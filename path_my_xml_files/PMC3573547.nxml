The medical treatment is unsatisfactory for both the patient and the neurosurgeons, as the surgical treatment has its own hazards and the cost of the surgical procedure and medical treatment is prohibitory to most of the Indian patients. Hence, most of the patients present themselves to the practitioners of Indian medicines like Ayurveda and yoga. This study was designed to evaluate the preliminary clinical effects of Bahya Snehan and Asanas in the patients of sciatica. This was a prospective randomized active control trial. A total of 60 participants showing classical symptoms of Sciatica between 18 and 65 years of age were randomly assigned to receive Ayurvedic or Yogic measure. One group received Snehan (external) with Bhujang and Shalabh Asana while another group received Bhujang and Salabh Asana only. Both groups practiced supervised intervention for 4 weeks. The signs and symptoms like Katishool (pain), tenderness, Stambha (rigidity), difficulty in walking, pain on bending forward were graded and interpreted at the end of the trail Significant improvement was observed in both groups before and after external Snehan with Bhujang and Shalabh Asana and in another group Bhujang and Salabh Asana only. Conclusions: Both groups, one with Snehan with asanas and the second with asanas only showed significant improvement in the patients of sciatica (Gridhrasi).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asanas</kwd><kwd>gridhrasi</kwd><kwd>janu</kwd><kwd>kati</kwd><kwd>pada</kwd><kwd>prushtha</kwd><kwd>sciatics</kwd><kwd>sphika</kwd><kwd>stambha</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gridhrasi is a clinical entity which produces intense pain and hampers day to day activities, affecting valuable hours. The clinical symptomatology of Gridhrasi is migrating pain from Sphika (hip), Kati (waist), Prushtha (back), Uru (groin), Janu (knee) and Jangha(thigh) to Pada (foot). Classical pain of Gridhrasi is accompanied by Stambha (rigidity), Ruk (pain), Tod (pricking pain) and patient feels recurrent throbs along the affected leg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This reveals that the disease is basically produced by vitiated Vata Dosha, which is an originator of every kind of movement in the body. Vata has been described as &#x0201c;Tantra Yantra Dhara&#x0201d; which means it keeps and maintains the human body machinery and parts in a state of good health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The diseases pertaining to extremities, bowels and vital parts of the body are affected by vitiated Vata. Vitiation of Vayu takes place due to either qualitative loss of Dhatus or obstruction in their passage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The emptied place in the body is filled with vitiated Vayu and various diseases originate depending on the affected site. Due to peculiarity of causes and site of vitiated Vayu peculiar disorders are produced.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The rapid industrialization in today's world is causing rapid urbanization and a high degree of environmental pollution, coupled with sedentary life style and stress has given rise to number of health problems. Improper postural compulsions like sitting on computers, increased requirement of travel and excessive physical works lead to many painful diseases. Altered habits of food consumption are also responsible for increasing incidence of these diseases along with altered Vihara (life style). This leads to vitiation of Vayu which produces different Vata Vyadhies as described by Acharya <italic>Charaka</italic>. As Vata is a moving force and it has Chala (moving) property, Vayu is moving all over the body through the different channels (strotas). These channels are occupied by or made up of Dhatus and Malas along with Tridosha. When there is any obstruction to these movements of Vayu, it gets vitiated. This is one of the two major causes of its vitiation. The other causes being the emptiness of these channels are due to reduction in the quantity and quality of their occupants. In short, if the Dhatus, Malas, Kapha and Pitta reduce in the quantity or quality that emptied space in the body is filled by Vayu, causing increase in Vayu and its vitiation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Gridhrasi is one the Nanatmaja Vata Vyadhi caused by vitiation of Vayu. The name Gridhrasi is derived from the word &#x0201c;Grudhra&#x0201d; that literally means a &#x0201c;Vulture&#x0201d;. The patient suffering from this disease walks like a vulture (Grudhra) due to severe, persistent and migrating pain, so the name of this disease or Vyadhi is &#x0201c;Gridhrasi&#x0201d;. If the patient's right leg is affected by Gridhrasi Vyadhi, patient bears all his weight on his left leg and vice versa. This typical gait looks like that of Grudhra's (Vulture's) walk hence this name.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>These symptoms are similar to the symptoms of &#x0201c;sciatica&#x0201d; described in modern medical science.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The Pratyatma Lakshana of Gridhrasi is migrating pain from Sphika (hip), Kati (waist), Prushtha (back), Uru (groin), Janu (knee) and Jangha(thigh) to Pada (foot). Classical pain of Gridhrasi is accompanied by Stambha (rigidity), Ruk (pain), Tod (pricking pain) and the patient feels recurrent throb along the affected leg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>AIMS</title><p>

Peer-reviewed medical researches have shown that the benefits of massage include pain relief, reduced trait anxiety and depression, and temporarily reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and state of anxiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Theories behind what massage might do include blocking nociception (gate control theory), activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which may stimulate the release of endorphins and serotonin, preventing fibrosis or scar tissue, increasing the flow of lymph, and improving sleep,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] but such effects are yet to be supported by well-designed clinical studies.</p><p>From various researches, it is clear that transcriptional co-activator PGC1-alpha is liberated from muscles in exercises such as yoga, and suppresses a broad array of inflammatory responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Yoga improves functional disability, pain intensity, and depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>External snehan (Abhyang) is beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic sciatic pain, stiffness and function. The effects of external snehan are improved if combined with exercise and education. Few improvements can be suggested. Factorial design can be used to assess the effectiveness of treatments alone or in combination. Because most outcomes in sciatica are subjective measures, the ideal control group is one that ensures that treatments are equally credible and acceptable to patients to minimize placebo effects and high dropout rates. There are numerous techniques of massage therapy and its effects are difficult to measure because of various confounding variables, including the size of the massage area, amount of pressure, different types of manoeuvres, duration and number of treatment sessions, experience of therapist, level of stress, and heterogeneity of participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-7"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hence, we may conclude that external Snehan and Asanas play a statistically significant role in improving signs and symptoms of sciatica.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shastri</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaturvedi</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name></person-group><source>Chikitsa Sthana Chapter 28, Charak Samhita, &#x0201c;Vidyotini&#x0201d; Hindi Commentary Part-II</source><year>1998</year><edition>Edition Reprint</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Bharti Acadami</publisher-name><fpage>787</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shukla</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><source>Kaya Chikitsa</source><year>1999</year><edition>3rd edition</edition><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhambha Surbharti Prakashan</publisher-name><fpage>25</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><comment>Part III</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>YG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vata vyadhi Chikitsa</article-title><source>Kayachikitsa</source><year>2001</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Pune</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Pune Sahitya Vitaran</publisher-name><fpage>331</fpage><lpage>2</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name></person-group><source>Kayachikitsa</source><year>2001</year><edition>1st Ed</edition><publisher-loc>Delhi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhmbha Sanskrit Pratisthan</publisher-name><fpage>507</fpage><lpage>20</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shastri</surname><given-names>Kaviraj Ambika Dutt</given-names></name></person-group><source>Chapter 1 Nidan Sthan.
