The study was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Bologna as well as by the local ethics committees when required (see acknowledgments for a list members of the SMILE-4 working party by country). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrolment. The SMILE-4 study (protocol MEN/03/ZOF-CHF/001) was registered with EudraCT Number 2004-001150-88 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu</ext-link>) and with the Italian Ministry of Health Code: GUIDOTT_III_2004_001 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it">https://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it</ext-link>).</p><p>The first patient was enrolled in March 2005, and the last patient completed in July 2009. Patients complying with the study eligibility criteria entered a four-day open-label phase, during which zofenopril was administered to all patients according to an up-titration scheme.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> On days 1 and 2, patients received zofenopril 7.5 mg twice daily plus an evening dose of ASA 100 mg. On days 3 and 4 the zofenopril dose was doubled (15 mg twice daily), whereas the dose of ASA was kept unchanged. On day 5 patients were randomized 1:1 double-blind (using a centralized, computer-generated randomization list) to receive zofenopril 30 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily or ramipril 5 mg twice daily and ASA 100 mg once daily for 12 months. The study medications were given in combination with standard recommended treatments for AMI. Patients were seen at enrolment, at randomization and at one, six and 12 months thereafter. A physical examination, a 12-lead electrocardiogram and laboratory tests (haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) were performed at entry, at randomization and at the study end. Laboratory tests included red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, serum creatinine, blood glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, serum transaminases and urinalysis. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Blood pressure and heart rate were measured, an echocardiogram was performed, blood samples were drawn (centralized estimation of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and occurrence of concomitant diseases, adverse events, use of concomitant medications and compliance to study drugs were checked at each study visit.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1470320316656480"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In this post-hoc analysis of the SMILE-4 study we evaluated the probability of receiving different treatments (based on the measured characteristics) with the propensity score.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The propensity score is usually estimated by applying a logistic regression analysis, where the outcome is the treatment variable and predictor variables are the covariates.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Accordingly, we estimated propensity scores with the observed covariates as predictors, and treatment assignment (dummy coded 0=ramipril, 1=zofenopril) as dependent variable. The selected model included 13 possible patient variables (predictors), as recorded at entry: age (&#x0003e;65 vs &#x02a7d;65 years), gender, heart rate (&#x0003e;70 vs &#x02a7d;70 bpm), diagnosis of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolaemia, low HDL, type of infarction (STEMI vs NSTEMI), revascularization, Killip class (&#x02a7e;2 vs 1), NT-proBNP (&#x02a7e;330 vs &#x0003c;330 pg/ml), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&#x02a7d;40 vs &#x0003e;40%), GFR (&#x0003c;60 vs &#x02a7e;60 ml/min). Such variables were selected because they were considered representative of the individual&#x02019;s risk level and were available as complete data for all patients. After fitting the model according to a stepwise approach, the patients in the two treatment groups were stratified according to the aforementioned predictors and ranked in five equal-sized strata or quintiles (Qs). The QI represented patients with the best and the QV included those with the worst risk profile; thus, patients inside each Q had a similar overall risk. The choice of five strata was based on the Cochran method,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which showed that, in general, five strata are able to remove approximately 90% of the bias due to a single continuous covariate.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> To validate the propensity score model we tested each of the covariates (predictors) in a two-way (two conditions&#x000d7;five strata) analysis of variance, examining the magnitude and significance of the <italic>F</italic> ratio for the treatment group main effect and the interaction <italic>F</italic> ratio. If both <italic>F</italic> ratios were small, balance on the covariate was probably reasonable. However, if either <italic>F</italic> ratio was large, the model was revised including any covariates with large <italic>F</italic> ratios that had previously been excluded during the stepwise procedure, and if balance was still questionable, nonlinear and interaction terms were added. We used logistic regression in a similar two-step procedure for assessing the balance of dichotomous categorical variables. To estimate the effects of treatment with a propensity score adjustment, zofenopril and ramipril group means were analysed as the unweighted average of the cell means over the five strata for each group. The appropriateness of the propensity score model was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test (<italic>p</italic>=0.459).</p><p>The primary study end-point was defined as in the original study as the one-year combined occurrence of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Secondary study end-points, including hospitalization and death for cardiovascular causes, were assessed as well. Efficacy evaluation was carried out in the intention-to-treat population, defined as patients treated with at least one dose of study medication and documenting at least once the measure of the primary efficacy assessment, even in a case of protocol violation or premature withdrawal from the study.</p><p>The difference between treatment groups with respect to the primary combined end-point and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate, was assessed within each Q of the propensity score, by calculating the estimated odds ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. The Chi-square analysis was applied to data with the Mantel-Haenszel extension for the comparison between the two treatment groups. A logistic regression model was also applied to assess differences between treatments, by accounting for treatment and propensity score group. Survival curves were drawn using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the survival analysis was performed according to survival Cox regression analysis.</p><p>All <italic>p</italic> values are two-tailed and the minimum level of statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section9-1470320316656480"><title>Results</title><sec id="section10-1470320316656480"><title>Study population</title><p>The 716 patients of the original SMILE-4 study intention-to-treat population were included in this analysis.

The preliminary step of the propensity approach applied to the SMILE-4 study was to verify the homogeneity between the two patient groups: after the matching process, the treatment groups were well balanced and, consequently, comparable on propensity scores. The use of the propensity score as a stratification method yielded new information on how demographic and clinical variables may have influenced the outcome of treatment. Although the rate of major cardiovascular events was constant across the various propensity score groups (Qs), we observed some heterogeneity in the treatment effects: indeed, zofenopril was associated with a greater reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary study endpoint) and hospitalizations alone (secondary endpoints) in QII, QIII and QIV, with a statically significant difference in favour of this drug in the third Q. Mortality rates were similarly affected by both study treatments, irrespective of the propensity group, confirming the finding of the main study. Thus, the propensity score analysis helped in substantiating the main study results, because it allowed us to correct for some potential confounding factors, mainly related to the study population. We can speculate on the origin of the observed superiority of zofenopril over ramipril in individuals at an intermediate risk, but not in the other Qs. Likely, patients in the low, and those in the high, risk category may equally benefit from both ACE-inhibitors, with no specific advantages of one treatment over the other. Particularly in high risk patients, the class effect could be more important than the specific properties of the pharmacological compounds (in this case zofenopril and ramipril). We also acknowledge that, given the small number of subjects in each Q, the possibility that the between-group difference might be a result of chance cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The propensity score analysis represents an alternative to standard adjustment methods (linear or logistic regression) and is a useful tool to provide estimates of the treatment effects and create a direct covariate balance between compared groups, thus removing bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1470320316656480" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The propensity analysis is a suitable technique especially for clinical settings where other pretreatment observed covariates (e.g. disease risk factors, concomitant treatments, demographic variables) are present, and it is necessary to reach an unbiased effect assessment of the randomly compared treatments.

First, though the propensity score of the SMILE-4 study provided an adjustment for measured differences between treatment groups, this analysis, by its nature, did not include unmeasured differences. Despite the methodological rigour due to the design of the SMILE-4 trial and the stratification of patients based on the propensity score approach, possible unknown risk factors could have contributed to the generation of cardiovascular outcomes. Second, the propensity score retrospective analysis was not included in the original SMILE-4 study protocol; therefore, potentially significant information could have not been collected at the enrolment phase and/or during the study progress. Third, the relatively limited length of the patient&#x02019;s follow-up may have reduced the chance of recording some events and, in particular, may explain the low mortality rate; due to this fact, the propensity analysis was not helpful for better exploring the impact of treatments and their possible diversity on cardiovascular deaths.</p><p>Fourth, usually the propensity analysis is appropriately applied to observational studies in order to minimize the limitations due to the non-randomized nature of the studies. In the case of our double-blind randomized study this approach might appear to be less useful. However, we think that it helped provide a confirmatory analysis of the main study results</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-1470320316656480"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The propensity score analysis of the SMILE-4 study confirmed the good efficacy of zofenopril in the prevention of one-year cardiovascular outcomes. The propensity model was useful to confirm results of the main study by correcting for selection bias and possible unbalance between treatment groups, and to support the view that zofenopril is beneficial regardless of an individual patient&#x02019;s cardiovascular risk level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All named authors meet the criteria for authorship for this manuscript and gave final approval to the version to be published.</p><p>Members of the SMILE-4 Working Party: Coordinators: E Ambrosioni (Bologna), C Borghi (Bologna); Study centres: Greece: D Alexopolulus, I Nanas; Italy: M Agrusta, A Barsotti, S Bergerone, L Caliendo, P Caso, A Castello, D Cianflone, T Cipolla, G De Ferrari, G De Nittis, L Dei Cas, P Di Pasquale, R Evola, L Fattore, R Ferrante, A Fiscella, A Gaspardone, G Ielasi, N Marchionni, G Marenzi, F Marte, F Miccoli, P Noussan, S Novo, M Orlandi, G Piovaccari, M Porcu, P Presbitero, A Raviele, E Renaldini, UJ Salerno, G Storti, C Tamburino, P Terrosu, R Testa, R Trinchero, B Tuccillo, L Vasquez, GQ Villani; Portugal: MG Alv&#x000e9;s, A Andrade, S Cardoso, JI Moreira; Romania: GC Arsenescu, M Cinteza, M Dorobantu, D Ionescu, I Manitiu, F Ortan, C Pop, M Radoi, D Vinereanu; Russia: VY Alexandrovich, KV Avenirovitch, KY Borisovich, TV Iosifovna, SA Lvovich, GB Mikhailovich, NE Mikhaylovich, TS Nikolaevich, BN Nikolaevna, ZK Nikolayevich, AG Pavlovich, MV Sergeevich, RL Victorovich, VA Yurievich; Spain: D De La Yera, F Romero; Turkey: C Kirma, K Meral, A O&#x0011f;uzhan, KD Ural; Ukraine: KO Ankindinovna, PA Nikolaevich, VI Petrovich, VM Tihonovich, BV Vladimirovich; Independent End-point and Safety Committee: G Ambrosio (Perugia), A Mugelli (Firenze), F Mascagni (Firenze); Statistician: G Boissard (Milano), G Reggiardo (Milano).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Claudio Borghi: consultancy for Boheringer Ingelheim, Menarini International, Sanofi, Amgen, Takeda, Novartis, Ely Lilly and Servier.
