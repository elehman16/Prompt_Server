Key inclusion criteria were: adults aged 18&#x02013;55&#x02009;years with RRMS, at least one relapse in the previous year (or at least two in the previous 2&#x02009;years) and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0&#x02013;5.5.

MRI scans were performed at screening and at months 6, 12 and 24; new lesion activity on any scan during the 2-year period was considered evidence of MRI disease activity. Annual BVL thresholds evaluated for inclusion in the NEDA-4 assessment were based on annual percentage brain volume change (PBVC) between baseline and the month-24 scan. The AR-BVL used in subsequent assessments is defined as ((PBVC/100+1)^(365.25/days)&#x02013;1)*100, where &#x02018;PBVC&#x02019; is measured using Structural Image Evaluation using Normalization of Atrophy (SIENA) methodology with 2D non-enhanced T1 weighted MRI scans and &#x02018;days&#x02019; represents the number of days between the two scans. This formula adjusts for the exact duration between two scans and converts PBVC derived from SIENA (in this case obtained over 2&#x02009;years) into a mean AR-BVL (see Online Supplement, eMethods). The following annual BVL thresholds were included in the analysis: 0.2% (which is approximately the mean annual BVL rate in healthy controls of similar age to those with MS, using the SIENA method); 0.4% (which is above the mean rate in healthy controls, but below the range of mean rates reported for patients with MS (0.5%&#x02013;1.35%); and 0.6% and 1.2% (values that are within the range of reported rates of BVL seen among untreated patients with MS).<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section10-1352458515616701"><title>Definitions of NEDA</title><list list-type="simple" id="list1-1352458515616701"><list-item><p>NEDA: refers to the general concept of no evidence of disease activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>NEDA-3: refers to no evidence of relapses, active MRI lesions (both new or enlarged T2 lesions and Gd+ lesions) and 3-month CDP (defined as an increase in EDSS score of 1.5 points from a baseline score of 0, of 1.0 point from a baseline score of 1.0 or more or of 0.5 points from a baseline score of greater than 5.0).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Variations of NEDA-3 definitions were used to assess the contribution of individual components and are defined in the text and figures/tables.</p></list-item><list-item><p>NEDA-4: based on results of the interrogation of NEDA-3 components and the outcome of the hierarchical analysis of NEDA-3 (see next section), NEDA-4 was defined as no evidence of relapses, new or enlarged T2 lesions and 6-month CDP (as defined in NEDA-3, above), and a mean AR-BVL of less than 0.4% (NB: other AR-BVL thresholds were tested in NEDA-4).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section11-1352458515616701"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Hierarchical analysis of patient subsets according to individual disease activity criteria was used to assess the contribution of the three different components within the NEDA measure using the following hierarchy: new or enlarged T2 lesions, Gd+ lesion activity, relapses; disability progression (6-month confirmation). In the analysis, patients who had an event for one outcome were removed/not evaluable from that point onwards for any other outcomes, for example, if a patient had a new or enlarged T2 lesion, the patient was removed from subsequent evaluations for Gd+ lesion activity. When patients had both new T2 and new Gd+ lesion activities simultaneously, they were counted as having T2 lesion activity because patients can be counted in one area only. Logistic regression analysis was used to detect a treatment effect of fingolimod on evidence of disease activity when varying the MRI and disability components of NEDA, when determining the proportion of patients with an AR-BVL less than the annual BVL threshold investigated and when determining the proportion of patients achieving NEDA-4. Odds ratios (ORs) were derived from the associated logistic regression analysis.

We favour the 0.4% annual BVL threshold because it is above the mean annual rate of BVL reported for healthy individuals (0.1%&#x02013;0.3%), and is below the range of mean rates usually reported in untreated patients with MS when measured using the SIENA method.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This threshold is also consistent with a recent longitudinal analysis of MRI data processed using SIENA, which found that an annual BVL rate of 0.4% provides 80% specificity in discriminating patients with MS from healthy controls and also had a prognostic value for discriminating patients who would develop disability progression in a follow-up of up to 12 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> We further investigated if the rate of BVL remained stable over the study period and found that the majority of patients with an AR-BVL of at least 0.4% at 6&#x02009;months also had an AR-BVL of at least 0.4% at both 12 and 24&#x02009;months. Approximately one-quarter of patients did fluctuate between annual rates of BVL above and below the 0.4% threshold at individual MRI assessments within the 2-year study period, suggesting some limitations of using a single study-end measure of PBVC when calculating the AR-BVL.</p><p>Measurement of BVL has been widely adopted as an outcome in clinical trials, but has not yet entered clinical practice in the field of MS, thus limiting the utility of NEDA-4 as a routine assessment of disease activity or worsening in individual patients with MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For the assessment of individual patients, methodological issues including optimal reproducibility of image acquisition and uniform application of image analysis tools would need to be resolved, and more data on the development of BVL over time in different groups of normal individuals will need to be sampled.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A potential confounding factor in determining the rate of BVL could be pseudoatrophy as a result of the early anti-inflammatory effect of an intervention, which was proposed as an explanation of lacking or even adverse effects of some clinically effective DMTs in the first 6&#x02009;months of treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This was not observed with fingolimod in the overall clinical trial populations; however, post hoc analysis provided some evidence of the phenomenon in patients with one or more Gd+ lesions at baseline. In these patients, the rate of BVL at 6&#x02009;months was still lower than in those treated with placebo but the effect was less pronounced than in patients without Gd+ lesions at baseline.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> A real-world longitudinal analysis of 219 patients with MS (not stratified by treatment, but most received IFN or glatiramer acetate) revealed that 46% of patients achieved NEDA-3 at 1&#x02009;year, 27.5% achieved it at 2&#x02009;years, but only 8% achieved it at 7&#x02009;years.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1352458515616701" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This illustrates that the conventional definition of NEDA-3 is already difficult to meet over long observation periods, at least with interferons beta or glatiramer acetate. Proportionately fewer patients had NEDA as defined by NEDA-4 (with the 0.4% annual BVL threshold) than by NEDA-3. In the pooled FREEDOMS population studied here, only 5% of patients on placebo achieved NEDA-4 compared with almost 20% of patients receiving fingolimod 0.5&#x02009;mg. In addition to supporting the treatment benefit of fingolimod, this result also highlights that NEDA-4 represents a very stringent assessment of efficacy, the aspiration of which is complete disease remission based on a more comprehensive consideration of the underlying pathology.</p><p>Determining whether patients who achieve NEDA-4 are at lower risk of future disability than those with disease activity or achieving NEDA-3 will require validation in long-term studies. Acknowledging the importance of BVL in MS disease progression, and monitoring it both in the clinic and through clinical research using measures such as NEDA-4, should improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes. The results of the present analysis should encourage further validation of NEDA-4 in MS clinical studies and across different treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="MSJ616701_supplementary_materials.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1021" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial assistance was provided by Jeremy Bright from Oxford PharmaGenesis and was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.
