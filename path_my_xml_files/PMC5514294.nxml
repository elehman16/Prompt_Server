The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to evaluate the long-term effects of lurasidone and quetiapine XR on daytime sleepiness and neurocognitive performance during a 6-month, double-blind continuation study, in subjects who completed an initial 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing these agents. Daytime sleepiness, cognitive performance, and health-related quality of life were assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), CogState computerized battery, and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB-SA) Scale, respectively. Treatment with flexible-dose lurasidone 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d, administered once daily in the evening, was associated with significantly reduced daytime sleepiness compared with flexibly dosed quetiapine XR 200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03, <italic>effect size</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.36) at week 32 (month 6 of the continuation study endpoint). Incidence of markedly high sleepiness (ESS &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10) was significantly higher in the quetiapine XR (200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d) group compared with the lurasidone (40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/day) group at both months 3 and 6 visits (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Lurasidone (40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d) significantly improved neurocognitive performance compared to quetiapine XR (200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d) before (<italic>effect size</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.49) and after adjustment (<italic>effect size</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.45) for sleepiness effect (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.008 and 0.010, respectively). Increased daytime sleepiness was significantly associated with reduced neurocognitive performance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019) and quality of well-being (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). Our findings suggest that clinicians should actively monitor patients for the presence of daytime sleepiness due in part to its potential impact on neurocognitive performance and well-being.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Daytime sleepiness</kwd><kwd>Cognitive performance</kwd><kwd>Lurasidone</kwd><kwd>Quetiapine XR</kwd><kwd>Long-term double-blind study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Daytime sleepiness adversely impacts neurocognitive performance, which is often significantly impaired in patients with schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Leifker, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Hawley et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Argyropoulos, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2013a</xref>). Daytime sleepiness is a commonly reported adverse effect of pharmacologic agents with significant antihistaminergic and/or antiserotonergic effects, such as certain antipsychotic agents. The propensity to doze while performing daily activities such as driving or working can have serious consequences, including increased motor vehicle and work-related accidents, as well as compromised job performance (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">National Sleep Foundation, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2009</xref>). It has been estimated that driving while drowsy contributes to 100,000 police-reported crashes that resulted in 71,000 injuries and 1550 deaths each year in the United States (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">National Sleep Foundation, 2007</xref>). Daytime sleepiness, if persistent, can adversely impact patients' social and daily functioning, quality of life and can compromise treatment adherence (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">McWhirter et al., 2007</xref>). Despite awareness of the health and economic burden posed by daytime sleepiness, the long-term effects of antipsychotic treatments on daytime sleepiness and their clinical consequences have not been adequately studied (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">McWhirter et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Lurasidone is a novel benzisothiazol derivative with potent binding affinity for the D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5HT<sub>7</sub> receptors (antagonist), and moderate affinity for 5HT<sub>1A</sub> (partial agonist) and &#x003b1;<sub>2C</sub> receptors (antagonist) (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Ishibashi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Horiguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Lurasidone has no appreciable affinity for H<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Ishibashi et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, quetiapine is associated with a high affinity at the H<sub>1</sub> receptor where it acts as an antagonist (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin and Scott, 2009</xref>); this mechanism is associated with sedation in both animal models and human studies (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Witek et al., 1995</xref>). The short-term effects of lurasidone on neurocognitive performance were demonstrated in a 3-week double-blind, active-controlled study of lurasidone and ziprasidone (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2011</xref>), as well as a 6-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study of lurasidone and quetiapine XR (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). In a 6-month, double-blind, flexible-dose, continuation study, lurasidone (40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d) was superior to quetiapine XR (200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d) for cognitive performance at both months 3 and 6 of the extension study (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2015</xref>).

The design of these studies will therefore only be briefly summarized here. The study was approved by an institutional review board at each investigational site and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practices guidelines, and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed an informed consent document explaining study procedures and potential risks before study entry.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, who had recently been hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, were randomly assigned to receive 6&#x000a0;weeks of double-blind treatment with once-daily fixed doses of lurasidone (80&#x000a0;mg or 160&#x000a0;mg), quetiapine XR (600&#x000a0;mg), or placebo. Upon completion of the initial 6-week study, eligible patients were enrolled in the 1-year, double-blind, flexible-dose, continuation study, where patients continued treatment with either lurasidone 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d (lurasidone-to-lurasidone) or quetiapine XR 200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d (quetiapine XR-to-quetiapine XR). Cognitive and functional capacity assessments were obtained at baseline and up to 6&#x000a0;months in the continuation study.</p><p>Patients who had been treated with placebo in the initial 6-week study were switched in a blinded fashion to flexible-dose lurasidone treatment in the continuation study (placebo-to-lurasidone), but the present analyses focused primarily on those patients receiving lurasidone during both the acute and continuation study phases (lurasidone-to-lurasidone). Entry into the continuation study required patients to have completed all assessments on the final week 6 visit of the acute phase and to have been judged by the investigator as suitable for continuation study treatment in an outpatient setting.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Assessments</title><p>Daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a validated self-reported measure of daytime sleepiness at baseline, 6&#x000a0;weeks, and 3 and 6&#x000a0;months in the continuation treatment phase (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Johns, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Johns, 2008</xref>). The total ESS score is the sum of all 8 items (each refers to level of anticipated sleepiness in various routine life situations) and ranges from 0 to 24. Each individual item ranges from 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02018;would never doze or sleep&#x02019; to 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02018;high chance of dozing or sleeping&#x02019;. Higher ESS scores are associated with a greater severity of daytime sleepiness. If one or more items were missing at a visit, the total score was set to missing. The ESS has been validated in both case-controlled studies of normal patients and in a number of populations with various sleep disorders (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Johns, 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Johns, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chervin, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Cognition was assessed by the CogState composite score (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Pietrzak et al., 2009</xref>) at baseline, week 6 (end of acute treatment phase), week 19 (month 3 of the continuation study), and week 32 (month 6 of the continuation study). The composite measure of overall cognitive performance was calculated as an average of the 7 standardized domain scores over the tasks of: Detection Task, Identification Task, One Back Task, International Shopping List Task, One Card Learning Task, Groton Maze Learning Task, and the Social Emotional Cognition Task. These standardized domain scores were computed using the age stratified CogState normative mean and standard deviation according to the following equation: (raw domain score &#x02013; norm mean)/norm SD. The sign of the standardized domain score was adjusted so that negative scores indicated performance worse than average, and positive scores indicated performance better than average. If three or more components were missing at a visit, the CogState composite score was set to missing. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Quality of Well-Being (QWB-SA) Scale (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary treatment group comparison was between patients continuing on flexibly dosed lurasidone 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d (lurasidone-to-lurasidone) or quetiapine XR 200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d (quetiapine XR-to-quetiapine XR) at week 19 and week 32 (month 3 and 6 of the continuation study period). The change in neurocognitive composite score from pretreatment baseline (week 0) to week 19 and week 32 (primary endpoint) was analyzed using a mixed-effects longitudinal data analysis model (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fitzmaurice et al., 2004</xref>), with fixed effects for treatment, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit interaction, and study sites. In addition, we evaluated the change from the pretreatment baseline in the neurocognitive composite score after controlling for change in ESS total score from baseline (week 0) over time. Cohen&#x02019;s d between-group effect size was calculated as least squares mean difference between LUR-to-LUR and QXR-to-QXR divided by the model estimate of the pooled SD (across treatment groups), adjusting for site effects and baseline at randomization. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was applied to evaluate the incidence of markedly high sleepiness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>A total of 292 patients completed the 6-week acute phase and were enrolled in the double-blind continuation study (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> depicts the disposition of patients.

Incidence of markedly high sleepiness was higher at both weeks 19 (month 3 of the continuation study) and 32 (month 6 of the continuation study) in the quetiapine XR-to-quetiapine XR group compared with the lurasidone-to-lurasidone group. These results are consistent with findings reported from the acute phase, placebo-controlled study, where patients with schizophrenia were randomized to lurasidone and quetiapine XR (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2013a</xref>), and we extend these results by demonstrating that the excess daytime sleepiness associated with quetiapine XR (vs. lurasidone) persisted in the subsequent long-term continuation study.</p><p>The findings that quetiapine XR was associated with greater incidence of markedly high sleepiness and reduced neurocognitive performance at week 32 (end of 6&#x000a0;month continuation study) compared with lurasidone suggest that tolerance and adaptation to this drug-induced adverse effect did not occur over time. Significantly greater improvement from baseline to week 32 (month 6 of the continuation study) in favor of lurasidone compared with quetiapine XR was observed in neurocognitive performance before and after adjustment for daytime sleepiness effects.</p><p>We note that while the current study evaluated quetiapine XR, similar comparative findings versus lurasidone would be expected for quetiapine IR, which has been shown to be associated with higher sedation intensity and less patient satisfaction compared to the XR formulation (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Datto et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Riesenberg et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Riedel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Across all treatment groups, we found that increased daytime sleepiness was significantly related to reduced neurocognitive performance and quality of well-being, assessed over the acute phase study and longer-term extension. Given that cognitive impairment is both pervasive and relatively severe in patients with schizophrenia (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>; Leifker et al., 2009), our findings suggest that patients may be vulnerable to even modest levels of drug-induced sedation, due to its negative impact on cognition and well-being, and that this should be avoided when possible.</p><p>Drug-induced sedation, including by antipsychotic agents, is among the most common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>). However, this common clinical problem has not been well-studied, so that the magnitude of antipsychotic-induced daytime sleepiness and its impact on cognition and functioning are poorly understood. Our study contributes to further understanding of the comparative impact and longitudinal course of daytime sleepiness associated with antipsychotic agents.</p><p>The findings reported here that increased daytime sleepiness was significantly associated with worsening in neurocognitive performance and quality of well-being are consistent with previous reports that show excessive daytime sleepiness may adversely affect personal well-being, functional and cognitive performance, including concentration and alertness (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">McWhirter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Sharif, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Argyropoulos, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Riedel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the significant health and economic burden associated with daytime sleepiness for both individuals and society, its evaluation is challenging due to the lack of consensus on systematic methods of assessment. This study confirms that the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a validated, patient-reported assessment of daytime sleepiness, is sensitive to drug-related changes in daytime sleepiness in patients with schizophrenia. Our finding supports the use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale as a practical monitoring tool to assess level of daytime sleepiness in patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>Several limitations of these findings should be noted. First, the primary analysis was focused on longitudinal changes from baseline to individual follow-up visits in patients who had completed an initial 6-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing fixed doses of lurasidone or quetiapine XR. Therefore, no long-term data were available for those patients who did not participate in the continuation study. However, demographics and baseline patient characteristics (age, gender, PANSS scores, neurocognitive composite score, and ESS scores) were comparable between the treatment groups in the continuation study (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and between the 292 patients entering the 6-month continuation study versus the original randomized ITT population (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). These data suggest that the extension study population was representative of the randomized ITT population. Second, potential biases due to practice effects and regression to the mean may confound the results. These potential confounds were addressed through the use of active controls in the double-blind, acute and continuation study phases over an extended treatment period (up to 32&#x000a0;weeks) (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Allison et al., 2009</xref>), permitting valid comparisons of outcomes in the continuation study. Pseudospecificity issues were also addressed by adjustment for clinical symptoms (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>) or daytime sleepiness effects with consistent results in all findings.</p><p>In summary, treatment with flexible-dose lurasidone 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;mg/d, administered once daily in the evening, was associated with significantly less daytime sleepiness and significantly improved neurocognitive performance compared with flexibly dosed quetiapine XR 200&#x02013;800&#x000a0;mg/d in a long-term continuation study that followed a 6-week acute trial in patients with schizophrenia. Across all treatment groups, increased daytime sleepiness was significantly associated with reduced neurocognitive performance and quality of well-being over the acute and continuation study periods. Clinicians should therefore actively monitor patients for the presence of daytime sleepiness due in part to its potential for adverse impact on neurocognitive performance and well-being.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><title>Role of Funding Source</title><p>This study was sponsored by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
