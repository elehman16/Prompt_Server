However, there have been no controlled studies comparing patient-reported outcomes between them. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that patient-reported outcomes are better in patients who have undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) with PA than in those who have undergone THA with LA, 12 months postoperatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>80 patients with hip osteoarthritis (mean age 61 years) were randomized to THA using PA or the modified direct LA. We recorded outcome measures preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score&#x02013;Physical Function Short Form (HOOS-PS) as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were HOOS-Pain, HOOS-Quality-Of-Life, EQ-5D, UCLA Activity Score, and limping.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found no statistically significant difference in the improvements in HOOS-PS between the treatment groups at 12-month follow-up. All secondary outcomes showed similar results except for limping, where PA patients improved significantly more than LA patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, patients treated with PA did not improve more than patients treated with LA regarding physical function, pain, physical activity, and quality of life 12 months postoperatively. However, limping was more pronounced in the LA patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The choice of surgical approach in total hip arthroplasty (THA) is debated as one factor that may influence the patient-reported outcome (PRO) (Jolles and Bogoch <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, Hendrickx et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Repantis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and the risk of revision, especially revision due to dislocation (Bystrom et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Arthursson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, Hailer et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Lindgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Worldwide, the posterior approach (PA) and the lateral approach (LA) are 2 of the most commonly used approaches. The 2 approaches differ in several ways. The abductor muscles are partly detached during the LA procedure but are not disturbed during the PA. The detachment of the abductor muscles during LA may influence the postoperative outcomes, especially physical function. Registry-based studies have revealed small differences in PROs between the 2 approaches, favoring the PA (Amlie et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Jameson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Lindgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, this difference has not been investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A systematic review concluded that there is a need for patient-reported evidence to support a particular surgical approach (Jolles and Bogoch <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>We conducted a prospective RCT in patients operated with the PA or the LA. The primary aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of the 2 surgical approaches regarding patient-reported physical function, and the secondary aims were to evaluate their efficacy regarding patient-reported pain, physical activity, limping, and quality of life. We hypothesised that patient-reported outcomes within the first year would improve more in patients who are operated with PA rather than LA.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="s0002"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Design</title><p>The trial was a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial with balanced randomization (1:1) following the CONSORT guidelines.

All of them received the same types of cementless components (Bi-metric stem and Exceed ABT Ringloc-x shell and metal head, size 32&#x02009;mm or 36&#x02009;mm). 2 teams of 3 experienced surgeons performed all the operations.

The hip capsule was excised on the anterior side of the joint, from the basis of the collum femoris to the acetabular rim. The hip was dislocated by external rotation, adduction and flexion. During closure of the wound, the detached parts of the gluteus medius and minimus were re-inserted using a heavy absorbable suture (coated VICRYL, size 2) to re-approximate the divided gluteus minimus and the anterior flap of gluteus medius. No capsular repair was performed. A detailed description of the approach can be found in the work by Mulliken et&#x000a0;al.

The HOOS-PS score ranges from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 points (no symptoms). The HOOS-PS has shown good validity when compared with the HOOS-ADL, and high responsiveness in THA patients (Davis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0012"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>We used subscales of the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS 2.0)&#x02014;Pain (HOOS-Pain) and Quality Of Life (HOOS-QOL)&#x02014;which range from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 points (no symptoms) (Thorborg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, Roos <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The patients completed the validated, transcultural, translated Danish versions of the HOOS-PS, HOOS-Pain, and HOOS-QOL (Nilsdotter et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Beyer et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, Thorborg et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0013"><title>EQ-5D-3L</title><p>The Danish version of the EuroQol-5-Dimension-3-Likert-scale Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) (Brooks <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>, Gudex and S&#x000f8;rensen <xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) was used to assess health-related quality of life.

The overall health status (EQ-5D-VAS) is scored on a "thermometer-like" 100-point visual analog scale from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable) (van Reenen and Oppe <xref rid="C40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) .</p></sec><sec id="s0014"><title>UCLA Activity Score</title><p>A Danish version of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Activity Score was used to measure the patient-reported activity level. It uses an ordinal 10-point (1&#x02013;10) Likert scale ranging from "wholly inactive: dependent on others" to "regularly participate in impact sports or heavy labour", with a higher score being better (Terwee et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Limping</title><p>We used the question about limping from the function domain of the Harris hip score (HHS). Limping is scored on an ordinal 4-point (1&#x02013;4) Likert scale (no limping; slight, moderate, or severe limping), with a lower score being better. This means that a single-point change will make the patient change category e.g. from no limping to slight limping. The question was used to evaluate the patient&#x02019;s own perception of his/her gait function (Mahomed et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0016"><title>Adverse events</title><p>We performed a medical audit 12 months postoperatively.

We considered the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) to be 10 points between treatment groups at the 12-month follow-up (Ehrich et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Roos and Lohmander <xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Terwee et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Roos <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and used a standard deviation of 16.7 preoperatively and 16.1 postoperatively (Davis et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). To achieve a statistical power of &#x000df; = 0.80 and &#x003b1; = 0.05, 29 patients were needed in each treatment group. To account for possible dropouts, 40 patients were included in each treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s0019"><title>Randomization</title><p>Balanced 1:1 block randomization was performed using a computer-generated list, with 4 blocks of 20 patients in each. The sequence was generated by a third person who was not involved in the trial (JL). The sequence was written on paper and placed in sealed opaque consecutively numbered envelopes by a secretary not involved in the trial. The envelopes were opened in the order given, and the patient was allocated to a treatment group and scheduled for surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Blinding</title><p>The patients were blinded to treatment and informed, prior to participation, that the type of intervention would not be revealed to them. The reason for blinding was explained to them. Due to the nature of the intervention, the surgeons, ward doctors, nurses and physiotherapists were not blinded. However, they were all well aware of the importance of not discussing the intervention with the patients. Since all the patients were treated with the same rehabilitation protocol, there was no need to discuss the specific intervention. The principal investigator was kept blind throughout the trial and the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s0021"><title>Ethics, registration, funding and conflict of interest</title><p>The trial was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Danish Regional Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics (Southern Denmark) (project-ID: S-20120009).

This model included the interaction between treatment and elapsed time, adjusted for preoperative values and assuming that data were missing completely at random (MCAR) (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal <xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Where data were missing preoperatively, the mean or median preoperative value from all the other patients was imputed (used on 3 patients: 2 UCLA Activity Scores and 1 EQ-5D-VAS). Given the small amount of data imputation, it did not change the results. Otherwise, no data imputation was performed. We used the absolute score on the outcome variable as the dependent variable with patient as the random effect factor, and based the model on the restricted maximum likelihood estimate. The independent variables were the preoperative values, treatment group, time as a categorical variable, and the interaction between treatment group and time. Model assumptions were checked with residual plots for each dependent variable and were found to be acceptable.</p><p>The UCLA Activity Score and Limping Score were a priori considered as ordinal data and treated accordingly. However, because of the limited sample size and the many categories in each outcome, we modelled the UCLA Activity Score and Limping Score as numerical scales and used mixed linear model analysis as described above.</p><p>We performed the primary analyses using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis followed by a per-protocol analysis. Effect size (using Cohen&#x02019;s d) was calculated for continuous dependent variables.

The same applied to the secondary outcomes except for limping, where patients in the PA group improved more than the patients in the LA group.</p><p>There was, however, a systematic tendency towards higher numeric improvements in the PA group, ranging from 2.6 to 4.9 points on HOOS-Pain, HOOS-PS and HOOS-QOL, than in the LA group. These findings are in agreement with a cohort study of 852 THA patients operated with LA or PA, with 1&#x02013;3 years of follow-up. That study showed a statistically significant difference of 4.0 points on the HOOS-ADL subscale in favor of the PA group (Amlie et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Also, a randomized study with 3-month follow-up showed this tendency in both surgeon-reported and patient-reported outcomes (Witzleb et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), although the differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>We found a between-group difference in general health status (EQ-5D-3L) of &#x02212;0.04 (95% CI: &#x02212;0.1 to 0.03). This corresponds to findings from a registry-based study of 42,233 THA patients with 6 years of follow-up. That study showed a statistically significantly better EQ-5D outcome (by 0.03) in favor of the PA group (Lindgren et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). However, the differences in both HOOS and EQ-5D between the 2 approaches were small, and it can be questioned whether the differences are above the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (Ehrich et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Roos and Lohmander <xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Terwee et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Larsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, Roos <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Coretti et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The effect size (Cohens&#x02019; d) also supports this notion, as the effect size for all outcomes was small to negligible.</p><p>We based the sample size calculation on the HOOS-PS subscale with 10 points as the MCID between groups. This decision was based on published evidence and related RCT studies using the HOOS questionnaire as the primary outcome measure (Ehrich et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Roos and Lohmander <xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, Terwee et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, Roos <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Skou et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Villadsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility of type-II error in our study, if the MCID is less than 10 points as we used. A post-hoc sample size calculation showed that to detect a statistically significant between-group difference in HOOS- Physical Function of 3.3 points, using the standard deviations from our trial, 183 patients would be required in each treatment group. However, we consider that the statistically non-significant between-group difference of &#x0223c;3 HOOS points in all the HOOS subscales included, in favor of PA, was not clinically relevant&#x02014;based upon current evidence (Frobell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, Roos <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, Villadsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C41" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, Kise et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, Kise et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This does not imply that there could be no other clinically significant differences than those investigated in our study.</p><p>We found that patients in the PA group reported having less limping than patients in the LA group, which may be explained by the disturbance of the abductor muscles (Masonis and Bourne <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, Edmunds and Boscainos <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Amlie et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The difference was, however, less than 1 point. A single-point change is what differentiates 2 categories, e.g. the difference between no limping and slight limping on the 4-point Likert scale. The difference was not statistically significant in the per-protocol analysis. Our results are in line with those from a cohort study that found twice as many patients in the LA group with self-reported limping at 1&#x02013;3 years postoperatively (Amlie et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). That study also found that the difference in mean score between patients with and without self-reported limping ranged from 17 to 35 on the 5 HOOS subscales, in favor of the non-limping patients. In contrast to our results, a Cochrane review based on 4 non-randomized cohort studies found no differences in limping between patients operated with LA or with PA, as measured with the Trendelenburg test (Jolles and Bogoch <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Also, the study by Winther et&#x000a0;al. (2015) could not detect any difference in hip muscle strength at 3 months between the PA patients and the LA patients. However, the patients&#x02019; perception&#x02014;and hence response to the question&#x02014;of limping may not match an objective measurement of limping.</p><sec id="s0027"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Regarding strengths, the study was a thoroughly executed, randomized controlled trial following the CONSORT statement. We randomized the patients to a specific approach that automatically included a specific team of surgeons with skills in that particular approach, thus avoiding bias due to a learning curve. To avoid the risk of comparing surgeon skills or surgeon preference rather than the surgical procedure, 3 equally experienced surgeons participated in each team.</p><p>Regarding limitations, the study was designed as a superiority trial. We cannot therefore conclude that LA is not inferior to PA. If the clinically relevant difference was less than 10 points on the HOOS subscales, the study may have been underpowered to show this with a statistically significant value. Furthermore, this trial was designed to investigate group differences between PA and LA rather than at the individual level, which has been suggested by Katz et&#x000a0;al. (2015). At the individual level, we found that 23 patients in the LA group had a HOOS-PS score of over 88 points&#x02014;as compared to 27 in the PA group, giving a non-significant absolute risk reduction of 7% (95% CI: &#x02212;14 to 28). The number needed to treat (NNT) was 14 in favor of PA, but the result was not statistically significant based on the present sample size (Appendix C, see Supplementary data).</p><p>Blinding of both the patients and the principal investigator performing the analyses was maintained almost completely throughout the trial, due to the nature of the self-reported outcomes and through the discretion of the hospital personnel. We are aware that a few patients may have guessed their intervention. However, we did not systematically measure the success of blinding.</p><p>Disadvantages related to THA surgery, such as dislocation rates and revision rates, are relevant to include in the investigation of potential differences between the 2 surgical approaches, but this would require a longer follow-up and a study design with a larger sample size (Jolles and Bogoch <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). These issues should be addressed before making any firm conclusion about the superiority of one approach over the other.</p></sec><sec id="s0028"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Not all eligible patients (43%) were included in the trial, which may have reduced the external validity. The strict exclusion criteria may have limited any generalizability of the results to other patient groups. However, 80% of all THA patients are diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis (Overgaard <xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), so the patients in this trial represent the vast majority of all THA patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0029"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no superior efficacy of using the PA compared with LA, as evaluated from patient-reported physical function, pain, physical activity, and quality of life. However, patients operated using the PA had less self-reported limping at 12 months. A future multicenter non-inferiority RCT would be valuable to investigate whether there are significant differences in revision rates between THAs performed with the LA and with the PA.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Appendices A&#x02013;C are available as supplementary data in the online version of the article <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1291100">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2017.1291100</ext-link>.</p><p>We thank the patients for their willingness to participate.
