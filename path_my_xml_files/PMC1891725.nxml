<bold>Background:</bold> The Women's Health Initiative hormone trials originally set out to evaluate whether postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT, estrogen in the case of women who had had a hysterectomy, and estrogen plus progestin for women who had not had a hysterectomy) reduced the risk of heart attacks and strokes, as compared to placebo. The trials were stopped early, and the investigators found that both estrogen alone, as well as estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of stroke amongst women participating in the trials. As part of a secondary analysis of data from these trials, the investigators aimed to explore possible associations between various biological markers (such as variants in particular genes, and levels of particular lipids, proteins, and other markers in blood), and the risk of a woman experiencing a stroke in the trials. Specifically, they wanted to evaluate whether there was any evidence for particular markers being associated with the risk of a stroke; and then whether that risk was modified by whether a woman took HT in the trials.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> In this study, the researchers collected early cases of ischemic stroke in the trials (combining cases among women taking estrogen with those for women taking both estrogen and progestin), and matched these to control individuals, or women participating in the trials who did not experience a stroke. Two hundred five women who experienced a stroke were compared to 878 control individuals. The markers analyzed included those for which there was already some evidence for an association with stroke. Several clinical characteristics and some biomarkers, as measured at the start of the trial, but none of the gene variants, were linked with later risk of stroke. However, none of these clinical characteristics or gene variants specifically identified women who were at greater risk of experiencing a stroke within the HT arms of the trial. High levels of two biomarkers, IL-6 and PAP, did seem to identify women who were at lower risk of experiencing a stroke within the HT arms of the trial. This finding is interesting, because high levels of these markers had previously been suggested as being associated with a higher risk of stroke. Levels of several biomarkers changed during the trial, but for only one biomarker, D-dimer, did the change (an increase in levels) seem to predict higher risk of stroke amongst women receiving HT.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> A particular strength of this study includes the nesting of a case-control study within the Women's Health Initiative trials, in which HT or placebo was randomly assigned. This design minimizes the chance that individuals taking HT differ in their stroke risk from individuals taking placebo. However, the power of this study to detect anything other than large associations is limited; together with the limitation of multiple statistical testing, the findings here must be interpreted as hypotheses for further study and not definitive conclusions.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This study adds data relating to possible predictive risk markers for stroke among users of HT. The hypotheses raised here remain to be tested in further studies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kooperberg C, Cushman M, Hsia J, Robinson JG, Aragaki AK, et al.

We evaluated the association between baseline biomarkers and stroke, whether that association was modified by HT, whether biomarkers were influenced by HT, and whether biomarker changes influenced stroke risk.</p><p>The biomarkers analyzed in this paper were part of a slightly larger panel of markers that were thought by members of the Women's Health Initiative laboratory working group to be associated with either stroke, venous thrombotic disease, or myocardial infarction (MI). Before analyzing the data we restricted our attention to those markers for which we felt there was evidence for an association with stroke, or for a modification of the effects on stroke in the presence of HT. Other markers in the original panel were not analyzed in relation to stroke. The major focus of this biomarker study was to understand why HT increases stroke risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Details of the design, recruitment, randomization, data collection, intervention, and outcomes ascertainment procedures of the Women's Health Initiative hormone trials, including CONSORT diagrams, have been published [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

For this paper we analyzed the cases of ischemic stroke, and the combined controls for each of the three outcomes to increase the power of detecting an association. In particular, this study included 205 participants who had ischemic strokes cases and 878 controls. Of the participants who had a cases stroke, 11 also experienced an MI and seven also experienced a VTE event by February 2001.

No other biomarkers were analyzed for the participants in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>All baseline marker values were log-transformed due to skewed distributions and for consistency; differences from baseline to year 1 were analyzed on the original scale. Logistic regression models were controlled for age and study (estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin), race, BMI, waist-hip ratio, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, prevalent coronary disease (including six cases of atrial fibrillation), prevalent cerebrovascular disease, blood pressure (BP), use of antihypertension medication, aspirin, and statins at baseline. Analyses involving year 1 biomarker data only involved 138 of 205 participants who experienced their stroke after that analysis, and 603 (of 878) matched controls.</p><p>We assessed the appropriateness of using biomarkers log linearly in generalized additive models [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using stroke as response, correcting for risk factors; linearity was rejected for CRP, TAFI, and platelets. For those markers we examined both linear and quadratic models. While we used markers linearly to assess significance (the more powerful analysis), we do not report the coefficients in the logistic regression model, but rather the more easily interpreted odds ratios (OR) comparing quartiles or quintiles. Thus, there is no one-to-one correspondence between <italic>p</italic>-values for models below 0.05 and confidence intervals for OR not containing 1.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses that excluded potential outliers were carried out; except where noted, results were unaffected. All analyses involving TAFI were repeated comparing the subjects with TAFI values above the 90th percentile (7.4 &#x003bc;g/ml) with those below the 25th percentile, as we a priori hypothesized that only very high TAFI levels influence stroke outcome. We only refer to this additional analysis where it differs from the analysis of TAFI on a log linear scale. As most strokes that were analyzed in this study happened early in the trials, most subjects were adhering to study medication. Of the 205 incident stroke cases in this study, only 32 out of 118 of the subjects on HT and 16 out of 87 subjects on placebo were nonadherent 6 mo before their stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline Data</title><p>Baseline characteristics are shown by case-control status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020028-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Baseline levels of several biomarkers representing inflammation and coagulation activity, but not the genotypes that were studied here, were associated with increased stroke risk. The finding that women with higher IL-6, PAP, D-dimer, and leukocyte counts at baseline were at lower risk for stroke if assigned to estrogen plus progestin than placebo, but not estrogen alone, is counterintuitive and is likely due to a noncausal association since both hormone treatment groups had similar stroke rates. When one-year changes in biomarkers were examined, only women with treatment-related increases in D-dimer had increased stroke risk with HT. The effect of other risk factors (such as BP, hypertension, and smoking) in the complete Women's Health Initiative cohort has been previously reported [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The relatively small number of strokes limited our power to definitively detect associations for any lipid parameter. Although low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&#x02013;cholesterol appears to be a weak risk factor for ischemic stroke in women [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], there was evidence in Women's Health Initiative of a trend toward lower stroke risk in women with a reduction in LDL&#x02013;cholesterol of 0.52&#x02013;0.73 mmol/l on HT. HDL&#x02013;cholesterol is more strongly correlated with stroke risk in epidemiologic studies, with protection at levels above 1.45 mmol/l in women aged 45&#x02013;64 y, and above 1.04 mmol/l in women over age 65 y [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this analysis, there was some evidence of a trend toward a lower risk of stroke in women with a greater than 0.16 mmol/l (12%) increase in HDL&#x02013;cholesterol on HT. Baseline HDL-3, but not HDL-2, appeared to be protective against stroke, perhaps explaining the lack of significance for HDL&#x02013;cholesterol overall.</p><p>Inflammation promotes atherogenic events, including stroke [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. IL-6 is an important regulator of the <italic>CRP</italic> gene [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HT with estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin increases CRP to a similar extent [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The rise in CRP with estrogen plus progestin, but not estrogen alone, appears to be IL-6 mediated [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These observations suggest that estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone have differing proinflammatory effects, consistent with the significant interaction between baseline levels of IL-6 and stroke risk that we identified with estrogen plus progestin, but not estrogen alone.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that hemostatic activation underlies increased vascular risk with hormones, and it has been previously reported that hormones raise D-dimer levels [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most associations of hemostatic markers and stroke were carried out during acute ischemic stroke, which itself affects the hemostatic system. A prospective study in patients with prior transient ischemic attack or asymptomatic carotid bruits identified prothrombin fragment 1.2, but not PAP or D-dimer, as an independent predictor of subsequent cardiovascular events [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, D-dimer levels independently predicted ischemic stroke in healthy men, whereas prothrombin fragment 1.2 did not [<xref rid="pctr-0020028-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our findings of higher D-dimer as a risk marker for stroke, and that increases in D-dimer with HT might identify women at risk of stroke, support a role for hemostatic activation in the development of stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The strengths of this analysis are the ability to prospectively assess the interaction between randomly assigned HT and baseline biomarker levels and changes in biomarker levels. Some limitations should be considered. There were a relatively small number of strokes, confining us to detecting relatively large interactions of treatment with biomarkers. Because we analyzed a large number of biomarkers, some of the results may be due to chance. We studied clinical trial participants who may be different from the general population, so that the results might not be generalizable. A standardized diagnostic approach to stroke was not followed, and this may have led to misclassification of stroke types. Information on stroke subtype was limited. The fact that stroke risk was increased similarly with estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin, whereas baseline levels of four biomarkers (IL-6, PAP, D-dimer, leukocyte count) appeared to predict a protective association from estrogen plus progestin, raises concerns about the plausibility of these findings. Regarding the findings related to change in D-dimer and stroke susceptibility of women with HT, in view of the number of markers, one interaction might be expected by chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Summary</title><p>In this nested case-control study, no biomarker convincingly predicted the stroke risk seen with HT, although some hypotheses were raised. A genome-wide scan is in progress to search for underlying mechanisms, and a proteome study has been proposed to characterize hormone-induced proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020028-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020028.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(52 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020028-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020028.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(147 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following persons are investigators in the Women's Health Initiative.</p><p>In the program office at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, United States: Barbara Alving, Jacques Rossouw, Shari Ludlam, Linda Pottern, Joan McGowan, Leslie Ford, and Nancy Geller.</p><p>In the Clinical Coordinating Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States: Ross Prentice, Garnet Anderson, Andrea LaCroix, Charles Kooperberg, Ruth E.
