Standard treatment with antibiotics and simple analgesia are often ineffective and many patients are managed by the chronic pain services.</p><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to be helpful in the management of many chronic diseases and has recently been proposed as an effective treatment for chronic prostatitis. Furthermore, a self management programme administered to groups of men with lower urinary tract symptoms has been shown to be more effective than standard treatments including surgery.</p><p>Therefore, we have developed a cognitive behavioural therapy programme specifically for men with chronic prostatitis. This novel treatment approach will be compared to conventional therapy in the pain clinic such as atypical analgesia and local anaesthetic injections in the context of a randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Men will be recruited from general urology outpatient clinics following the exclusion of other diagnoses that could be responsible for their symptoms. Men will be randomised to attend either a self management healthcare and education programme or to pain clinic referral alone. The self management programme will be administered by a clinical psychologist to small groups of men over six consecutive weekly sessions each lasting two hours. Patients will be taught techniques of problem-solving and goal-setting and will learn coping mechanisms and how to modify catastrophic cognition.</p><p>The primary outcome will be change from baseline in the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index, a validated instrument for the assessment of men with chronic prostatitis. Secondary outcomes include generic quality of life scores and analgesic and drug usage. Outcomes will be assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If this group administered self management programme is shown to be effective in the treatment of men with chronic prostatitis it may become the new standard of care for these patients. Furthermore, it may be adapted for use in women with interstitial cystitis, a condition which is analogous to chronic prostatitis in men.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=ISRCTN21012555">ISRCTN21012555</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Prostatitis is a common urological diagnosis in men of all ages, representing 8% of male urology office visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Type III prostatitis, also referred to as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is the most common type and accounts for 90-95% of prostatitis diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Standard care for men with CP/CPPS has traditionally consisted of initial assessment by a urological surgeon to exclude an underlying reversible organic cause for pain, followed by a non-uniform pathway that incorporates a variety of pharmacological approaches including antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and specialist pain-clinic approaches such as the use of gabapentin. That no one therapeutic approach is consistently beneficial underpins the fact that the underlying condition is multifactorial in its pathogenesis and includes physical, emotional and psychological components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Effective treatment, therefore, must focus not only on the physical pathology but also the emotional and psychological aspects of the disorder. Psychosocial factors were recently targeted in the development of a cognitive-behavioural programme designed specifically for men with CP/CPPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent analysis of the large National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Cohort showed that psychological variables could predict pain experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Self management interventions that enhance patients' problem solving and goal-setting skills have been shown to be effective for a number of chronic diseases including arthritis, diabetes and asthma through reduction in secondary care referrals, reduced primary care attendance and increased self efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recently a group-directed self management programme has been shown to improve both symptoms and quality of life in men with lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>We have developed a programme of cognitive behavioural therapy for men with CP/CPPS. This intervention uses personal health planning and self directed care delivered in the context of small group sessions. We believe that through this holistic approach we can improve these patients' quality of life and functional status, reduce their pain and reduce the need for sustained primary and secondary care consultation.</p><p>The main objective of the study is to show that our programme of group-directed cognitive behavioural therapy for men with CP/CPPS is more effective than standard therapy (pain relief and coping mechanisms delivered in the pain clinic).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>We believe that our self management programme would be best evaluated in the context of a randomised controlled trial compared to standard care. A randomised controlled trial is the most rigorous trial design that will allow comparison of the effectiveness of our intervention with standard treatment and will also allow an economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The trial will take place at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The treatment sessions will take place at the Pain Management Centre and follow-up visits will be scheduled in the hospital outpatient department.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>We will recruit men with CP/CPPS that has not responded to simple treatment with painkillers or antibiotics from general urology outpatient clinics at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. All patients aged 18 or over with CP/CPPS referred for the first time by their GP will be eligible for inclusion. All patients will be assessed by a consultant urologist to diagnose CP/CPPS and exclude other important causes for their symptoms (for example, ureteric stones, prostate cancer).</p><p>Patients meeting these inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to take part in the study. Those who do not wish to take part will be offered standard care and be referred to the pain clinic if they wish.</p><p>If during the course of the study it becomes clear that further psychological treatment would be required for an unexpected diagnosis in a given participant, this would be made available.</p><p>Vulnerable patients, those who are unable to consent for themselves and patients who do not speak English will be excluded from the study.

Mean NIH-CPSI scores in published trials are around 25, with standard deviation in the region 6-7. To detect a mean fall in NIH-CPSI of 4 points, we used CPSI score in control of 25.2, and CPSI score of 21.2 in the intervention with standard deviations of 6.1 and 7.2 in the control and intervention respectively. At 90% power, 5% two sided significance level, we estimate a sample size of 59 individuals in each group.

The SF-36 will provide a measure of generic quality of life. The HAD scale is a self-screening questionnaire for depression and anxiety. The PAM tool will provide a measurement of empowerment and be used to evaluate the degree to which patients feel that they are in control of their health status. Changes in analgesic and drug requirement will be a secondary effectiveness outcome. An economic evaluation will also be undertaken as a secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention comprises a total of six consecutive once-weekly cognitive behavioural therapy sessions delivered to small groups (5-8) of men with CP/CPPS. Each session will last 2 hours and will be led by a Consultant Clinical Psychologist with support from a Specialist Pain Nurse. There will be further input from a Consultant Pain Specialist and Senior Urologist if required particularly in the initial sessions. The sessions will focus on re-enablement through patient education, identifying and challenging negative thoughts, fostering a sense of control and introducing problem-solving and goal-setting strategies.
