There is evidence that in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), about 35&#x000a0;% suffer from manifest T2DM. Early glucose-lowering intervention in subjects with T2DM has been demonstrated to be beneficial in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction. But thus far, no data are available regarding investigating the impact of linagliptin treatment in patients with early diabetes on cardiovascular endpoints or surrogate parameters. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of linagliptin in CAD patients with early T2DM on various cardiovascular surrogate measurements including mechanical and biochemical endothelial function assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Forty-two subjects with early diabetes and CAD are included in this investigator-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IV, single-center study. Participants will be randomized to receive either linagliptin (5&#x000a0;mg) administered once daily per os or placebo for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Before and after the intervention, evaluation of endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation and biochemical biomarkers) and a Meal Tolerance Test are performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Cardiovascular surrogate parameters, such as endothelial function, are able to provide insights into the potential mechanisms of the cardiovascular effects of antihyperglycemic agents. Currently ongoing trials do not specifically focus on early diabetes as a target of intervention and we therefore believe that our study will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular effects of dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in early diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

It is well-known that the pathophysiologic process of T2DM starts many years before the diagnosis can be made on the basis of elevated fasting blood glucose or pathologic glucose tolerance evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and in particular the data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the UKPDS post-trial monitoring highlighted the importance of an early glucose-lowering intervention in patients with T2DM for the reduction of future microvascular and macrovascular complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and in particular the Euro Heart Survey on Diabetes and the Heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have demonstrated that disturbances of glucose metabolism are present in approximately two thirds of patients with CAD, and current joint guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend screening for dysglycemic states in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and GLP-1 in turn increases insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner as well as suppressing glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Investigations in T2DM patients have shown that this drug class lowers both fasting and postchallenge or postmeal glucose levels, and hence glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and is well-tolerated.</p><p>However, the lowering of the surrogate measurement HbA1c level has not necessarily turned out to translate into a reduced number of cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM and, therefore, the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] issued in 2008 and 2010, respectively, guidance for new glucose-lowering drugs, requiring at least the proof of cardiovascular safety. Three cardiovascular outcome trials with the DPP-4 inhibitors alogliptin, saxagliptin and sitagliptin have been published to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and have demonstrated cardiovascular safety albeit not cardiovascular superiority to usual diabetes care without DPP-4 inhibitors. Two outcome trials with linagliptin (CAROLINA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and CARMELINA - NCT01897532) are underway, of which the former is performed in subjects with early diabetes.</p><p>A major limitation of the published studies is that they included primarily patients with longstanding diabetes (median duration of between 7.1 and 11.6&#x000a0;years in EXAMINE, SAVOR-TIMI53 and TECOS) while data from the UKPDS suggest that patients benefit most from an early glucose-lowering intervention rather than a later intervention in the course of the disease. The cardiovascular impact of DPP-4 inhibitors in early treatment remains unclear and there is currently no ongoing trial in this patient population given the low event rate and the need for long-term follow-up.</p><p>A well-known and validated cardiovascular surrogate parameter for future cardiovascular events is endothelial dysfunction. We and others have shown previously that endothelial dysfunction is present in patients with CAD and early diabetes and can be improved by pharmacologic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Data on the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on endothelial function are sparse and the results of these trials are conflicting. While Nakamura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] demonstrated an improvement of endothelial function with sitagliptin, Ayaori and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed a worsening of endothelial function with the same drug. However, none of these trials was performed in a placebo-controlled fashion.</p><p>Therefore, we aim to perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigating the effect of the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin on endothelial function and further biochemical markers of vascular function, which will help to better understand the cardiovascular effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in early diabetes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The aim of our current study is to investigate the effects of linagliptin in CAD patients with early T2DM on various cardiovascular surrogate measurements including mechanical and biochemical endothelial function assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This is an investigator-driven, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IV, single-center study to evaluate the effect of linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg once daily on cardiovascular surrogate measures in patients with early diabetes and CAD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The software&#x02019;s compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) has been confirmed by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). The randomization plan is designed by the Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University Graz, Austria, which passes the treatment codes to the Pharmacy of the University Hospital Graz for adequate labeling and blinding of the medication. The labels of the study medication display the name of the trial, the name of the investigational medicinal product and contact details of the principal investigator. Subject numbers are assigned sequentially as each subject enters the study. The study is subject- and investigator-blinded during the treatment periods from visit 2 until the end of the study. In the rare case of a requirement to unblind study medication, the principal investigator needs to give permission for unblinding.

Weight is measured with the patient standing and then registered after rounding it to the nearest 500 grams. Height is measured using a metric tape with the patient standing against the wall, and the value marked by a ruler placed horizontally on the vertex of the patient&#x02019;s head. BMI is estimated using the weight in kilograms divided by the second power of the height expressed in meters. Blood pressure is taken using an automated sphygmomanometer Boso Medicus Uno (Bosch &#x00026; Sohn GmbH, Juningen, Germany) after a 5-min rest in sedentary body position. Number of beats per min is measured from the radial artery by manual palpation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Measurement of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery</title><p>Endothelium-dependent FMD following reactive hyperemia and endothelium-independent nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NMD) following administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) are examined in the brachial artery by a trained physician according to the guidelines described by Coretti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Vasodilatation of the right brachial artery is measured using a 9&#x02013;14&#x000a0;MHz, linear array, high-resolution transducer (ACUSON S2000 ultrasound system, SIEMENS Healthcare, 91052 Erlangen, Germany). After a 5-min rest in the supine position the brachial artery is examined in a longitudinal plane above the antecubital fossa by continuous grayscale imaging in a segment with definitive intimal interfaces between the lumen and the vascular wall. The distance between the two intimal interfaces is measured at least three times in the end-diastolic phase using echocardiographic (ECG). A blood pressure cuff is placed on the forearm and inflated to a pressure of 250&#x000a0;mmHg for 5&#x000a0;min. The postischemic diameter of the brachial artery is taken 45&#x000a0;s after cuff release. At least 15&#x000a0;min later, the diameter between the two intimal lines is recorded immediately before and 3&#x000a0;min after sublingual administration of 0.4&#x000a0;mg GTN. FMD diameter is calculated as the average of the three diameter measurements following reactive hyperemia. FMD and NMD are calculated as the percentage change in diameter compared to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Meal Tolerance Test (MTT)</title><p>The MTT is performed after an overnight fast (apart from water). A standard-gauge cannula is placed into a subcutaneous vein for blood sampling. In order to prevent blood clotting in the cannula and to keep the cannula working it will be occasionally flushed with sterile normal saline. Study medication will be given (time &#x02212;15&#x000a0;min) before the meal. A pre-meal blood sample will be taken (&#x02212;5&#x000a0;min) and then all subjects are asked to drink Fortimel compact (10&#x000a0;kcal/kg) over a period of 2&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;min (time 0&#x000a0;min). During the meal test further blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 60 and 120&#x000a0;min. All samples are used for determination of glucose, insulin and FFA levels. The blood at each time point is placed into a fluoride oxalate tube (1&#x000a0;ml) for plasma glucose and into a serum tube for insulin and FFA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Laboratory measurements</title><p>Insulin and c-peptide will be measured by chemiluminescence on an ADVIA Centaur system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany). Lipoproteins will be separated using a combined ultracentrifugation-precipitation method (&#x003b2;-quantification). Cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid levels will be determined enzymatically (DiaSys, Holzheim, Germany). Apolipoprotein (apo) AI, apo B and lipoprotein(a) levels will be measured by immunoturbidimetry (Greiner, Flacht, Germany). Lipoprotein analyses will be performed on an Olympus AU640 analyzer (Olympus Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany). Free fatty acids (FFA) will be measured enzymatically (Wako Chemical, Neuss, Germany). Routine parameters will be determined using a cobas&#x000ae; analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Inflammatory markers, such as sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1, will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Arginine bioavailability ratios</title><p>L-arginine, L-citrulline and L-ornithine will be measured using modifications of previously described chromatographic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Briefly, after precipitation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma with perchloric acid following neutralization of the supernatant with sodium carbonate, the extracted amino acids are derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde and separated on a reversed phase column with gradient elution. Quantification will be performed using ratios of the fluorescence signals of the amino acids of interest to the internal standard norvaline in comparison to the appropriated calibration curves. Intra-assay and interassay CVs (coefficient of variation) are all below 10&#x000a0;%. The global arginine bioavailability ratio (GABR) will be calculated from L-arginine divided by the sum of (L-ornithine plus L-citrulline). The L-arginine to L-ornithine ratio will be calculated by dividing the L-arginine by the L-ornithine levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared.

These treatments differ in their mechanisms of drug action and their long-term outcomes. The FDA and the EMA require cardiovascular trials for all new antihyperglycemic drugs in order to prove the safety of these agents. Cardiovascular surrogate parameters, such as endothelial function, cannot replace outcome trials but are able to provide insights into the potential mechanisms of the cardiovascular effects of antihyperglycemic agents. Moreover, currently ongoing trials do not specifically focus on early diabetes as a target of intervention and we therefore believe that our study will contribute to a better understanding of cardiovascular effects of DPP-4 inhibitors in early diabetes.</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently enrolling patients.
