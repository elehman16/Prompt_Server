In rural South Asia, hypertension continues to be a significant public health issue with sub-optimal BP control rates. The goal of the trial is to compare a multicomponent intervention (MCI) to usual care to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the MCI for lowering BP among adults with hypertension in rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a stratified, cluster randomized controlled trial with a qualitative component for evaluation of processes and stakeholder feedback. The MCI has five components: (1) home health education by government community health workers (CHWs), (2) BP monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained general practitioner using a checklist, (3) training public and private providers in management of hypertension and using a checklist, (4) designating hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics and (5) a financing model to compensate for additional health services and provide subsidies to low income individuals with poorly controlled hypertension. Usual care will comprise existing services in the community without any additional training.</p><p>The trial will be conducted on 2550 individuals aged &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years with hypertension (with systolic BP &#x02265;140&#x000a0;mm Hg or diastolic BP &#x02265;90&#x000a0;mm Hg, based on the mean of the last two of three measurements from two separate days, or on antihypertensive therapy) in 30 rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The primary outcome is change in systolic BP from baseline to follow-up at 24&#x000a0;months post-randomization. The incremental cost of MCI per CVD disability-adjusted life years averted will be computed.</p><p>Stakeholders including policy makers, provincial- and district-level coordinators of relevant programmes, physicians, CHWs, key community leaders, hypertensive individuals and family members in the identified clusters will be interviewed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MCI strategies for BP control compared to usual care in the rural public health infrastructure in South Asian countries. If shown to be successful, MCI may be a long-term sustainable strategy for tackling the rising rates of CVD in low resourced countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02657746">NCT02657746</ext-link>.

In South Asia, high rates of CVD are observed at a younger age than in other countries, causing a greater loss of productive life years with severe economic consequences. Population blood pressure (BP) levels and rates of hypertension continue to rise in South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated the benefit of a model of care (COBRA: Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation), which combines family-based home health education (HHE) with trained private general practitioners (GPs), on lowering BP in urban Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The combination of two interventions was superior than single or no intervention (usual care). However, the strategies were not evaluated in rural areas of Pakistan or any other South Asian country. Moreover, the urban model did not use the public health infrastructure for care delivery. Most of South Asia is still rural, where the prevalence of hypertension is high (one in four adults suffers from hypertension, and most cases are poorly controlled), and cardiovascular case fatality rates have been shown to be higher than in urban areas. Thus, evidence-based interventions applicable to rural South Asia are urgently needed.</p><p>Recently, we reported findings from a feasibility study to modify the COBRA model of care as a multicomponent intervention (MCI) for optimal delivery using the public health infrastructure in rural regions in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (the COBRA-BPS feasibility study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The feasibility study also explored system-level barriers and facilitators of implementation of the MCI. Common standardized protocols and manuals for training community health workers (CHWs) and GPs in all three countries were developed. The feedback and suggestions from the stakeholders have already been incorporated in the full-scale trial protocol to be evaluated for fidelity, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the MCI model of care that we refined based on the COBRA-BPS feasibility study. The current protocol paper describes the full-scale COBRA-BPS trial in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>We will evaluate the effectiveness of the MCI model of care compared to usual care in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels over 2&#x000a0;years among 2550 individuals aged 40&#x000a0;years or older with hypertension (those with SBP &#x02265;140&#x000a0;mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &#x02265;90&#x000a0;mm Hg based on the mean of the last two of three measurements from two separate days, or on antihypertensive therapy) in 30 rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p><p>The MCI has five components: (1) HHE by government CHWs, (2) BP monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained GP using a checklist, (3) training public and private providers in management of hypertension and using a checklist, (4) designating hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics and (5) a financing model to compensate for additional health services and provide subsidies to low income individuals with poorly controlled hypertension.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Main and additional aims of the trial</title><p>The main aims of the trial are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate whether the MCI (described with components 1&#x02013;5 above) is better than usual care in lowering BP among adults with hypertension in rural communities</p></list-item><list-item><p>To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of the MCI approach in terms of cost per projected cardiovascular disease disability-adjusted life years (CVD DALYs) averted from the societal, government and participant perspectives.</p></list-item></list>

The unit of randomization will be a cluster defined by 250&#x02013;300 households as defined by local administration according to CHW catchment area (each served by one to two CHWs). These clusters are grouped in geographically contiguous administrative units (AUs) as defined by the local governments (12 sub-districts in Tangail, 6 sub-districts in Munshignaj, 30 union councils in Thatta, 12 medical officers of the health division in Puttalam District) such that each unit is served by one government clinic. First, in the selected district of each country, 10 administrative units will be deliberately sampled, and the respective government clinic will be determined. Within each AU in each country, an eligible cluster will be identified (one cluster is defined as a village for Bangladesh, two to five neighbouring villages for Pakistan and two Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions for Sri Lanka). Each country will measure the distance of clusters from the respective government clinic measured by a GPS device. In each AU, clusters will be stratified by their distance to respective government clinic into two strata: FAR and NEAR (a distance of 2&#x000a0;km or less will be defined as NEAR and more than 2&#x000a0;km as FAR). In each arm (usual care or MCI), five AUs will be further randomized into three NEAR and two FAR.</p><p>One NEAR cluster from each NEAR AU and one FAR cluster from each FAR AU will be randomly selected for subject recruitment. A minimum distance of 10&#x000a0;km between randomized clusters will be ensured. Randomization will be stratified by country as well as by the distance from the government clinic, and AUs will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either MCI or usual care within the six strata defined by the combination of country and distance (NEAR versus FAR) using a computer-generated randomization program at Singapore Clinical Research Institute, Singapore.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility and recruitment</title><p>Inclusion criteria include individuals who:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Are of age &#x02265;40&#x000a0;years</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reside in the selected clusters</p></list-item><list-item><p>Have hypertension defined either as:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Persistently elevated BP (SBP &#x02265;140&#x000a0;mm Hg or DBP &#x02265;90&#x000a0;mm Hg) from each set of last two of three readings from two separate days, where BP measurements on the same day were measured at least 3&#x000a0;min apart</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are maintained on antihypertensive medications</p></list-item></list>

<italic>Home health education (HHE) by government CHWs:</italic> The standardized curricula have been adapted to local diets and languages in the three countries during the pilot feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Training for CHWs in conveying HHE using a structured behaviour change communication approach will be carried out by a qualified nutritionist for 3.5&#x000a0;h/day over 5&#x000a0;days (see details in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). During this time the CHWs will also be trained in completing a paper-based HHE checklist developed as part of the MCI (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The health messages include information on the deleterious effects of hypertension, non-pharmacological interventions for preventing and controlling hypertension and CVD, along with advice on weight loss strategies, physical activity, smoking cessation, avoiding excessive alcohol, low salt and saturated fat intake, and high fruit and vegetable intake.</p><p>The trained CHWs will go door to door and deliver the sessions every 3&#x000a0;months in each cluster (about 60 households with hypertension) per CHW &#x02014; a caseload consistent with the existing services. CHWs will deliver HHE to all individuals with elevated BP (SBP &#x02265;140&#x000a0;mm Hg or DBP&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;mm Hg) at any visit. The first HHE session is expected to run for one hour with the second session expected to last 30&#x000a0;minutes. Family members (including those without hypertension) are also invited to sit in the sessions. The HHE Checklist will be completed by the CHW at the end of the session and submitted to the Local Health Office (LHO) via the community health supervisor.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>BP monitoring, and stepped-up referral to trained GP using checklist:</italic> Every government CHW in the 15 intervention clusters will have a digital portable BP device (Omron HEM-7300&#x02122; Blood Pressure Monitor) and will be rigorously trained in standardized methods for BP measurement. CHWs will monitor the BP of all individuals aged 40&#x000a0;years or older with hypertension (as defined at baseline) at 3-monthly intervals and will complete the CHW BP monitoring and HHE checklist at each visit (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) including list of HHE sessions delivered. All individuals with poorly controlled BP (SBP &#x02265;160&#x000a0;mm Hg or DBP &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mm Hg) at any visit will be referred to a trained GP. The CHW will complete and submit the GP management checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) to the CHW supervisor to track the referrals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Training providers in BP monitoring, management of hypertension and using checklist:</italic> As in the feasibility study, GPs and midlevel providers (nurses, pharmacists) in public and private clinics will be invited for training. All providers will be trained in standardized BP measurement. In addition, GPs will be trained in management of hypertension. The Hypertension Management Manual for Clinic Providers has been developed during the pilot feasibility study and includes training on (1) measurement of BP, (2) provision of lifestyle advice, (3) prescription of antihypertensive therapy and (4) risk stratification for lipid lowering. Those individuals with any of the following will be classified as being at &#x02018;high risk for CVD&#x02019;: (a) aged 55&#x000a0;years older with SBP &#x02265;160&#x000a0;mm Hg (b) past history of diabetes, (c) past history of heart disease, (d) past history of stroke or (e) current smokers; these individuals will be initiated on statins. The GPs will also be trained in completing a GP referral checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). A pre- and post-test of knowledge and practices will be administered. As in the feasibility study, we anticipate at least 66% of all GPs in the intervention clusters to be trained.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Designating hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinator at the government clinics:</italic> A functional hypertension triage counter will be established at the government health clinic enrolled in the study. This triage counter will facilitate care of hypertensive individuals who present to the clinic with a GP referral checklist. The counter will be equipped with a digital BP device for standardized measurement of BP by a trained clinic nurse/assistant before evaluation by a trained physician. Additionally, a hypertension care coordinator will be appointed at each government clinic to facilitate tracking of referrals by the CHW of individuals with poorly controlled BP.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Compensation for additional health services and targeted subsidies:</italic> The government CHWs will receive a pre-decided compensation of up to 0.2 FTE equivalent upon submission of the CHW BP monitoring and HHE checklist. Hypertensive individuals who are deemed poor (according to local policy in each country developed by the study team) with poorly controlled BP (SBP &#x02265;160 or DBP &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mm Hg) will receive a travel voucher for a clinic visit, and a free supply of antihypertensive medications will be provided.

The chief principal investigator (PI) and site PIs will be masked to randomization status of all analytic data. The primary outcome is SBP change from baseline to 2&#x000a0;years. The four 6-monthly changes from baseline measurements (at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months) for all subjects will be modelled simultaneously using a likelihood-based generalized linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. This approach is a subject-level analysis that incorporates a cluster random effect. Although a Gaussian distribution with identity link function is pre-specified for the primary outcome, appropriate distributions within the exponential family and corresponding link functions will be employed in the case of non-normality. An unstructured matrix will be used to model the within-subject variance-covariance structure. If this model fails to converge, other variance-covariance structures will be considered. Primary analyses models will include fixed effects for baseline SBP, country, indicator for distance from clinic (FAR or NEAR), age, gender, intervention arm, visit number and the intervention arm-by-visit number interaction. The primary outcome of interest at 2&#x000a0;years post-randomization will be estimated with corresponding 95% confidence interval using the appropriate contrast at the final visit. Additional analyses will include interactions for country and treatment group to determine whether the effects differ by country. If the interaction effect is found to be clinically meaningful, an MMRM model similar to the primary analysis model will be performed separately for each country. Other analyses (sensitivity, secondary and subgroup analyses) will be explained in a detailed statistical analysis plan paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size</title><p>The planned sample is 2550 subjects with hypertension, involving 3 strata (countries), with an equal number of clusters per strata (10 clusters per country or 30 clusters total) and similar cluster sizes (85 hypertensive subjects per cluster). Based on findings observed in a previous study in urban Pakistan, and assuming a conservative intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.02, 80% follow-up within clusters at 2&#x000a0;years post-randomization (68 hypertensive subjects per cluster) and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, the trial will provide &#x0003e;99% power for the overall test to detect a difference between arms in SBP reduction as small as 4 (SD 11) mm Hg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The study will use 5&#x000a0;mm Hg as the clinically meaningful difference between the two arms for reduction in SBP.</p><p>If heterogeneity in intervention effect across countries is evident (e.g. a reduction in SBP of 3 (SD 11) mm Hg in one country and 9 (SD 16) mm Hg in the other two countries), the trial has 80% power to detect such differences in intervention effects based on the following assumptions: ICC of 0.02 and type I error rate of 1.6% (based on a Bonferroni adjustment), 30 clusters and 85 participants per cluster. In addition to this, the trial has &#x0003e;80% power to detect a difference of 4&#x000a0;mm Hg (SD 11) in SBP reduction between the MCI and usual care arms for each country separately, for an ICC of 0.02, a type I error rate of 5% and 10 clusters of size 85 subjects per country. Furthermore, the high power also ensures that the main effect is adequately powered even after adjusting for dropouts, at both the participant and cluster levels. Therefore, the study is not over-powered for heterogeneity or dropouts (missing data). Power and Sample Size (PASS) software was used for the power calculations. Based on our previous work in urban Pakistan, and expecting a somewhat lower attrition rate in rural areas, the attrition rate is likely to be less than 15% at the end of 2&#x000a0;years in the overall study; therefore, our assumptions about follow-up rates are conservative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The chief PI (THJ) will be responsible for the overall management of the trial.

This framework draws on theories from implementation research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It encapsulates the barriers to hypertension control and makes it possible to explore mediating pathways and moderators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We will explore sub-themes for investigating the implementation of evidence-based practice, organized under three main themes whereby a change in behaviour requires a strong commitment for change (intention barriers), the necessary skills and abilities to perform the behaviour (capability barriers), with no health system constraints, as well as barriers that are external to patients&#x02019; or health care providers&#x02019; control (health care system barriers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The second stage of this study will involve conducting semi-structured interviews with hypertensive individuals, CHWs, health care professionals, providers and policy makers.

The study will adopt a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews using an adaptation of a behaviour change theoretical framework and a health system&#x02019;s assessment framework, adopting some techniques of grounded theory such as line-by-line analysis, identifying deviant cases and using the constant comparison method (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of participants per country over a 2-year period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Time points<break/>Participants</th><th>Prior to intervention</th><th>After 1&#x000a0;year of the intervention</th><th>After 2&#x000a0;years of the intervention</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hypertensive patients</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Health care professionals</td><td>15</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Policy makers</td><td>7&#x02013;10</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>7&#x02013;10</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>42&#x02013;45</td><td>20</td><td>42&#x02013;45</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

The budgetary impact analysis will track the total and per participant costs (including travel time costs monetized at local wage rates) of program delivery using an activity-based costing (ABC) approach. Using this approach, all relevant labor, materials and supplies, contracted services, travel vouchers and opportunity costs required to deliver the interventions will be captured by key activities. This information will not only feed into the cost-effectiveness analysis, but it will also allow policy makers within each country to identify the full and public sector costs of the program, should it be expanded beyond the trial communities.</p><p>The incremental cost-effectiveness evaluation will follow the approach we have employed in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and focus on the additional cost per unit reduction in CVD DALYs relative to standard care. The DALY is a generic measure of the burden of disease that combines healthy life years lost because of premature mortality with those lost due to disability. The metric thus enables assessment of burden of disease and the extent of burden that can be removed due to successful interventions. Using this approach will allow for comparing our results with other programs aimed at improving health outcomes and against common thresholds for cost-effectiveness, such as WHO-CHOICE recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>CVD DALYs averted will be computed using the approach presented in Jafar et al., which assumes a linear relationship between blood pressure and DALYs such that a 1&#x000a0;mm Hg reduction in BP leads to a 2.2% reduction in CVD DALYs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In addition, we will quantify incremental costs per QALY gained over the 2-year time period based on the EQ-5D-5L scores.

The early age of onset of CVD in South Asians worsens the consequences through a reduction in productive life years. About one in four adults suffers from hypertension in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Evidence on effective health systems strategies to manage hypertension is limited, especially in rural South Asia where case fatality rates from CVD are even higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the COBRA-BPS study, we will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive &#x02018;multicomponent intervention (MCI)&#x02019; for effective delivery of hypertension care using the rural predominantly public primary care infrastructure. The MCI approach has been modified from a two-component strategy of HHE and training of GPs, previously shown to be successful in an urban private practice setting, into a five-component MCI with the additional components essential for monitoring of individuals with poorly controlled hypertension and sustainable care delivery via subsidies for travel to clinic and antihypertensive medications through the public health care infrastructure.</p><p>The MCI is also expected to strengthen the capacity of the health system by establishing a team-based approach and referral links with documentation of standardized care to enhance hypertension management. The trial uses hypertension as an entry point into developing rural NCD health services, and the HHE component of our intervention is the first-line approach for management of diabetes and other common NCDs. The use of statins among individuals at high risk for CVD follows an up-to-date comprehensive CVD risk reduction strategy. Models of coordinated care are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for communicable disease programs, such as directly observed treatment (DOT) for tuberculosis, HIV and management of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our trial will provide direct evidence of the value of using comparable models and platforms for NCD management. Furthermore, the training components in the intervention leverage the existing infrastructure and will create economies of scale during roll out at national and regional levels if the trial is successful. NCDs have recently been featured on the national health policy agenda in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Contrasting the experiences from these three countries should provide valuable lessons to implement an action plan and also validate the usefulness of our approach for other countries in the region and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participants are currently being recruited.
