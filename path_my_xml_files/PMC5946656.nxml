In this study, clinical outcomes were evaluated at 5 years post-TIF 2.0. <italic>Methods.</italic> A total of 63 chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) sufferers with troublesome symptoms refractory to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, absent or &#x02264;2 cm hiatal hernia, and abnormal esophageal acid exposure were randomized to the TIF group or PPI group. Following the 6-month evaluation, all patients in the PPI group elected for crossover to TIF; therefore, all 63 patients underwent TIF 2.0 with EsophyX<sub>2</sub> device. Primary outcome was elimination of daily troublesome regurgitation and atypical symptoms at the 5-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptom scores, PPI use, reoperations, and patient health satisfaction. The cost-effectiveness of TIF 2.0 was also estimated. <italic>Results</italic>. Of 63 patients, 60 were available at 1 year, 52 at 3 years, and 44 at 5 years for evaluation. Troublesome regurgitation was eliminated in 88% of patients at 1 year, 90% at 3 years, and 86% at 5 years. Resolution of troublesome atypical symptoms was achieved in 82% of patients at 1 year, 88% at 3 years, and 80% at 5 years. No serious adverse events occurred. There were 3 reoperations by the end of the 5-year follow-up. At the 5-year follow-up, 34% of patients were on daily PPI therapy as compared with 100% of patients at screening. The total GERD Health-related quality-of-life score improved by decreasing from 22.2 to 6.8 at 5 years (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). <italic>Conclusion</italic>. In this patient population, the TIF 2.0 procedure provided safe and sustained long-term elimination of troublesome GERD symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF)</kwd><kwd>regurgitation</kwd><kwd>EsophyX</kwd><kwd>atypical GERD symptoms</kwd><kwd>proton pump inhibitor (PPI)</kwd><kwd>heartburn</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1553350618755214"><funding-source id="funding1-1553350618755214"><institution-wrap><institution>EndoGastric Solutions, Inc</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1553350618755214"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following major changes in technique since the early iterations of endoluminal fundoplication (ELF) and transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) 1.0 (gastrogastric fundoplication), the TIF 2.0 procedure (esophagogastric fundoplication) performed with the EsophyX<sub>2</sub> device (EndoGastric Solutions, Redmond, WA) has emerged as a safe and effective therapy for chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients with minimal anatomical deterioration of the gastroesophageal junction and the diaphragmatic hiatus. Other studies have documented the lack of serious adverse events (SAEs) and demonstrated the ability of TIF 2.0 to eliminate GERD symptoms, heal reflux esophagitis, normalize or reduce pathological distal esophageal acid exposure, and reduce proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use in a subset of chronic GERD patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Despite these successes, the durability of these outcomes remained in question.</p><p>The TIF 2.0 EsophyX vs Medical PPI Open label (TEMPO) trial is a multicenter, controlled, randomized study with 3 prior publications.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In these reports, the superiority of the TIF 2.0 procedure compared with high-dose PPIs in a select group of chronic GERD sufferers with small or absent hiatal hernias was established.

Analysis of the 5-year follow-up data offers the opportunity to assess the durability of symptomatic control, quality-of-life outcomes, reoperation rates post-TIF, PPI use, and patient satisfaction. This is the first study to assess long-term clinical outcomes beyond 3 years in patients in the United States. The authors expected that the determination of reoperation rates 5 years post-TIF could offer preliminary cost comparisons for the TIF procedure versus the more traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF). Finally, we hoped to use the results of this long-term follow-up to propose a role for the TIF procedure in the antireflux armamentarium for select patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-1553350618755214"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-1553350618755214"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label study, with a crossover arm, carried out at 7 community-based practices in the United States.

Patients suffering from troublesome regurgitation and atypical symptoms despite optimized acid-reducing therapy represent a common clinical challenge. This validated the crossover randomized design of this trial, allowing patients in the PPI arm to undergo TIF 2.0 after their 6-month follow-up. Of note, all of them chose this option, recognizing that the TIF 2.0 procedure may offer a valuable alternative.</p><p>The major contribution of this report is that it offers conclusive evidence that the early benefits reported with the TIF 2.0 procedure in previous shorter-term prospective multicenter randomized reports<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and prospective multicenter observational studies<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr14-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> are sustained at the 5-year follow-up. This is a milestone that has not been achieved by previous GERD endoluminal therapies (eg, EndoCinch, Enteryx, Gatekeeper, NDO Plicator, ELF, and TIF 1.0), which, with the exception of the Stretta procedure, are no longer available because of safety concerns and/or lack of effectiveness. The quality and durability of the long-term symptomatic outcomes achieved in this study set apart the TIF 2.0 procedure from these earlier GERD treatment modalities. These results were achieved without unwanted SAE and postfundoplication side effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Importantly, the elimination of regurgitation, atypical symptoms, and heartburn, as evaluated by validated, disease-specific questionnaires (RDQ, RSI, GERD-HRQL), was maintained without significant deterioration over time. Therefore, this study establishes the ability of the TIF 2.0 procedure to provide long-term and durable resolution of troublesome GERD symptoms, improvement of quality of life, and reduction in PPI utilization in well-selected chronic GERD patients.</p><p>Our study design included patients who were selected to demonstrate that the TIF 2.0 procedure would be beneficial for a subset of chronic GERD patients who failed maximal medical therapy (hiatal hernia &#x02264;2 cm, esophagitis Los Angeles grade A or B, Hill grade valve I or II). These patients had been experiencing intractable symptoms and sought a minimally invasive surgical cure without side effects. The TIF 2.0 procedure has repeatedly proven to avoid postfundoplication symptoms such as gas bloat, flatulence, dysphagia, and diarrhea.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The authors reiterate that comparable results can only be achieved by expert endoscopists with appropriate training in the standardized TIF 2.0 technique and by adhering to stringent selection criteria similar to what was used in this study.</p><p>The reoperation rate in this report was determined to be 5% (3/60) after 5 years, which is comparable to the published rates of reoperation after LNF (3%-6%).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In our study, 3 patients underwent Laparoscopic Nissen (2) and Dor (1) fundoplication post-TIF without difficulty, as was previously suggested by others.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In contrast, studies with earlier iterations of the device and techniques no longer used (ELF and TIF 1.0) reported higher rate of reoperations (11%-52%).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr20-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Additionally, the higher reported reoperation rates from the European studies can be attributed to patient selection because patients with large hiatal hernias (&#x0003e;2 cm), Hill grade valves III and IV, and esophagitis C or D were often enrolled.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the relatively small number of patients, which can be partially explained by the challenges involved in enrolling patients with such highly selective criteria. The study was, however, appropriately powered for statistical significance and had a respectable follow-up rate of 70% at 5-year assessment. We could also be criticized for not performing functional tests and endoscopies at the 5-year mark, though they were performed and reported in the 3-year follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We note that a poor correlation between postintervention GERD symptoms and physiological parameters has consistently been reported with all therapies, including traditional antireflux surgery,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> the TIF procedure,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and during PPI therapy (17% to 80% of patients demonstrated abnormal esophageal acid exposure while being asymptomatic on PPI therapy).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="bibr25-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr26-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr27-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> An additional potential limitation of this study is that the results are reported regardless of PPI use at the time of postprocedure assessment (on or off PPI therapy). We felt justified to use this methodology because all patients in the study experienced daily troublesome regurgitation and/or atypical symptoms on optimized PPI therapy before the TIF 2.0 procedure. Achieving control of troublesome symptoms and improving quality of life with the use of PPIs after an endoscopic antireflux procedure in patients whose symptoms were refractory to high-dose PPIs before intervention should not necessarily be considered a treatment failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In these cases, the TIF procedure may be viewed as a useful therapeutic adjunct to PPIs.</p><p>Although every patient enrolled in the TEMPO trial experienced intractable GERD symptoms despite daily PPIs (per inclusion criteria), more than two-thirds of patients remained off daily PPIs 5 years after undergoing the TIF procedure. Others have suggested that return to PPI utilization is a poor indicator of recurrent GERD.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In our study, patients who were still on occasional or daily PPIs had benefited from improved symptomatic control after TIF 2.0, with 95% of patients enrolled not having sought corrective surgery after 5 years.</p><p>The TIF 2.0 procedure appears to be cost-effective. Medicare data suggest that the average reimbursement for a TIF procedure ($4, 510.81) is about half the rate for a LNF ($8, 573.99). A simulation applying these reimbursement rates to the 60 TEMPO patients (who were candidates for either procedure) reveals a potential procedure-related savings of $238 543.40 for performing TIF 2.0 instead of LNF. Considering that the preprocedure evaluation is the same for the TIF candidates and the LNF candidates, and that the reoperation rate established in this study for TIF is similar to that of LNF, we believe that TIF may be a cost-effective alternative to LNF. In the top quartile of medical resource utilization, such as in GERD patient populations with similar characteristics as our TEMPO patients, the potential savings may be even more significant. Indeed, in that subgroup, the approximate total accrued cost reached $124 000 for a single LNF patient versus $66 000 for TIF for the first 2 years postprocedure. Out of the 63 patients enrolled in this study and who underwent the TIF procedure, 5% had corrective surgery within 5 years, leaving 95% of patients who underwent a less-invasive procedure, with virtually no side effects and at a significant overall cost savings compared with more invasive GERD surgery.</p><p>Based on these results and the authors&#x02019; personal experience, and in an attempt to define the role of TIF in the antireflux armamentarium, we suggest that in the appropriate patient population, the TIF 2.0 procedure could be considered the definitive alternative therapy to PPIs in a majority of patients undergoing the procedure. Indeed, our study shows that at 5 years, a majority of patients had enjoyed the combined benefits of not having undergone any kind of additional corrective surgery, not being back on daily dose of PPIs, experiencing complete resolution of their troublesome symptoms, and being satisfied. In a minority of patients, it appears that TIF 2.0 represented a useful adjunct therapy to be used in conjunction with various regimens of acid-reducing therapy. In this subgroup of patients, our study shows that the TIF procedure helped eliminate or improve difficult-to-control symptoms such as regurgitation and atypical symptoms that had been intractable and refractory to PPIs prior to the procedure. Finally, in a very small group of patients, estimated at approximately 5% after 5 years, the procedure would have represented a noninvasive first-line therapy without &#x0201c;burning any bridges&#x0201d; or compromising the ability to perform additional surgery such as a LNF.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1553350618755214" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section17-1553350618755214"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Five years after undergoing TIF 2.0, the great majority of TEMPO trial patients experienced durable elimination of all types of troublesome GERD manifestations, including regurgitation and atypical symptoms.
