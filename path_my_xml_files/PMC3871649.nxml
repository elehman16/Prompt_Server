The typical US diet provides 5&#x02013;40 mg/day of quercetin, but intake can reach 200&#x02013;500 mg/day with high fruit and vegetable consumption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-oajsm-4-053">1</xref> As a polyphenolic flavonoid, quercetin has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant. There is also evidence that quercetin can provide a number of health and performance benefits due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, cardioprotective, psychostimulating, and neuroprotective properties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-oajsm-4-053">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-oajsm-4-053">3</xref> In regards to physical performance, the potential for quercetin to be ergogenic lies in the electron donating capacity of its phenolic hydroxyl groups, reducing the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-oajsm-4-053">4</xref> and the possibility of increasing mitochondrial density.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-053">5</xref> Few authors have studied quercetin&#x02019;s effect on human performance, with consistent results being elusive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-053">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-oajsm-4-053">8</xref> Reasons for equivocal findings include (1) acute supplement duration; (2) mode of exercise, with cycling having less muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress than running; (3) quercetin cocktails with other isoflavones, catechins, vitamin C and E, and omega-3 fatty acids, not allowing for evaluation of the direct effects of quercetin benefits;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-oajsm-4-053">4</xref> and (4) dose/response variables have demonstrated many factors unique to individuals causing different absorption and storage capacities of quercetin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-oajsm-4-053">9</xref></p><p>Oxidative stress during physical activity can cause damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, and carbohydrates if the increase in free radicals is greater than the ability to neutralize them. Byproducts of lipid and protein oxidation are malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls, respectively. To measure the damage to cellular components by oxidation, studies have typically used MDA as a measure of oxidative stress induced by exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-oajsm-4-053">10</xref></p><p>Most antioxidant supplementation studies on human performance have been carried out using vitamins A, C, and E. It has been suggested that antioxidant supplementation may improve performance by reducing oxidative stress to the contractile and structural proteins in muscle, thus limiting the inflammation and fatiguing effects of exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-oajsm-4-053">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-oajsm-4-053">12</xref> Contrary to this suggestion, vitamin C was found to delay the exercise recovery process and have no positive effect on the delayed onset muscle soreness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-oajsm-4-053">13</xref></p><p>Human performance studies using antioxidant supplementation have been frequently carried out in a maximal exercise capacity such as a long duration race or via maximal oxygen testing. At exercise intensities over 80% VO<sub>2max</sub>, antioxidant systems become overrun with ROS and no longer provide benefit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-oajsm-4-053">14</xref> With extensive exercise durations, such as in long distance endurance runs, acute antioxidant supplementation may have no beneficial effect due to absent training effects and short half-life of the antioxidants used.</p><p>We found only two studies with a treatment time of at least 6 weeks where the effects of quercetin on endurance performance in humans have been evaluated. MacRae and Mefferd<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-053">7</xref> found a 3% improvement in cycle time trial performance following 6 weeks of supplementation. This performance improvement was not statistically significant but even a minor improvement for elite cyclists in competition can have a dramatic effect on final race results. It should also be noted that the placebo group in this study had a 1.5% performance improvement. The study by Bigelman et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-oajsm-4-053">15</xref> found no significant difference in VO<sub>2peak</sub> or anaerobic performance measures with 6 weeks of quercetin supplementation in moderately trained military personnel. Neither of these two studies investigated the antioxidant effects of quercetin supplementation.</p><p>Several researchers have studied the acute effects of quercetin supplementation on performance measures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-053">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-oajsm-4-053">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-oajsm-4-053">18</xref> Because VO<sub>2max</sub> and cellular adaptations take several weeks to improve with aerobic exercise training,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-053">19</xref> it is likely that a similar duration of exercise with quercetin supplementation is warranted to produce significant performance improvements and develop an adaptation response to oxidative stress.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effect of quercetin supplementation to placebo using trained, healthy, male endurance runners during a 6 week time period. To date, no other studies have investigated the antioxidant effects of quercetin in endurance performance over a training period longer than 7 days. First, we hypothesized that quercetin supplementation will result in less oxidative stress at baseline, after a VO<sub>2peak</sub> test and after a strenuous 10 km time trial (10 km TT) exercise bout as measured by lipid peroxidation (MDA) and protein oxidation (protein carbonyl) in serum. Second, we hypothesized that 6 weeks of quercetin supplementation and continued exercise training will increase endogenous antioxidant activity as measured by total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum. Lastly, we hypothesized an improved VO<sub>2peak</sub>, improved running economy, decreased heart rate, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during a 10 km TT for quercetin supplementation versus placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight males ages 18&#x02013;39 volunteered to participate after a preliminary screening and explanation of all procedures and gave their written informed consent, according to the experimental procedures approved by the University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and University of Sioux Falls Institutional Review Boards.

At the end of this study, the 10 km TT was repeated at the exact same run speeds and time as the preliminary 10 km TT to replicate the same intensity.

A recent meta-analysis found quercetin supplementation to have a statistical benefit in endurance performance but the effect is trivial to small.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-oajsm-4-053">23</xref> Our results demonstrate that there is a relationship between quercetin supplementation and the statistically significant decreasing trend in the serum MDA levels following 6 weeks of supplementation and training. These findings imply that quercetin reduced oxidative stress as measured by MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation. The reduction of oxidative stress can be a mechanism through which quercetin improves aerobic performance.</p><p>Davis et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-oajsm-4-053">3</xref> found that endurance capacity with quercetin supplementation in mice was associated with positive changes in markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in just 7 days of supplementation. It is possible that flavanols, including quercetin, may enhance mitochondrial biogenesis in humans, hence improve aerobic performance. Flavonol rich lychee fruit extract, has been shown to decrease inflammation caused by high intensity exercise but, as in our study, did not significantly improve aerobic performance in humans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-oajsm-4-053">24</xref> Similarly, Nieman et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-oajsm-4-053">25</xref> found that quercetin reduced inflammation but had no effect on cycling performance in trained cyclists.</p><p>In our study, quercetin supplementation did not enhance performance through peak oxygen consumption or running economy measured by oxygen consumption during a self-selected speed 10 km TT. The peak oxygen consumption results obtained are consistent with published studies on the ergogenic effect of quercetin supplementation in humans. Ganio et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-oajsm-4-053">18</xref> found that 5 days of quercetin supplementation did not improve VO<sub>2max</sub> in untrained, sedentary individuals. Cureton et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-053">5</xref> showed that 1000 mg/day of quercetin supplementation had no significant effect on VO<sub>2peak</sub> or metabolic responses during submaximal cycling. Davis et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-oajsm-4-053">21</xref> demonstrated that VO<sub>2max</sub> improved by 3.9% with 7 days of quercetin supplementation (1000 mg/day) in untrained subjects. A significant difference between this study and ours is the conditioning of subjects with the subjects in the current study being well-trained versus untrained in the cited study.</p><p>According to Vollaard et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-oajsm-4-053">26</xref> when assessing aerobic performance, it is important to utilize a direct measure of performance output to prevent the large individual variability outcome associated with a percentage of VO<sub>2peak</sub>. Therefore, we analyzed differences in oxygen consumption at a self-selected 10 km TT pace from pre- to post-supplementation. A decrease in oxygen consumption indicates improved running economy, which can lead to an improved time trial performance or time to fatigue test. Consistent with the lack of changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub>, we did not find that quercetin supplementation altered oxygen consumption at the self-selected 10 km TT pace.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that the antioxidant properties of quercetin may improve endurance performance by scavenging free radicals, and reducing systemic inflammation, damage to skeletal muscle&#x02019;s membranes and contractile proteins, and oxidative stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-oajsm-4-053">27</xref> Previous research by Hadley et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-oajsm-4-053">28</xref> found an increase in urinary MDA excretion following exercise in the unsupplemented group and a decrease in urinary MDA following exercise in the supplemented (vitamins C and E) group. Similarly, we found no significant difference in serum MDA between quercetin and placebo before training. However, following training, the placebo group had an increase in serum MDA, while the quercetin group had a decrease in serum MDA, resulting in a significant interaction between the two groups with pre- and post-supplementation. This observation strongly supports our hypothesis of a decreased level of oxidative stress with quercetin supplementation. However, we did not observe any benefits in performance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found differences in TAC, protein carbonyl, and SOD activity between the quercetin and placebo groups. These differences were observed before and after supplementation, however, quercetin supplementation did not appear to have an effect. This may be due to subjects being randomized by VO<sub>2peak</sub> rather than antioxidant or oxidative levels as well as a small sample size.</p><p>We found no changes in TAC, protein carbonyl, or SOD activity with 6 weeks of training and quercetin supplementation. These results are similar to the findings of Quindry et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-oajsm-4-053">29</xref> who found no alterations in post-race antioxidant capacity or oxidative damage with 3 weeks of quercetin supplementation prior to a 160 km endurance run, which took up to 30 hours to complete. In addition, there was no difference in performance between the supplemented and non-supplemented groups. Our findings are also similar to findings by McAnulty et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-oajsm-4-053">30</xref> who supplemented trained cyclists for 3 weeks prior to a 3 day cycling bout of 57% of cyclist&#x02019;s VO<sub>2max</sub> and demonstrated that although plasma quercetin increased, there were no changes in oxidative stress, inflammation, plasma antioxidant capacity, or performance.</p><p>The time of quercetin supplementation in our study (6 weeks) was much longer than in the study (9&#x02013;16 days) by Cureton et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-oajsm-4-053">5</xref> Because VO<sub>2peak</sub> and cellular adaptations for mitochondrial biogenesis take several weeks to improve with aerobic exercise training,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-oajsm-4-053">19</xref> it is possible that, with a longer treatment time, we would find changes in performance measures. However, our findings imply that 6 weeks treatment time does not provide those adaptations. Contrary to our findings, Davis et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-oajsm-4-053">21</xref> found a significant improvement in VO<sub>2max</sub> and endurance performance using human subjects during a cycling bout with quercetin supplementation for 7 days. The authors hypothesized that the change in performance was related to mitochondrial biogenesis, reduction of reactive oxygen&#x02019;s species preventing fatigue, and/or the psychostimulatory effect, which may also delay fatigue. However, the biological mechanisms as to why the performance improved were not measured in this study.</p><p>It should be noted that although excessive oxidative stress can be detrimental to exercise performance, it is also known that blocking oxidative stress can hinder adaptations in the mitochondria, therefore stifling performance. Gomez-Cabrera et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-oajsm-4-053">31</xref> concluded that 8 weeks of antioxidant supplementation prevented cellular adaptations in untrained men who underwent strenuous indoor cycle training. Several researchers have used cocktails of antioxidant supplements in subjects involved in kayaking and downhill running and found an attenuation of ROS resulting in a delayed recovery of muscle function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-oajsm-4-053">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-oajsm-4-053">32</xref> Therefore, our null exercise performance findings may also be due to the potential negative effects of antioxidant supplements on performance.</p><p>Quercetin supplementation (1000 mg/day) has been shown to be safe and quercetin is currently a legal supplement. Further research is needed before a consensus statement can be made concerning its effectiveness. We found no performance benefits with 6 weeks of supplementation in long distance runners but did find a decrease in lipid peroxidation. The reduction of oxidative stress has been found to provide benefit to exercise performance,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-oajsm-4-053">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-oajsm-4-053">12</xref> but has also been suggested to prevent adaptations from the stress of exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-oajsm-4-053">31</xref></p><p>Although we found a decrease in lipid peroxidation and no improvement in endurance performance, experimental limitations hamper simple interpretations of the results. Similarly to previous research by MacRae and Mefferd,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-oajsm-4-053">7</xref> we restricted our sample to well-trained athletes where positive adaptations may be small and difficult to detect for those who have reached a ceiling for increasing muscle oxidative capacity due to high levels attained through training. To test for these potentially small adaptations, we used a 10 km TT to measure the VO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate, and RPE at specified intervals which can indicate changes in performance. Although this method doesn&#x02019;t mimic a competitive event performance, it allowed us to control environmental factors that would normally affect race performances scheduled 6 weeks apart. There is also a possibility that serum indicators of lipid peroxidation may not directly correlate with those indicators in muscle tissues that are responsible for exercise performance. Future studies are needed to examine the effect of quercetin with longer supplementation durations, greater bouts of intensity, greater sample size, and more specific measures of performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quercetin has been found to improve athletic performance but the mechanisms involved are not yet clear. The results obtained in this study demonstrated, for the first time, that quercetin supplementation during training for 6 weeks can decrease oxidative stress in well-trained endurance athletes, implying the potential for improved endurance performance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was funded in part by NIH Grant Number 2 P20 RR016479 from the INBRE Program of the National Center for Research Resources.
