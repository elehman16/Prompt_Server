It costs the UK &#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x000a3;2.8 billion per year in loss of productivity. Endometriosis can be managed by surgical excision or medically by ovarian suppression. However, ~&#x02009;75% symptoms recur after surgery and available medical treatments have undesirable side effects and are contraceptive. Omega-3 purified fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown in animal models to reduce factors that are thought to lead to endometriosis-associated pain, have minimal side effects, and no effects on fertility. This paper presents a protocol for a two-arm, pilot parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) which aims to inform the planning of a future multicentre trial to evaluate the efficacy of Omega-3 PUFA in the management of endometriosis-associated pain in women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study will recruit women with endometriosis over a 12-month period in the National Health Service (NHS) Lothian, UK, and randomise them to 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with Omega-3 PUFA or comparator (olive oil). The primary objective is to assess recruitment and retention rates. The secondary objectives are to determine the effectiveness/acceptability to participants of the proposed methods of recruitment/randomisation/treatments/questionnaires, to inform the sample size calculation and to refine the research methodology for a future large randomised controlled trial. Response to treatment will be monitored by pain scores and questionnaires assessing physical and emotional function compared at baseline and 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We recognise that there may be potential difficulties in mounting a large randomised controlled trial for endometriosis to assess Omega-3 PUFA because they are a dietary supplement readily available over the counter and already used by women with endometriosis.

It is associated with chronic pelvic pain, pain during menstruation, pain during intercourse, and an increased likelihood of infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Endometriosis is associated with a 45% reduction in work productivity with the annual cost for caring for women with endometriosis estimated at &#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x000a3;2.8 billion in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue (endometriosis &#x02018;lesions&#x02019;) outside the uterine cavity, most commonly on the pelvic peritoneum or ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The cause of the painful symptoms experienced by women with endometriosis is not well understood. Endometriosis is treated by surgical excision or medical management by ovarian suppression. However, up to 75% symptoms recur after surgery and medical treatments have undesirable side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and are contraceptive. There is an unmet need for new medical treatments for endometriosis.</p><p id="Par24">An ideal therapy for endometriosis would (i) reduce the painful symptoms associated with the condition, (ii) reduce lesion size, (iii) preserve the patients&#x02019; ability to conceive while on medication, and (iv) have no, or limited, side effects. Oral Omega-3 purified fatty acids (PUFA) have the potential to meet all of the above criteria. Omega-3 PUFA are a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dietary supplement, which play a role in the regulation of prostaglandin metabolism and cytokine physiology, and are thought to work by competing with Omega-6 PUFA to produce lipid mediators which are anti-inflammatory as opposed to pro-inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Intake of food with a high content of Omega-3 PUFA have been used in other inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis and have been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In endometriosis, Omega-3 PUFA supplementation has been shown to reduce lesion size and reduce local prostaglandin/cytokine production in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In an endometriosis model using Fat-1 mice, in which Omega-6 can be converted to Omega-3 PUFA, the number and weight of endometriotic lesions 2&#x000a0;weeks after inoculation were significantly less than in Fat-1 mice compared to controls who cannot convert Omega-6 to Omega-3 PUFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In vitro studies, using endometrium from women with and without endometriosis have shown that Omega-3 PUFA might have a suppressive effect on endometrial cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a large, prospective cohort study investigating dietary exposure and endometriosis risk in women, it was concluded that increasing Omega-3 PUFA intake might be the first identified modifiable risk factor for endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, it is reported that a low ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 PUFA intake is correlated with painful menstruation and a high rate of autoimmune and endocrine disorders in women with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">We believe that it is important to determine the true value of Omega-3 PUFA for the control of or potential elimination of endometriosis-associated pain. A definitive evaluation of the efficacy of Omega-3 PUFA in the management of endometriosis-associated pain will require a large, multicentre randomised controlled trial. This protocol outlines a pilot study to assess the processes that are unknown and vital to the delivery of such a trial, including variance of the response, variables for sample size calculation, follow-up rates, and &#x02018;failure to comply with treatment&#x02019; rates. In the pilot study, we are using olive oil capsules, which do not contain Omega-3 PUFA, as a comparator due to lack of availability of a matched placebo. We accept that this comparator might have the potential for pain relief which could encourage participation in our trial and that it might have a unique taste with a theoretical risk of unblinding the trial medication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par27">We aim to perform a two-arm, parallel, double blind randomised controlled pilot trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart for the trial process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40814_2018_274_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study settings</title><p id="Par28">We will recruit patients from gynaecology outpatient clinics, gynaecology wards and day surgery units within NHS Lothian, UK (Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and St. John&#x02019;s Hospital).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par29">Women with a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis and associated pelvic pain will be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par30">The primary objective is to assess recruitment and retention rates.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Participant enrolment</title><p id="Par52">All gynaecology consultants within NHS Lothian will be sent an email informing them of the study and requesting permission to approach their patients. A clinical research fellow will approach eligible women who have agreed to be seen by the trial team, while the women are still in the clinic, provide them with patient information sheets and offer them the opportunity to discuss the trial. Consent will only be taken later once the patient has had ample time, of at least 24&#x000a0;h, to read the patient information sheet. A further appointment will be arranged for the participant to come for this visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Screening</title><p id="Par53">Eligibility for randomisation will be based on the worst of four weekly numerical rating scale (0&#x02013;10; NRS) pain scores collected by text messaging (&#x02018;run-in phase&#x02019;), score of 4 out of 10 in 2 or more weeks is required. Texts will be sent by the clinical research fellow to the women&#x02019;s mobile phone, asking about average and worst pain, respectively, and the woman will be asked to reply to the text message with her pain score, rating it from 0 for no pain at all, to 10 being worst pain imaginable. To capture known cyclicity in pain in women, these texts will be sent once per week during the eligibility phase (weeks&#x02013;minus one to minus four). If a woman has an NRS of greater than or equal to &#x02265;&#x02009;4 in two or more of the pre-randomisation run-in weeks of the study, she will be eligible for randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par54">Women will be randomised to one capsule of Omacor 1000&#x000a0;mgs capsules (Omega-3-acid ethyl ester filled capsules) or one capsule of comparator (olive oil soft gelatin capsules which do not contain Omega-3 PUFA) to be taken twice a day, once in the morning and once at night with food. The allocated treatments will be taken for 8&#x000a0;weeks. Omega-3 purified fatty acids have been used clinically, e.g. post myocardial infarction and for hypertriglyceridemia at doses of 1000&#x02013;4000&#x000a0;mg daily (in divided doses of 1000 or 2000&#x000a0;mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, high dosage (i.e. 4000&#x000a0;mg) has been associated with a moderate increase in bleeding time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], so we chose to pilot a lower dose and frequency of one capsule (1000&#x000a0;mg) twice a day. We approached the MHRA for advice, and due to the fact that both PUFA and olive oil are &#x02018;food supplements&#x02019;, our trial was not deemed a CTIMP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par55">The randomisation scheme will be generated using tables, drawn up by an independent statistician, with 1:1 allocation ratio.

They will also be instructed to contact the clinical research fellow at any time after consenting to join the trial if they have an event that requires hospitalisation or an event that results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Omega-3 PUFA are an FDA-approved dietary supplement, and serious adverse events are not anticipated. Any serious adverse events that occur after joining the trial will be reported in detail in the participant&#x02019;s medical notes, followed up until resolution of the event and reported to the Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research &#x00026; Development (ACCORD) Research Governance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.accord.ed.ac.uk">http://www.accord.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>) and Quality Assurance Office based at the University of Edinburgh immediately, or within 24&#x000a0;h. ACCORD will onward report all serious adverse events (SAE) within 7&#x000a0;days. Hospitalisation for a pre-existing condition, e.g. exacerbation of pain due to endometriosis will not be considered a SAE, but will be documented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par71">The emphasis in this study is to establish feasibility, not statistical significance. This study is designed primarily to explore the recruitment and retention rates, and we will aim to recruit as many women as possible over a 12-month period. We estimate that we will recruit ~&#x02009;4&#x02013;5 patients per month and will aim to recruit 40 patients. As we anticipate a recruitment rate of 50%, 40 participants would be able to give 95% confidence interval of 35&#x02013;65%.

Due to the conflicting literature about the benefits of methods such as prescription monitoring, pill counting and devices for monitoring the self-administration of medicines, data on blinding and compliance to treatment will be derived from questionnaires at 8&#x000a0;weeks. We aim to determine if treatment is acceptable in terms of self-reported compliance (from treatment diaries).

We plan to randomise participants to either Omega-3 PUFA or olive oil and then evaluate recruitment and retention rates as our primary outcome.</p><p id="Par79">A potential limitation of our study is the broad inclusion and exclusion criteria which we have produced in an attempt to reflect the true clinical scenario of endometriosis. Our criteria do not take into account pain intensity, do not exclude women with non-reproductive comorbidities (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, bladder pain syndrome) that could explain their symptoms and allow participants the use of concomitant medications. We are aware that these characteristics may increase variability in patient responsiveness to treatment and carry the risk of failing to demonstrate treatment effect. We will therefore capture this information in our pilot study in the participants&#x02019; questionnaires and treatment diaries to inform interpretation of our results and the planning of the future randomised controlled trial. Like many of the medications/supplements used for endometriosis, Omega-3 PUFA given in the highest effective dose with the rate and severity of adverse effects are minimised.</p><p id="Par80">One of the other limitations of our pilot study is the lack of availability of a suitable placebo. It was not possible to find a placebo identical to Omega-3 PUFA, and therefore, we decided to use a &#x02018;comparator&#x02019; (olive oil) instead of a true placebo. We thought that olive oil, a comparator with the potential for pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], was the best option for our target population to encourage participation in our trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The drawback of using olive oil is that it may have a unique taste and there is a theoretical risk of the subjects guessing which arm of the trial they have been randomised to. In order to determine whether significant &#x02018;unblinding&#x02019; was present, we will ask the subjects at the conclusion of the trial to guess what treatment was received and the primary reason for the guess in an attempt to determine the validity of using olive oil as a suitable comparator. Another limitation of our study is the short timescale of the treatment phase, and we are aware that a longer trial will likely be necessary to better assess the long-term effects of Omega-3 PUFA.</p><p id="Par81">We have chosen data collection tools to assess the core domains of pain, physical/emotional functioning (including sleeping difficulties), improvement/satisfaction with treatment, symptoms and adverse events, following advice from a clinical psychologist and a general practitioner, both with a research interest in endometriosis. These tools are in line with the IMMPACT recommendations for chronic pain trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We will assess the reliability and acceptability of these data collection tools in order to refine our methods for the subsequent RCT.</p><p id="Par82">In summary, this pilot trial with embedded evaluation of trial processes and collection of outcome data will allow us to undertake detailed feasibility work to inform a future large-scale trial in the important but challenging area of dietary supplements and endometriosis-associated pain.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AA</term><def><p id="Par5">Arachidonic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACCORD</term><def><p id="Par6">Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BFI</term><def><p id="Par7">Brief Fatigue Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPI</term><def><p id="Par8">Brief Pain Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p id="Par9">Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHA</term><def><p id="Par10">Docosahexaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPA</term><def><p id="Par11">Eicosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p id="Par12">Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GHQ-12</term><def><p id="Par13">General Health Questionnaire-12</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMMPACT</term><def><p id="Par14">Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRS</term><def><p id="Par15">Numerical Rating Pain Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCQ</term><def><p id="Par16">Pain Catastrophizing Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PUFA</term><def><p id="Par17">Purified fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par18">Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAQ</term><def><p id="Par19">Sexual Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p id="Par20">12-Item Short-Form Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WPAI-SHP</term><def><p id="Par21">Work and Productivity Impairment Questionnaire-specific Health Problem Version 2.0</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Funding</title><p>PurFECT is funded by an IKTF grant (96bM-12/0774) from the University of Edinburgh and supported by an MRC Centre Grant Mr/N022556/1.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>IMA, PTKS, FCD, AD, LW, and AWH was responsible for the contribution of original material, drafting, editing, and approval of the final manuscript.
