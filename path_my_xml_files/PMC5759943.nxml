The aim of our study was to determine whether DBD can prevent myelosuppression in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. We conducted a phase II randomized prospective controlled clinical study. From December 2013 to February 2015, 106 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to the TCM group and control group. The primary end point was incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia. The secondary end points included incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia in each cycle, incidence of anemia, and incidence of thrombopenia during 4 cycles. Seventeen patients withdrew from this study, and 89 patients were included in the final analysis. Incidences of grade 3-4 neutropenia during 4 cycles were 57.1% in the TCM group and 59.6% in the control group, and there was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = .816). Similarly, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups for incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia in each cycle. While incidences of anemia were 54.8% and 66.6% for the TCM group and control group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .280), incidences of thrombopenia were 11.9% for the TCM group and 4.3% for the control group (<italic>P</italic> = .248). No significant differences were observed for the incidence of other nonhematological toxicities between the 2 groups. DBD failed to prevent myelosuppression in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Further studies are warranted to validate the efficacy of DBD in selected patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>traditional Chinese medicine</kwd><kwd>Danggui Buxue decoction</kwd><kwd>myelosuppression</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1534735416675952"><funding-source id="funding1-1534735416675952"><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1534735416675952">12ZR1446400</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-1534735416675952"><funding-source id="funding2-1534735416675952"><institution-wrap><institution>Joint Research Project of the Emerging Cutting-edge Technology of Shanghai Shen-kang Hospital Development Center</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-1534735416675952">SHDC12014103</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award3-1534735416675952"><funding-source id="funding3-1534735416675952"><institution-wrap><institution>Technology Innovation Act Plan of Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding3-1534735416675952">14411950200, 14411950201</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award4-1534735416675952"><funding-source id="funding4-1534735416675952"><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding4-1534735416675952">81172520, 81202087, 81202088, 81472462</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735416675952"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemotherapy is one of the main effective systemic treatments for breast cancer, previous studies have shown that anthracycline-based polychemotherapy reduced the annual breast cancer death rate by about 20% to 38%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Nevertheless, patients who receive chemotherapy also suffer from different grades of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, such as neutropenia, thrombopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and neuropathy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Among those, acute myelosuppression is the most common hematologic toxicity and often occurs within a very short time after chemotherapy, which is associated with increased risk of life-threatening infections as well as chemotherapy dose reductions and delays that may compromise treatment outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Studies have revealed that incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia in breast cancer patients treated with conventional chemotherapy regimens is 43% to 65%.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>To reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, especially febrile neutropenia, the routine method is prophylactic treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), such as filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, these drugs are not only expensive but also have some side effects.

All patients were proactively treated with ondansetron hydrochloride 8 mg intravenously to decrease the risk of vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Patients receiving TC regimens also took dexamethasone tablets 7.5 mg orally twice a day for 3 days (the days before, on and after chemotherapy was administered). Patients in the TCM group received 1 dose of DBD (RAS 6 g and RS 30 g, concentrated traditional Chinese medicine granules; PuraPharm Corporation) twice daily during 4 cycles.

A previous in vivo study indicated that DBD treatment significantly increased the white blood cell counts and hematopoietic colony-forming unit (CFU) of myeloid cells in a myelosuppression mouse model.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, in our study, the total incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was 57.1% in the TCM group and 59.6% in the control group; no significant improvement was observed after addition of DBD. Similarly, there were no significant differences for grade 3-4 neutropenia in each cycle. Nevertheless, incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the first cycle was 45.2% and 46.8% for the 2 groups, respectively, but it decreased rapidly in the subsequent 3 cycles, ranging from 16.7% to 27.7%. This phenomenon is similar to previous reports that most neutropenia induced by chemotherapy occurs in the first cycle.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In a study about patients with non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer who were treated with CDE (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and roxithromycin), incidence of febrile neutropenia was 24% in the first cycle and ranged from 3% to 11% in the subsequent cycles.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Beyond that, other studies also showed that 75% of febrile neutropenia occurred in the first cycle in breast cancer patients who were treated with docetaxel and doxorubicin.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This may be related to patients&#x02019; tolerance to chemotherapy and acceleration of bone marrow proliferation in the subsequent cycles, although the mechanism is still unclear.</p><p>According to prior stratification, subgroup analysis showed that there were no significant differences in the incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia between 2 groups in patients treated with either EC or TC chemotherapy. However, we observed that incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was lower in patients treated with the TC regimen than patients treated with the EC regimen. By contrast, previous studies revealed that docetaxel had more hematological toxicity than doxorubicin.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In a phase III study, patients treated with TC suffered higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia than AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; 61% vs 55%),<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> while the NATT trial at our center also showed that incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was only 24% in patients treated with TC, which was close to this study.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> To analyze the reasons, we found that patients treated with TC in the NATT trial and our study both received dexamethasone prophylactically for anaphylactic reaction and body fluid retention. Meanwhile, dexamethasone could promote hematopoiesis and increase peripheral blood cell counts, which was the main treatment for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia caused by myelodysplastic syndrome and mononucleosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>As a consequence of myelosuppression, anemia and thrombocytopenia were also adverse events of chemotherapy.

Beyond that, incidences of other nonhematological toxicities in the TCM group were similar to those in the control group, and safety of DBD was verified.</p><p>Our study did not give us an exciting result that DBD could prevent myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy with lower expenses and fewer adverse effects. Reasons were complicated as DBD was not a single chemical drug but a traditional Chinese formula. One reason may be that dosage of DBD in our study was not high enough to prevent myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy. Besides, chemical components of DBD are complex and the truly effective component is still unclear, dosage of which may be very low, just as the artemisinin derived from <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> for antimalaria treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Beyond that, peripheral blood parameters were affected by various physiological, pathological, and physical factors.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In China, there are an abundance of traditional nutritional supplements and a variety of diets, which possibly affected our results. Another reason may be that we did not use DBD in selected populations dialectically as the original theory of TCM, which recommended us to treat patients with personalized medicine.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Of course, efficacy of DBD may not be as good as ancient books described, although some basic research revealed that DBD could promote hematopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in vivo and in vitro.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1534735416675952" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-1534735416675952"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our phase II clinical study demonstrated that DBD, a classical formula of TCM, failed to prevent myelosuppression in breast cancer patients treated with EC or TC chemotherapy.
