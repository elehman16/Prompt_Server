The modality of exercise that is most beneficial and economic for masses has now become the topic of research.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The conventional exercises (endurance exercises like walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling, etc), which give stress on cardiovascular and respiratory systems and test the responses of these systems, are very popular. On the other hand, ancient yogic exercises which have been claimed to benefit human body on multiple fronts are also getting popularity all over the world.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the focus is on the effect of yoga (asanas and pranayama) and swimming on the lungs as pulmonary function has been identified as a long-term predictor for overall survival rates as well as a tool in general health assessment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Both yoga and swimming have been reported to improve the pulmonary functions to a great extent as both the modalities involve physical activity as well as breathing exercise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Efficacy of different modules must be compared as practicing any one exercise module may not be feasible by different people. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to assess the beneficial effects of these exercises and to compare the improvements in the lung functions by these two modalities of exercises. Very few cross-sectional comparative studies between yoga and other endurance exercises have been published[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and there are no reports of prospective comparative studies. Therefore with an aim to study and compare the improvement of lung functions by yoga and swimming, well-planned, randomized comparative prospective study was undertaken.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study set up</title><p>The study was conducted in Department of Physiology in Post Graduate Research Laboratory in co-ordination with Yoga Centre and Municipal Swimming Pool.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study groups</title><p>Healthy males and females with normal physical examination and with sedentary occupations between 18 and 40 years of age were included in the study. The volunteers from the socio-cultural gathering of general populations were motivated to participate in the study by explaining plan of the study to them. The recruitment was purely on the voluntary basis. After screening and fulfilments of inclusion and exclusion criteria, volunteers were recruited in the study. Yoga group consisted of 41 subjects (<italic>n</italic>=41) out of which 16 were males and 25 females. Swimmer group comprised of 40 subjects with 18 males and 22 females. Volunteers had not been engaged in yoga practice or swimming nor were they doing any physical exercise at least during 3 years preceding the study as assessed by enquiring in detail. Smokers, alcoholics, subjects who were in non-sedentary occupations, post operative patients and subjects suffering from any hernia, pregnant females, subjects with history of any cardiovascular disorder, subjects with a history of respiratory tract infection symptoms during previous 6 weeks and subjects suggestive of any active respiratory disorder were excluded by thorough history and clinical examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The screening of subjects was done and clearance of Institutional Ethics Committee was obtained. After selection of the subjects, they were explained about the detailed plan of work and aim of present research project. The volunteers were briefed about the study protocol, they were motivated for the training and for compliance needed till the end of the study and written informed consent was obtained from them.</p><p>One hundred volunteers were divided into cohorts of 10 subjects each and were randomly (block randomization) assigned to undergo either yogic training or swimming for a duration of 12 weeks. Before the actual training period, baseline parameters were recorded in a single day for one cohort. The subjects of that cohort were motivated for the exercise regimen they had to follow during the entire 12 weeks period. After 12 weeks exercise by all ten subjects in that cohort, all the parameters were again studied. After baseline parameters were recorded for one cohort and the training started for that cohort, the next cohort was subjected to same treatment.</p><p>Out of the 100 subjects, 9 from the yoga group and 10 from the swimmer group dropped out in due course of the study. As subjects who dropped out were non-compliant, per protocol analysis method was used to analyze the data. Thus, at the end of the study, data of 41 subjects from yoga group and 40 subjects from swimming group was analyzed (characteristics of the population shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of both groups of intervention namely yoga and swimming</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-5-128-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The yoga group subjects were instructed not to practice any yogic technique other than the prescribed ones and swimmer group was advised to refrain from other physical exercises during the study. We supervised the subjects early in the morning (5.00&#x02013;6.00 a.m) during yoga classes and swimmers from 6.00&#x02013;7.00 a.m. every day during the training period. Participants of both the groups were allowed to do their routine activities during the study period.</p><p>The subjects were taught yogasanas and pranayamas and they practised the same, 6 days/week for 60 min daily, for a total duration of 12 weeks. Iyengar yoga techniques were followed by the yoga trainers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Different yogasanas (yogic postures) viz. tadasana, konasana, utkatasana, sarvangasana, halasana, chakrasana, padmasana, dhanurasana, makarasana, pashchimottanasana, vajrasana, virasana and shavasana were practiced for 40 min and pranayamic breathing exercises with purak, rechak and kumbhak, anulom-vilom, bhastrika, bhramari pranayam and kapalbhati were practised for 20 min. Swimming was practiced 6 days/week for 60 min daily. Swimming comprised freestyle in first 6 weeks (including training in first 2-3 weeks) and freestyle and breast stroke in last 6 weeks including 10 min of floating on the water. For novice swimmers, continuous swimming for 60 min is difficult; therefore, intermittent floating with deep slow breathing was introduced. It also helped to keep similarity with yoga group who practiced shavasana for 10 min (Lying still and relaxed with slow deep breathing). An important limitation of the methodology was inability to compare the intensities of two modalities of exercise during 12 weeks duration. This inability was because of the fact that unlike endurance exercise, intensity of yogic asanas and pranayama is not directly related with exercise and post-exercise heart rates.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Pulmonary function tests</title><p>On the day of recordings, the subjects were familiarized with the laboratory environment and their height and weight were recorded. Pre training (at the start of study) and post training (after 12 weeks of training) lung function measurements were done in the morning about 2 h after a light breakfast by single investigator. On the day of recording (both pre and post training), yoga or swimming was not done. All the lung function parameters viz. forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at the end of first second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), average forced expiratory flow rate during 0.2-1.2 L of FVC (FEF 0.2-1.2 L), average forced expiratory flow rate during 25-75% of FVC (FEF 25-75%), and maximal ventilatory volume (MVV) were recorded with computerized spirometer (Helios, Recorders and Medicare Systems Pvt. Ltd., Chandigarh, India). The recordings were done during 9.30 to 10.30 a.m. in sitting position by single investigator throughout the study for all the subjects. Recommendations and guidelines of American Thoracic Society for spirometry were followed to avoid measurement bias.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Percent predicted values were calculated using prediction equations for Indian population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the data obtained was presented group-wise by descriptive statistics using mean, and standard error of mean. For differences in sex-wise composition of two study groups, Chi-squared test was used. For each parameter in both yoga and swimming groups before and after training period of 12 weeks, data distribution was tested for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p><p>The paired data before and after the exercise for both yoga and swimming groups was tested by Student's paired &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test for parametric data with normal distribution and by Wilcoxon signed rank test for parametric data without normal distribution as well as for non-parametric data.</p><p>The change in different PFT parameters with exercise was studied by calculating delta i.e. difference in value before and after the exercise of both modalities. The percent change was also calculated for each parameter as percentage of change with respect to pre-exercise level of that parameter. Percentage increase or decrease in value of a parameter (delta) with yoga and swimming was also compared using unpaired &#x02018;t&#x02019; test for parametric data with normal distribution and using Mann-Whitney U test for parametric data without normal distribution as well as for non-parametric data.</p><p>The statistical significance was considered at probability value less than 0.05.</p><p>The statistical calculations were done using Data Analysis tool of Microsoft Excel and Systat 12 (Systat Software, Inc.

In few follow up studies, the duration of training and the age group of study population are also different. Most of the randomized controlled trials in yoga are therapeutic in nature and therefore done in some or the other diseased condition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Thus, the comparison of the values obtained in the present study with the previous studies is difficult. However, significant improvements in FVC, FEV1 and PEFR have been reported in young individuals previously by some authors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Pranayama, a yogic practice, has beneficial effects on respiratory efficiency. It includes various exercises which involve forceful inspiration to total lung capacity (TLC) and forceful exhalation to residual volume, and all maneuvers are done through nostrils, which offer resistance by means of decreased cross sectional area and turbulence. Breathing through one nostril in Anulom-vilom pranayama further increases the resistance. Higher peak expiratory flow rates and FEV1 could be explained due to better strengthening of respiratory muscles in yogis. By yoga practice respiratory apparatus is emptied and filled more completely and efficiently which is recorded in terms of increased forced vital capacity (FVC).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Yogic breathing creates more negative pressures in both abdominal and thoracic cavity during inspiration and moves the diaphragm more than its normal excursions and helps in efficient movement of diaphragm leading to improvement in vital capacity. Removal of undue tension from the skeletal muscles in yogasanas helps the thorax to relax better than before. All these practices seem to increase expiratory reserve volume (ERV) thereby increasing the vital capacity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Skeletal muscles control many crucial elements of aerobic conditioning including lung ventilation. Repeated inspirations to TLC and breath holdings as done during pranayama can lead to increase in the maximal shortening of the inspiratory muscles which has been shown to improve the lung function parameters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Yogis have significantly higher peak expiratory flow rates presumably due to respiratory muscle conditioning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Increase in MEP and MIP suggests that yoga training improves the strength of expiratory as well as inspiratory muscles. Yoga postures involve isometric contraction which is known to increase skeletal muscle strength.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In addition to improved respiratory muscle performance, increased FEV1 in yogic practitioners may be because of improved patency of airways.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Yoga with its calming effect on the mind can reduce and release emotional stresses, hereby withdrawing the broncho-constrictor effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Lung inflation near to total lung capacity is a major physiological stimulus for the release of lung surfactant and prostaglandins into alveolar space, which increases lung compliance and decreases bronchiolar smooth muscle tone, respectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>MVV improvement might be due to improvement in respiratory mechanism and strengthening of respiratory muscles and also due to regular practice of yogasanas and yogic breathing exercises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Breathing is automatically regulated by bulbopontine respiratory control mechanisms, which are further modified by suprapontine mechanisms. The pneumotaxic centre is supposed to relay suprapontine messages which promote voluntary inspiration and expiration. During daily practice of pranayamic breathing, the basic activity of bulbopontine complex may be modified in such a way as to slow down its rhythm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>A combined practice of several important asanas show considerable improvement in cardiorespiratory functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] These changes might be due to specific rehabilitative effects of yogic practices on different vital organs improving their microcirculation and thus improving their functions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Increased tolerance of respiratory centers to higher PCO<sub>2</sub> and low PO<sub>2</sub> is achieved with yogic exercises, particularly with different pranayamas. Short periods of conscious control of the rate and depth of breathing as a health-promoting exercise have claimed wide human interest. In performing yoga breathing, the subject while keeping his skeletal muscles relaxed and immobile can exercise a close, continuous voluntary control over his respiratory muscles. The subject may change his ordinary rate of 15-18 respirations/minute to 1-2 respirations/minute and reduce his ventilation volume a great deal. Also this drastically lengthens his duration of expiration. In some exercises, he can use extremely rapid, shallow breathing and in others he can make each successive breath nearly equal to his vital capacity. In these prolonged efforts at controlling his respiratory muscles, he is consciously and persistently over-riding the usual stimuli of respiratory centers. These overriding stimuli may alter the sensitivity of respiratory centers thereby increasing the breath holding time or decreasing the resting respiratory rate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Players have higher values of lung functions compared to those not playing any games. Exercise has a facilitating effect on the lungs. Especially swimmers have the highest value of lung capabilities amongst all the sportsmen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The ability of the individual to inflate and deflate the lungs depends upon the strength of the thoracic and abdominal muscles, posture of the individual and the elasticity of lungs. Swimming increases this ability because it is performed in horizontal position compared to the vertical position in other sports. Swimming involves keeping the head extended which is a constant exercise of the Erector Spinae muscle which increases the vertical and antero-posterior diameter of the lungs and the supraspinatus which increases the antero-posterior diameter of the lungs. The sternomastoid, trapezius and the diaphragm are also being constantly exercised. Ventilation is restricted during swimming which leads to intermittent hypoxia in every respiratory cycle for one moment or the other. This intermittent hypoxia sets up the anaerobic process by which lactic acid starts accumulating in the blood leading in &#x0201c;lactic oxygen deficit&#x0201d;. This leads to the stimulation of respiratory center in the medulla therefore increasing respiration. The resultant alveolar hyperplasia may be responsible in increasing FVC, VC and number of alveoli. FVC and FEV depend on the strength of the abdominal muscles which require prolonged exercise to hypertrophy. Highest improvement in VC, FVC and FEV occurs after swimming.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Swimming involves high pressure on the thorax from outside. So the respiratory muscles and the diaphragm are required to develop greater pressure as a consequence of immersion in water during the respiratory cycle, thus leading to functionally better respiratory muscles. Also the heat conductance of water is more than that of air. Regular swimming practice may tend to alter the elasticity of the lungs and the chest wall which leads to improvement in lung functions in swimmers. These factors when combined together play an important role in developing better lung functions in swimmers compared to other sportsmen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, yogic postures and pranayama as well as swimming improve the pulmonary functions significantly within 12 weeks. Somewhat better improvement in some of the parameters, particularly FVC, FEF 25-75% and MVV, seems to give an edge to swimming over the yoga for lung function improvements. However, the present study has important limitation of not comparing the effects of these modalities of exercise on other body functions. Moreover, other factors like cost effectiveness and ability of any exercise regime to keep continued motivation and interest of the trainees should also be taken into account for exercise prescription.</p><p>In developing and poor countries, the facilities for recreational exercise and sports are not easily available and many low socio-economic group people can not afford to utilize the available resources. Some individuals with physical constraints and for other reasons like lack of training may not be able to swim, though they can undergo some yogic training. In light of these facts, yogic exercise can become the most important way of lifestyle intervention and physical activity for prevention of many diseases as prescribed by World Health Organization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shimamoto</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Adachi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low impact aerobic dance as useful exercise mode for reducing body mass in mildly obese middle aged women</article-title><source>Appl Human Sci</source><year>1998</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>109</fpage><lpage>14</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khalsa</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Yoga as a therapeutic intervention: A bibliometric analysis of published research studies</article-title><source>Indian J Physiol Pharmacol</source><year>2004</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>269</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15648399</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schunemann</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dorn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Winkelstein</surname><given-names>W</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Trevisan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pulmonary Function is a long-term predictor of mortality in the general population: 29-year follow-up of the buffalo health study</article-title><source>Chest</source><year>2000</year><volume>118</volume><fpage>656</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10988186</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Meshram</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramtekkar</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Atheletes, yogis and individuals with sedentary lifestyle; Do their lung functions differ</article-title><source>Indian J Physiol Pharmacol</source><year>2007</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>76</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17877296</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pherwani</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Solepure</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A study of pulmonary functions of competitive swimmers</article-title><source>Indian J Physiol Pharmacol</source><year>1989</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>228</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2620964</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika</article-title><year>1995</year><publisher-loc>New York City</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Schocken Books</publisher-name><fpage>544</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Thoracic Society.
