Thirty patients each were assigned to NexGen LPS without and with navigation (groups 1 and 2), and 30 patients to navigation with the Stryker Scorpio PS (group 3). The navigation system used was the imageless Stryker KneeTrac, version 1.0.

Four implants had to be revised for early loosening or infection (4.4%). Four patients had died and three patients were not able to follow the invitation for clinical assessment.

Ten-year survival rates are reported to be higher than 90% in large patient series and registers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Long-term failure modes include wear, loosening and infection. More than 50% of revisions are performed within two years after surgery and a common reason is component malposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Especially malrotation of components is reported to be a common source for postoperative pain and revisions. Diagnosis of malrotation is challenging since it usually requires computed tomography <italic>(CT) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and bony landmarks (usually the femoral epicondyles) can provoke imprecision with and without navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Computer assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS, navigation) has developed in large extent with improvement of software and computers since its first description. Navigation of TKA may be performed based on CT-scans or image-free at equal radiological results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Today it finds its application in numerous orthopedic interventions. Navigation was successfully introduced into TKA to improve radiological accuracy of component position by avoiding position outliers in coronal and sagittal planes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this sense it has been proven an effective tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most studies were not able to give statements on rotational alignment, since no CT scans were conducted. Choong et al. reported on mean values of femoral rotation as measured on full-leg CT scans, which were not different between conventional and navigated TKA but did not mention, if rotational outliers could be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Higher accuracy of component position with navigation is supposed to increase long-term survival and function of the implants. Good coronal femoral alignment was reported to allow better function after TKA. The same study reported trends for better function with good sagittal and rotational femoral alignment and good sagittal and coronal tibial alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In some mid-term follow-up studies no functional differences were shown between navigated and conventional TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand Choong et al. reported that Computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty achieved greater accuracy in implant alignment, which correlated with better knee function and improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>This study was designed to assess the outcome of navigated TKA in comparison with conventional implantation. One focus was on clinical mid-term results, since numbers of publications in this field are still low. Secondly, the number of rotational outliers of both tibia and femur should be compared by pre- and postoperative CT-scans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In a prospectively randomized single-blinded approach, 90 patients with primary gonarthrosis were assigned to three different groups between August 2001 and December 2002. 30 patients received a conventional NexGen LPS without navigation (Group 1). Another 30 patients received a NexGen LPS with navigation (group 2) (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). In group 3, 30 patients underwent navigated TKA with the Stryker Scorpio PS (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics, New Jersey, USA). The study was approved by the institutional research board and the local ethics committee. It follows the Declaration of Helsinki principles.</p><p>Patients older than 50 years with primary osteoarthritis willing and able to give informed consent were included. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, history of local infections and gonarthrosis secondary to trauma were excluded. Randomization was done with a computer generated list under supervision of the institutional research board.</p><p>Clinical outcome was assessed prior to the operation, at 12 weeks, at one year and at minimum two years after index surgery by an independent observer who had not been involved in the procedures without knowledge of the patients' assignment. The following clinical parameters were assessed: Physical examination with the Knee Society Score (KSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], pain with visual analogue scale (VAS) according to Huskisson (VAS: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain), operation time, incision length, and length of hospital stay. Early and late complications were documented, too: bleeding, wound healing problems, deep infections, aseptic loosening, patella problems, stiffness, thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and abortion of navigation.</p><p>Radiographs and CT-scans were conducted prior to and 12 weeks after index surgery. Radiographs included the knee in two planes with a weight bearing anteroposterior view, and an axial view of the patella. The slope of the tibial plateau was assessed in the long lateral tibial view. The Scorpio prosthesis comes with a slope of 7&#x000b0; that is integrated into the PE inlay. Therefore, the ideal slope of the tibial resection is 0&#x000b0; for this implant. The NexGen implant comes with no intrinsic slope. Thus, the recommended slope of the tibial resection is 7&#x000b0;.</p><p>CT scans were performed over the knee joint as well as over the hip and the ankle of the same leg. This allowed assessment of the axis of the femoral neck, the transepicondylar axis, the tangent to the posterior femoral condyles, the axis of the tibial plateau and the axis of the ankle joint.</p><p>The leg axis was reconstructed from the CT data set. It allowed evaluation of the Mikulicz line and the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle expressing the mechanical axis of the leg. The mechanical lateral distal femur angle (mLDFA) is defined as the angle between the mechanical axis of the femur and the tangent to the distal joint line, measured on the lateral side of the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The medial proximal tibia angle (MPTA) was defined as the angle between the mechanical axis of the tibia and the tangent to the tibial plateau, measured on the medial side of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Postop the mechanical axis of the tibia was drawn between the middle of the tibial implant plateau and the center of the ankle.</p><p>At latest follow-up another series of radiographs was performed. Radiographs and CT-scans were assessed by two independent examiners. Consensus was sought, whenever results were divergent. Following the manufacturer's instructions, 90&#x000b0; for postop MPTA and mLDFA were considered optimal. In analogy to studies published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], radiological results were classified. For HKA, mLDFA and MPTA all results with a maximum deviation of 1&#x000b0; were categorized as ideal. Deviations &#x0003e; 3&#x000b0; were defined as outliers. For rotational alignment of femoral and tibial components, deviations of maximally 3&#x000b0; were regarded as ideal. Rotational deviations &#x0003e; 6&#x000b0; were considered as outliers as proposed by Jenny et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CT scans and X-rays were evaluated by an independent observer, who was blinded to the clinical information. This was an orthopaedic resident, who had not been involved into the surgical procedures.</p><p>Surgery was performed following the manufacturers instructions using conventional instrument trays through a medial parapatellar approach under general anaesthesia. All patients were operated by two authors of this publication (M. P. and J. S.) in a femur-first technique using conventional cemented posterior stabilized components in all cases, leaving the patella unresurfaced.</p><p>The applied navigation system was the imageless (CT free) KneeTrac (Stryker Howmedica Osteonics, New Jersey, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Software version 1.0 was applied throughout the study. This represents the first navigation system generation and the first software version by this manufacturer. The Stryker KneeTrac uses cordless, battery powered infrared light emitters that can be positioned on a variety of implements. Optical tracker pins are attached to the distal femur, the proximal tibia and to the pelvic rim by rotation screws. The latter requires an additional small incision. Bony landmarks, such as the femoral epicondyles are identified using a pointer. Implant positions are displayed on a computer and allow adjustment of cutting jigs in real time when necessary.</p><p>Continuous variables were displayed as mean and SD. Categorical data were given in absolute numbers. After checking for equal distribution by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, values were analyzed by independent student's t-test for comparisons between groups. For pre- and postoperative comparisons within the groups the dependent student's t-test was applied. Analysis of outliers and optimally implanted components was done with the chi-squared test. A p value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was supported by using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ninety knee joints of 89 patients were randomly assigned to the three groups (61 women, 28 men).

However, revision rates and survival of implants remained comparable in all groups without significant differences. Lower scores could be explained by longer incisions, more wound healing problems and longer operation time with navigation. In the early version of the Stryker navigation system three screws had to be inserted into the patients' bones: One at the pelvis, one at the distal femur and another one at the proximal tibia. To give enough room to avoid contact between the screws and the implants the skin incision had to be longer and also a second incision at the pelvis had to be made.</p><p>After 12 weeks, the navigated Scorpio group scored significantly lower in the KSS in comparison with navigated and conventional NexGen knees. This might be partially implant or procedure related. At the time of the study, the NexGen had been the primary implant at the author's institution for several years. However, also navigated NexGen scored significantly lower at mid-term in terms of function in comparison with conventional NexGen. At one year follow-up there were no significant clinical differences between conventional and navigated groups.</p><p>Incisions and operation time were longer with navigation. This did not lead to more perioperative complications such as infections or bleeding, as has been reported by other authors. Bonutti et al. reported a higher incidence of complications with navigation and attributed this to longer operative time and larger incisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the presented cohort, there were more cases of wound healing problems in the navigated groups without differences reaching statistical significance. A longer operation time with navigation in TKA has been shown by other authors (13 - 32 minutes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This might mainly be due to the navigation procedure itself (placement of screws, registration of anatomic landmarks). Navigation had to be abandoned in three cases. This implicates that the surgeon has to be capable to finish the operation without help of navigation.</p><p>Analysis of component rotation from CT-scans revealed no significant differences between navigated and conventional groups. With navigation, femoral and tibial rotation was optimal more frequently, but the number of outliers could not be reduced. This is in accordance with a recent publication that showed that the virtual individual rotational position of the femoral component using a CAOS system is significantly different from its position on a postoperative CT scan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In CT-less navigation the accuracy of the implantation depends on the exact identification of anatomic landmarks, which can be difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Also there can be errors due to the fixation of the pins or the reference trackers.</p><p>For the coronal alignment, navigation managed to increase the number of optimally positioned components and to avoid outliers for the femoral side in comparison with conventional TKA as expressed in the mLDFA. This was statistically significant. For the tibial coronal positioning, results showed no significant differences. While there were more outliers and less optimal implants with navigation in the NexGen group, navigated Scorpio showed favourable results in comparison with the conventional TKA without reaching statistical significance. Less coronal and sagittal component outliers with navigation have been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis of alignment outcomes for navigation vs. conventional TKA including 29 studies indicated significant improvement in component orientation and mechanical axis when CAOS is used in TKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Data on rotational malalignment remains scarce. Oberst et al. reported that analysis of the rotational position of the femoral component revealed no difference between navigated and conventional TKA. Group sizes were small and there was no information on tibial rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Chauhan et al. showed by post-operative CT significant improvement of rotational alignment of both components with navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. No differences were reported by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Results concerning component rotation remain inconsistent. Navigation's value for rotational alignment will have to be examined in larger patient series or by a meta-analysis.</p><p>The applied navigation system was not able to rule out all radiological outliers. The accuracy of navigation depends on several factors. Computer assisted instrumentation incorporates highly accurate measurement devices and results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This might be tampered by the accuracy, of which anatomic landmarks may be defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also the position of markers may accidentally change within the operation. Finally, measurements taken from x-rays and CT-scans inherit some inaccuracies, too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, it has to be considered that the KneeTrac Software version 1.0 was the first system and software version of this manufacturer. There has been a tremendous development of navigation techniques in recent years. The findings made with this system may differ from modern navigation in TKA.</p><p>The Stryker navigation system uses the epicondylar axis and the Whiteside line which were determined by the surgeon. The digitalization of the bony landmarks is one of the crucial steps in navigation. Problems of reproducibility with intraoperative termination of these landmarks have been described to especially appear with the femoral epicondyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The debate on how reliably these landmarks can be localized within surgery and assessed by computed tomography persists. A recent publication ruled out major inter- and intraobserver failure for the determination of femoral and tibial rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>No clinical benefits for navigation at short-term have been shown in other publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Kamat et al. showed no difference in clinical outcome measures between navigated and conventional TKA at 5 years in a large patient series. While malaligned knees showed worse clinical results they concluded that significant differences might develop at long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other studies could not show clinical differences at 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or at five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In one series, computer-assisted TKA achieved greater accuracy in implant alignment, which correlated with better knee function and improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Data on mid- and long-term follow-up remains scarce. In the presented series functional outcome was lower in the navigated group. More clinical studies at longer follow-up are needed to assess the value of navigation for functional outcome of TKA e. g. by means of meta-analysis.</p><p>There were no differences in patient demographics in between groups but nevertheless, there are some limitations to the presented study. Patient blinding of the randomization might have been tampered by the additional cut at the pelvic rim for one of the bone markers in the navigated group. TKA has been a successful intervention over the last decades at high patient satisfaction rates. Thus, remarkable improvement of outcome by new technologies might be hard to achieve and even harder to be proven. With 30 patients, group sizes remain small. Some of the differences discussed above might have become significant at larger patient numbers. The presented results should help to determine group sizes for future studies with bigger patient numbers for a more profound analysis e.g. of rotational alignment of components and clinical results.</p><p>To date there is little data on rotational alignment of TKA components in dependence of navigation. First generation navigation allowed slightly higher accuracy of both rotational and coronal component position, although differences failed significance for most of the assessed angles in the presented group size. However, this did not lead to superior clinical results in the applied scores. Functional results with navigation were even lower in comparison with the conventional procedure at mid-term follow-up. Key factor for the evaluation of an endoprosthetic procedure is the long-term survival of the implant. Thus, success of navigation has to be re-evaluated at a longer follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be stated, that significantly less radiological outliers with first generation navigation were found for coronal alignment of the femur, only. At minimum two years follow-up no beneficial effect for navigation in TKA could be shown assessing clinical data, as functional results in the presented series seemed to be lower after navigated TKA. Its clinical long-term value remains to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body Mass Index; CAOS: Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery; CT: Computer Tomography; HKA: Hip Knee Ankle Angle; KSS: Knee Society Score; mLDFA: mechanical Lateral Distal Femoral Angle; MPTA: Medial Proximal Tibial angle; TKA: Total Knee Arthroplasty; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JS Analysis and interpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript.
