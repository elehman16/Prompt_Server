In the age groups 35&#x02013;44, 45&#x02013;54, 55&#x02013;64, and 65&#x000a0;years and more, the prevalence of prediabetes increased from 9.0%, 11.2%, 13.9% to 19.9%, while diabetes was 4.3%, 16.7%, 24.4% and 19.0%, respectively. In the same SANHANES-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], a prevalence of 38.2% and 20.0% systolic and diastolic prehypertensive blood pressure, respectively, and 24.6% and 9.1% systolic and diastolic hypertension, respectively, in persons 15&#x000a0;years and above was found. In the age groups 35&#x02013;44, 45&#x02013;54, 55&#x02013;64, and 65&#x000a0;years and more, the prevalence of systolic prehypertension was 45.2%, 37.1%, 31.7% and 24.3%, respectively, and the prevalence of systolic hypertension was 21.9%, 39.2%, 50.5% and 63.7%, respectively. Elevated blood glucose and elevated blood pressure are prototype of preventable chronic cardiovascular disease risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Lifestyle interventions have been shown to ameliorate or prevent the progression of prediabetes and prehypertension to diabetes and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Such a non-pharmacological approach to primary prevention and disease interruption carries enormous public health significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Improving diet and physical activity can prevent type 2 diabetes among those at high risk in a very short time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In trials conducted in China, Finland and the USA, for example, study participants have significantly improved their diet and/or physical activity, and shown improved levels of blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides within one year of commencing a programme, with improvements continuing for at least six years. The incidence of diabetes was reduced by almost 60% in both Finland and the USA, and by over 30% in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Orozco et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] conclude that interventions aimed at increasing exercise combined with diet are able to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes in high risk groups (people with impaired glucose tolerance or the metabolic syndrome). Likewise, lifestyle modifications can reduce blood pressure and lower cardiovascular risk. Several clinical trials investigated the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications to reduce BP. Best evidence from randomized controlled trials supports BP-lowering effects of weight loss, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and dietary sodium (Na+) reduction in those with prehypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Established recommendations include weight loss, sodium reduction, and increased physical activity. PREMIER studied the effects of lifestyle interventions based on established recommendations alone and with the addition of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Participants with prehypertension or stage-1 hypertension were randomly assigned to an advice only control group, a 6-month intensive behavioural intervention group of established recommendations (EST), or an established recommendations plus DASH group (EST&#x02009;+&#x02009;DASH). Both EST and EST&#x02009;+&#x02009;DASH reduced the primary outcome variable, systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Maruthur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] studied the effect of PREMIER on estimated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and observed substantial reductions of 12% to 14% in estimated CHD risk, which have important public health benefits. M&#x000e1;rquez-Celedonio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also found in a study in Mexico that lifestyle modification decreased cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with prehypertension. Prehypertension, defined as blood pressure between 120-139/80-89&#x000a0;mmHg, is a major public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The condition is very prevalent (30% of the adult population), is often associated with other cardiovascular disease risk factors and independently increases the risk of hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The mechanism of elevated risk for cardiovascular events associated with prehypertension is presumed to be the same as that of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Hypertension recommended only lifestyle changes for most prehypertensive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>To have a significant public health impact, benefits of proven lifestyle interventions have to be translated into community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Evidence from a varied community, including church-based settings have shown that lifestyle interventions can be effective in lowering diabetes and hypertension risk. Ackerman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] found positive results in an implementation, evaluation of the delivery of a group-based Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP) lifestyle intervention in a community setting. Boltri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] describes the successful translation of the National Institutes of Health Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP) in African American churches. A 6-session modified DPP was associated with decreased fasting glucose and weight similar to the 16-session programme. Simmons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] was able to reduce risk factors for diabetes among Western Samoans in New Zealand based on a church-based programme. Likewise, Oexmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] describes a successful church-based approach to lifestyle change in cardiovascular disease risk in African Americans. The church is an important community intervention setting for health promotion in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There is a lack of evidence that such a community (church-based) lifestyle intervention to lower diabetes and hypertension risk is effective in an African setting. Therefore, a cluster randomized controlled implementation trial to control high normal blood pressure and/or high normal blood glucose in church members in South Africa is proposed. This proposed study will also identify culturally and regionally specific approaches (and constraints) to the translation of the key elements of the lifestyle arm of the Diabetes and Hypertension Prevention Programme, including a determination of the feasibility of and best models for the delivery of physical activity and dietary interventions in a community setting (churches).</p><sec><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The aim of this study is to study the efficacy of a community (church) -based lifestyle intervention programme to control high normal blood pressure and/or high normal blood glucose in church members in a randomized controlled trial in Gauteng, South Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>1.

Research assistant nurses will be trained for 1&#x000a0;week on risk factors, data collection and research process. They will screen church members in the church area (by putting up a tent with 4 sides wall), using a diabetes risk screen and blood pressure assessment after informed consent has been taken for study participation. Prehypertension will be defined as blood pressure between 120-139/80-89&#x000a0;mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Blood pressure (BP) is measured with a validated automated digital BP monitor (BpTRU) based on South African guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] three times at two different visits each, a week apart. Prediabetes is initially assessed with the Diabetes Risk Score Tool. The risk status is determined by a risk factor questionnaire developed on the basis of epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A score of 15 or more will be used as a recruitment criterion. High risk equals have an estimated one in three chance of getting the disease during the following 10&#x000a0;years. In the absence of a diabetes risk screen developed in an African population, the Finnish diabetes risk score (FINDRISC) questionnaire will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

In each church the lay health promoter(s) is expected to start and run 4&#x02013;5 support groups (6&#x02013;8 members per group) over the project period. The intervention model used is based on a Finnish diabetes prevention implementation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and includes components of the PREMIER study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Briefly, the programme consists of six two-hour group sessions facilitated by trained lay health promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. They will receive two weeks of training with a standardized training programme, training manuals, and practical exercises. The first five sessions will extend over 8&#x000a0;weeks, with 2-week intervals in between sessions. The last session will take place at 6&#x02013;8 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The sessions will be facilitated by specially trained lay health promoters, dieticians and physiotherapists. The group counselling sessions provide individuals with dietary and physical activity guidance based on the South African food-based dietary guidelines for adults (South African food-based dietary guidelines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and South African physical activity recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and self-regulation theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] are used to set individual goals and motivate participants to progress from intention to actual behaviour change to accomplish the diet and physical activity goals of the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Programme goals include seven specific goals related to diet and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The goals are: (1) no more than 30 per cent of total energy from fat; (2) no more than 10 per cent of total energy from saturated fats; (3) at least 15&#x000a0;g/1000&#x000a0;kcal fibre; (4) at least 30&#x000a0;min/day moderate intensity physical activity; (5) at least 5 per cent reduction of present body weight, (6) limit daily sodium intake to &#x02264;2400&#x000a0;mg per day and (7) the goal for alcohol intake was &#x02264;2 drinks/day for men and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1 drink/day for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

This will require the development of mechanisms for determining that adequate levels of competence have been attained by those who have received training and that their continuing performance does not fall below these levels. A random sample of group session interactions will be tape-recorded and analysed for that purpose. Feedback will be provided to the field work staff and protocol deviations or other problems addressed and corrected in a timely manner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study measures</title><p>The primary outcomes and measures include 1) the reduction in systolic blood pressure after the intervention and 2) the reduction in blood glucose levels after the intervention.</p><p>The secondary outcomes and measures include 1) anthropometric measures: body weight, height (for BMI) and waist-to-hip-ratio; body composition 2) lipid levels: total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides; 3) behavioural measures (diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol, weight and stress); and 4) blood lipid profiles.

If a group difference between a potentially confounding variable is observed at limit differences in a key outcome, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed with the potentially confounding variable serving as the covariant.

The integration of a lifestyle intervention for both the reduction of diabetes and hypertension risk and evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention in a community-based setting is both innovative and can facilitate research translation into primary health care practice. Moreover, this intervention utilizes community health workers to enhance lifestyle modification for the reduction of both diabetes and hypertension risk through group sessions, which can be easily adapted in real world settings. This study will present a new analysis of the effectiveness a community (church)-based lifestyle intervention programme to control high normal blood pressure and/or high normal blood glucose in a low and middle income setting. If data confirm our hypothesis, this may help policy makers to increase resources in prevention rather than treatment. It is important to consider that the study data will be collected from a real life community setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BP: Blood pressure; CHD: Coronary heart disease; DASH: Dietary approaches to stop hypertension; DPP: Diabetes prevention programme; FBS: Fasten blood sugar; IFG: Impaired fasting glucose; IGT: Impaired glucose tolerance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SP and KP were the main contributors to the conceptualization of the study and also contributed significantly to the first draft of the paper.
