Inclusion criteria for this study were teeth with single-rooted canals, the absence of resorption, root caries, cracks, and root length &#x0003e;15 mm. The teeth were stored in distilled water. These samples were placed in 5.25% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and washed under tap water. The samples were decoronated, and working length was standardized to 15 mm. The canals were prepared apically using 15 and 20 size K files. Root canal preparation was completed using ProTaper rotary files (S1, S2, F1, F2 and F3). Samples were irrigated with 5 ml of 5% sodium hypochlorite (Prime DentPro) and 5 ml of 17% ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) (Provest DentPro) after each change of file. Saline was used to stop the reaction of each irrigant. Obturation was done using sealer (AH-Plus; Dentsply DeTrey GmbH) and gutta-percha (Dentsply Mallifer) by single cone technique. An interim filling material (Cavit 3M ESPE) was used to seal the endodontic access cavities.</p><p>After the root canal treatment was completed, the roots were stored in gauze dampened with sterile saline for 24 h for the sealer to set. The root canal filling was removed at 10 mm depth with number 1 (0.70 mm) peeso reamer (Mani INC), and preparation was completed using drill number 1 (Hi Rem Endod Drill 201). After post space preparation, the specimens were divided into three groups according to the PSI procedure.</p><p>Group A &#x02013; Control group specimens were irrigated with 5 ml saline (0.9% sodium chloride W/V Nirlife) for 1 min.</p><p>Group B &#x02013; Specimens were irrigated with 5 ml of 5% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min followed by 5 ml of 17% EDTA for 1 min.</p><p>Group C &#x02013; Specimens were treated with a diode laser (Zolar Photon Plus) of 3 watts power. The laser was used in a continuous mode in the presence of 5% sodium hypochlorite for 20 s irradiation time of three cycles. After each cycle, sodium hypochlorite was replenished to compensate the vaporization of the solution.</p><p>All the specimens were irrigated with distilled water, After post space treatment, absorbent paper points were used to dry the root canals and self-adhesive resin cement (G Cem LinkAce, GC Pro) was used to lute the fiber posts of size 1 (Hi Rem Over Fiber Post 201) which were seated with light finger pressure. Self-adhesive resin polymerization was initiated using light emitting diode curing unit (Woodpecker LED. D) for 20 s and left for another 4 min for the material to set. After 24 h, the specimens were sectioned horizontally with a water cooled, low speed diamond disc (Premiere dental: Shofu INC). Three slices were obtained from apical, middle, and coronal region. Each slice of sample was standardized to 1 mm thickness. A push out test was applied to slices at 0.5 mm/min using 1 mm diameter metallic plunger in coronal third, 0.7 mm in middle third portions, and 0.5 mm in apical third portion from apical to coronal direction in all samples until the post dislodges from the tooth. A Jig was used to hold the slices in position. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the specimen preparation and jig apparatus. A computerized universal testing machine (Kalpak) was used to measure the maximum push out bond failure load in newtons (N). Maximum failure load was converted to megapascals for each post to its bonding area of each slice. The total bonding area was calculated using formula A= &#x003c0;(r + R) *h<sup>2</sup> + (R &#x02212; r) where R = coronal post radius, r = apical post radius, and h = slice thickness.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The post diameter at coronal and apical portion of each slice and thickness of dentin sections were measured using caliper. Statistical analysis one-way ANOVA of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test was performed to evaluate the statistical difference between experimental groups (&#x003b1; = 0.05) at different root thirds. Adhesive, cohesive, and mixed failure modes were evaluated with respect to each post space treatment protocol using stereomicroscope.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Post luted specimen cut in coronal, middle and apical third region with 1 mm thickness (b) Push out test apparatus and customized jig for holding the slices</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-197-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Push out results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Statistical analysis showed that both the PSI procedures and section level (root thirds) significantly affected the bond strength values. The interaction between these two factors was not significant. The samples treated with sodium hypochlorite and EDTA showed highest bond strength. The diode group showed lowest bond strength. For the root section level factor, there was a reduction in values from coronal to middle and apical thirds of all samples. The middle and apical third of all groups showed similar bond strength values with no statistically significant difference among them (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). The failure mode analyzed using stereomicroscope displayed cohesive failure at dentin in the saline group. A prevalence of mixed failure at post-cement-dentin interface was found. Failure pattern was similar among all the groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Chart 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Push out bond strength based on post space treatment techniques at different root sections (Mean&#x000b1;standard deviation)*</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-197-g002"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Chart 1</label><caption><p>Failure mode represented in percentages with respect to Post space irrigation treatment technique</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPBS-9-197-g003"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the bond strength after different post space treatments at different levels of root sections (apical, middle, and coronal third). Push out bond strength is evaluated as it depicts the polymerization stress at the dentin cement interface. The test was performed to mimic dentin cement interface failure. Push out test is more reliable for testing the bond strength of post cement interface due to premature failure in specimen preparation and large data distribution spread linked with micro tensile testing.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>EDTA and sodium hypochlorite group had better efficacy than diode laser and the Sodium hypochlorite group. This is due to the use of EDTA as a final irrigant. This finding coincides with studies done previously. It improves penetration into the dentinal tubules by removing smear layer. EDTA reacts with calcium ions in dentin and forms water soluble calcium chelates. It also causes dentin demineralization and allows penetration of resin monomers.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Diode laser of 980 nm is absorbed more by water, whereas 810 nm is absorbed by melanin so it dehydrates the dentin water.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Diode laser helps in disinfection of root canal and produces acid etch like appearance.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The diode laser does not enhance bond strength. This finding is similar to that of several studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This is against the finding of the study done by Maenosono <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in which he used diode laser with low power watts. In the present study, temperature is one of the factors, which affect the bond strength of fiber post. The use of diode laser at 3 weeks for 20 s of three cycles increases the temperature of the dentin.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Laser melts the dentinal tubules and vaporizes the irrigating solution. Use of NaOCl as a final irrigant produces free oxygen radicals which inhibit the vinyl free radicals produced in the light activation of adhesives which consequently affects the initiation and propagation of addition polymerization.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Sodium Hypochlorite when used as final irrigant, shows no difference in bond strength when compared with non-oxidizing agents according to Morris <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Bond strength values were varied at different section levels. This can be due to different tubule density of dentin at different regions of roots, as well as technical sensitivity and difficulty in applying adhesives to post space, limited light transmission to narrow post space.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Diode laser at the apical third showed less bond strength. This can be due to the positioning of the optic fiber, which concentrates continuous power delivery at the apical portion. The most likely explanation for low resistance to post dislodgement at apical portion of all samples relies on the decreasing effect of curing light at a greater distance and difficulty in moisture control causing incomplete infiltration of adhesive agent. Moreover, coronal part is easily accessible, easier to etch, and apply adhesive agents. Different types of defects such as bubbles, bonding defects, polymerization defects, and cement residues were observed in the post space in other studies[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] on using different irrigating solutions. The traces of gutta-percha and cement residues remain at apical thirds after post space preparation.</p><p>Self-etch adhesives are claimed to require smear layer for proper bonding to dentine. In contrast, Cecchin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] concluded smear layer removal is necessary for better penetration of self-etch adhesive cements into dentinal tubules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The present study displayed that bond strength of fiber post is affected by post space treatment techniques at various section levels. Use of diode laser does not improve bond strength. Low-level pulsed diode laser can be used only as an adjuvant to other techniques for vaporizing the traces of gutta-percha and cement traces at inaccessible apical third regions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mariasevera Di</surname><given-names>Comite</given-names></name><name><surname>Crincoli</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Fatone</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ballini</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapone</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Quantitative analysis of defects at the dentin post space in Endodontically treated teeth</article-title><source>Materials</source><year>2015</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>268</fpage><lpage>83</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Belwalkar</surname><given-names>VR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gade</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mankar</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of the effect of shear bond strength with silane and other three chemical presurface treatments of a glass fiber-reinforced post on adhesion with a resin based luting agent.
