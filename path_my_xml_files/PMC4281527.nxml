Patients had one or two of the following characteristics: a positive Gram's stain of the sputum, 2 or more exacerbations in the previous year, a decrease in lung function of <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>200&#x02005;mL and <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>12%. Patients received amoxicillin clavulanic acid (500/125&#x02005;mg three times daily) or placebo for 7&#x02005;days, always combined with a course of prednisolone (30&#x02005;mg/day) for 7&#x02005;days. Primary outcome was duration of the exacerbation. Additionally, we measured severity of the exacerbation, health-related quality of life, sputum parameters, number of relapses within 28&#x02005;days and the number of re-exacerbations within 4&#x02005;months after the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no difference observed in time to resolution of the exacerbation between the two groups (HR=1.12; (95% CI 0.5 to 2.3; p=0.77)), nor in any other treatment parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We detected no evidence for the effectiveness of addition of antibiotics to prednisolone for COPD exacerbations of moderate severity and with intermediate probability of bacterial infection in this underpowered study.

Their use remains controversial due to several reasons. First only approximately one-third of AECOPD are due to bacterial infections.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Second, given the existence of bacterial infections, the treatment is empirical since culture and resistance results usually take 1&#x02005;week to become available. Third, growing resistance against antibacterial agents is an additional reason to be reluctant to give a prescription of antibiotics.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Finally and perhaps most importantly, there is no definitive evidence that antibiotics offer benefits in outpatients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The latest international guidelines recommend antibiotics to patients with AECOPD who have three cardinal symptoms (increase in dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence); patients who have two of the cardinal symptoms, if increased purulence of sputum is one of the two symptoms; or to patients who require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These criteria originated from the study by Anthonisen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which showed only a marginal benefit from antibiotics in a subgroup of patients. They divided AECOPD into three categories and concluded that in case of the presence of all three of the above mentioned criteria (type I) the cause of the AECOPD is probably bacterial and is more likely to have a favourable outcome with antibiotics.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, most placebo-controlled antibiotics trials, on which these guidelines are based, have important limitations and are difficult to compare because of different definitions of COPD and AECOPD, and different end points that have been used.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, these trials were conducted several decades ago, before systemic steroids were widely introduced for the treatment of AECOPD.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref> Even in the recently published study by Llor <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in which a beneficial effect with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo was observed, only 17% of the patients were treated with systemic steroids.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Furthermore, as stated in the Cochrane Review of Vollenweider <italic>et al</italic>, when the analyses on the effects of antibiotics are restricted to currently used drugs, antibiotics do not significantly reduce treatment failure in outpatient AECOPDs.</p><p>Van der Valk <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> reported that an Anthonisen type I AECOPD did not predict a bacterial origin of an outpatient's AECOPD and that sputum purulence was poorly associated with bacterial infection. This study did, however, found that the combination of a positive Gram's stain of sputum, a clinically relevant lung function decrease and <underline>&#x0003e;</underline>two AECOPDs in the previous year were 67% predictive for a bacterial origin of the AECOPD and therefore, postulated to warrant antibiotic treatment. The absence of all three characteristics gave a negative predictive value of 100% for a non-bacterial origin, suggesting to abstain from administering the antibiotics.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This leaves patients with one or two of these characteristics. Therefore, in the current double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of an antibiotic on the duration and severity of AECOPDs in outpatients with one or two of the three mentioned characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with COPD were recruited from May 2005 till January 2007 from the outpatient pulmonary clinic of Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to either the intervention or control group based on a computer generated randomisation list. The hospital pharmacy provided both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo in identical containers with identical capsules. Based on the randomisation list, the hospital pharmacy sequentially numbered the containers with both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo. This list was kept in a safe at the hospital pharmacy throughout the course of the study. Patients received these numbered containers in sequence of randomisation, which was recorded on a medication distribution list.</p><p>Patients in both groups received oral prednisolone, 30&#x02005;mg/day for 7&#x02005;days. Patients in the intervention group additionally received oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 500/125&#x02005;mg three times daily for 7&#x02005;days, while control patients received a matching placebo. The choice for this amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is based on the negligible prevalence of organisms resistance in our region (less than 5%). All patients continued their prescribed inhaled regimen. Patients were followed for 28&#x02005;days for the primary outcome and for 4&#x02005;months to detect new AECOPDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the duration of the AECOPD.

Also no difference in severity, number of relapses, number of AECOPDs 4&#x02005;months after the study or HRQoL was observed. These conclusions apply only to patients with one or two of the following characteristics: a positive Gram's stain of sputum, a clinically relevant lung function decrease, and two or more AECOPDs in the previous year.</p><p>As detailed in the introduction, there is a paucity of good placebo-controlled studies on the effect of antibiotics in AECOPDs in addition to the treatment with systemic steroids.</p><p>Though there are large differences in prescription routines between and within countries, many physicians tend to err on the &#x02018;safe&#x02019; side and therefore, also give antibiotics. In the current trial too we observed that 66% of the patients would have been treated with antibiotics by their physician. This routine has implications for costs, adverse effects and for the surge in antibiotic resistance<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> especially. Therefore, evidence needs to be established also in the group with less severe AECOPDs.</p><p>Anthonisen <italic>et al</italic> performed post hoc analyses stating that type I AECOPDs were likely to be bacterial and have a more favourable outcome with antibiotics. They stated that antibiotics confer no benefit in type III AECOPDs and that treatment of type II AECOPDs with antibiotics probably could be justified in case of antibiotic tolerance.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A remarkable finding in our study was that a bacterial infection was present in only 15 (56%) of the 27 type I AECOPDS. Additionally, although 15 (83%) and 12 (71%) of the AECOPDs in the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the placebo group, respectively, were type I Anthonisen, no effect from antibiotics was observed. These results give food for thought about the effectiveness of antibiotics in this type of AECOPD. The main difference between the study by Anthonisen and ours is the concomitant use of prednisolone, which is the standard recommendation nowadays. In the Anthonisen study only 42% received systemic steroids. The authors state that the success rate with antibiotics was favourable in both steroid and non-steroid users, but no data are provided. We believe that room for improvement by antibiotics will generally be less in patients treated with prednisolone, certainly in those with less severe AECOPDs.</p><p>Besides the type of Anthonisen AECOPD, we also measured PCT since this has been shown to be a marker of systemic bacterial infection.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>In the study of Stolz <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> PCT was also elevated at hospitalisation for AECOPD. One study suggested that PCT can be used as criterion for decisions on whether to start antibiotics.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, this could not be reproduced in another study.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In our study, in which instead of hospitalised AECOPD patients, outpatients with an AECOPD were included, we observed that 20 (57%) of our patients with an AECOPD experienced a bacterial infection but that only 2 (6%) had a PCT level between 0.1 and 0.25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L, which indicates possible bacterial infection. None of the patients had a PCT level &#x0003e;0.25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L which suggests the presence of bacterial infection. Therefore, our results suggest that PCT is not an informative biomarker as a criterion for decisions on whether to start antibiotics in outpatient AECOPD with an intermediate probability of infection.</p><p>In this study we observed that even though 57% of the patients experienced a bacterial infection, antibiotics had no added value in these patients. Although this suggests refraining from administering antibiotics in outpatient AECOPDs, this inference should not be generalised from our data to all outpatients, since our patients were selected for not having a high probability of bacterial infection.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We believe, however, that our results merit a supplementary randomised, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a high probability of an AECOPD of bacterial origin.</p><p>In our additional analyses, we observed that the large majority of patients on antibiotics thought they had received placebo (79%) which was very similar to the percentage in the group that really received placebo (82%). This suggests that the patients were not aware of any effect that could be caused by the antibiotics.</p><p>An important limitation of this study is the number of patients included. Based on our power calculation, we needed to include 58 patients to be able to detect a difference of 3&#x02005;days in AECOPD duration between the treatment groups. We were able to include only 35 patients within the time allotted. The majority of patients were not eligible due to: their participation in the COPE II study,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>an AECOPD or use of antibiotics or prednisolone 4&#x02005;weeks prior to enrolment or their inability to produce a spontaneous sputum sample. However, with the observed HR of 1.12 and the median time to resolution of 10&#x02005;days in the control group, the required sample size would be 2450 patients. With this enormous number of patients we might have found a significant difference, but we suggest that this difference would not be clinically relevant. We, therefore, feel that the lack of effect of antibiotics is not completely based on not including 58 patients. We should, however, realise that due to the smaller number of patients included, the probability of a type II error &#x02013; not rejecting the null hypothesis in case of a difference between arms &#x02013; in this study will be higher than the 20% based on the power of 80%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this underpowered, randomised, placebo-controlled study observed no added value of treatment with antibiotics in outpatients with moderate to severe AECOPDs and intermediate probability of infection. Instead of more equivalence trials comparing two antibiotics, we need more placebo-controlled studies to determine whether we can properly define subgroups of COPD outpatients in which antibiotics indeed are of additional value and in whom there is no use at all.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Research Department of Thermofischer, Hennigsdorf, Berlin, for supplying the PCT kits and the use of the Kryptor.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MB-K participated in designing the study, data-collection and data management, analyses and interpretation of data and writing the article.
