EG participated in a 16-week aerobic exercises (four 60-min sessions per week at 70-85% of HRmax (maximum heart rate)), in addition to the school physical education. Fat-Free Mass (FFM) and Fat Mass (FM) were assessed with bioelectrical impedance equipment. To assess aerobic capacity, maximal metabolic equivalent of task (METmax) and maximal workload (Wmax) were estimated with an electronically braked cycle ergometer (type Ergoline 500<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>At baseline, there were no differences between the two groups.

Exercise training significantly decreased FM only in the EG. A significant increase in FFM was seen in both groups; more marked in the EG.

Its main findings are that our physical training program was able to improve both body composition and aerobic capacity parameters in the obese children.</p><p>In order to keep the program varied, interesting and fun, yet able to provide adequate aerobic benefits and to improve adherence by the children, we incorporated short duration games and different sporting activities. Obese children may find lack of variety in the long duration aerobic-based activities, and therefore reluctant to continue exercising on a routine basis in effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Since we conducted a feasibility study, we assured that all children participating in the training program had been exposed to a substantial physical training dose.</p><p>In this study, there was significant decrease in BMI and WC in the EG after intervention without diet intervention. Observational studies consistently showed that greater activity is associated with lower BMI and girth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In contrast, other interventions were unable to improve such parameters.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] One reason for this failure is that more activity leads to higher calorie consumption, offsetting any gains in energy expenditure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Therefore, BMI improvement may be attained through a combined approach or with the interventions that aim to improve diet rather than physical training alone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] However, this hypothesis seems inconsistent with our results, given that our participants were advised not to change their dietary habits during the study period. Alternative explanations could be lack of adherence to the intervention or that exercise intervention may simply replace an equally habitual activity spent by children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>BMI; as a measure of body composition; has well-known limitations, given that it reflects both fat and fat-free components of body weight.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] It is possible that PA could increase lean muscle mass and decrease fat component with no overall change in BMI. Despite these limitations, BMI is the most consistently reported measure of body composition. In addition, elevated BMI in children is associated with increased metabolic abnormalities, as well as development of coronary artery disease and increased all-cause mortality later in life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>Our exercise program resulted in a significant decrease in FM and a significant increase in FFM in the EG.

The treatment of obese children should aim at decreasing FM, avoiding loss of FFM, ensuring adequate growth and development, and preventing cyclic weight regain. Notably, a decrease in FFM can result in subsequent reduction in basal metabolic rate, which then becomes a major risk factor for weight gain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]</p><p>In contrast, Treuth <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] demonstrated significant increases in weight, FFM, FM, and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue in growing obese prepubertal girls undergoing a strength training program, whereas intra-abdominal adipose tissue remained unchanged.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, a recent study showed that a 12-week controlled resistance exercise program; increased weight, lean body mass, and hepatic insulin sensitivity in 12 obese adolescents, with no effect on the metabolically active fat tissue (visceral, hepatic, and intramyocellular).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] Therefore, body fat distribution, rather than total fat mass or fat excess should be of importance in obese children.</p><p>Reduced values of cardiopulmonary exercise performance and lower aerobic fitness have been reported in obese children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] Our results showed significant improvement in the METmax, Wmax, and HRmax in the EG.
