The
incidence of geriatric conditions such as insomnia and depression among the elderly in care
facilities is high compared to the elderly living at home. Also, health problems such as
stress, depression and sleep disorders among the elderly in care facilities are more severe
than among the elderly living at home<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The proportion of the elderly complaining of sleep disorders while living at home is
23.7%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, compared to 41.7% for the
elderly living in care facilities, indicating poor quality of sleep<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The above statistics show that the elderly in care
facilities have severe sleep disorders caused by psychological depression that is worse than
that of the elderly living at home. Therefore, this suggests that aggressive efforts to
treat the elderly in care facilities is required.</p><p>The WHO reported that physical activities are the most important factor affecting the
health and fitness of the elderly, and physical activities have positive effects on the
quality of life of seniors<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, there
is a research that shows the quality of sleep of the elderly performing regular exercise is
good, and that the quality of night sleep correlates significantly with activities during
the day. Therefore, researchers have emphasized the importance of physical activity for the
elderly<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A representative muscle
relaxing method is stretching. Stretching can be performed as a collective exercise to
increase flexibility. Stretching enables the body to move efficiently with breathing in a
stable state of mind, by widening the range of motion of joints and increasing the muscle
length<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to verify the effects of sittercise on depression and sleep
disorders of the elderly, since sittercise is a therapy that can be safely and easily
performed in a sitting position without limitations of time and place by the elderly in a
nursing home.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 100 residents of a nursing home. The subjects were divided into two
groups of 50, with the consent of their guardians, the participants, as well as other
concerned parties. The subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed
sittercises, and a control group which did not. We used a non-equivalent control group
design because it was impossible to randomly allocate the subjects to the experimental and
control groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">Group factor</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental </th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43</td><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65&#x02013;70 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td align="center" rowspan="4" colspan="1">98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70&#x02013;75 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75&#x02013;80 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;80 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Medical treatment period (years) </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;3 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="center" rowspan="4" colspan="1">98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02013;5 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02013;8 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;8 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">Educational level</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51</td><td align="center" rowspan="4" colspan="1">98</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Junior high school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">University graduate</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>). The experimental group participated in the sittercise program three times a
week for 8 weeks. The control group did not participate in the sittercise therapy. The
research tools used in this study were structured questionnaire-based self-assessments. All
experiments were reviewed and approved by the Committee of Chungnam National University.</p><p>The sittercise therapy used in this study was developed by Billy Gober in 1982. Sittercise
is a kind of sedentary stretching<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
designed for the elderly using wheelchairs because of walking disability.</p><p>This study used a Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDSSF-K)+,
which is an abridged version of the Geriatric Depression Scale adapted for Koreans<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The GDSSF consists of 15 items and is a
simplified version of the (Geriatric Depression Scale) which has 30 questions. The GDSSF-K
has a total of 15 questions with &#x0201c;Yes/No&#x0201d; responses which are scored 0 or 1, and has a
maximum possible score of 15 points. A higher score means higher depression. It&#x02019;s
reliability was verified in this study, and it had a Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.781.</p><p>The Korean sleep scale<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to
measure sleep disorder. It is a modified version of the tool developed by
Snyder-Halpern<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It measures the sleep
state over one week, and the Korean sleep scale consists of 15 questions, and the answers
are scored using a four-point Likert scale. The range of scores is from 15 points to 60
points, and a higher score means that the sleep state is satisfactory. The reliability of
this tool was assessed in this study, and had a Cronbach &#x003b1; = 0.816. The sittercise program
was composed of stretching, warm-ups, near-aerobic activities, and cool-down. Directly
related to the program used in this study is the US Butterfield Trail Village Retirement
Community (Faytteville, Arkansas) content. The sittercise program procedure consisted of
week 1: breathing (abdominal) with upbeat music, raising the arms up and down, light uphill
walking, and breathing; week 2&#x02013;3: breathing (abdominal) with music, moving the arms and legs
to the left, and breathing; week 4&#x02013;8: breathing (abdominal) with music, moving the arms and
legs to the left, arm and leg movement, neck, chest, back stretching, pelvis and leg
stretching, and breathing.</p><p>The subjects were evaluated at pre- and post-intervention. The SPSS 14.0 statistical
program was used for data processing and statistical analysis. Data were subjected to the
t-test and multiple regression analysis in order to determine the significance of changes in
the degree of depression and sleep disturbances between before and after the stretching
program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The result of GDSSF-K for each group are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>The depression results</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Group</th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Mean&#x000b1;SD)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Mean&#x000b1;SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.3&#x000b1;0.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.9&#x000b1;0.1*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.8&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.1&#x000b1;0.01</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.1&#x000b1;0.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.05&#x000b1;0.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

Chi training for elderly women to reduce tension, anger, and depression<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical activity, was also effective as replacement
therapy for medication provideing some comfort and improvement in depression<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regular exercise three times a week performed by the elderly in a Longitudinal Study of
Depression Status was reported to have lowered depression three years after the
intervention.</p><p>Relaxation therapy and guided imagery therapy including stretching for 12 weeks for the
elderly who suffered from osteoarthritis reduced depression and improved the quality of life
of the experimental group. The results of that study can assist in promoting increased
comfort<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The study conducted
stretching with upbeat music and familiar songs as a background. Participation in sports
with an emphasis on fun and sociability with peers participating in the program, to create
enjoyment was helpful in spiritual terms.</p><p>In another study, a group that participated in stretching reported greater reduction in
sleep disorders than the control group. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy for patients
with depression reduced anxiety, and had a positive effect, similar to the present study,
which carefully measured depression. The results for sleep induction and sleep disorders
suggest that there were effective improvements<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A substance abuse group comprised of 28 women in a care facility performed progressive
muscle relaxation therapy, 30 minutes a day for five days. The progressive muscle relaxation
therapy was performed with the subjects&#x02019; preferred background music, and the quality of
sleep in the experimental group was reported to improve<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two meta-analysis studies of behavioral therapy research, provided
support for the efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation therapy<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, improving
sleep disorders<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching exercise
performed for three to four weeks by elderly cancer patients resulted in significant
improvements in their quantity and quality of sleep. Elderly insomnia patients were
instructed to perform a self-assessment for 6&#x02013;8 weeks of quality of sleep and were treated
with relaxation therapy<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the relationship between sleep and depression in the elderly, one study reported
there is a negative correlation, which was consistent with the findings of the present
study<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it appears that
at 65&#x02005;years of age, there is a negative correlation between depression and the length of
