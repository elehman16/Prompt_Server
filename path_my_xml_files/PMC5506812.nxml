However, this regimen has been shown to be associated with lesser compliance and higher toxicities. Hence, there is a need to explore alternative concurrent cisplatin regimens.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objectives:</title><p>The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicities of 3 weekly cisplatin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Patients and Methods:</title><p>This phase IIb trial randomized 56 patients with Stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx to Arm A or Arm B. Arm A received cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> 3 weekly and Arm B received cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly concurrently with radiation. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) and secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and acute toxicity. DFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and log-rank test was used to assess the difference in these distributions with respect to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>The 2-year DFS in Arm A and Arm B was 64.5% and 52.8%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.67). The OS at 2 years was 71% and 61.1% in Arm A and Arm B, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.61). There were no significant differences in acute hematological, renal, or mucosal toxicities between the two arms.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study showed a nonsignificant improvement in DFS and OS in the 3 weekly cisplatin arm over the weekly arm with comparable toxicities.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB-01-2013/10) and the Ethics Committee (HEC No-05/2010). The trial is registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI no: CTRI/2013/05/003703).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients who met all the following criteria were included in the study: (1) Previously untreated patients with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, (2) age in the range of 18&#x02013;70 years, (3) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, (4) baseline hemoglobin &#x02265;10 g/dl, white blood cells count &#x02265;4000 cells per cubic millimeter, platelet count &#x02265;100,000 cells per cubic millimeter, and (5) creatinine clearance of &#x02265;60 ml/min. The creatinine clearance was determined from 24 h urine sample and serum creatinine value. Patients with bone or cartilage involvement and with distant metastasis were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>Out of the 78 patients screened, 56 were eligible for randomization. Patients were randomized into either Arm A or Arm B using a computer-generated randomization chart. Patients in Arm A received cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> 3 weekly and patients in Arm B received cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly concurrently with radiation. All patients received radical radiotherapy, 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment</title><p>Patients were immobilized using head and neck thermoplastic cast and were treated with conventional technique. Primary and upper neck was treated with lateral parallel-opposed pair with multileaf collimator-shaped fields and the lower neck was treated using anterior field. All patients were treated with 6 MV photons using conventional fractionation, 200 cGy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 days/week. The gross tumor received a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks. Involved neck nodes were treated to 60&#x02013;66 Gy in 30&#x02013;33 fractions whereas uninvolved neck received 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Spinal cord shielding was given after 40 Gy. Posterior neck was treated with electron boost, delivering 60&#x02013;66 Gy to involved nodal areas and 50 Gy to uninvolved nodes.</p><p>Cisplatin was administered concurrently with radiation either weekly or 3 weekly according to the randomization. For 3 weekly cisplatin, 1000 ml normal saline (NS) with 20 mmol potassium chloride (KCl) and 10 mmol magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) followed by 200 ml 10% mannitol were given as prehydration. This was followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 1000 ml NS. Posthydration consisted of 1000 ml NS with 20 mmol KCl and 10 mmol MgSO<sub>4</sub>. For 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin, 500 ml NS and 200 ml 10% mannitol were given as prehydration followed by cisplatin in 1000 ml NS. Posthydration consisted of 500 ml oral fluids.</p><p>Antiemetic prophylaxis consisted of 8 mg ondansetron, 12 mg dexamethasone as intravenous bolus, and NK1 antagonist 125 mg orally on the day of chemotherapy. Dexamethasone 8 mg per day and NK1 antagonist 80 mg were continued on the second and third days after each cycle. The entire treatment was administered on an outpatient basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Dose modification</title><p>Cisplatin was delayed until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reached 1500/cu mm and platelet count reached 100,000/cu mm. If the ANC or platelet count remained below the above cutoff values on two occasions taken 2 days apart, that cycle of chemotherapy was omitted. Cisplatin dose was modified to 75% in cases of creatinine clearance value between 45 and 59 ml/min. 50% dose reduction was given for creatinine clearance values between 30 and 45 ml/min, and cisplatin was omitted for creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Toxicity assessment during treatment</title><p>All patients were monitored weekly during the course of chemoradiation for the assessment of mucositis, dermatitis, dysphagia, vomiting, hematological parameters, renal function tests, and body weight. Radiotherapy toxicities were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading, and chemotherapy toxicities were graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria-Adverse Events version 4.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Assessment of response</title><p>After completion of treatment, the first follow-up was done at 1 month and subsequently the follow-up was done at three monthly intervals. Response was assessed at 3 months of completion of treatment. Clinical examination and endoscopic evaluation were done for all patients. Those patients with clinical complete response were not subjected to further imaging. Patients with residual disease were considered nonresponders and their response was assessed using the RECIST criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and acute toxicity. Since this was designed to be a phase II study and due to the paucity of similar studies, no predetermined sample size was calculated. It was decided to randomize 100 patients from June 2013 to May 2014. However, only 56 patients could be accrued during this study period. DFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of recurrence or death. OS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death or last follow-up. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to estimate OS and DFS, and the log-rank test was used to assess differences in these distributions with respect to treatment. The difference in cisplatin dose intensity in Arm A and Arm B was analyzed using Chi-square test. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were employed to test the proportions of acute toxicity differences. All tests were two-sided, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>From June 2013 to May 2014, 56 patients were randomized.
