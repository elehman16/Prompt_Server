plantar pressure in patients with plantar fasciitis. [Subjects] The 30 patients in this
study were randomly allocated to a low-dye taping group (n = 15) or a conservative
treatment group (n =15). [Methods] Both groups received treatment thrice a week for six
weeks. BioRescue was used to measure the weight distribution of the patients&#x02019; paretic
side. [Results] Within-group comparison showed that the posterior weight distribution
significantly increased among patients in both groups. However, comparison between the two
groups showed that the low-dye taping group&#x02019;s posterior weight distribution was
significantly higher than that of the conservative treatment group. [Conclusion] These
findings show that the application of low-dye taping is an effective intervention for
paretic-side plantar pressure among patients with plantar fasciitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Plantar fasciitis</kwd><kwd>Low-dye taping</kwd><kwd>Plantar pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The plantar fascia is a hard membrane that connects the heel bone and the toes, and has a
thick structure with bonding strength. It plays a complex role in the protection and support
of the foot itself, but is also important for support of body weight by the foot<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Plantar fasciitis is a condition caused by
repetitive and excessive tensile stress applied to the plantar fascia, which leads to
fibrosis and inflammatory and degenerative changes. It can develop in those who perform
excessive exercise all of a sudden. In fact, there are several well-characterized causes of
plantar fasciitis: a flat foot, a supinated foot, a tight Achilles tendon, and other
conditions that reduce the shock-absorbing power of the feet<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Conservative treatment methods for plantar fasciitis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
analgesics, local steroid injections, plantar heel cushions, injections with botulinum
toxin, insoles, heel cushions, and assistive devices<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, such treatment methods have
limitations. They cannot correct the posture of the foot area or apply plantar pressure that
is suitable for an individual patient&#x02019;s condition. For such patients, low-dye taping is a
conservative treatment method, first devised by Dr. Ralph Dye, which can be used for plantar
fasciitis patients who have excessive pronation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low-dye taping reduces excessive pronation by fixing the subtalar
joint axis, which corrects the aforementioned associated problems of plantar fasciitis.
Numerous papers have demonstrated the short-term use of low-dye taping for an excessively
pronated foot<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, studies
describing longer-term application of low-dye taping are lacking. Accordingly, this study
was conducted to examine the effects of the long-term application of low-dye taping on
plantar pressure among patients with plantar fasciitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The 30 patients included in this study were those who visited the foot clinic of B Hospital
located in Daegue Metropolitan City and were diagnosed as having plantar fasciitis in one
foot, after examination by an orthopedist. Patients with inflammatory arthritis,
neurological abnormalities, hypersensitivity response to taping therapy, or another disease
that triggered gait disorder, were excluded.</p><p>The average age, height, and weight of the patients was 38.6 &#x000b1; 4.1&#x02005;years, 166.2 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x02005;cm,
and 65.3 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;kg, respectively, in the low-dye taping group (LTG, n = 15), and 37.4 &#x000b1;
4.5&#x02005;years, 168.3 &#x000b1; 6.2&#x02005;cm, and 66.5 &#x000b1; 4.8&#x02005;kg, respectively, in the conservative treatment
group (CTG, n = 15). All subjects read and signed consent forms, in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for the study was granted
by the Youngdong University institutional review board.</p><p>Patients in the LTG received transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS, 15&#x02005;min) and
infrared therapy (5&#x02005;min) for thirty minutes per session before undergoing modified low-dye
taping. The method of applying modified low-dye taping was based on the procedure used by
Schulthies and Draper<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ordinary
low-dye taping method was adapted into a modified method that covered adipose tissues of the
heels and could replace fatty pads. This modified method was designed to reduce heel pain
during the first few steps taken in the morning, and to decrease shock from the ground to
the heel during the stance phase of gait. Ordinary low-dye taping was attached by pulling it
from the lateral side to the medial side of the foot three to five times, with each line of
tape overlapping, in order to support the medial longitudinal arch. It was then wound around
the head of the metatarsal bone across the sole. In addition, the tape was wound along the
side of the foot, from the lateral to the medial part of the foot. In order to support the
medial longitudinal arch, taping was applied three to five times along the plantar fascia,
with taping overlapping slightly from the lateral to the medial part. Then, with the plantar
heel as the center, taping was wound from the lateral side back to the center of the sole,
and then, from the center of the medial sole, taping was wound to the lateral side and then
returned to the center. This procedure was repeated four times. In order to prevent
detachment of the tape, it was applied across the center of the sole twice. Once applied,
the tape remained on the foot for 12 hours. Patients in the CTG received treatment with TENS
(15 minutes) and infrared (five minutes) for 30 minutes per session. Both groups received
treatment three times a week for six weeks. For TENS, low frequency (3 pps) and high
intensity (100 pps) were alternately applied, and infrared treatment was used between 700
and 2,000&#x02005;nm and 10&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> to the area of the foot that was described as painful
by the patients.</p><p>BioRescue (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie&#x02019;s, France) was used to examine the anterior weight distribution
(AWD) and the posterior weight distribution (PWD) of plantar pressure of the affected foot.
BioRescue&#x02019;s baropodometric platform has 1,600 pressure sensors that can evaluate weight load
on both feet. Measurement was initiated by having the patient step onto the BioRescue
equipment, putting their heels together so that their second toes were situated on the
diagonal line of the foot pad, and then maintaining the anterior parts of their feet at 30
degrees. Patients stood in their most comfortable posture on the measurement equipment, with
both arms held relaxed beside their trunk. The pressure sensor at the platform measures both
AWD and PWD. Measurements were taken when taping was removed, thereby eliminating the
emotional placebo effect of taping for the patients.</p><p>For the statistical analysis of this study, paired t-tests and independent sample t-tests
were conducted for comparison within groups and between groups, respectively. For
statistical processing, SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used, and the significance level was set
at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of this study, the PWD of the LGT and CTG significantly increased

on the plantar pressure of patients with plantar fasciitis. Radford et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the application of low-dye
taping led to immediate increase in the height of tuberosity of the navicular bone. Smith et
al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that inelastic taping to
prevent pronation supported the medial part of the foot, which affected both the middle and
the rear foot. Another study showed that application of low-dye taping during the stance
phase of gait was associated with significant variation in the degree of changes in angles
of eversion and inversion<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also
been reported that the leg joint angle is affected by low-dye taping, with significantly
increased flexion angle and adduction angles of the ankle joints<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that an excessively pronated foot, which may be the cause
of plantar fasciitis, had wide weight distribution in the medial foot, but after application
of low-dye taping over 6 weeks, the weight distribution of the medial sole decreased and the
height of the navicular bone was elevated. In a study of basketball players who had
functional ankle instability during basketball games, inelastic taping was shown to be
effective for improving joint range of motion, proprioception, and functional performance
ability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the results of
the present study, PWD significantly increased among patients of both the LTG and CTG. These
findings suggest that patients with plantar fasciitis move their weight onto the front of
the paretic side due to abnormal posture and pain, but that six weeks of modified low-dye
taping and conservative physical therapy resulted in them shifting their weight onto the
back side of the foot. In addition, after treatment the LTG&#x02019;s PWD was significantly higher
than that of the CTG. This result shows that a 6-week regimen of modified low-dye taping was
associated with greater outcomes for plantar fasciitis, including improved correction of the
feet and reduced pain, than was conservative physical therapy. Modified low-dye taping also
resulted in shifting of the body weight onto the foot on the paretic side, suggesting that
it is effective in normalizing a balanced weight load. Vicenzino et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that plantar pressure decreased when low-dye taping
was applied before walking and jogging. In particular, such a result signifies a decrease in
plantar pressure of the medial middle part and medial cochlear of the feet, and that low-dye
taping effectively corrected the feet and normalized weight distribution. On a long-term
basis, pain and the failure to achieve a proper weight distribution on the lower limbs lead
to the recurrence of plantar fasciitis for many patients. Therefore, simultaneous
application of conservative physical therapy and low-dye taping at home may be more
effective than physical therapy alone. The use of modified low-dye taping is conducive to
treating patients with diseases of the neurological system and those with musculoskeletal
system disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hedrick</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The plantar aponeurosis</article-title>. <source>Foot
