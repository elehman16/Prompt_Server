<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, it does not capture subtle, but important variation in smoking behaviour due to variation of number of inhalations per cigarette, depth of inhalations, respiratory retention of the smoke and heaviness of second-hand on top of first-hand smoking.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, self-reported cross-sectional smoking information produces underestimated risk estimates, as suggested in genetic studies using a smoking-related genotype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<italic>CHRNA3</italic>) as proxy for the lifetime exposure to tobacco smoke<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; however, in that study, association of genotype with cigarette consumption was based on current smoking status and not on lifetime exposure and was not adjusted for factors that influence nicotine metabolism.</p><p>Objective measures of smoking behaviour consist mainly of measurements in body fluids of cotinine<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> or exhaled CO concentration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> With biological half-lives below 24&#x02005;hours, these measurements are, however, not well-suited to estimate long-term smoking behaviour.</p><p>In CpG sites across the genome, methylation extent is associated with tobacco smoking.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Of these, one situated in intron 3 of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (<italic>AHRR</italic>) gene on chromosome 5 (annotated on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array as probe cg05575921), showed greatest evidence for different methylation in response to exposure to tobacco smoking, as found by others,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;15</xref> and in a recent meta-analysis.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; however, it is not known whether variation in <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent is associated with risk of future smoking-related morbidity and mortality among individuals from the general population, and how useful this association might be for (pre-)clinical management of smokers. Screening with low-dose CT scans reduces lung cancer mortality among individuals with high a priori risk, but only marginally among those at lowest risk.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Therefore, several algorithms, which include self-reported smoking have recently been developed to predict smokers' risk of lung cancer.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>

Time scale was chronological age taking into account that risk time began at date of the 1991&#x02013;1994 examination with DNA sampling.

<italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) hypomethylation was predictive of high risk of COPD exacerbation, lung cancer and all-cause mortality, also after adjustment for past and current smoking behaviour. Within a large group of smokers with a 6-year a priori risk of lung cancer above the current cut-off for lung CT scan, <italic>AHRR</italic> cg05575921 methylation extent separated individuals into a very low, an intermediate and a high-risk group. This is a novel finding.</p><p><italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent was an accurate marker of several components of the smoking history. <italic>AHRR</italic> expression is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and cg05575921 methylation marks an upregulation of the expression of <italic>AHRR</italic> in blood cells<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and lung tissue.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Whether cg05575921 hypomethylation of leucocyte DNA in itself has any direct causal role in the development of smoking-related diseases is not known. Observational studies such as ours cannot clarify this, but the AHRR protein is located in the cell nucleus,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and silencing of AHRR enhances tumour growth pleiotropically through increased Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor activity.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Cg05575921 methylation extent varied with smoking behaviour, even among former smokers, who had quit many years before blood sampling, which leads to different exposure to toxic effects of smoking. This suggests that <italic>AHRR</italic> cg05575921 methylation extent is less dynamic in adults than in new-borns, where more rapid attenuation of hypomethylation is seen once the antenatal exposure is removed.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A small number of never smokers have low <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent, presumably due to environmental exposures and may have increased risk of lung cancer.</p><p>Three observations support the notion that measurement of <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent is superior to self-reported smoking behaviour when assessing an individual's risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. First, <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent was associated with the rs1051730 genotype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (<italic>CHRNA3</italic>), a variant associated with increased smoking behaviour,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> also after adjustments for self-reported smoking. This suggests that <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent is superior at capturing individuals' &#x02018;true&#x02019; smoking behaviour. Second, risk estimates of future smoking-related morbidity by methylation extent remained high even after adjustments for self-reported smoking. Third, about 70% of the lung cancer burden is attributed to smoking alone<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x000a0;and in ROC statistics of incident lung cancer in all smokers, <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent performed similarly to the PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> prediction model, which includes information on present and former smoking behaviour. Among high-risk smokers, the relatively bad performance of PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> prediction model might be due to the fact that it was developed to produce a binary risk cut-off for lung CT scan in smokers and not to be used as a continuous risk variable.</p><p>If <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent is indeed a better indicator of the harmful effects of smoking than self-reported smoking behaviour, this points towards the potential clinical use of <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent in stratifying smokers into different risk groups prior to lung CT scan. For this purpose, the relatively stable <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent could in the future be supplemented with short-term objective epigenetic markers of smoking behaviour. It could seem risky to base a decision on lung CT scan on a single blood test sampled years previously, and linked to smoking at the time of sampling, to predict the individual's lung cancer risk. Similar arguments are also valid for the PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> prediction model used to select for lung CT scan. While <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent and the PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> prediction model only predict what will happen for the average person, predictions are naturally not exact for a specific individual.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the large number of general population individuals followed for more than 20&#x02005;years without losses to follow-up. The Danish health registers allowed us to examine associations with three endpoints and this combined with the high frequency and heaviness of tobacco smoking in Denmark in the 1990s gave us adequate power to test the hypotheses.</p><p>Some limitations must, however, be acknowledged. This is the first large-scale application of a simple assay quantifying DNA methylation; however, two arguments support the notion that the assay captured relevant information. First, the measurements correlated with results from Pyrosequencing. Second, we could reproduce the expected association with the smoking-related <italic>CHRN3A</italic> genotype.</p><p>Also, COPD exacerbation during follow-up was only defined by diagnostic codes for hospital admissions, and not additionally by glucocorticosteroide and/or antibiotic treatment. We also lacked information on other variables, which may impact methylation, for example exposure to benzene, lead and arsenic.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> An invalid, non-differential measurement technique would only tend to pull associations with phenotypes, morbidity and mortality towards the null hypothesis, and thus cannot explain our positive findings.</p><p>Misclassification of diagnoses from the Danish registries is a potential limitation, but is likely non-differential by methylation extent and can therefore not explain our results on COPD. Importantly, for lung cancer, diagnoses are based on histological confirmation by a fully trained pathologist and registration is compulsory by law. For all-cause mortality, there is no misclassification in Denmark.</p><p>The 9234 individuals examined only represent 56% of the invited population. Thus, smoking-related death or severe disease may have prevented some from being examined. However, this potential self-selection of healthy individuals cannot explain our positive findings of associations with self-reported smoking, morbidity and mortality. Importantly, we detected the presumed unbiased association with the genotype of the smoking-related <italic>CHRN3A</italic> genotype, for example the genotype distributions among ever and never smokers were similar (p=0.24, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; data not shown), suggesting that if present, selection might be of minor importance. Furthermore, we only measured <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent once, precluding adjustment for within-person variation, regression dilution bias and determination of the natural pattern of methylation after smoking cessation. Nevertheless, we did detect an association of ranked <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation quintiles with time since cessation.</p><p>It could be argued that independent validation of our findings would be preferable; however, the strengths and magnitudes of the associations, and the biological plausibility involving a well-known disease causing lifestyle, argue against the possibility that the findings are due to chance alone.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) hypomethylation was associated with smoking, high smoking-related morbidity and with high all-cause mortality. Among smokers at high risk of lung cancer, and eligible to screening with CT scan, <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent could help to identify a subgroup with the potential most benefit from a lung CT scan. Cost&#x02013;benefit analyses of adding <italic>AHRR</italic> (cg05575921) methylation extent to selection for lung CT scan should be explored in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge participants and team of the Copenhagen City Heart Study.
