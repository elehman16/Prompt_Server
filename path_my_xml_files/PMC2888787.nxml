Following baseline assessments, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) aerobic training alone, (2) resistance training alone, (3) the combination of aerobic and resistance training, or (4) attention-control (progressive stretching). The ultimate goal for all exercise training groups will be 3 supervised exercise sessions per week an intensity above 70% of the individually determined VO<sub>2peak </sub>for aerobic training and an intensity between 60 and 80% of one-repetition maximum for resistance training, for 30-45 minutes/session. Progressive stretching will be matched to the exercise groups in terms of program length (i.e., 16 weeks), social interaction (participants will receive one-on-one instruction), and duration (30-45 mins/session). The primary study endpoint is VO<sub>2peak</sub>. Secondary endpoints include: patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (e.g., quality of life, fatigue, depression, etc.) and organ components of the oxygen cascade (i.e., pulmonary function, cardiac function, skeletal muscle function). All endpoints will be assessed at baseline and postintervention (16 weeks). Substudies will include genetic studies regarding individual responses to an exercise stimulus, theoretical determinants of exercise adherence, examination of the psychological mediators of the exercise - PRO relationship, and exercise-induced changes in gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>VO<sub>2peak </sub>is becoming increasingly recognized as an outcome of major importance in NSCLC.

Approximately 26,000 individuals per year in the United States will survive more than 5 years after initial diagnosis of operable disease. With improving prognosis, acute and long-term disease - and treatment-related morbidity (symptom control) and mortality are now recognized as issues of major clinical importance in the multidisciplinary management of operable NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A parameter of central importance that may mediate acute and late-occurring disease and treatment-related toxicity in lung cancer survivorship is cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by an objective exercise tolerance test, reflects the integrative capacity of components in the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) cascade to supply adequate O<sub>2 </sub>for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resynthesis. Peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) provides the gold standard (direct) assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness. Direct or estimated measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness is a well-established independent predictor of mortality in a broad range of non-cancer, adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Not surprisingly, operable NSCLC patients have significant and marked reductions in VO<sub>2peak</sub>. Postsurgical NSCLC patients are subject to the effects of normal ageing, age-related and/or disease-related comorbid conditions, and deconditioning that adversely impact components of the O<sub>2 </sub>cascade. However, these 'normal' consequences are profoundly accelerated by disease pathophysiology and the use of conventional adjuvant therapy to create a 'perfect deconditioning storm', reducing either the body's ability to deliver and/or utilize O<sub>2 </sub>and substrate leading to poor VO<sub>2peak</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Such effects have important implications across the entire NSCLC continuum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>First, preoperative VO<sub>2peak </sub>is a well-established risk stratification tool to determine perioperaitve and postoperative complication risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Second, following resection, VO<sub>2peak </sub>as well as self-reported exercise behavior (a major determinant of VO<sub>2peak</sub>), are strong predictors of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as overall QOL, fatigue, and other QOL domains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Finally, our group found that pre-operative VO<sub>2peak </sub>is a strong independent predictor of overall survival in NSCLC surgical candidates even when controlling for performance status, gender, and age[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In totality, these data provide strong evidence that VO<sub>2peak </sub>is an attractive modifiable therapeutic target to improve surgical risk and/or recovery, symptom control and possibly, disease outcome in NSCLC.</p><p>Chronic, repeated aerobic training (i.e., continuous activity involving large muscle groups) is widely established as the most effective method to improve VO<sub>2peak </sub>in healthy humans although a paucity of studies have investigated the role of exercise in NSCLC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Given the preliminary nature of this field, we recently completed two uncontrolled pilot studies investigating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of supervised aerobic training in the pre-operative and post-operative setting in NSCLC. Results of these pilot studies provided 'proof of principle' that aerobic training is a safe and feasible intervention for NSCLC patients, however, the improvements in VO<sub>2peak </sub>were modest (&#x0003c;15%), particularly in the post-operative setting (~10%) despite good exercise adherence rates (&#x02265;70% of planned sessions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The reasons for the relatively modest improvement in VO<sub>2peak </sub>in NSCLC relative to other clinical populations (i.e., ~15%-20% improvement in VO<sub>2peak </sub>following traditional aerobic training recommendations) remain to be elucidated. An obvious potential explanation is a ventilatory limitation or inadequate gas exchange following removal of a substantial portion of lung parenchyma. However, several elegant studies have demonstrated that VO<sub>2peak </sub>is not limited by ventilation or diffusion capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggesting that exercise-induced adaptations (or lack thereof) in the other organ components of the O<sub>2 </sub>cascade are responsible. VO<sub>2peak </sub>in NSCLC patients is likely principally governed by poor cardiovascular O<sub>2 </sub>delivery and oxidative capacity <italic>as well as </italic>unfavorable fiber type distribution and muscle atrophy/weakness similar to the limitations to exercise described in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Major contributors to skeletal muscle dysfunction in NSCLC likely include direct skeletal myopathy (from the use of oral corticosteroids), deconditioning (from physical inactivity), and high levels of systemic inflammation (from underlying disease and therapy)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, aerobic training will cause favorable adaptations in most O<sub>2 </sub>transport components but will not reverse skeletal muscle atrophy/weakness and will only partially reverse a more glycolytic fiber type distribution. Thus, aerobic training alone may be insufficient to ameliorate skeletal muscle dysfunction likely manifest in NSCLC. Standard resistance training (i.e., activity involving the acute exertion of force) performed according to standard guidelines (i.e., 2-5 times/week, 50%-80% of 1 repetition maximum for 12-24 weeks) is unequivocally acknowledged as the most effective method to improve skeletal muscle function in human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, in severely deconditioned adults, resistance training causes improvements in VO<sub>2peak </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] although the mechanisms underlying this effect are not clearly understood. In theory, while aerobic and resistance training might independently improve VO<sub>2peak </sub>in NSCLC, such improvements are likely to be modest (~10%). Instead, the combination of aerobic and resistance training may be the most effective form of exercise training to optimally augment VO<sub>2peak</sub>. The complementary physiologic adaptations from the combination approach will result in higher cardiovascular O<sub>2 </sub>delivery, skeletal muscle oxidative phosphoryation, muscle strength and optimal fiber type composition leading to higher muscle endurance, reduced fatiguability, a higher threshold to the metabolic waste products of exercise, and reduced ventilatory requirements during exercise. This approach is hypothesized to maximize physiologic adaptations in the principal factors underlying poor VO<sub>2peak </sub>in postsurgical NSCLC patients more effectively than either exercise modality alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothesized effects of aerobic training alone, resistance training alone, and aerobic plus resistance training on the components of the oxygen cascade and resultant impact on exercise tolerance (VO<sub>2peak</sub>)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-10-155-1"/></fig><p>Against this background, we designed the <underline>Lu</underline>ng Ca<underline>n</underline>cer Exerc<underline>i</underline>se <underline>T</underline>raining Stud<underline>y</underline> (LUNGEVITY), a randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of different types of exercise training in post-operative NSCLC patients. The fundamental rationale for this single-center trial is to identify the optimal type of exercise training to improve VO<sub>2peak </sub>in postoperative NSCLC patients and understand the physiologic mechanisms underlying this effect. The specific aims are: (1) to compare the effects of aerobic training alone, resistance training alone, or both, relative to attention-control, on VO<sub>2peak</sub>, (2) determine the effects on the mechanisms that govern VO<sub>2peak </sub>(measurements of the heart-lung-skeletal muscle axis), and (3) to compare the effects on PROs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Participants and Setting</title><p>In LUNGEVITY, we will recruit and randomize 160 subjects (40 patients/study arm) with histologically confirmed stage I-IIIA NSCLC following curative-intent complete surgical resection at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC).

On the following day, patients will perform the following assessments: (1) one repetition maximum lower extremity strength test, and (2) tissue biopsy of the vastus lateralis. Participants will be asked to adhere to a water-only fast for 8 hours prior to testing on both days. All baseline assessments will be repeated at the end of the intervention (i.e., 16 weeks). To maximize internal validity, study endpoint assessments will be conducted by the same personnel, with the same equipment, in the same order (timing) at baseline and follow-up timepoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Group Allocation (Randomization)</title><p>Following the successful completion of baseline assessments, participants will be randomly allocated, on an individual basis, to one of the three exercise interventions (i.e., aerobic training, resistance training, the combination of aerobic and resistance training) or an attention-control group. Randomly allocated participants will remain in the same group for the entire duration of the intervention (i.e., no cross-over). To ensure randomized groups are similar at baseline, patient randomization will be stratified based on gender (men vs. female) and smoking status (current vs. non-smoking). For each gender-smoking status participant subgroup, a computer-generated list of random treatment assignments will be created by Dr. Peterson (trial biostatistician) in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The random allocation sequences will be concealed from all study personnel (except Dr. Peterson). A permuted block design with allocation weight of 1:1:1:1 will be used to generate the treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding/Masking</title><p>Blinding study participants to treatment allocation in clinical trials of exercise training is not possible since participants are aware whether they are exercising or not. Also, it is not possible to blind study personnel monitoring exercise training sessions to the participant group assignment since study personnel are aware whether a participant is performing aerobic or resistance training. Nevertheless, all study personnel conducting the study assessments at baseline and postintervention will be blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study. Only the trial statistician and the data monitoring committee will have access to unblinded data, but none will have any contact with study participants or study personnel.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise Training Protocols (General Considerations)</title><p>The ultimate goal for all exercise training groups will be 3 supervised exercise sessions per week an intensity above 70% of the individually determined VO<sub>2peak </sub>for aerobic training and an intensity between 60 and 80% of one-repetition maximum for resistance training, for 30-90 minutes/session. All the exercise interventions are designed such that participants begin exercising at a low intensity (~50%-60% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) that is subsequently increased to more moderate to vigorous intensity (~70%-80% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) when appropriate. All interventions will be individually tailored to each patient following the principles of aerobic or resistance training prescription guidelines for adults as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. All exercise sessions will also be performed in a supervised setting with one-on-one supervision by an ACSM-certified exercise physiologist. Supervised exercise training sessions are critical to ensure a robust test of exercise training efficacy and safety in this setting.</p><p>All exercise sessions will include a 5-min warm-up and 5-min cool down on either a treadmill or cycle ergometer at the beginning and end of each training session, respectively. Heart rate and O<sub>2 </sub>saturation will be monitored continuously throughout exercise while blood pressure will be assessed prior, during, and immediately following each exercise session.

The ultimate goal for aerobic training alone is 3 cycle ergometry sessions/week at an intensity above 70% of VO<sub>2peak </sub>for 30-60 minutes/session. Cycle ergometry was chosen as the mode of aerobic training because exercise prescriptions can be more accurately prescribed and monitored on cycle ergometers than treadmill walking. Also, treadmill walking requires considerable balance; lung cancer patients are typically older, have balance issues, and typically have limited experience with treadmill exercise.

For each of the primary and secondary endpoints, three separate t-tests will be used to compare each experimental arm to the control arm in mean change across time of the endpoint. For each endpoint, the overall alpha level will be controlled at a two-sided 0.05 by using Holm's procedure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. That is, Holm's procedure first ranks the three p-values from lowest to highest. The first (lowest) p-value has to be less than 0.05/3 (0.0167) to be significant and permit continuation to the other t-tests. The Holm's procedure continues sequentially in this fashion using alpha levels of 0.05/2 (0.025) and 0.05/1 (0.05) for the remaining two t-tests, respectively. Power for this study is defined as the probability that at least one of the three t-tests of the arm effect on VO<sub>2peak </sub>is significant; in other words, power is the probability that the first of the 3 ordered t-tests are significant. We assume that change in VO<sub>2peak </sub>will have a standard deviation of 3.0 mL.kg.<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1 </sup>as observed in our pilot work. Statistical power depends upon the configuration of mean change in VO<sub>2peak </sub>across the 4 arms. Thus, for example, 80% power is obtained when the mean change in VO<sub>2peak </sub>across Arms 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 0.60, 0.60, 2.10, and 0.0 (mL.kg.<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytic Plan</title><p>The principal analysis of the study endpoints will employ the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. The ITT analysis will include all randomized participants in their randomly assigned allocation. The intervention group assignment will not be altered based on the participant's adherence to the randomly allocated study arm. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up will be included in all primary and secondary analyses by assuming zero change across time. For the primary analysis, a multiple regression model will be used to regress change in VO<sub>2peak </sub>on study group, the baseline value of the endpoint, and other pertinent baseline variables that may influence change in the study endpoints (e.g., co-morbid conditions/medications, self-reported exercise history, age).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Methodological Considerations</title><p>Several issues were considered when designing LUNGEVITY. First, was the decision to investigate exercise in patients with operable (early) or inoperable (advanced) NSCLC. The majority of patients (~75%) diagnosed with NSCLC present with inoperable (advanced) disease. From a population health perspective, exercise trials in inoperable disease are likely to greater impact in comparison to those in patients with operable disease. Our decision to target early-stage patients was based on several important factors, primarily, exercise training safety and patient eligibility (recruitment). Inoperable NSCLC patients have poor prognosis and commonly present with significant smoking-related comorbid disease, advanced disease and symptoms, and are heavily treated with aggressive chemotherapy and concurrent radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As a result, the majority present with KPS scores &#x0003c;70% which may preclude participation in a moderate-intensity exercise training program and increase the risk of an exercise-related adverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Accordingly, it is prudent to focus on patients with operable disease; these patients have, in general, better performance status (and prognosis) and issues of NSCLC survivorship are becoming increasingly important aspect of multidisciplinary care. A second important consideration was the decision to investigate the efficacy of exercise following completion of, as opposed to, during adjuvant therapy. In our pilot work, aerobic training was associated with a 2% and 11% improvement in VO<sub>2peak </sub>among patients receiving or not receiving chemotherapy, respectively for postoperative NSCLC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clearly, without a non-intervention control group, it is not known whether maintenance of VO<sub>2peak </sub>during chemotherapy is important. Nevertheless, given the lack of benefit of exercise training during chemotherapy, subjects in LUNGEVITY will be recruited &#x02265;6 months following the completion of adjuvant therapy, if appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Ancillary Studies</title><p>A number of ancillary studies are planned for LUNGEVITY. First, as part of the informed consent process, a sample of white cells (buffy coat) will be collected from each subject in order to conduct genetic studies. A question of great interest that has not yet been addressed in the cancer populations is assessing genetic contributions to inter-individual differences in response to exercise training. Second, we will conduct ancillary study to examine predictors of adherence to the interventions as well as extent of exercise 'drop-in' in the attention control group across different exercise protocols in NSCLC. To address this question, we will adopt the guiding principles of the theory of planned behavior (TPB)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This data will be used to inform the design and implementation of future trials. Third, in addition to assessing the physiological mediators of the exercise - VO<sub>2peak </sub>relationship, LUNGEVITY also provides a unique opportunity to examine which psychological variables that may mediate the exercise - PROs relationship. To this end, we will assess whether self-efficacy, affect, and social support mediate the effect of the exercise interventions and attention-control on anticipated improvements in PROs. Finally, we will include pilot studies to investigate the effects of exercise training on changes in peripheral gene expression (from analysis of whole blood mRNA) using high-density mRNA microarrays. Such studies will provide insight into the molecular mechanistic properties of exercise in NSCLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>The past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in clinical and research interest of the application of exercise following a cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews conclude that exercise is a safe and feasible supportive intervention to improve symptom control and cardiorespiratory fitness in cancer patients with early-stage disease either during or following the completion of adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Moreover, recent observational studies provided the first evidence that regular exercise (i.e., 30 minutes of brisk walking at least 5 days/week) may be associated with substantial reductions in cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality among patients with early breast and colorectal cancer following the completion of adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Despite this growing evidence, investigation of the role of exercise training following a diagnosis of NSCLC remains limited.</p><p>The pathophysiology of NSCLC together with conventional therapeutic management is associated with unique and varying degrees of adverse physiological impairments that dramatically reduce patient's ability to tolerate exercise. Poor VO<sub>2peak </sub>likely predisposes to increased susceptibility to other common age-related diseases, greater symptoms, poor QOL, and even premature death. In recent years, a limited number of pilot studies have emerged that provide 'proof-of-principle' that supervised aerobic training is a safe and feasible supportive intervention associated with improvements in cardiopulmonary function and select patient-reported outcomes in postsurgical NSCLC. In addition, VO<sub>2peak </sub>may be a strong, independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality in this population. Against this background, LUNGEVITY was designed to identify the most effective type of exercise training to improve VO<sub>2peak </sub>and to elucidate the physiologic mechanisms underlying this improvement. To our knowledge, LUNGEVITY will be the first trial to compare different types of exercise training protocols in NSCLC as well as the first to study the effects of exercise on changes in the organ components that govern exercise tolerance in any cancer population. In totality, LUNGEVITY will address many critical unanswered questions regarding the role and mechanistic properties of exercise in NSCLC and will set the stage for more definite trials. In the long-term, we hope that this research will contribute to the establishment of clinical exercise therapy rehabilitation guidelines for patients across the entire NSCLC continuum.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LWJ: conception and design, drafting of manuscript, and final approval for publication.
