However, SSM has poor sensitivity in HIV-infected patients. We compared performance of urine lipoarabinomannan strip test (LAM) and SSM among hospitalized HIV-infected patients with suspected TB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Hospitalized HIV-infected patients with suspected TB were randomized to LAM plus SSM or SSM alone groups as part of a larger multi-country parent study. Here we present a comparison of LAM versus SSM performance from the Zimbabwe study site. LAM analyses (grade 2 cut-off) were conducted using (i) a microbiological reference standard (MRS; culture positivity for <italic>M.tb</italic> and designated definite TB) and (ii) a composite reference standard (CRS; definite TB plus probable TB i.e. patients with clinical TB excluded from the culture negative group). CRS constituted the primary analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">82/457 (18&#x000a0;%) of the patients randomized to the LAM group were <italic>M.tuberculosis</italic> culture positive. Using CRS, sensitivity (%, 95 % CI) of LAM was significantly higher than SSM [49.2 (42.1-56.4) versus 29.4(23.2-36.3); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001]. Specificity and PPV were 98.1&#x000a0;%, and 95.8&#x000a0;%, respectively. By contrast, using MRS, LAM sensitivity was similar to SSM and specificity was significantly lower, however, the combined sensitivity of LAM and SSM was significantly higher than that of SSM alone, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009. Using CRS, LAM sensitivity (%, CI) was CD4 count dependent [60.6(50.7-69.8) at &#x02264;50 cells/&#x003bc;L; 40.0(22.7-59.4) at 51-100 cells/&#x003bc;L, and 32.8(21.0-46.3) at &#x0003e;100 cells/&#x003bc;L. The combined sensitivity of LAM and SSM was higher than SSM alone being highest at CD4 counts &#x0003c;50 cells/&#x003bc;L [67.6(57.9-76.3); <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.001]. Specificity of LAM or SSM alone, or of combined LAM and SSM was &#x0003e;97&#x000a0;% in all the 3 CD4 strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Among hospitalized HIV-infected patients with suspected TB, the sensitivity of LAM is significantly higher than that of SSM, especially at low CD4 counts. LAM and SSM are complimentary tests for diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected patients. We recommend a combination of LAM and SSM for TB diagnosis in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts in HIV/TB co-endemic countries, where alternative methods are unavailable.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Urine LAM strip test</kwd><kwd>Sputum smear microscopy</kwd><kwd>Hospitalized HIV-infected patients</kwd><kwd>CD4 counts</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001713</institution-id><institution>European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IP.2009.32040.009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dheda</surname><given-names>Keertan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par5">Tuberculosis (TB) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients in southern Africa which bears 80&#x000a0;% of the global HIV burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Our study had some interesting findings. First, employing the CRS (used as the primary analysis in this case because of sampling bias when using the MRS) we have shown that LAM is more sensitive than SSM and the combination is better than either diagnostic modality alone. Moreover, specificity was excellent. Secondly, when stratified by CD4 count, the sensitivity of LAM is highest at CD4 count &#x02264;50 cells/&#x003bc;l. Similarly the sensitivity of the combined tests is highest at CD4 counts &#x02264;50 cells/&#x003bc;L identifying 87&#x000a0;%&#x000a0;TB-infected patients. Indeed, in Zimbabwe AIDS patients with probable opportunistic infections, such as TB, present late in the course of their disease at tertiary hospitals as reflected by the low median CD4 counts (55cells/&#x003bc;L) in this study. The urgent need for a rapid POC TB diagnostic tool for this group of patients cannot be over-emphasized as they may benefit from early commencement of anti-TB treatment. TB is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. SSM is the routinely used microbiological test for TB, yet it has poor sensitivity among HIV-infected patients. Our study suggests additional benefit of a rapid POC TB diagnostic tool which utilizes easily obtainable urine and produces results within 30&#x000a0;min.</p><p id="Par33">The specificity of LAM (86&#x000a0;%), using MRS in our study is below the usual acceptable level of 95&#x000a0;% or more for acceptability of any new diagnostic test. Several reasons may be attributable to the low specificity. The reference standard culture, which uses sputum is inappropriate. It is widely known that HIV-infected patients are often sputum scarce or have paucibacillary sputa and hence do not produce &#x0201c;good quality&#x0201d; sputum, thus likely contributing to false negative culture results. To address this issue, and where sampling error is high, we opted to use the CRS that is likely more appropriate in this specific context. The specificity of LAM was significantly improved from 86&#x000a0;% to 98&#x000a0;% when using the CRS. Similarly the PPV of LAM was also greatly improved from a mere 49&#x000a0;% to 95&#x000a0;%. We agree that this introduces misclassification bias. However, this specificity is likely to be more accurate than that that obtained using MRS due to the dominating effect of sampling bias (significant possibility of false negative culture results). Nevertheless, we present both analytical strategies so the relative differences can be appreciated.</p><p id="Par34">Based on the sensitivity of LAM, which was significantly higher than that of the routinely used SSM; the higher sensitivity of SSM and LAM combination than SSM alone and the high specificity and PPV of LAM when using the CRS, a combination of LAM and SSM offers a very attractive option for diagnosis of HIV-associated TB in hospitalized patients who are heavily immunosuppressed. LAM has the added advantages of using urine which is easily and rapidly obtained even from very ill patients compared to sputum. It is an easy to use POC test which can also be performed by trained nurses making it an ideal POC test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It does not require electricity or any equipment, making it ideal for rural areas where the majority of patients live in resource-limited countries. Each LAM test costs less than US$3.50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, adding LAM to routine TB diagnostic work-up among HIV-infected adults with CD4 counts &#x0003c;100 cell/&#x003bc;L has been reported to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The LAM has been evaluated globally but with widely varying sensitivity (13&#x000a0;% to 93&#x000a0;%) and specificity (87&#x000a0;% to 99&#x000a0;%) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). The variability may be attributed to the study design, study populations, hospitalized versus out-patients, HIV status, degree of immunosuppression as assessed by CD4 counts, use of fresh urine versus frozen urine, cut-off grade for positive result (grade 1 versus grade 2), and performance of the test by state certified technologist versus trained nurses etc. These variations make it difficult to compare performance characteristic of LAM across various settings. However, in the majority of the studies which stratified performance of LAM by CD4 counts, the consensus is that sensitivity of LAM was highest in patients with low CD4 counts (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Our study lends support to the growing consensus.</p><p id="Par36">To our knowledge, only two other studies, one in South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and another in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have evaluated LAM in hospitalized HIV-infected patients with suspected TB. The South African study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] like our current study used both MRS and CRS for LAM grade 2 cut-point analysis. Comparison of LAM performance characteristics is not possible due to the different study designs and degree of immunosuppression. Furthermore the South African study used frozen urine whereas in the current study, spot fresh urine was used. However, the two studies (South Africa and Zimbabwe) showed that using the CRS the specificity of LAM was high (&#x0003e;95&#x000a0;%). The two studies also showed that combining LAM and SSM significantly increased the sensitivity. The Ugandan study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] used a MRS based LAM grade 2 cut-off analysis. Based on the overlapping CI, the sensitivity in our study 61&#x000a0;%, CI: 49.6&#x02013;71.6 was similar to that in the Ugandan study; 49&#x000a0;%, CI: 39.0&#x02013;59.0. Conversely, the specificity of LAM was higher in the Ugandan study 97&#x000a0;%, CI: 92.0&#x02013;99.0 versus 86&#x000a0;%, CI: 82.2&#x02013;89.5. The differences in specificity between the two studies (Uganda and Zimbabwe) may be attributable to misclassification bias and differences in study design (case controlled versus unselected cohort design).</p><p id="Par37">There are some limitations of our study. We did not perform Gene Xpert, which has been partly rolled out in several countries. Thus, comparison of LAM and Xpert was not possible. However, in most TB endemic countries globally and including Africa SSM is still the predominant diagnostic modality. Thus, our data have substantial relevance to clinical practice in TB and HIV endemic settings. Misclassification bias could have over or under estimated the accuracy of LAM. The focus of this report is to highlight the performance outcome of a combination diagnostic strategy; patient important outcomes are reported elsewhere (submitted).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Among hospitalized HIV-infected patients with suspected TB, the combined sensitivity of SSM and LAM, using CRS, is significantly higher than that of SSM, especially at low CD4 counts. The specificity is greater than 95&#x000a0;% for either test alone or combined. Thus, LAM and SSM are complimentary tests for diagnosis of TB in HIV-infected patients. We recommend a combination of LAM and SSM for TB diagnosis in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts in HIV/TB co-endemic countries, where alternative methods are unavailable.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>KD has received free LAM test kits for research studies and speaker fees from Alere at industry sponsored congress symposia.
