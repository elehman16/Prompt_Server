The intervention group (RLO+, n = 103) received the RLOs plus standard clinical service including hearing aid(s) and counseling, and the waitlist control group (RLO&#x02212;, n = 100) received standard clinical service only. The effectiveness of the RLOs was assessed 6-weeks posthearing aid fitting. Seven RLOs (total duration 1 hr) were developed using a participatory, community of practice approach involving hearing aid users and audiologists. RLOs included video clips, illustrations, animations, photos, sounds and testimonials, and all were subtitled. RLOs were delivered through DVD for TV (50.6%) and PC (15.2%), or via the internet (32.9%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>RLO take-up was 78%. Adherence overall was at least 67%, and 97% in those who attended the 6-week follow-up. Half the participants watched the RLOs two or more times, suggesting self-management of their hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication. The RLOs were rated as highly useful and the majority of participants agreed the RLOs were enjoyable, improved their confidence and were preferable to written information. Postfitting, there was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome measure, overall hearing aid use. However, there was significantly greater hearing aid use in the RLO+ group for suboptimal users.

Provision of hearing aids is the main form of clinical intervention for adults with hearing loss (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin 2009</xref>). Other components of aural rehabilitation include instruction on the use of hearing aids and communication strategies, counseling to enhance participation in everyday life, and strategies to enhance speech perception, such as auditory training (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Boothroyd 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite evidence that hearing aids are effective in providing hearing-specific benefits and improved quality of life (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Chisolm et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2007</xref>), a significant proportion of hearing aid users, estimated between 4.5 and 24%, do not wear them (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">McCormack &#x00026; Fortnum 2013</xref>), and others wear them only some of the time (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Whitmer et al. 2014</xref>). Reasons for this are varied. These include comfort and maintenance of hearing aids, psychosocial and situational influences, device factors, and attitude of healthcare professionals (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">McCormack &#x00026; Fortnum 2013</xref>). Furthermore, expectations of first-time hearing aid users are often set too high, leading to unrealistic expectations (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al. 2014</xref>). It is not surprising then that around half (51%) of first-time hearing aid users have difficulties using their hearing aids (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Action on Hearing Loss 2011</xref>).</p><p>Provision of high-quality information by audiologists to hearing aid users, particularly those using them for the first time, may help to address many of the above issues. Typically, much of the information offered in a clinical setting is delivered verbally, with the result that many patients forget the information given to them. <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Kessels (2003)</xref> reported that between 40 and 80% of information was forgotten after the clinic appointment. For hearing aid users, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Reese and Hnath-Chisolm (2005)</xref> showed that 25% of information delivered at the hearing aid fitting appointment was forgotten 1 month later when assessed using a multiple-choice method. However, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">El-Molla et al. (2012)</xref>, using a free recall method, reported that half of the information given was forgotten 6 weeks later, with poorer retention of psychosocial issues (35%) compared with practical issues (65%). These study findings are reflected in a typical comment from a first-time hearing aid user, &#x0201c;you get a lot of information&#x02026;by the time you get home you&#x02019;ve forgotten most of it&#x0201d; (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Action on Hearing Loss 2011</xref>, p. 23).</p><p>As follow-up appointments are not routine in the UK National Health Service (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Lowe 2015</xref>), the importance of high-quality information to reinforce that given at the fitting appointment is important. Although delivery of high-quality written information is recognized and recommended as good clinical practice in the UK (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">NHS Scotland 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Action on Hearing Loss 2011</xref>), this is not always done in clinic. A survey of 107 UK audiology services showed that fewer than 40% of services offered written information other than the standard provision of hearing aid manufacturers&#x02019; hearing aid user guide (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Action on Hearing Loss 2011</xref>). However, hearing aid manufacturers&#x02019; user guides are not optimal in terms of content, design, and readability (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Brooke et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Caposecco et al. 2014</xref>). It is also important to recognize that one-way delivery of information by the audiologist to the hearing aid user is not the same as educating the patient and increasing their knowledge base (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Boothroyd 2007</xref>). Constructivist learning theory suggests that learners construct an internal representation by taking an interactive role in learning, and that higher interactivity with learning material promotes better learning (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2006</xref>). Therefore for development of a good knowledge base and subsequent learning to occur, hearing aid users need to not only receive good quality information but also understand and actively engage with the information for it to transfer, and be relevant and useful in their everyday lives.</p><p>Knowledge of hearing-related matters in the general public is generally poor (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Greengross 2014</xref>), and even in existing hearing aid users, knowledge of hearing aids and how to use them is highly variable, ranging from poor to excellent (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Desjardins &#x00026; Doherty 2009</xref>). For example, between 60 and 80% of first-time hearing aid users did not know how to use the telephone with their hearing aids and needed further instruction (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Vuorialho et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Goggins &#x00026; Day 2009</xref>). To address this, a number of educational programs for hearing aid users have been developed. Communication programs, delivered either in group or individual settings, have been shown to provide benefits in terms of reduction of self-reported hearing and communication difficulties (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Beynon et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Chisolm et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Hickson et al. 2007</xref>). For some programs, although not all (e.g., Active Communication Education [ACE]), this requires input from the audiologist. This can be costly, both in terms of time and finances, which may be problematic when healthcare resources are limited.</p><p>Remote delivery of a more cost-effective individual home-communication program delivered by videotapes showed improvement in the use of communication strategies and improved quality of life and satisfaction at a 6-month follow-up (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>). Similarly, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 5-week written educational program that covered the basics of hearing, the audiogram, and information on hearing aids, supplemented by weekly telephone calls, showed a reduction in hearing handicap and reported anxiety in the intervention group in existing hearing aid users (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al. 2011</xref>). These materials were further developed by <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. (2011)</xref> for internet delivery with email feedback and advice from an audiologist. An RCT of these internet-delivered materials showed no improvements in existing hearing aid users on the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) in both intervention and control groups; however, there was a reduction in depression symptoms both immediately and at the 6-month follow-up. Recently, these materials were expanded with additional information on hearing and cognition, and components from the ACE (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Hickson et al. 2007</xref>), as well as online interaction with peers and an audiologist (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2014</xref>). A subsequent RCT showed improvements in the HHIE and two items of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) in the intervention group immediately and at 6-month follow-up. Thus, educational programs appear to be beneficial to hearing aid users.</p><p>In other fields, educational and psychological research provides evidence that visual approaches can enhance learning and motivation by providing concrete depictive representations of subjects to be learned (<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ainsworth &#x00026; Loizou 2003</xref>). In the present study, we investigated the use of reusable learning objects (RLOs). These are &#x0201c;chunks&#x0201d; of interactive multimedia learning, containing highly visual components that include animations, cartoon, and video clips to illustrate concepts and processes (<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Windle &#x00026; Wharrad 2010</xref>). The RLO concept is based on three components (1) visual illustration of concepts, (2) activity and engagement with content, and (3) self- assessment. Two important principles are that RLOs are based on specific learning goals, and the theoretical framework underpinning the pedagogical design (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Koper 2003</xref>) ensures that the multimedia environment enables the user to take an active role within the RLOs via activities and self-assessment aligned to these learning goals (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Biggs &#x00026; Tang 2003</xref>). RLOs can be adapted to specific patient groups, constitute only a small amount of learning time, and can be replayed until the knowledge or skill has been mastered. Furthermore, RLOs have been shown to improve motivation and compliance of treatments in clinical groups (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al. 2001</xref>). Video materials for hearing aid users have been developed previously to supplement standard hearing aid care (e.g., <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>). However, the development of materials using the underpinning theoretical principles of the RLO concepts as described above, with the inherent range of multimedia that were developed by using an iterative participatory approach, have not been used with hearing aid users. As hearing aid follow-up appointments are not routinely offered in the UK, all the important information needs to be given at the time of the hearing aid fitting. As such, RLOs offer advantages in that they can provide essential and supplementary information, be used at a time that suits the patient, used as many times as the user wants and needs, and can be delivered remotely in the home environment.</p><p>Internet delivery of educational programs, along with other teleaudiology applications, has the added potential of being accessible to many people, including hard-to-reach populations, provided they have access to the internet (<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Swanepoel &#x00026; Hall 2010</xref>). While there is an increasing use of internet-based solutions to deliver educational resources, one current logistical problem in the internet delivery of patient education and support to first-time hearing aid users is that internet use is relatively low in this age group. We reported on PC and internet use in a random sample of 1298 UK 50- to 74-year-olds (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Henshaw et al. 2012</xref>). In the typical first-time hearing aid user age group (70 to 74 years), PC and internet use was significantly lower (36.4 and 17.5%), than the youngest age group (50 to 54 years) where use was 84.6 and 65.5%. Thus, to maximize accessibility of educational programs in the first-time hearing aid user population, it is important to consider a range of delivery methods, such as DVD for TV and PC, and internet.</p><p>We aimed to develop and evaluate a series of RLOs for first-time hearing aid users, based on guidance on the development, evaluation, and implementation of complex interventions provided by the <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Medical Research Council (2008)</xref>. This guidance suggests that interventions should be developed systematically and includes four key stages. <italic>Development</italic> of an intervention should be based on an identified evidence base and an underlying theory. <italic>Feasibility</italic> of the intervention informs recruitment and retention of participants, delivery, accessibility and take-up of the intervention, in addition to acceptability and adherence of participants with the intervention. The <italic>evaluation</italic> phase assesses the effectiveness of the intervention, ideally by an RCT to prevent selection bias, where selection of appropriate outcome measures is crucial. The final stage, <italic>implementation</italic>, ensures that the intervention translates into clinical practice and assessment of long-term outcomes, to show whether the intervention can generalize to wide-scale implementation and effectiveness.</p><p>The specific aims of this research were to:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>develop a series of short interactive RLOs to cover a broad range of auditory rehabilitation content, both practical and psychosocial, which could be accessible to hearing aid users and their family and friends;</p></list-item><list-item><p>establish accessibility, take-up, acceptability, and adherence of the RLOs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>assess the benefits and cost-effectiveness of the RLOs in first-time hearing aid users.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study is reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Schulz et al. 2010</xref>) that offers guidance for the transparent and unbiased reporting of RCTs.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Adult first-time hearing aid users were recruited via the Nottingham Audiology Service at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust who had been referred for hearing assessment by their family doctor. Of the 553 patients who attended the assessment appointment and had not previously worn hearing aids, 203 (36.7%) were willing to take part and met the inclusion criteria. These were (1) adults ages &#x02265;18 years, (2) first-time hearing aid users, and (3) spoken English as first language or good understanding of English. Exclusion criteria were those who were unable to (1) access DVD, PC or internet, or (2) complete questionnaires due to age-related problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study Design and Procedure</title><p>The design was a prospective, registered clinical RCT with two arms. The intervention group (RLO+, n = 103) received the RLOs plus standard clinical service including hearing aid(s) and counseling, and the waitlist control group (RLO&#x02212;, n = 100) received standard clinical service only. Patients who met the eligibility criteria at the hearing assessment appointment were asked by the clinical audiologist if they were interested in participating in the study. Details of the study, including randomization and offer of the RLOs to the control group postevaluation, were explained both verbally and in the participant information sheet. Informed, written consent was obtained by the audiologist at the hearing aid fitting appointment approximately 4 weeks later to meet the ethical requirement of at least a 24-hr consideration period. Eight experienced clinical audiologists received training in the consent procedure, as well as how to use and demonstrate the RLOs as part of the study protocol by MF and MB.</p><p>Postconsent, participants were allocated to one of two groups. Allocation was based on a computer-generated pseudo-random code using random arrangement of blocks of randomly varying size, created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit to provide a robust randomization method. Allocation to groups was in the ratio of 1:1, stratified by age (&#x0003c;70 years, &#x02265;70 years), and made by the recruiting clinical audiologist who accessed a remote-controlled randomization system managed by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit. Allocations were revealed to the research team on completion of the study.</p><p>Those who were allocated to the RLO+ group chose their preferred RLO delivery method from one of four options: (1) interactive DVD for television, (2) interactive DVD for PC, (3) interactive RLOs via the internet, and (4) autoplay DVD for television with no interactivity. The DVD was given at the hearing aid fitting appointment, and access to the internet was given within 1 to 2 days of receiving the hearing aid. Participants were requested to watch all the RLOs, preferably no more than two per day to minimize information overload.</p><p>Participants attended an evaluation session approximately 5 to 8 weeks postfitting (M = 6.8 weeks, SD = 1.2, range 4 to 12, 91% seen between 5 and 8 weeks). The research audiologists (n = 2) were blinded as to whether the participants had received the RLOs or not. Before attending the evaluation session, the participants were requested not to reveal their group until the end of that session, to minimize researcher bias in outcome measurement. On completion of the evaluation session, the RLO&#x02212; group was offered the RLOs although there was no further evaluation. The primary outcome measure was hearing aid use measured by the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Gatehouse 1999</xref>). On the basis of an improvement of 12.5% use, equivalent to a half-category increase on the response scale of the GHABP, and based on 80% power and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, 85 patients were required for each group. To allow for an estimated 15% dropout rate, a total recruitment of 200 patients was planned.</p><p>The study was approved by the Nottingham Research Ethics Committee and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust Research and Development department. Participants were paid a nominal inconvenience fee and travel expenses to attend the evaluation session.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>RLOs</title><p>RLOs were developed using a participatory, community of practice approach, and were based on pedagogical design principles (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Biggs &#x00026; Tang 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Koper 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Windle et al. 2010</xref>) described in more detail elsewhere (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2015</xref>). In brief, a Delphi review of 33 hearing healthcare professionals identified by consensus the key informational elements, including topic areas, for inclusion in the RLOs (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2012</xref>). These then informed two workshops of 35 hearing aid users (compliant and noncompliant) and one workshop of 11 audiologists, where RLO content was developed based on their personal experience and insights. The RLOs were designed to be delivered at the lowest technological fidelity (i.e., DVD) to maximise accessibility, as previous research had shown that PC and internet use in the typical first-time hearing aid user age group was relatively low (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Henshaw et al. 2012</xref>). The DVD could also be used with television and PC, and RLOs were also available via the internet through the Nottingham Hearing Biomedical Research Unit internet portal.</p><p>There were seven RLOs (getting to know your hearing aids; how to insert hearing aids; what to expect when wearing hearing aids; adapting to wearing hearing aids; communication tactics; using the phone and other devices; hearing aid care and troubleshooting), with duration between 4 and 11 min (M = 7.89 min, SD = 2.5). There was also a short introduction (2.8 min), and altogether the total duration of the RLOs was 58.7 min. Sample RLO clips can be found in the videos in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A236">http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A236</ext-link>). The RLOs were based on pedagogical principles, introducing specific learning outcomes at the outset, reinforcement of good behaviors, and explaining the consequences of poor behaviors, with an interactive multiple-choice quiz at the end of each RLO so the user could see what they had learned. The RLOs included video clips, illustrations, animations, photos, sounds and testimonials, and all were subtitled. The importance of psychosocial aspects of hearing loss was evident from the Delphi review and workshops. Therefore, aspects such as emotions, confidence, and involvement of friends and family members were included in the Expectation, Adaptation and Communication RLOs.</p><p>The interactive nature of the RLOs included (1) choice of ear mold (custom or open, as some of the RLOs were ear mold specific, e.g., how to insert hearing aids); (2) choice of RLOs from a user-friendly interface; (3) the option to rewind, fast-forward, and pause; and (4) the interaction with a two- or three-question multiple-choice quiz, based on a three-option, three-alternate forced-choice paradigm, after each RLO via the TV remote control handset or PC mouse. After selecting the answer, the participant was shown whether this was correct or not, along with some additional advice, before moving onto the next question. Participants were able to replay the quiz as many times as they wished. An autoplay version was developed for those unable to use a TV remote control handset. Using a platform for DVD delivery meant that the participants&#x02019; interactivity with RLOs was limited compared with that for RLOs developed specifically for internet delivery. However, given the low PC and internet use in the typical first-time hearing aid user group, we decided the compromise between lower interactivity and higher accessibility for typical first-time hearing aid users was acceptable.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Hearing Aids</title><p>Hearing aids (Oticon Zest, Phonak Nathos) were fitted, programmed using the NAL-NL1 algorithm and verified by real-ear measurement in accordance with local protocols and national guidelines (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">British Society of Audiology 2008</xref>).

For significant results, an adjusted analysis using multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, and hearing loss (better-ear average [BEA] for 0.25 to 4 kHz) was performed. Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons was applied where necessary. For outcome measures obtained at both fitting and evaluation (HADS and PAM), an analysis of variance was performed with &#x0201c;group&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;visit&#x0201d; as factors.

Incremental QALYs were calculated as the difference between the baseline and follow-up QALYs for the two groups. Total cost per participant was calculated as the average cost of specific activities within the patient pathway, and the incremental cost was the cost difference between the two groups (i.e., the costs of the RLOs, which were costed at &#x000a3;2 per set). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was the incremental QALY divided by incremental costs. In the UK, the willingness to pay per QALY is an arbitrary threshold value set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is typically set at an ICER of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">NICE 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of those who (1) were initially assessed, (2) were eligible and consented at the fitting appointment, and (3) participated in the evaluation session are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

At a willingness to pay of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">NICE 2013</xref>), 70% of cases were cost-effective; however, the 95% confidence intervals suggest that there is some uncertainty in the results.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6.</label><caption><p>Results of the cost-effectiveness base case analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aud-37-123-g009"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main aims of this research were to develop a series of interactive educational resources (RLOs) for first-time hearing aid users, assess the feasibility of delivering the RLOs to those attending hearing aid fitting appointments in an audiology clinic, and then evaluate the effectiveness of the home-delivered RLOs using an RCT, based on a framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Medical Research Council 2008</xref>).</p><sec><title>Development of RLOs</title><p>RLO content was developed using pedagogical principles from learning theory by taking a participatory approach that involved both hearing aid users and audiologists using a Delphi review, focus groups and workshops and iterative feedback during development (<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Brandreth et al. 2013</xref>). The participatory approach based on a validated methodology used in education enabled user perspectives and experiences to be incorporated into the RLOs (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Keefe et al. 2008</xref>). Although this approach is labor intensive, it has been recognized that rich multimedia developed with high productions values has enormous power to engage learners and aid understanding (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Edelson &#x00026; Pittman 2001</xref>). The end product was seven high-quality production RLOs that included a range of multimedia to demonstrate concepts, meet specific learning objectives, and self-assessment of learning with an interactive quiz.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility of Using RLOs in an Audiology Clinic Sample</title><p>To assess the feasibility of the RLOs as an intervention for first time hearing aid users, we measured participant recruitment and retention, delivery and accessibility, take-up, acceptability, and adherence of the intervention. <italic>Recruitment</italic> of the participants in the present study differed from other studies that have evaluated remotely delivered educational programs. These generally recruited existing users by advertising through the media thereby recruiting later in the patient journey as well as running the risk of sampling biases, such as self-selection and being better educated (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It has been suggested that the timing of the delivery of educational support is most beneficial early on in the hearing aid user&#x02019;s journey (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>By recruiting participants prospectively, we aimed to recruit a representative sample of the typical hearing aid clinic population. However, compared with those who presented for hearing assessment, our recruited sample were younger, had better hearing, and there were fewer women. It is likely that these significant differences resulted from the study eligibility criteria. For example, despite our best efforts to maximise accessibility to the RLOs, the main reason for nonparticipation was because a large number of patients, around one-fifth, could not access the RLOs as they did not have access to a DVD player, PC, or internet. Although we expected PC and internet use to be low (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Henshaw et al. 2012</xref>), lack of access to DVD was poorer than expected given the percentage of households in the UK with DVDs in 2012 was 87% (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Statista 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Delivery</italic> and <italic>accessibility</italic> of RLOs using a solely online route was recognized at the outset as a barrier for many first-time hearing aid users, as we had shown previously that internet use in a large random sample (n = 473) of 65- to 74-year-olds was 26.2% (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Henshaw et al. 2012</xref>). This was much lower than a Swedish study of 41 volunteers ages 65 to 74 years that showed 78% used the internet (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2013</xref>). It is likely that these differences were due to the different volunteer recruitment criteria and methods. In the present study, internet use was higher than expected at 32.9%, similar to that of the 65- to 69-year age group (34%) reported by Henshaw et al., which reflected the average age of those who participated in the present study (M = 67.9 years).</p><p>Use of IT and smartphones is increasing in older adults (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Deloitte 2014</xref>), with epidemiological data on internet use showing a year-on-year increase in 55- to 74-year-olds (2010 = 61%, 2012 = 70%, 2014 = 78%), suggesting that teleaudiology has the potential to become more prevalent in this age group (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">UNECE 2015</xref>). However, for the short term at least, there remains a digital divide due to age (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Friemel 2014</xref>). To maximize accessibility and reduce barriers to educational resources for first-time hearing aid users, we propose that educational materials are developed across a range of flexible learning resources to future-proof the RLO concept. For those who have poor IT literacy, one option is to adapt the educational materials for a technology-free interactive booklet, although it should be noted in our present study that the majority (82%) preferred the RLOs to written information. Another option would be to take advantage of rapid technological developments that do not require IT skills but still allow interaction with RLOs, such as video e-cards. These are cardboard cards that can display graphics and sound via a small LCD (liquid&#x02013;crystal display) screen. For those with good IT literacy skills, the RLOs could be adapted from the current &#x0201c;one-size-fits-all&#x0201d; approach, into shorter chunks or &#x0201c;bytes&#x0201d; of information to enable individualized tailoring to maximise relevance to individuals, with delivery capability increased to include mobile technologies (e.g., smartphones, tablets).</p><p><italic>Take-up</italic>, estimated at 78%, was not measured directly but was assessed from those who were eligible and agreed to participate in the study. It is possible that without the additional research component the RLO take-up could have been even higher. In a service evaluation of the Nottingham Audiology Service where the RLOs in DVD format were paid for by the local NHS healthcare commissioning group and offered as part of standard care, the real-world take-up was indeed higher, at 90% (99/110). Seven people did not have the means to play the DVD, three did not want the DVD, and one could not understand English.</p><p><italic>Acceptability</italic> of the RLOs was high, as demonstrated by take-up, ratings of usefulness, usability and desirability, the feedback questionnaire and postevaluation focus groups. The highly useful RLO rating (8.9/10) was consistent with the usability descriptors where &#x0201c;useful&#x0201d; was listed in the top three choices. There was high agreement on the feedback questionnaire for all three RLO components (content, activity and engagement, self-assessment). Practically, the RLOs were not difficult to use and were pitched at the right level. In terms of impact on their everyday lives, participants agreed they would be more likely to contact Audiology, and the RLOs gave them more confidence to discuss hearing aids and communicate with others. This suggests the RLOs were more than simply a tool to enhance information and knowledge in that they also had a positive impact on other activities and actions in their lives. Improved confidence has been suggested to be a critical element in the success of an intervention (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Sweetow &#x00026; Sabes 2010</xref>), and <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. (2005)</xref> reported their home-education program increased confidence in dealing with hearing loss. Similar responses were reported during the focus groups with themes of reassurance and improved confidence, as well as sharing the RLOs with others. Although the open-ended feedback questionnaire and focus groups showed favorable results, we do recognize that there is a potential for response bias as participants had invested time in the research (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p><italic>Adherence</italic> in the RLO+ group was extremely high, with only two participants reporting a failure to watch the RLOs. However, it remains a possibility that some nonattenders did not attend because they had not watched the RLOs. If we make this assumption (although many reasons for nonattendance were unrelated to the study, e.g., health reasons), only 67% watched all the RLOs. One of the interesting findings was that RLO reuse was considerable with at least half watching the RLOs two or more times, and some using them up to six to seven times. This reusability, which was also evident in the postevaluation focus groups, suggests that the participants were using the RLOs as a means to self-manage their hearing loss, hearing aids, and communication. This is an important finding as it is recognized in other health domains that patients who are motivated and actively participate in their care are more likely to adopt health behaviors that then lead to better patient outcomes (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Mosen et al. 2007</xref>). This is particularly the case in patients with chronic conditions who are required to play a role in their day-to-day management, such as seen in those who have hearing difficulties.</p><p>It was notable that 78% said they would recommend the RLOs to others, and that sharing the RLOs with others and involving communication partners was a main theme from the focus groups. Most spouses report some degree of third-party disability (<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Scarinci et al. 2012</xref>), and the role of communication partners in the rehabilitation of people with hearing loss has been shown to be highly beneficial (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Armero 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Stark &#x00026; Hickson 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Scarinci et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, the RLOs may act as a facilitator for encouraging discussion and a shared understanding of hearing and communication with others. Many who watched the RLOs felt more confident to discuss hearing-related issues, and there was a positive appetite in the focus groups for RLOs specifically for communication partners.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of RLOs</title><p>Evaluation of effectiveness of the RLOs using the RCT showed no significant group differences for the primary outcome measure (GHABP hearing aid use), although there were no nonhearing aid users in the RLO+ compared with the RLO&#x02212; group (n = 5). However, for suboptimal users (GHABP hearing aid use &#x0003c;70%), there was significantly greater use in the intervention (RLO+) group compared with the control (RLO&#x02212;) group. It could be argued that improvements in hearing aid use were shown where it mattered, which is when hearing aid use is lower than it could be. This suggests that if clinical resources are limited, RLOs are best targeted at those who are less likely to use their hearing aids optimally. Difficulties in noisy situations and in background noise are a major reason for nonuse of hearing aids (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Vuorialho et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bertoli et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Linssen et al. 2013</xref>) and although there was greater use in the most complex listening situations (conversation in a group and busy street or shop), this was not significant after applying Bonferroni corrections.</p><p>There were benefits for the RLO+ compared with the RLO&#x02212; group in terms of significantly better practical hearing aid skills and better knowledge on hearing aids and communication. The effect sizes were generally large, which is important when considering implementing an intervention into clinical practice as the clinical significance of the intervention is as important, if not moreso, than the statistical significance (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al. 1984</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Sedgwick 2014</xref>).</p><p>For practical hearing aid skills, there was no group difference for hearing aid insertion/removal and battery functions, where both groups performed at ceiling. This probably reflects the importance audiologists place on ensuring that new users can manage the basics of hearing aid and battery insertion before leaving the clinic as an inability to do either renders the hearing aid virtually useless. Despite this, other studies have shown that difficulties with ear mold insertion and batteries are problematic in between 9 and 17% (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Vuorialho et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bertoli et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Desjardins &#x00026; Doherty 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Goggins &#x00026; Day 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the RLOs watched the most at 3+ times were Insertion and Getting to Know Your Hearing Aids, along with Hearing Aid Care and Troubleshooting. There were significant group differences shown in using the telephone and cleaning the ear mold and it is likely that these receive less attention from audiologists. Yet, the consequences of these are not trivial. Not being able to use the telephone with hearing aids is a major reason for hearing aid nonuse (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Kochkin 2000</xref>) and the most common reason for repairs appointments is poorly maintained hearing aids (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Block 2001</xref>), which also leads to hearing aid nonuse (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">McCormack &#x00026; Fortnum 2013</xref>). In a 3-year follow-up of hearing aid users, 85% needed further explanation on how to use phones and the need for regular retubing (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Goggins &#x00026; Day 2009</xref>). Of note, is that although the participants in the present study only recently acquired their hearing aids, the practical hearing aid skills in the control group were on average 10% higher than those reported in experienced users (78.6%; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Desjardins &#x00026; Doherty 2009</xref>). This may be because age was a significant factor in both studies, with our participants having a lower mean age 67.9 compared with 75.3 years in the Desjardins and Doherty study. This highlights the importance of early fitting of hearing aids early to minimize the effect of poor handling skills (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>Knowledge of psychosocial issues (e.g., how to improve communication) was significantly poorer than practical issues (e.g., frequency of tube replacement) in both groups. This suggests that either psychosocial issues receive less attention in hearing aid appointments or retention of knowledge of the more complex psychosocial issues is poorer. Either way those who received the RLOs had significantly better knowledge of hearing aids and communication 6-weeks postfitting, with large effect sizes, indicating that the RLOs facilitated improved knowledge and awareness of hearing-related issues. Furthermore, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that knowledge arising from educational guidance can increase confidence and set realistic expectations. It should be noted, however, that the mean total knowledge score in the RLO+ group of 58% and maximum score of 74% suggests there are still gaps in knowledge for most users. More research is needed to identify the impact of hearing-related knowledge on everyday life for new hearing aid users.</p><p>There were no between-group differences in the remaining hearing aid outcome measures (IOI-HA, HHIE, SADL). The results of the IOI-HA were similar to those reported in other studies of educational programs (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2011</xref>). However, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. (2014)</xref> reported some improvement on two of the items (residual participation restriction and impact on others) in those who received the improved online intervention. It may be that the IOI-HA is not sufficiently sensitive to detect incremental benefits over and above that of the hearing aid. Similarly, there was no group difference on satisfaction (SADL) or psychosocial wellbeing (HADS), consistent with the other studies (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al. 2011</xref>).

It may be that the RLOs do not reduce participation restrictions per se, or else the participants in the present study had fewer participation restrictions at the outset. Thor&#x000e9;n et al. specifically targeted those with greater difficulties and this may have accounted for some differences.</p><p>There were no between-group differences in the remaining hearing aid outcome measures (IOI-HA, HHIE, SADL).

Such a finding with the EQ-5D is not common in hearing research as the EQ-5D is usually insensitive to hearing-related interventions (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Chisolm et al. 2007</xref>). The relative gains in the incremental QALYs for the RLO+ compared with the RLO&#x02212; group were very small, but because the cost of the DVD is very low (set at &#x000a3;2/DVD for the analysis presented), the RLO intervention was dominant over the standard care because it provided a more effective and cheaper pathway. It may well be that a health-related quality of life measure that is more sensitive to hearing interventions, such as the Health Utilities Index (HUI3; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2007</xref>), would provide more robust cost-effectiveness results. However, from a health commissioner&#x02019;s perspective, the low cost of this intervention is unlikely to be a barrier to implement these RLOs into clinical practice.</p><p>The choice of outcome measures to assess the benefits of interventions is a major issue in adult rehabilitation research. There is no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; measure for &#x0201c;patient benefit&#x0201d; or consensus on which outcome measure(s) are optimal, and many studies use multiple measures to tap into different domains (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Granberg et al. 2014</xref>). However, even for a specific concept such as hearing aid use, systematic reviews have shown a lack of consistency and robustness in the way hearing aid use is assessed and categorized (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Perez &#x00026; Edmonds 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al. 2014</xref>). Outcome measures to assess patient benefit need to be sensitive and appropriate for the intended method of benefit, and must not be too easy nor too difficult (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2014</xref>). It may be that an overall measure of hearing aid use (whether subjective or objective) is simply not sensitive nor appropriate to show the benefits of RLOs.</p><p>The long-term vision is to have educational resources, such as these RLOs, available to all hearing aid users in the UK. To this end, we have partnered with industrial and third sector partners and the RLOs, now branded as &#x0201c;C2Hear,&#x0201d; have been available to the UK audiology centers (NHS and independent sector) since end of 2014. An online version (C2Hear Online) is now freely available on YouTube. Further research needs to done to identify real-world benefits in a late phase clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There were a number of limitations in this research. First of all, there was no active control group, so the participants could not be blinded with respect to the intervention. Similarly, although a number of precautions were taken to blind the research audiologists to the intervention and control groups (e.g., clinical audiologists recruited and randomized the patients and the research audiologists performed the evaluations), the explicit request for participants not to reveal their group was not always successful. A double-blind trial with an active control group (e.g., multimedia activities not associated with hearing) should be considered in future studies of this type. There was no long-term follow-up, which has been identified as major problem in hearing rehabilitation research (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al. 2014</xref>). This was due primarily to limitations of time and funds imposed by the grant funding stream. However, in view of results from other patient education studies, which showed improvements in outcomes that were not evident shortly after the intervention but were revealed some months later (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al. 2014</xref>), any future studies of this nature should include a long-term follow-up of at least 6 months. Despite a prospective study design, the study sample was not representative of the typical clinic population. Finally, cognitive abilities, which were not tested, could have helped inform whether cognition was a factor in the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Research</title><p>With the increasing functionality available of online and smartphone technology, there are a number of potential future developments. Individualized tailoring of resources would provide a more user-centered intervention to meet individuals&#x02019; needs rather than the current &#x0201c;one-size-fits-all&#x0201d; approach taken in this research. This would allow the more technologically able to explore new technologies and reduce the basics, whereas for the less able, the converse would be more relevant. New technological developments in multilingual mobile translation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht et al. 2013</xref>) could also address those who have poor understanding of English, around 6% in this study. Indeed for this disadvantaged group, RLOs specific to their native language would be a very helpful facilitator in the delivery of hearing healthcare information. There was a clear involvement of communication partners, and focus groups were highly in favor of RLOs specifically targeted for communication partners. Development of these is currently underway. A pilot study of the RLOs used by care staff in residential care homes showed highly significant improvements in knowledge of hearing aids and communication (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rocks &#x00026; Ferguson 2013</xref>). As around 10% of patients were unable to participate due to cognitive decline, the use of the RLOs could extend to caregivers, including family members as well as professional care workers. Other healthcare professionals, such as family doctors, could also benefit from tailored RLOs to highlight the need for early onward referral to Audiology, as only around 50% of 55- to 74-year-olds with significant hearing loss are referred (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2007</xref>). Finally, there is the opportunity for RLOs to help increase public awareness more generally to address the huge public health issues around hearing loss.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study developed an educational program for first-time hearing aid users based on the concept of RLOs. This concept has been trialed for the first time in audiology in one of the largest RCTs of an educational intervention for individualized use in adult auditory rehabilitation to date.
