Resistance training programs are specific to training goals of individuals and their daily physical demands <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>. A resistance training program can be described with many acute training variables such as training intensity, volume, repetition numbers, rest intervals, contraction speed and other variables <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is regarded that to achieve optimal muscle hypertrophy and strength, exercise intensity should be middle to high (&#x02265;65% of 1 RM) <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>, these authors suggested that mechanical stimuli are essential and represent the major determinant of resistance training adaptation <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>. For this reason, some middle-high intensity resistance exercises like traditional and normal methods with different concentric and eccentric duration time have been introduced <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. In contrast, some researchers have claimed metabolic and hormonal changes are important for hypertrophy and strength gain as well <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. For this claim, several resistance training methods have been developed like slow, super slow and modified vascular occlusion to compare metabolic and hormonal changes <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. The similarity between these methods is the training intensity being low to middle (20-50% of 1 RM).</p><p>Recent studies indicate that low intensity resistance exercise induces muscle hypertrophy and strength when exercise combined with partial vascular occlusion or performed at slow velocity. Slow training methods are more practical in the weight room because neither tourniquet nor monitoring is required <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. [Using tourniquet or garrote during resistance exercises is not usual particularly in study. But, in clubs could increase artificial ischemia and caus more anabolic and metabolic responses. In this regard, scientists reported that these responses are essential for hypertrophy.] Goto et al compared hormonal and metabolic changes between low intensity with slow method (SL, 50% 1 RM, 3s for each concentric and eccentric phase) and high intensity with normal method (NH, 80% 1 RM, 1s for each concentric and eccentric action), these authors concluded that circulating catecholamine and anabolic hormones increased more after SL than NH method <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>. Although training intensity and pressure on joints was lower in SL method than NH method because of the different intensity and volume which was used <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, Tanmito and Ishii and Westcott reported that slow resistance training ends in considerable hypertrophy and strength <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. Goto et al found that slow method increased the serum concentration of growth hormone (GH) and free testosterone whereas the anabolic response after NH method was lower than SL method. Their study's results revealed that extending time under tension (TUT) is an important factor that can stimulate anabolic hormone responses in resistance exercise <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Mazetti et al revealed slow resistance exercise as the most fatiguing method. This fatigue might prompt hormonal and metabolic changes that are important for acute and chronic adaptation like hypertrophy and strength gain <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Insight into training protocols may be initially gained by monitoring the acute muscle fatigue because of its association with strength enhancement. The reduction of integrated electromyography (IEMG) immediately following the training protocols could present development of central fatigue <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. Authors assumed that slow method might be the cause for lower neural activation (IEMG) with prolonged period of muscle tension, but no authors have not examined this hypothesis so far <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, several researchers have compared slow method with normal and traditional methods regarding hormonal and metabolic changes <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>, but neuromuscular responses were not assessed <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to assess neuromuscular and metabolic responses to slow, traditional and normal resistance exercise methods, this study compared acute responses among three methods and we expected that the observed results may provide some possible insights into chronic training adaptations.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>METHODS AND SUBJECTS</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty four male recreational athletes voluntarily participated in this study (of mean &#x000b1; standard deviation: age 23.59 &#x000b1; 0.87 years, height 172.75 &#x000b1; 5.80 cm, body mass 68.73 &#x000b1; 7.42 kg) participated in this study, all the subjects were physically active and familiar with resistance training, but they had not participated in a regular resistance training program for six months before the beginning the study.

Before testing, subjects performed three warm-up sets on the knee extension machine using low-moderate weights. The subject<sup>&#x02019;</sup>s 1RM was determined by allowing three attempts to lift the heaviest weight by trial and error procedure. Range of motion was from 90&#x000b0; to 0&#x000b0; (0&#x000b0; at full extension). Their upper body was fixed with a comfortable and special belt. Subjects used their natural concentric and eccentric repetition speed to perform all warm up and 1 RM attempts and rested 3 minutes between sets.

Volume load was calculated by load x repetition &#x000d7; set number. However, in this research we also compared work considering time under tension (volume load x time). Contraction speed has been monitored with the aid of metronome at a defined constant velocity during each method and an experienced assistant who announced the end of CON and ECC action.

The main findings of this study were that high intensity resistance exercises (TH and NH methods) induced greater lactate response compared to low intensity method (SL). Additionally, number of repetitions and neuromuscular response in SL method was similar to other two types of resistance exercise methods.</p><p>The acute changes in the neuromuscular system that selectively optimize chronic adaptation of the nervous system are not clearly known <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. Electromyography represents the electrical properties of the muscle and is often used to monitor central drive because of the relationship between the amplitude of the surface EMG and the net motor activity <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>. Fatigue protocols result in decrease in IEMG <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>, previous researches have observed that the magnitude and source of such fatigue may vary when different contraction type, intensity, repetition, speed and rest period are manipulated in resistance exercise protocols <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>High intensity resistance exercise has appeared to elicit strength gain and increase muscle unit activation (MUA). Also, it is known to stimulate type II muscle fibers. Therefore, high intensity resistance exercise optimizes nervous system adaptation <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, low intensity resistance exercise with slow or modified ischemic manner perhaps prompts peripheral fatigue and increases strength through muscle morphology and cross sectional area and anabolic hormone changes <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Considering the literature, it is hypothesized that high intensity method may result in greater fatigue due to central origin <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup>. In this research, all protocols resulted in significant decrease in IEMG but not significantly different from each other. The results of IEMG suggest that temporary decline in voluntary muscle activation may be caused by central fatigue. However, it was not specific to any protocols. Therefore, in this study it was revealed that central fatigue is not influenced by manipulating TUT or exercise intensity. In our findings it is assumed that although, total volume and load in SL method was lower than NH and TH methods, perhaps increase in concentric and eccentric action time (TUT) compensate for the low intensity and little volume load in SL method and could make acute neuromuscular response similar to high intensity methods (NH and TH).</p><p>The current data on IEMG are in agreement with previous studies that have elicited neuromuscular fatigue by using IEMG as a fatigue index <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. But caution should be advised because some authors suggested that median frequency (MF) is a better index than IEMG for neuromuscular fatigue <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup>. Above all, some investigators used IEMG as acute neuromuscular response and somewhere as fatigue index <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that plasma lactate concentration increased significantly following all methods, but this increment was lower in low-intensity slow (SL) group than the other two high intensity groups (NH and TH). There are contradictory findings about lactate changes following SL and high intensity methods (NH and TH) <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Goto et al (2009) and Hunter et al (2003) found that high intensity (TH and NH) exercises increased blood lactate concentration more than SL method <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>. Their results are in agreement with our findings. In contrast, some authors like Tanmito et al (2005) found no significant differences between TH and SL methods on lactate responses <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore Mazzeti et al (2007) found that SL increased blood lactate concentration significantly more than high speed resistance exercise <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. The discrepancy between the present results and other studies could be due to methodological differences. For instance, Tanmito et al (2005) used three sets, but there are four sets in the current study. Or Mazzeti et al (2007) used higher intensity in SL method (60% of 1 RM).</p><p>The higher lactate production response to high-intensity exercise (NH and TH), may reflect more peripheral fatigue which is caused following TH and NH methods than SL method. Although lactate may not be a direct promoter of muscle adaptations, it may be used as marker of metabolic stress. This assumption was based on previous findings that reported elevated responses of lactate and other metabolites involved that stimulating increase in muscle size and strength <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>. In this study it was revealed that NH and TH methods could make a higher metabolic stress than SL method.</p><p>Results indicate that plasma glucose concentration increased following each method, but between-group difference was not seen. To our knowledge, just one study compared blood glucose response to SL and high intensity (NH) forms of exercises <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>, its results agree with our findings.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, training volume and intensity are the most important variables in resistance training program design <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>. Scientists have suggested a different definition of training volume <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup>. It is most commonly calculated by load x repetition number and expressed as volume load. Also, it is computed by the cumulative time that a muscle group is under tension or all contraction time during a training session that is named TUT. In this research we compared volume load (sets x repetition x load) and work considering time under tension (volume load x repetition time). Training volume is one of the major determinants of hypertrophy and strength gain. Each set in this study was carried out to failure point, furthermore, training intensity was different in each method, so training volume was different in three protocols <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Tran et al (2007) concluded that training volume is a more important stimulus than TUT in resistance training and they suggested when training volume is equated, TUT is the major determinant of neuromuscular changes <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup>. According to the present findings, the NH method provided a greater volume load than SL and TH methods, and the TH and SL method provided greater work considering time under tension than NH method. This could be caused by the higher TUT achieved with SL and TH when compared with lower duration methods (NH). We concluded that an increase in repetition duration (contraction time) declines volume load that can be displaced. The findings of Goto et al (2009) and Hatfield et al (2006) would support this suggestion <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The other finding of this research was that SL method could decrease total number of repetition as much as NH and TH methods, although exercise intensity was lower in SL rather than the other two methods (50% of 1 RM and 80% of 1 RM respectively). This may be because of TUT that makes resistance exercise more fatiguing, as some researchers proved this finding <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. They concluded that increasing TUT could decrease total number of repetition as much as high intensity method in a fast manner. Hatfiled et al (2006) resulted that the more time under tension, the less volume load can be displaced and Mazzetti et al (2007) reported that SL method made greater fatigue than high intensity methods <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>. Perhaps, this is why some authors suggest that the slow method must be performed with low intensity (&#x0003c;50% of 1 RM) <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup>.</p><sec id="S20015"><title>Practical applications</title><p>According to the stimulus-tension theory, the intensity and duration of the muscular tension are responsible for neural and morphological adaptations <sup>[<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. The interesting finding of this study is that SL method could stimulate IEMG as much as NH and TH methods. Although, training intensity, volume and pressure on joints was lower. The other interesting finding of this research is that SL method could decrease total number of repetition as much as NH and TH methods, even though exercise intensity was lower in SL. This is maybe because of more fatigue caused by SL than high speed methods. These results indicate that high intensity resistance exercise causes higher lactate response, but slow resistance exercise method could induce acute neuromuscular response as much as high intensity methods. It seems that this method will be advantageous for those who want to increase acute neuromuscular changes with low exercise intensity and volume.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0016"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study showed that the SL method caused similar IEMG responses when compared to the two other methods, but high intensity methods increased more metabolic response (lactate) than SL method. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the chronic adaptations of SL, TH and NH to test if the acute differences in selected physiological parameters reflect on increase in muscle size and strength.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to gratefully thank the Physical Education staff at University of Guilan for their close interactions, and
