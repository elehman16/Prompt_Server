Participants were 40 men and 10 women, 18-65 years at the time of screening, with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (paranoid or nonparanoid subtype), based on the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV-TR,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for at least 2 years. These patients were selected among 200 patients of Schizophrenia after checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The acute symptoms of illness were controlled by typical antipsychotics at least for 1-month. All the participants were required to have a positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score of more than 60 and a negative subscale score of more than 15.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Patients were treated with typical antipsychotics before randomization and remained on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before randomization and throughout the trial. Women of childbearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening. Criteria for exclusion were, any chronic untreated medical condition; substance dependency; any other psychiatric disorder in Axis I or II; use of any medications identified as contraindicated to buspirone; any abnormalities in vital sign or electrocardiogram. Pregnant or lactating women and those of reproductive age without adequate contraception were excluded. After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was provided by patients, guardians or legally authorized representative. The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. This trial was registered with the Iranian Clinical Trial Registry (IRCT201106026691N1).</p><p>Eligible patients were assigned to receive either placebo or buspirone. We randomized the patients using permuted blocks. We wrote the type of intervention on a paper and put it in a black sealed box and along with every patient who entered the study we picked a box. Twenty-five patients were randomly allocated to typical antipsychotic medication and buspirone 30 mg/day (3 times a day) and 25 patients were chosen to receive typical antipsychotics plus placebo. Patients received buspirone with dosing titration as follows: 1<sup>st</sup> week 5 mg twice daily, and the dosage was then increased to 30 mg/day after 1-week the patients in the placebo group received identical tablets. One patient (in buspirone group) dropped out of the study due to headache and vertigo which relieved after the medication stopped. All patients were assessed at the baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the start of medication by a psychiatry resident.</p><p>The PANSS is a 30-item scale, developed to assess both the positive and negative syndromes of patients with schizophrenia. The PANSS total score is rated based on a structured clinical interview with the patient (conducted by a resident of psychiatry). Each item is scored on a continuous 7-point scale and provides evaluation of positive and negative symptoms, as well as general psychopathology. The PANSS rating scale has been used in several studies in Iran, and it has high reliability and validity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Simpson-Angus scale (SAS), assessment of mental state and global functioning were performed using the mini mental state examination (MMSE) scale.

There were no differences between two groups in sex, age, marital status, and subtype of schizophrenia. Therapy with 30 mg of buspirone/day was very well-tolerated, and no clinically important adverse effect was seen. It is possible that the participants in this study (patients with chronic schizophrenia with moderate residual positive and negative symptoms) may not have been the optimal population for studying the effect of buspirone, and this could be considered as one of the limitations of this study.</p><p>In the agreement with our results, Ghaleiha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] found improvement in the negative, positive, general, and total scores of PANSS during an 8-week trial. They treated 46 patients with chronic schizophrenia by 6 mg/day risperidone and up to 60 mg/day buspirone. Brody <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] administered 10-60 mg of buspirone to seven patients with schizophrenia and reported no improvement in positive and negative symptoms throughout 4-week study.</p><p>In the study of Ghaleiha <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] it has been suggested that, low doses of buspirone (&#x0003c;30 mg/day) induce serotoninergic effects, whereas high doses (&#x0003e;30 mg/day) may induce postsynaptic dopaminergic antagonism as well. Maybe the low dose of buspirone in our study (30 mg/day) was the reason that there was no improvement in positive symptoms of patients in our study.</p><p>Piskulic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] added 15-30 mg/day buspirone to the ongoing treatment with atypical antipsychotics in a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They found no statistically significant differences between placebo and buspirone group on cognitive function measures. As noted above, most of the studies on the effect of buspirone had been on atypical antipsychotics which have an overlapping effect with buspirone in 5HT1A agonism. To our knowledge, there have been only two studies on buspirone added to typical antipsychotics. One has been done by Goff <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It was an open 6-week trial with an adjunct of 30 mg/day buspirone to a stable dose of typical antipsychotics and reported a modest decrease of clinical ratings of positive symptoms in 20 schizophrenic patients. Another study was carried out by Sirota <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] 13 patients with schizophrenia who were receiving haloperidol, received up to 100 mg/day buspirone and there was a decrease in the mean PANSS score and all 3 subscales during a 6-week trial this study had no control group.</p><p>In the present study, we used a triple-blind method to collect and evaluate the subjects. We also had a control group which was a match to our intervention group regarding sex, age, marital status, and type of schizophrenia. Four scales including MMSE, PANSS, SAS, Global Assessment of Functioning were assessed in this study.</p><p>The limitations of this study are short duration of the study, studying the chronic patients with moderate residual symptoms which indicate the need for further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Buspirone has been shown to be effective in the improvement of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
