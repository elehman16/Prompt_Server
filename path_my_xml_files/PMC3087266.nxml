The effect of the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on improving partial pressure of oxygen (PO<sub>2</sub>) is well established. However, not many similar studies have been done in pregnant women in this regard and also to know its effect on foetus. In this randomised double blind controlled study, we analysed effect of the application of PEEP during pre-oxygenation on the maternal PO<sub>2</sub>and umbilical venous PO<sub>2</sub>in foetus.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>The prospective randomised controlled was commenced after obtaining approval from hospital ethical committee. Written informed consent was taken from all the patients.</p><p>40 term pregnant women, ASA I or II, undergoing elective lower segment Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided in to PEEP and Non-PEEP groups of 20 each.</p><p>Parturients with cardiopulmonary diseases, pre-eclampsia, anaemia, haemoglobinopathies, history of smoking, ante-partum haemorrhage, multiple gestations, antenatally diagnosed placental anomalies, hyper maturity of placenta, with foetal distress and any condition which likely to compromise foetal oxygenation were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients kept 8 hours Pre-operative fasting. Observer (Resident Anesthesiologist) premedicated Parturient with tab ranitidine 150mg and tab. metoclopramide 10mg orally hr before surgery. Parturients were randomly divided into either of the two groups by drawing shuffled sealed lots and were shifted in left lateral position to the operating room and standard monitors were connected. Baseline vitals were recorded. Intravenous line was secured on non-dominant hand and all patients were preloaded with 15ml kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight lactated Ringer's solution. An arterial line was secured in radial artery of non-dominant hand with 20 gauge cannula and maternal arterial blood sample was taken for baseline blood gas analysis. Spinal anaesthesia was performed in left lateral position with 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) by observer 2 (Consultant Anesthesiologist). We aimed for a sensory block of T4 -T5 dermatome level. Immediately after giving the spinal anaesthesia patients were positioned supine with 15&#x000b0; lateral tilt of operating table. Hypotension (more than 20% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure from the baseline) was managed with boluses of ringer's lactate solution(crystalloid) followed by boluses of 6mg ephedrine as required and the intervention details were recorded.</p><p>After positioning supine, PEEP group received oxygen flow of 6 L/minute with 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O PEEP using a modified Mapleson's A circuit with a fixed unidirectional PEEP valve (Armstrong medical&#x02122;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) at the expiratory port during pre-oxygenation and Non PEEP group received the same fresh gas flow of oxygen without PEEP using the same breathing circuit. Observer 2 applied facemask and maintained it tight sealing during the pre-oxygenation till baby delivery. All patients breathed oxygen via mask at normal tidal volume and rate during pre-oxygenation with closed mouth.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Modified Mapleson's A circuit with a fixed unidirectional PEEP valve (Armstrong medical&#x02122;)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-26-470-g001"/></fig><p>Another maternal arterial blood sample was collected at the end of 5 minutes of facemask application for Po<sub>2</sub>analysis.</p><p>Inability to maintain tight mask fit at any time, inadequate spinal anaesthesia and further administration of general anaesthesia were excluded from the study.</p><p>The timings of spinal anaesthesia, pre-oxygenation, uterine incision, baby delivery and intervals between these were noted using a stopwatch.</p><p>Immediately after delivery of the baby obstetrician triple clamped the umbilical cord with an extra cord clamp at 10 centimetres proximally towards the placental side. The umbilical cord was cut between the two distal clamps. Umbilical venous samples were taken for blood gas analysis between the two clamps by obstetrician.</p><p>Observer 3 (Resident Paediatrician) who was blinded regarding the pre-oxygenation sequence assessed the newborn's Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes and recorded the birth weight.</p><p>After the delivery, the mothers in PEEP group were made to breathe 100% oxygen via the same circuit with out PEEP for 3 minutes and those in Non-PEEP group were made to breathe from the same circuit with 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O PEEP for 3 minutes to assess the compliance of the mothers to simple mask holding and mask holding with application of PEEP. Compliance to mask holding and compliance to PEEP application were recorded separately</p><p>Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were analysed using Roche omni C&#x02122; blood gas analyser immediately after sampling.</p><p>Independent sample t-test was used in analysing the demographic data, comparison of time intervals, maternal and umbilical blood gas analysis data, birth weight of newborn. Pearson Chi-square test was used in analysing the comparison of crystalloid bolus requirement. Fisher's Exact test was used in the comparison of requirement of ephedrine and atropine as well as analysing the maternal compliance to PEEP application and conventional mask holding.

Study by Ramanathan S et al regarding the optimum FIO<sub>2</sub> for Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia showed a linear increase in foetal oxygenation with the appraisal of maternal PaO<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>. Later, the existence of such an increase and its merits and demerits were questioned by many other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>.</p><p>In our study, we evaluated whether the application of PEEP improves maternal and foetal PO<sub>2</sub>in comparison with a control of Non-PEEP group during spinal anaesthesia. We started supplementing 100% oxygen after established spinal anaesthesia and this may not exactly replicate a pre-oxygenation before general anaesthesia. This is because in our study, the spinal anaesthesia was aimed at T4 -T5 dermatomal level, which might interfere with the normal breathing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>.</p><p>Shelley and Gutsche states that 6 min of oxygen inhalation is required for equilibration of foetal oxygen levels after the change in maternal values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. Myers et al studying Rhesus monkeys showed that maternal administration of oxygen increases foetal tissue PO<sub>2</sub>beginning within 60 seconds and equilibrating with 3 minutes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Longo and Power constructed a systems model of placental O<sub>2</sub>transfer and suggest that foetal oxygen levels completely respond within 75 seconds to changes in umbilical oxygen supply<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>. Norris et al have shown that in the parturient both 3 min of oxygen breathing and the four-deep breath, 30-s technique are adequate for pre-oxygenation prior to rapid sequence induction of general endotracheal anaesthesia for Caesarean section<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. Considering those factors we decided to take maternal blood samples after 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation for blood gas analysis. Maternal PaO<sub>2</sub> in PEEP group after 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation was slightly more than Non-PEEP group (491.65&#x000b1;49.96 versus 452.08&#x000b1;77.6). Even though the values were not showing a significant difference statistically, a difference of 39 mmHg is seen between the groups which can be of clinical importance in a difficult intubation situation.</p><p>The umbilical venous PO<sub>2</sub> in PEEP group was found to be significantly higher than Non-PEEP group (34.22&#x000b1;6.50 versus 28.29&#x000b1;6.10). This showed that pre-oxygenating with PEEP increases the umbilical venous PO<sub>2</sub>. There were no findings of foetal distress and all babies were having a normal Apgar score. The umbilical venous blood pH also was comparable between both groups. Question may arise as when there is no significant difference in the maternal PO<sub>2</sub> how can there be a significant difference in the umbilical venous PO2? A probable explanation for this is as the mother is breathing 100% O<sub>2</sub> there could have been formation of absorption atelectasis which was prevented by applying PEEP. So in our patients the elevated PaO<sub>2</sub> at 5 minutes of oxygen may not have sustained in Non-PEEP group because of possible atelectasis formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>. But such an existence of atelectasis is not analysed directly in our study.</p><p>We consider that the compliance of the mother to the pre-oxygenation techniques will be a significant confounding factor for the efficacy of the techniques. We collected data regarding the need of reassurance for the mother for either of the techniques. An interchanging of the techniques of oxygen application was conducted immediately after the delivery. Our study showed that there was a clinically significant increase in the number of mothers needed reassurance with PEEP application when compared with Non-PEEP group. We consider that non- compliance can be a factor which needs attention in subjecting an already distressed mother to the PEEP application. In such a situation one has to weigh the risks and benefits of the PEEP, individualising to the situation.</p><p>In summary our study showed that application of PEEP during pre-oxygenation for spinal anaesthesia can increase maternal arterial PO<sub>2</sub>and foetal umbilical venous PO<sub>2</sub> when compared to Non-PEEP Group and is tolerated by majority of the individuals studied.</p><p><bold>Authors disclosure</bold>: Authors have no conflict of interest &#x00026; financial consideration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref
