Despite this, surveys of emergency clinicians suggest that provision of adequate procedural analgesia is often inconsistent and suboptimal. While many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various interventions to reduce pain and distress in adults, there have been few studies in the pediatric population. There are currently no studies comparing the effectiveness of a local anesthetic nasal spray for the prevention of the pain and distress associated with NGT insertion in children. This study aims to compare the analgesic efficacy of a proprietary preparation of lignocaine/phenylephrine nasal spray and placebo for this indication.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind superiority trial of 100 children aged 6&#x000a0;months to 5&#x000a0;years weighing at least 6&#x000a0;kg in whom a nasogastric tube is planned to be inserted. These children will be randomized to either intranasal lignocaine/phenylephrine or placebo. Pain severity is the primary outcome measure and will be measured utilizing the Face, Legs, Arms, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) pain severity rating scale. An independent staff member not involved in inserting the NGT and the child&#x02019;s parents or carer will also record pain and distress on a visual analog scale (VAS). FLACC scores and VAS scores will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Non-normally distributed scores will be compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Despite this, surveys of emergency physicians and trainees suggest that provision of adequate procedural analgesia is inconsistent and suboptimal in many instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There have been many studies examining the effect of various interventions to reduce the pain and distress of nasogastric tube insertion in adults. Most published interventions in adult patients involve some sort of local anesthetic administration with the use of topical nasal spray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], nebulization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], or a gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These are all more effective than a placebo; however, the relative superiority of one method over another is yet to be clearly demonstrated. More recently, intranasal ketamine (50&#x000a0;mg) was also found to be more effective than a placebo in reducing the discomfort of nasogastric tube insertion in 72 adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The pediatric literature is limited, with only one study published in 2009. Babl and colleagues compared nebulized lignocaine vs. placebo in a pediatric emergency department population. The study was terminated early, before the intended 52 subjects had been enrolled, because of staff concern about the level of patient distress during nebulization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Children appear less able to tolerate nebulized therapy.</p><p>Interestingly, children also appear to have different responses to topical local anesthetic application for painful mucosal conditions. A recently published trial by Hopper and colleagues demonstrated no difference in oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth ulcers when administered viscous lignocaine compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>There are currently no studies comparing the effectiveness of a local anesthetic nasal spray for the prevention of pain and distress associated with nasogastric tube insertion in children. This study aims to compare the analgesic efficacy of a proprietary preparation of lignocaine/phenylephrine nasal spray and placebo for this indication. It is hypothesized that intranasal lignocaine/phenylephrine spray will be more effective than intranasal placebo in the prevention of pain and distress associated with nasogastric tube insertion in children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind superiority trial.

It is administered by a pump-actuated topical spray. The nozzle spray attachment provides 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l per spray.

Twenty spray bottles will be prepared monthly by the pharmacy. Each month unused spray bottles will be deemed expired and destroyed by the pharmacy. Spray bottle numbers not used will be documented and later re-made (with the same allocation) until all 100 spray bottle numbers are accounted for.
