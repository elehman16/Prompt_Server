Biosimilars are biologics with similar quality, safety, and efficacy to a reference product that may increase the affordability of treatment compared with their reference compounds. There are currently no approved biosimilars of pegfilgrastim in highly regulated markets. No previous phase III studies have been performed with LA-EP2006. PROTECT-2 was conducted to confirm the similarity of the proposed biosimilar LA-EP2006 to pegfilgrastim. Biosimilar pegfilgrastim (LA-EP2006) may benefit oncology patients by offering increased access to biological treatments that may improve clinical outcomes. This means that patients could potentially be treated prophylactically with biologics rather than only after complications have occurred.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</kwd><kwd>Pegfilgrastim</kwd><kwd>Neutropenia</kwd><kwd>Biosimilars</kwd><kwd>Breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="Intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biosimilars are biologics with highly similar quality, safety, and efficacy to a reference product [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The development of biosimilars follows a stepwise approach including analytical comparison with the reference and an iterative process to achieve a product that is essentially the same as the reference [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Clinical trials in support of this stepwise process are focused on confirming this similarity so that the totality of data reinforce that the biosimilar is essentially the same biological substance as the reference product [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The clinical trial reported here was conducted to confirm the similarity of a proposed biosimilar to commercial pegfilgrastim.</p><p>The recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), filgrastim, and its pegylated form, pegfilgrastim, are widely used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Filgrastim undergoes rapid renal clearance and requires daily administration during chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim is mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, with renal clearance playing only a minor role, resulting in a long serum half-life. Clinical evidence shows that pegfilgrastim has a comparable efficacy and safety profile to filgrastim, but its longer half-life allows once-per-chemotherapy-cycle administration [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], thereby offering greater convenience, which may translate into better patient compliance and improved clinical outcomes [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Biosimilars of filgrastim, based on the reference product Neupogen, have been available in Europe since 2009, but in highly regulated markets there are currently no approved biosimilars of pegfilgrastim.</p><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind, multinational multicenter confirmatory efficacy and safety study was a head-to-head comparison of a proposed biosimilar pegfilgrastim, LA-EP2006, with the reference product (Neulasta).

The safety follow-up visit was performed 4 weeks after the final administration of pegfilgrastim. Immunogenicity of pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was assessed by a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for screening and confirmation of binding antipegfilgrastim antibodies and a validated cell-based neutralization antibody assay.

Because of the different regulatory requirements in the U.S. and Europe, equivalence was assessed using two-sided 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in the mean DSN, with LA-EP2006 considered equivalent to reference pegfilgrastim if CIs were within the predefined margin of 1 day. A sample size of 302 patients was considered sufficient to achieve 90% power for testing of equivalence (two one-sided tests) at the 2.5% significance level, assuming no difference in mean DSN between treatments with a common SD of 1.6 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment group, region, chemotherapy, and baseline ANC as factors, with corresponding 90% and 95% CIs based on the residual standard error and adjusted least squares means of the ANCOVA.

DSN in cycle 1 was also consistent with other studies of pegfilgrastim in which mean DSN in the first cycle ranged from 1.3 to 1.8 days [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These previous studies did not include cyclophosphamide or dose adaptations in the chemotherapy regimen. Our results with LA-EP2006 therefore support consistency in duration of DSN across studies with different regimens, including TAC, which has an increased risk of neutropenia compared with other combination chemotherapy treatments [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given the equivalence between the two arms with regard to primary and secondary endpoints and the known clinical benefits of G-CSF, these results can be applied to many chemotherapy regimens that result in high rates of febrile neutropenia, independent of tumor type. The secondary efficacy endpoints were also similar between LA-EP2006 and reference pegfilgrastim. The incidence of FN/NS in cycle 1 was less than 10% (7.7% and 9.8% for LA-EP2006 and reference), which is comparable to that observed in other studies with reference pegfilgrastim (7.0%&#x02013;9.1%) [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, depth of ANC nadir and time to ANC recovery of LA-EP2006 versus reference pegfilgrastim were nearly identical (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1634/theoncologist.2016-0011/-/DC1">supplemental online Fig. 1</ext-link>).</p><p>The safety profile was comparable between treatment groups and as expected for patients with breast cancer receiving TAC chemotherapy, with the most common TEAEs being alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, asthenia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Pegfilgrastim-related AEs with LA-EP2006 were similar to those in the reference group and consistent with the known safety profile of the G-CSF class [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most common pegfilgrastim-related TEAEs were recorded in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders system organ class (16.1% in the LA-EP2006 group vs 13.7% in the reference group). The reported incidence of musculoskeletal/bone pain was lower than in other studies of pegfilgrastim in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens other than TAC (range 25%&#x02013;38%) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, there may be some limitations in comparing across different clinical trials because of differences in reporting of musculoskeletal/bone pain, recording of adverse events, patient populations, chemotherapy regimens, and clinical settings.</p><p>No treatment-related binding and neutralizing antibodies against pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or PEG were detected during the study, which confirmed the low immunogenic potential of LA-EP2006. These findings are consistent with previous studies of pegfilgrastim in which no neutralizing antibodies were detected [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the 6 years of clinical experience with the biosimilar filgrastim EP2006, which includes the same filgrastim protein as in LA-EP2006.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that LA-EP2006 and reference pegfilgrastim are therapeutically equivalent and similar regarding efficacy and safety in the prevention of neutropenia in patients with breast cancer receiving TAC chemotherapy.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.TheOncologist.com">http://www.TheOncologist.com</ext-link> for supplemental material available online.</p></boxed-text></sec>
