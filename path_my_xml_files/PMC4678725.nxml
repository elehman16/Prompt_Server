Metallic resterilizible metallic vacuum cups have been routinely used in France. In the last few years a new disposable semi-soft vacuum extraction cup, the iCup, has been introduced. Our objective was to compare maternal and new-born outcomes between this disposable cup and the commonly used Drapier-Faure metallic cup.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective randomized controlled open clinical trial performed in the maternity units of five university hospitals and one community hospital in France from October 2009 to February 2013. We included consecutive eligible women with a singleton gestation of at least 37&#x000a0;weeks who required vacuum assisted delivery. Women were randomized to <bold>v</bold>acuum extraction using the iCup or usual Drapier-Faure metallic cup. The primary outcome was a composite criterion including both the risk of cup dysfunction and the most frequent maternal and neonatal harms: the use of other instruments after attempted vacuum extraction, caesarean section after attempted vacuum extraction, three detachments of the cup, caput succedaneum, cephalohaematoma, episiotomy and perineal tears.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>335 women were randomized to the disposable cup and 333 to extraction using the metallic cup. There was no significant difference between the two groups for the primary outcome. However, failed instrumental delivery was more frequent in the disposable cup group, mainly due to detachment: 35.6&#x000a0;% vs 7.1&#x000a0;%, <italic>p&#x02009;&#x0003c;</italic>&#x02009;0.0001. Conversely, perineal tears were more frequent in the metallic cup group, especially third or fourth grade perineal tears: 1.7&#x000a0;% versus 5.0&#x000a0;%, <italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.003. There were no significant differences between the two groups concerning post-partum haemorrhage, transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>While the disposable cup had more detachments and extraction failures than the standard metallic cup, this innovative disposable device had the advantage of fewer perineal injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01058200?term=NCT01058200&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01058200</ext-link> on Jan. 27 2010.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-015-0771-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vacuum extraction</kwd><kwd>Delivery</kwd><kwd>Obstetrical</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Instrumental vaginal delivery is common practice worldwide for both maternal and foetal indications, and the instrument chosen depends on the indication, the pros and cons of each instrument and the choice of the operator. Currently, instrumental extraction is used in about 16&#x000a0;% of the 860 000 annual deliveries in France and ventouse extraction represents 40&#x000a0;% of assisted vaginal deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More recent data from the same registry described: 13.1&#x000a0;% of instrumental deliveries, of which 38.3&#x000a0;% were vacuum cup extraction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.audipog.net/">http://www.audipog.net/</ext-link>). While the use of forceps is accompanied by fewer extraction failures, the use of a ventouse is associated with less maternal or neonatal trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In France the most frequently used metallic cup is the Drapier-Faure MiniCup&#x000ae; (Collin-Gentile-Drapier, Paris, France). It has a rigid cup with a vacuum aspiration system independent of the traction system. The disadvantage of this cup is that the lateral insertion of aspiration can lead to perineal wounds or vaginal injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are two main types of non-metallic vacuum cups, silicon cups and disposable cups. Silicon cups are sterilisable and resemble &#x0201c;trumpets&#x0201d; with a stem connected to the vacuum pump, which also serves for traction. The disposable Kiwi OmniCup&#x000ae; (Clinical Innovations, Heathrow, UK) ventouse has a rigid plastic cup with an integrated hand-held vacuum connection that allows both aspiration and traction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The new iCup&#x000ae; vacuum cup is disposable and has a 5&#x000a0;cm diameter cup with a central traction strap and a flexible suction tube leading to an electric pump. The cup is made from a rigid plastic material, but the part of the cup in contact with the foetal scalp is made of polyurethane, a soft plastic material with adherent properties (Gyneas, Goussainville, France).</p><p>A Cochrane literature review on the choice of instruments for assisted vaginal delivery found only 10 randomized trials (1558 women) comparing soft with metallic vacuum cups among 32 trials worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These trials were run in 8 countries, mainly in Europe, Asia and to a lesser extent Africa, where vacuum cups are regularly used. The meta-analysis showed that extraction failures occurred more often with soft cups: RR 1.63 [1.17; 2.28], but that scalp injuries and cephalohaematomas were significantly less frequent: RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67 [95 % CI: 0.53; 0.86] and RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.61 [95 % CI: 0.39; 0.95] respectively. No difference in maternal complications was found, in particular the rate of caesarean section, episiotomy, and perineal trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the major drawback of most of the studies comparing metallic cups and soft cups was their heterogeneous control groups including different types of cups, which could bias the final results and/or they were single centre studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Finally, no study has been done with the recently introduced iCup&#x000ae; ventouse, an innovative compromise between metallic and soft cups. Thus, we aimed to compare this new disposable device with the metallic cup considered as the &#x02018;gold-standard&#x02019; in France: the Drapier-Faure&#x000ae; vacuum cup, both in terms of risk of cup dysfunction and the most frequent maternal and neonatal harms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The population of our study was women giving birth after 37&#x000a0;weeks of gestation requiring and able to have a vacuum assisted extraction.</p><p>Women were included if they were aged between 18 and 45&#x000a0;years, with a singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation at delivery and if instrumental extraction was indicated.</p><p>Women, who refused to participate or were deprived of liberty by judicial or administrative decision or under legal protection, were not included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This multicentre prospective randomized controlled open superiority clinical trial followed the CONSORT statement of Non-Pharmacologic Treatment Interventions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/648-non-pharmacologic-treatment/652-title">http://www.consort-statement.org/checklists/view/648-non-pharmacologic-treatment/652-title</ext-link>) and was conducted from October 2009 to February 2013 in 6 maternity units in France (5 university hospitals and 1 community hospital) (Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p>Women likely to be included in the study were informed about it at their 9th month pregnancy visit, in order to have sufficient time for reflection or at the latest during admission to the delivery room. The information was provided both in writing (posters in the waiting and consultation rooms) and orally by investigators at this visit and in the delivery room if necessary. All participants provided written informed consent. As it was not known in advance whether vacuum extraction would be needed consent forms were signed and collected before knowing if an indication for vacuum extraction would in the end be decided.</p><p>In the delivery room, if a vacuum extractor was needed consent was confirmed orally and after verifying eligibility criteria, the woman was electronically randomized by the obstetrician in charge of the delivery and allocated to either the iCup&#x000ae; (&#x02018;disposable cup&#x02019; group) or to the usual Drapier-Faure&#x000ae; metallic cup (&#x02018;metallic cup&#x02019; group). Randomization was centralised using a web server and was stratified by center (random block sizes of 6 or 10) to give equal distribution between both groups for each center (ClinInfo SA, Lyon, France).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by Grenoble regional IRB (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud Est V) on August 4, 2009 number: 09-CHUG-19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection</title><p>An electronic-case report form (e-crf) was used to collect demographic and clinical data on the woman and the new-born at baseline and during the whole follow-up period.

If one or more of these elements were observed an &#x02018;event&#x02019; was considered to have occurred; otherwise &#x02018;no event&#x02019; was recorded.</p><p>Obstetric data were collected by the obstetrician but were objective well-defined criteria. Pediatric data were recorded by an independent pediatrician.</p><p>A composite criterion was chosen because we wanted to include both neonatal and maternal elements in judging the success of the intervention. Nevertheless, we needed to find a balanced compromise between similar severity and the frequency of each element.</p><p>The components of this composite endpoint represent the vast majority of clinical risks of instrumental vaginal delivery using a ventouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the advantage of using a composite endpoint was to be able to immediately assess the potential superiority of the instrument with a sufficient number of events without requiring an excessively large number of patients for the trial.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary criteria were maternal and neonatal outcomes that are rare, are minor, or are independent of the type of device used:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>maternal lesions: cervical lesions, postpartum haemorrhage &#x0003e;500&#x000a0;ml and &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;ml;</p></list-item><list-item><p>neonatal lesions: minor scalp injuries, Apgar score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7, pH&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7.20, anaemia (haemoglobin&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;14.5&#x000a0;g/dl), jaundice (bilirubin&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l), transfer to NICU.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Studied medical devices</title><p>The iCup&#x000ae; vacuum extraction device is sterile and disposable. It consists of a cup-shaped vacuum chamber measuring 5&#x000a0;cm in diameter and 2.5&#x000a0;cm in height with a base made of medical-grade elastomer, which is relatively flexible, an adjustable traction strap and an ergonomic handle. The inner and outer surfaces of the cup are smooth.</p><p>On the dome of the cup there is a furrow specially designed to fit the obstetrician&#x02019;s finger allowing to locate its position while it is being inserted and during the foetus&#x02019;s progression. The inside of the cup has an inner roof which is slightly convex, with a protective filter layer of synthetic foam with open pores. The aspiration inside the cup is circumferential to the inner roof in order to avoid any risk of obstruction of the vacuum system. The traction strap, consisting of a metal cable covered by a plastic protective coating with indicators at 5&#x000a0;cm and 10&#x000a0;cm, is located exactly at the centre of the dome of the cup and can be rotated through 360&#x000b0;. It has a total length of 60&#x000a0;cm, and this can be adjusted as required by inserting the end into blocking stops on the handle.</p><p>The flexible vacuum tube, which emerges from the dome of the cup, is 1.40&#x000a0;m in length and ends in an adjustable-diameter adaptor designed to fit most of the vacuum pumps on the market. This tube is strengthened by an inner reinforced tube where it emerges from the cup to avoid any risk of obstruction due to kinking during the extraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Assuming a frequency of events of at least 35&#x000a0;% with the metallic vacuum cup (standard device) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and to detect any relative reduction in frequency with the disposable cup of 30&#x000a0;%; it was necessary to include 330 women per group (i.e. 660 women) for 80&#x000a0;% power and a bilateral alpha risk of 5&#x000a0;% (Calculated using nQuery Advisor 6.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Considering that 5&#x000a0;% of women would, in the end, not require vacuum assisted delivery, the number of women to be included was increased to 700, or 350 per group.</p><p>The target population was women for whom vacuum extraction was indicated and who were able to undergo this. Randomization was made in an emergency context at installation in the delivery room. It was foreseen in the study protocol that some women would finally not require vacuum assisted delivery and they were to be excluded from the analyses. Indeed, these were not &#x02018;protocol deviations&#x02019; (noncompliance or loss to follow-up) but &#x02018;inclusion errors&#x02019;, which were independent of the treatment or its outcome. This also concerned mothers/babies who in the end were unable to have vacuum assisted extraction (i.e. operator&#x02019;s decision on the appearance of exclusion criteria to vacuum extraction). The intention to treat analysis was then performed for all other randomized women.</p><p>Descriptive statistics included frequencies and percentages for categorical variables with a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval, and means and standard deviations for continuous variables or medians and the interquartile range for non-Gaussian continuous-level variables.</p><p>Univariate analysis was performed when appropriate. Continuous data were compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test if the variable was normally distributed or Mann Whitney test for non-parametric variables. The Chi-square test (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test if necessary) was used for categorical variables.

Separate risk-benefit assessments would have required two or more trials with all the disadvantages inherent to this: an increase in the number of subjects to be included and especially no result as to the overall effectiveness (or not) of the new cup for several years. This would have been detrimental to the development of the innovative medical device where programmed obsolescence is on average 5&#x000a0;years. In addition, equivalence trials remain controversial, among specialists there is rarely an &#x02018;agreed efficacy loss&#x02019; and furthermore there is rarely consensus among specialists.

Surprisingly, the number of extraction failures did not significantly vary over time (1st quartile - 4th quartile), as might have been expected if there had been a normal learning curve. This result could be explained by a rapid early abandon of the new technology in certain centres where investigators felt more comfortable with more familiar instruments, especially as the control group was homogeneous using a single standard technique that was well tested and had been used routinely by all the investigators over a long period. In fact, the number of extraction failures could be over-estimated all over the study, as the obstetricians quickly abandoned the new device after only one or two detachments (instead of three, as written in the study protocol). The results in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> are in line with this hypothesis.</p><p>Few studies have investigated learning curves in obstetrics, and even less have sought to quantify the effect. In the case of vacuum cup devices, a French study aimed at assessing the learning curve of young residents concluded that it was quite short, not more than 6 procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. More recently, an American simulation trial quantifying subjective levels of traction by the obstetrician using the Kiwi Omnicup&#x000ae; did not find any differences. The authors thus assumed that the learning curve for use of the device was relatively short, as the force applied by junior residents was not different from that of more experienced practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, O&#x02019;Mahony et al. noted that the previous experience of the obstetrician remains central to the choice of instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is to date the largest multicentre randomised controlled trial on instrumental deliveries, with in addition a homogeneous control group. While the new disposable cup had more cup detachments and extraction failures than the standard metallic cups, this innovative disposable device had the advantage of causing fewer perineal injuries.</p><p>It would be useful to continue the evaluation of the device with a cost efficacy study and interviews to assess practitioner satisfaction.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12884_2015_771_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
