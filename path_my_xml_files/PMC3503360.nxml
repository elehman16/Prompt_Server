New angiographic techniques (e.g., TIMI myocardial blush score) and noninvasive diagnostic tests (e.g., continuous ST-segment monitoring and contrast echocardiography) have been used to show that epicardial TIMI flow grade 3 may be an incomplete measure of reperfusion success.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Although many events can be identified by angiography (e.g., side branch occlusion or the no-reflow phenomenon), a substantial number of &#x0201c;angiographically silent&#x0201d; events occur at the level of myocardial perfusion. Persistent ST-segment elevation following primary PCI, for example, is associated with reduced left ventricular function and increased mortality.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Despite epicardial vessel patency, disrupted microvascular function and inadequate myocardial perfusion are often the result of thromboembolic debris.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>To date, a number of studies examining the potential benefit of myocardial perfusion with GP IIb/IIIa antagonists have demonstrated improvements in distal microcirculatory flow. In the TIMI 14 study, patients treated with combined abciximab and fibrinolytic therapy experienced more rapid and complete restoration of epicardial flow as well as angiographically evident thrombus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] However, when comparing all patients with 60-min TIMI 3 flow, combination therapy also resulted in more complete STR. Since these findings were independent of the fibrinolytic agent used, an additional mechanism by which abciximab improved myocardial perfusion was proposed. By preventing microvascular obstruction from platelet thromboemboli and the proaggregatory effects of fibrinolysis, abciximab may improve myocardial and microvascular perfusion in addition to epicardial flow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>In the single-center, open label, randomized STOP-AMI trial, the combination of stenting plus abciximab was shown to enhance myocardial salvage and markedly improve event-free survival at 30 days and 1 year compared with accelerated t-PA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Similarly, among 162 AMI patients randomized to primary PCI with abciximab or a pharmacologic strategy of reduced-dose alteplase with full-dose abciximab, coronary stenting plus abciximab resulted in significantly greater myocardial salvage and infarct size measured by nuclear imaging at 11 days postinfarction.</p><p>Although 6-month survival tended to favor patients randomized to the invasive strategy, overall survival did not significantly differ in this modest-sized study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Neumann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] also explored the effects of abciximab on myocardial recovery and coronary flow following stenting in AMI patients. In that study, 200 patients within 48 hours of onset of AMI in whom a primary or rescue stent strategy was planned were randomized to a bolus plus 12-hour infusion abciximab regimen or control. Patients treated with abciximab had a lower composite rate of in-hospital death, reinfarction, or urgent TVR (9.2% vs 2.0%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Regional wall motion, global left ventricular function, and peak coronary blood flow velocity by Doppler were greater in abciximab-treated patients, consistent with improved distal microcirculatory function, presumably due to reduced distal thromboemboli and/or capillary plugging. However, no significant differences in clinical events or angiographic restenosis were present at 6 months. In summary, adjunctive treatment with GP IIb/IIIa inhibition not only increases epicardial patency but, unlike fibrinolytic therapy, may also enhance myocardial perfusion that results in improved ventricular function and decreased infarct size.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>Clinical trials demonstrating improved outcomes among acute MI patients with a patent IRA before percutaneous revascularization have provided further support for facilitated PCI. Percutaneous intervention following initial pharmacologic reperfusion therapy may not only identify those patients with incomplete reperfusion but also provide added benefit with mechanical revascularization. For example, among patients receiving GP IIb/IIIa inhibition and/or fibrinolytic therapy in the TIMI 10B and 14 trials, those with TIMI 0 or 1 flow who underwent &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; PCI tended to have lower 30-day mortality than patients treated medically (6% vs 17%; P = 0.28). However, even among patients with TIMI 2 or 3 flow, performance of adjunctive PCI was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality and/or reinfarction compared with a strategy of delayed revascularization (odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.57; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>The ideal combination of fibrinolytic, antithrombin, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is also uncertain. Clinical results from forthcoming trials should therefore further clarify the safety and efficacy of combined therapy in addition to its potential as a cost-effective measure.</p><p>Integration of most effective pharmacology with percutaneous revascularization strategies also remains an unresolved issue. The improvements in ventricular function, early recurrent ischemia, and both early and intermediate survival with GP IIb/IIIa inhibition in primary PCI support the use of these agents as adjunctive therapy to mechanical revascularization, particularly with timely administration before arrival in the catheterization laboratory. Whether the early performance of angiography and catheter-based intervention following combination therapy for ST- elevation MI will yield favorable outcomes similar to the experience in non-ST-elevation ACS (TIMI 18-TACTICS) is less definitive.</p><p>However, considering the importance of prompt restoration of flow in the IRA, the collective experience with fibrinolysis and primary PCI has fostered the concept of &#x0201c;facilitated PCI&#x0201d;, and randomized trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of this strategy are underway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Analysis from the On-TIME 2 trial evaluated the efficacy of triple antiplatelet therapy on initial patency and STR in relation to time from symptom onset to first medical contact. Patients were randomized to dual (500 mg aspirin and 600 mg clopidogrel) or triple antiplatelet (500 mg aspirin, 600 mg clopidogrel, and tirofiban 25 &#x003bc;g/kg bolus and 0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg/min maintenance infusion for 18 hours) pretreatment in the ambulance.</p><p>Primary outcome of this sub-analysis was initial patency of the infarct-related vessel and STR before PCI according to time from symptom onset to first medical contact in quartiles. Initial patency, STR before PCI, and the incidence of aborted MI gradually increased with shorter time from symptom onset to first medical contact. Initial thrombolysis in MI flow was present in 21.2% in the total population and 26.2%, 21.5%, 18.1%, and 18.8% in the time quartiles, respectively (P for trend = 0.01). The incidence of complete STR pre-angiography was 16.6% in the total population and 23.4%, 18.2%, 14.7%, and 9.9% in the four quartiles, respectively (P for trend &#x0003c; 0.001). This was largely driven by the effect of triple antiplatelet therapy, which further improved initial patency and STR and led to a significantly higher incidence of aborted MI (13.2% vs 8.7%, P = 0.011), especially in the patients with short duration of symptoms. Antiplatelet pretreatment before primary PCI, including a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blocker, seems to be most effective when given shortly after symptom onset.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>In our small trial of 90 patients, there was a trend for better STR and more patency of IRA and improved TIMI flow in patients who were given high bolus dose of Aggrrastat, which was started early in the ED in comparison with patient who were given abciximab standard dose in the cath lab during their PCI. Regardless of the treatment strategy, effective platelet inhibition appears to be a critical element in rising above the "ceiling of reperfusion" and past the limitations of current therapies. While the available data should facilitate the use of adjunctive GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as part of initial antithrombotic therapy for primary PCI, results from future trials should further refine the role of these agents as part of treatment algorithm for the initial pharmacologic management of patients with acute MI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Most current trials with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in ST elevation MI have been conducted with abciximab.
