Little is presently known about the effectiveness of these programs in Chinese COPD patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a specifically designed SMEP on levels of self-efficacy in Chinese patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Based on the Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions, an exploratory phase randomized controlled trial was employed to examine the effects of an SMEP. Self-efficacy was the primary outcome using the COPD Self-efficacy Scale, measured at baseline and 6 months after the program. Qualitative data were sequentially collected from these patients via three focus groups to supplement the quantitative findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The experimental group displayed significant improvement in their general self-efficacy (<italic>Z</italic> =&#x02212;2.44, <italic>P</italic>=0.015) and specifically in confronting 1) physical exertion (<italic>Z</italic> =&#x02212;2.57, <italic>P</italic>=0.01), 2) weather/environment effects (<italic>Z</italic> =&#x02212;2.63, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 3) intense emotions (<italic>Z</italic> =&#x02212;2.54, <italic>P</italic>=0.01). Three themes emerged from the focus groups: greater disease control, improved psychosocial well-being and perceived incapability and individuality. The connection of the quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated that individual perceptual constancy of patients could be a determining factor modulating the effectiveness of this type of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings highlight the potential putative benefits of an SMEP in Chinese patients with COPD. Further attention should be given to cultural considerations when developing this type of intervention in Chinese populations with COPD and other chronic diseases.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>embedded design</kwd><kwd>exploratory randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>mixed methods</kwd><kwd>self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>self-management</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, COPD places a serious burden on society, in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).<xref rid="b1-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With increased tobacco use and global aging population, a significant increase in COPD morbidity is forecasted in the future.<xref rid="b2-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Symptoms of COPD include chronic cough, sputum production and exertional dyspnea, and there is worldwide consensus that COPD symptoms are potentially manageable.<xref rid="b4-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Self-management education programs (SMEPs) have been shown to improve COPD intervention, particularly in symptom relief, by empowering patients with daily living management skills.<xref rid="b6-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In Macau, a special administrative region of China, obstructive airway disease was one of the top-ten causes of death from 2004 to 2011.<xref rid="b8-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Historically, gambling casinos were the frontline of cigarette smoke exposure for the local population.

Accordingly, the primary objective of this study was to compare the self-efficacy of Chinese COPD patients before and after the delivery of a newly initiated self-management intervention tailored for COPD patients in Macau. A secondary aim was to explain the primary results with a qualitative approach so as to understand the effects of a self-management intervention on these patients in a comprehensive way. Data collected from this study will also have potential implications for the use of self-management strategies in other forms of chronic illness in Chinese patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Design</title><p>Under the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the evaluation of complex interventions, this study used an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="b29-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> It followed an embedded design where a mixed-methods sequential explanatory approach was adopted.<xref rid="b30-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Exploratory trial is the second phase of evaluation of RCT for complex interventions, and it is appropriate to use this design in a study that is conducted in a place where there is lack of relevant theoretical and empirical basis, such as in Macau.<xref rid="b29-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Before progressing to a definitive RCT, the MRC framework advocates undertaking a separate exploratory study of a complex intervention to address all the components and outcome measures, rather than being as part of the overall evaluation package. This approach has previously been advocated in nursing academic research.<xref rid="b31-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In the sequential explanatory approach, the primary focus was on quantitative data (COPD Self-efficacy Scale [CSES]), which was collected in the first (pre-test) and second (6 months after intervention) phases, and qualitative data (focus groups) were collected in the third phase (follow-up of second phase) (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-12-2129">Figure 1</xref>). By using this approach, predetermined important topics identified in the quantitative phase of the study were sequentially included in the qualitative data collection, and this could help to explain the participants&#x02019; response and enhance the overall experimental design.<xref rid="b30-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The study was conducted at the outpatient department of a hospital and community centers of Macao.

All patients were approved to participate in this study and consented in writing to perform pulmonary function test for confirming diagnosis by their attending doctors. Written informed consent was collected from all participants by the principal researcher who did not involve in their clinical care. Then, they were allocated by block randomization to either experimental group (assigned SMEP on top of conventional therapy) or control group (conventional therapy) by drawing cards at random by the participants. The blocking was conducted in terms of the stages of disease severity, with consented participants of the same stage of severity being randomly assigned to either experimental or control group. Conventional therapy involved routine visits to the physicians and use of the prescribed medicine.

The specifically designed self-management education workshops comprised of an overview of the definition of COPD, natural course of disease, information on how to manage a stable condition, advice on how to prevent complications and a self-treatment guideline (or action plan) for managing exacerbations.<xref rid="b37-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Content validity was performed on the protocol of the workshops, and it demonstrated high validity both in appropriateness (content validity index [CVI] =0.95) and in feasibility (CVI =0.93). The self-management education workshops were conducted on group basis with five to eight participants in each section.

The CSES consists of 34 items exploring five dimensions of self-efficacy: 1) negative effect, 2) intense emotional arousal, 3) physical exertion, 4) weather/environment and 5) behavioral risk factors. The five factors show a good validity and internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha =0.95).<xref rid="b39-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> CSES has been translated into simplified Chinese and validated for an interventional study.<xref rid="b38-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> With the permission granted by Wong, the scale was converted into traditional Chinese version that is the native written language in Macau. Three experts in nursing, education or clinical respiratory nursing who comprehend both forms of Chinese were invited to validate the items of the scale with respect to language expression. The CVI was computed and scored 0.91 (ranged from 0.67 to 1.00). The questionnaires were completed through face-to-face interviews during clinical consultation with the patient. In the qualitative strand, focus groups were used to explore the self-efficacy perception of COPD patients after application of self-management skills. The interview guide included three focus open-ended questions, such as &#x0201c;how do you manage breathing difficulty?&#x0201d; Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by trained investigators and an experienced moderator who were independent from this study in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>SPSS 13.0 software was used to analyze the quantitative data, producing percentage, mean and standard deviation (SD) for descriptive data, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were computed for inferential statistics. Statistical significance was set at the level of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. In the qualitative strand, the focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed.

One RCT study reported significant improvement in total and all subscale scores of CSES in the experimental group.<xref rid="b42-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Other studies demonstrated improvement of self-efficacy in self-management behaviors in COPD patients for up to 2 years after self-management education.<xref rid="b15-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b43-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Wong et al<xref rid="b38-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and Davis et al<xref rid="b44-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> indicated that only functional aspects (ie, walking and physical exertion) can be improved by self-management intervention. Intriguingly, contradictory observations have been reported in other COPD studies.<xref rid="b45-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> These discrepancies may be attributed to the lack of standardization for the content or structure of self-management education and different measurements used for self-efficacy assessment.<xref rid="b47-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> It is also noteworthy to mention that the evaluation of self-management interventions for COPD patients in China has predominantly focused on biomedical parameters and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="b48-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="b49-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> but rarely on cognitive behavioral performance. Therefore, this study suggested the mediating role of self-efficacy in self-management intervention for COPD patients of Chinese ethnicity.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, the quantitative and qualitative findings were connected to answer the explanatory research question. First, participants in the experimental group showed improvement in the total score of CSES. This effect is illustrated in this quote from one participant:
<disp-quote><p>Chris: Before, my condition &#x02026; was very serious, through the check up by doctor, it was certified &#x02026; ha &#x02026; by the hospital, the indicator of my lung function was only 31, normal people is 80, so I thought it&#x02019;s hopeless when I knew the fact! Waited for my death at home, just a matter of time! Then afterwards learnt from the program &#x02026; learnt a lot, improved, in terms of improvement, in particular the dietary, &#x02026; like I ate more side dish, vegetable, it is documented in the handbook, like reducing the portion of carbohydrate, the intake of carbohydrate would be resulted in the production of carbon dioxide of the body, I know I should be very careful as mentioned here. Sometimes I took vegetable as rice. [Focus group 2]</p></disp-quote></p><p>This quote illustrates that the patient gained confidence in their diet management (efficacy expectation) and stated the improvement he believed (outcome expectation) by high-lighting the contrast in the level of confidence he had before and after receiving SMEP. The outcome and efficacy expectations led the participants to perceive better self-appraisal of efficacy when adopting self-management skills.<xref rid="b50-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p><p>In addition, three dimensions of self-efficacy, namely, physical exertion, response to weather/environment and intense emotional arousal also improved in the experimental group after delivery of the SMEP. The first theme &#x0201c;greater disease control&#x0201d; emerged from the qualitative findings and shows consistency with the quantitative results of improvement in self-efficacy during physical exertion. Functional capability should be essential to perform social activities and prominent in an individual&#x02019;s daily life as gaining confidence in engaging in social activities was identified to enable COPD patients to overcome feelings of social isolation.<xref rid="b51-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> A study of Chinese COPD patients also indicated that social coping strategies could help an individual reduce their psychological distress and increase their psychological well-being.<xref rid="b52-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Therefore, functional improvement would appear to be a key factor for COPD patients.</p><p>Weather or environmental factors have also been identified as risk factors in COPD.<xref rid="b53-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Quantitative findings in this study demonstrated that participants had greater confidence to avoid and deal with the adverse effects of weather changes and environmental triggers following their SMEP intervention. One focus group participant stated:
<disp-quote><p>Chris: For me I mainly followed the instruction for breathing, and also to avoid &#x02026; like those tobacco, temples, car park or those related to exhaust, tried hard to avoid all these factors. [Focus group 2]</p></disp-quote></p><p>From the quantitative findings, participants demonstrated higher levels of confidence managing difficulty in breathing during adverse emotions, eg, fear, anger and anxiety after receiving SMEP. However, this point did not really emerge from the qualitative phase. The participants in the focus groups appeared reluctant to admit emotional problems.
<disp-quote><p>Mr Lee: I don&#x02019;t have those emotions, I&#x02019;m not anxious.</p><p>Winnie: [interrupts] (hehehe) Mr Lee is similar with me, I&#x02019;m not anxious too.</p><p>Mr Lee: &#x02026; I don&#x02019;t even have pressure, I&#x02019;m always relaxed (laugh gently).</p><p>Winnie: [interrupts] I only have problem when I climb up staircases.</p></disp-quote></p><p>Participants did not make direct attribution to the SMEP in relation to equipping them with confidence to encounter and deal with adverse emotions. They mainly expressed that periods of intense emotion did not bother them in disease management. From this perspective, an improvement in self-efficacy derived from participating in the SMEP may have led the participants to enhanced level of psychosocial well-being, as they thought adverse emotion would not affect them. Alternatively, the improvement of self-efficacy in managing intense emotion in the participants might not merely be the effects of SMEP, as personal control over intense emotions may also be influential. The ethnographic characteristic of the Chinese tends to make them less likely to express their real feelings and lead them to excessive rumination over emotional expression.<xref rid="b54-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Therefore, the participants tended to place less emphasis on the effects of personal emotion to their own health.</p><p>In addition, the theme &#x0201c;perceived incapability and individuality&#x0201d; emerged in the focus groups highlighting the potential influence of one&#x02019;s perceptual constancy in the development of their efficacy expectation. In the study by Leung et al,<xref rid="b35-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> the Chinese with COPD were found to have a relatively poor psychosocial adjustment as a perception of decreased energy level may have prevented the patients from adopting a more adaptive approach to coping with their condition. Poor memory, as emphasized by study participants, could be related to decreased implementation of self-management techniques. This may also lead to feelings of inferiority that may make the patients give up easily and worry about performing the techniques poorly.<xref rid="b54-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> With regard to perceived individuality, a patient in this study adopted the Yin-Yang theory of traditional Chinese medicine in relation to diet, accordingly cold and heat properties of food can help to regulate the pathophysiological condition of the body.<xref rid="b55-copd-12-2129" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> She believed that individual difference would induce varied effect even with the same diet. This implies that the adoption of self-management might vary from person to person under this cultural influence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results and findings presented in this mixed study connect the quantitative and qualitative perspectives, which indicate the positive role of SMEP may have in COPD. Our program clearly improved the self-efficacy of COPD patients in the Chinese population of Macao. It also provided them with the feeling of able to better control their disease and improve psychosocial well-being. Of note, our qualitative data demonstrated that individual perceptual constancy of patients could also be the determining factors modulating the effectiveness of SMEP. Therefore, investigation of the effects of such factors in SMEP for COPD patient in Macau will be useful to enable further adjustment and refinement of this interventional program.</p><p>Possible weaknesses of our study are mainly related to the potential bias underlying the research design and to the sampling structure. Although block randomization and blinding were adopted in the research design, the influence of participant preference may still be a potential confounder of true randomization (MRC 2000). This could happen when the participants had a treatment preference, then they were likely to expect and achieve more positive outcomes. However, it is very difficult to avoid this type of bias in interventional study. The relatively small sample size could also be seen as a limitation in this study. Exhaustive efforts were applied to made up for the sample size through employing a sequential qualitative data collection and recruiting additional participants from the community care centers. In addition, the health beliefs of the Chinese population should be considered, which, however, have not been further discussed because it is not possible to explore this area in more detail within the scope of this study. Despite these efforts, being an exploratory phase of RCT, this study employed rigorous procedures to develop and evaluate a complex intervention, as outlined by MRC. The use of mixed-methods sequential explanatory design ensured that we captured a greater insight into the personal experience of the intervention by the participants.</p><p>Under the guidance of MRC framework for evaluation of complex intervention, an exploratory trial could not provide evidence to the same level of rigor as an RCT does. Despite this limitation, this study does serve a different purpose as the results interlinked the concepts of self-management, self-efficacy and mixed methods, as such it provided a foundation for the development of a full large-scale RCT. Therefore, the implementation of SMEP as an initiative step to the continual intervention process for the COPD patients in Macau is recommended. Follow-up study in examining the attributing effect of each component of the SMEP to the self-management performance of COPD patients is needed. Further exploration of the long-term effect, ie, 9&#x02013;12 months of SMEP, is also warranted. Taken together, the mixed quantitative and qualitative approach not only suggested that the Chinese population of COPD patients in Macau can be benefited from SMEP, but it also enhanced the overall design of an experiment. With the increasing burden of non-communicable chronic illness in the world, this study also provided insight for SMEP health care delivery to other forms of chronic illnesses in Chinese populations. It is important that these cultural considerations are taken into account when developing this form of intervention. This form of mixed-methods approach is recommended in future SMEP COPD studies, giving a very rigorous and comprehensive perspective of this complex chronic respiratory condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Dr Cheng Kuan, Ms Iris Lou and Leong Sok Man are acknowledged for their effort and advice.
