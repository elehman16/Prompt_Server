The management of menopausal symptoms calls for an individualized intervention depending on the nature of her symptoms and their impact on her quality of life, her personal preferences, and efficacy profile of potential treatment options.</p><p>Hot flashes have been reported as the most bothersome symptom of menopause accounting for 75% of symptoms.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Both hormonal and nonhormonal treatment modalities are available. Hormonal therapy includes estrogen, combined estrogen/progestin, and concern regarding the adverse effects and low compliance with estrogen due to irregular bleeding, mastalgia, nausea, weight gain, etc., has led to the demand of other treatment options.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Nonhormonal therapy includes isoflavones, gabapentin, clonidine, selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), black cohosh, and Vitamin E. Isoflavones are nonsteroid compounds that weakly bind to estrogenic receptors and have been demonstrated to decrease both severity and frequency of menopausal vasomotor symptoms.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Soy products are generally very safe. Gabapentin's role in hypothalamic calcium channel activity has been implicated as a mediator of temperature regulation, thereby helping in the treatment of hot flashes.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The reasons suggested by Yurcheshen <italic>et al</italic>. as to why gabapentin was responsible for a significant increase in sleep quality are a reduction of hot flashes, an increase in slow wave sleep, and a hypnotic effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend the use of gabapentin as an option for managing hot flashes in women who are unwilling to take estrogen-containing supplements.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The present study is carried out to compare the effects of gabapentin versus isoflavones in menopausal vasomotor symptoms, especially with regards to hot flashes and sleep disturbances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The prospective comparative study was conducted on 100 consecutive patients in the menopausal age group (40&#x02013;65 years) with complaints of hot flashes, who attended the outpatient Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, at a tertiary care hospital in India.</p><p>The cases of the study were alternatively divided into two groups of 50 each, in such a way that the first patient was enrolled into Group I, the second patient into Group II.</p><p>Group I (gabapentin group) patients received 900 mg of gabapentin for a period of 3 months (300 mg, thrice a day).</p><p>Group II (isoflavones group) patients received 60 mg of isoflavones for a period of 3 months (once daily).</p><p>Women with history of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and chronic liver, renal, or endocrine disease, use of hormonal therapy or antiseizure medication were excluded from the study. Ethical clearance was taken from the institutional ethics committee. After informed consent, all the cases underwent a general physical and gynecological examination and were interviewed in detail regarding hot flashes, sleep disturbances, depression, and other menopausal symptoms in the form of two validated questionnaires: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [<xref ref-type="app" rid="App1">Annexure 1</xref>] and Zung Self-rating Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="app" rid="App2">Annexure 2</xref>]. In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores were derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to three (severe difficulty) and the scores were summed to produce a global score (range 0&#x02013;21) [<xref ref-type="app" rid="App3">Annexure 3</xref>]. The Zung Depression Scale has scored from 20 to 80.</p><p>Hot flash score was calculated as = (1 &#x000d7; number of mild hot flashes in a day) + (2 &#x000d7; number of moderate hot flashes) + (3 &#x000d7; number of severe hot flashes).</p><p>Lipid profile was done at the first visit and repeated at 12 weeks. She was followed after 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At all the visits, the patients were reviewed and scored regarding hot flashes, PSQI score, and depression score and were also asked about any side effect of the drugs.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was a change in the hot flash scores from baseline. The secondary outcome measures were other symptoms related to sleep, depression, and change in lipid profile. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test for univariate analysis and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age was 50.9 &#x000b1; 4.49 years for Group I and 50.24 &#x000b1; 5.13 years for Group II, and maximum distribution (72%) was seen in the age group 46&#x02013;55 years. Eight percent of the patients were perimenopausal, 2% in Group I, and 14% in Group II. The largest number of the patients was within a year of menopause at the time of enrollment (36% in Group I and 38% in Group II) and 27% were hysterectomized (32% in Group I and 22% in Group II). The results are shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>. No side effect was observed in isoflavone group; however, in gabapentin group, five patients reported drowsiness at 2 weeks and ten patients at 4 and 8 weeks which subsided at 12 weeks and one patient had gastrointestinal side effects at 2 and 4 weeks follow-up, and there was no other major side effect.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic details of the study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-7-132-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of hot flash score in two groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-7-132-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (global score)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-7-132-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of the Self-rating Depression Scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-7-132-g004"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Lipid profile of the study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-7-132-g005"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods that occurs as part of the normal aging process or as a consequence of iatrogenic (surgical) intervention.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Baseline hot flash score in the present study was comparable in the two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.175]. Improvement in the hot flash score was seen as early as after 2 weeks of treatment (8%) and was durable over 12 weeks (82%) in the gabapentin group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Guttuso <italic>et al</italic>. investigated gabapentin for hot flashes in 59 highly symptomatic women and found a reduced hot flash score of 54% in the gabapentin group versus 31% in the placebo group at week 12.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Similarly, Pandya <italic>et al</italic>., studied gabapentin at doses of 300 mg/day and 900 mg/day in 420 breast cancer patients mainly on tamoxifen, found a significant 49% decrease in hot flash score in the 900 mg/day arm, compared with 21% in the placebo arm at week 4.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In another trial that was not placebo-controlled, Loprinzi <italic>et al</italic>. found that gabapentin at a dose of 900 mg/day reduced the hot flash score by 60% in breast cancer patients at week 4.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, fall in the mean hot flash score was also seen in the isoflavone group in the 2<sup>nd</sup> week (3%) which increased to 74% at 12 week [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Albertazzi <italic>et al</italic>., in their study using 90 mg/days of genistein aglycone, found that soy isoflavones were significantly superior to placebo in reducing the mean number of hot flashes after 4, 8, and 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Crisafulli observed a 24% reduction in daily flushes after 12 months with a daily dose of 54 mg of genistein.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These results are similar to that found the isoflavone group in the present study.</p><p>Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in hot flash score at the end of 12 weeks 82% in Group I and 74% in Group II; however, on comparing the two groups, the difference was statistically insignificant at all the visits [<italic>P</italic> = 0.056, 0.11, 0.356, and 0.076, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Although no head-to-head trial comparing the two drugs has been made, placebo-based studies showed that gabapentin at doses of 900 mg/day was similar to estrogens in the control of hot flushes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a head-to-head comparative design, Crisafulli <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the efficacy and safety of hormonal therapy versus a genistein concentrate in the reduction of menopausal hot flushes and found a significant difference in the magnitude of the effect between both treatments, which favored hormonal therapy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Sleep disturbance and insomnia are common symptoms of menopause. In the present study, analysis of the PSQI showed significant improvements in the global score in both the groups, 69.5% in Group I and 60.77% in Group II at 12 weeks, and sleep quality was significantly better with gabapentin at 12 weeks [<italic>P</italic> = 0.011, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Placebo-controlled studies by Yurcheshen <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that gabapentin caused a significant improvement in the PSQI score as compared to placebo.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of isoflavones on sleep-related disorders in menopause though no study has used the PSQI as an analytic tool. Hachul <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of isoflavones on hot flashes and insomnia using the Kupperman Index and polysomnography (PSG). They found that isoflavones decreased the frequency of moderate/severe insomnia related to menopause and increased sleep efficiency according to PSG.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Although their study did not show any correlation between insomnia and hot flashes, other studies such as that by Erlik <italic>et al</italic>. showed that insomnia may be related to the severity of hot flashes.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Whether the improvement of the PSQI score in our study was due to the symptomatic improvement in hot flashes with isoflavones remains unclear. On comparing the two groups, statistically significant difference was seen at 12 weeks in the global score in favor of gabapentin [<italic>P</italic> = 0.011, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown an association between hot flashes and depression.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Analysis of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale in the present study showed improvement in the mean value in both the groups which persisted throughout till 12 weeks [6.86% in Group I and 12.62% in Group II, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Reddy <italic>et al</italic>., however, reported no significant difference in the Zung Depression Score between patients in either the gabapentin, estrogen, or placebo groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Studies on the effect of isoflavones in depression associated with menopause have been very few. Lipovac <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of isoflavone extracts and reported that the Zung Depression Score scorings were significantly decreased (improvement) in comparison to placebo.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In another placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study, de Sousa-Mu&#x000f1;oz and Filizola evaluated the effect of soy isoflavones on depressive symptoms using the Center of Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale and found a significant reduction in the depressive symptoms in the experimental group; however, the response was not higher than that of the control group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] There was an earlier response (at 2 weeks) on depression symptoms, to the treatment with gabapentin as compared with isoflavone in which case improvement started from week 4 and the percentage fall in depression score from baseline at 4, 8 and 12 weeks favored isoflavones [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups at week 8, and 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.026, respectively], thus favoring isoflavone.</p><p>Soy isoflavones have been associated with a favorable effect on lipid profile. In our study, we found that there was a significant difference in the lipid profiles between the two groups which favored isoflavones [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The isoflavone group had significant improvement in cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TGLs) profiles after 12 weeks [<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, 0.009, 0.024, and &#x0003c; 0.001, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials, Taku <italic>et al</italic>. found that soy isoflavones significantly reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol but did not change HDL cholesterol and triglyceride.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, none of the drugs caused any major side effect and were well tolerated by the patients. Drowsiness was the main complaint that was seen in the gabapentin group that started at 2 weeks and persisted till week 8. This side effect has been reported in many studies involving gabapentin.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both isoflavone and gabapentin are equally efficacious in the treatment of hot flashes, but in patients who have associated complaints of depression isoflavones have better response. Gabapentin has better results in patients who have associated sleep disturbance with hot flashes. Both drugs are well tolerated. Isoflavones have a favorable effect on lipid profile with decrease in cholesterol, LDL, and TGL and an increase in HDL and also have added advantage of once daily dosage.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><title>Annexure 1: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</title><p>
