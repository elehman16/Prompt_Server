Certain mineral oils kill lice by blocking spiracles or by disrupting the epicuticular wax layer. The present study was performed to evaluate efficacy and safety of a mineral oil-based shampoo.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, monocentric study (EudraCT registration no. 2014-002918-23) was performed from October 2014&#x02014;June 2015 in Germany. A mineral oil shampoo (Mosquito<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Med L&#x000e4;use Shampoo 10 in Germany, Paranix or Silcap shampoo elsewhere), registered as medical device, was compared to a conventional, locally reimbursed, pyrethroid-based pediculicide (Goldgeist<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Forte solution). In total, 107 patients (&#x0003e;1 year) with confirmed head lice infestation were included (test arm: n = 53; control arm: n = 54). All subjects received two applications of either test or control product at day 0 and day 7, according to the instructions for use. Efficacy and safety was evaluated directly, 1h and 24h after first application, before and after second treatment, and at day 10. The main objective was demonstrating a cure rate for the test product, being superior to 70% at day 10.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Cure rates at day 10 (corrected for re-infestation) for the test product (96.1%) and control (94%) significantly exceeded the pre-defined target (70%) (p &#x0003c; 0.001, 2-sided, 1-sample, chi-square test) with confirmed non-inferiority for the test product. Over all visits, cure rates were consistently higher for the test product, whereas more initially-cured subjects remained lice-free until end of study (78%; control: 60%). Both products were safe and well tolerated, offering good esthetical effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that substance-based medical devices (including the tested mineral oil shampoo) can be safe and effective alternatives for insecticide-based pediculicides, with less risk for development of resistance because of the physical mode of action.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de/drks_web/">DRKS00009753</ext-link> and EudraCT database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/index.html">2014-002918-23</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Oystershell Laboratories</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>Doerte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Oystershell Laboratories</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adriaens</surname><given-names>Els</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funder of the study was Oystershell Laboratories who is also the manufacturer of the test product.

They are spread by direct contact with an infested individual, especially by head-to-head contact. Head lice can infest all types of hair, and it is a common nuisance, particularly in school-aged children. Population-based studies in European countries show highly diverging prevalence values, ranging from 0.45% to 22.4% [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of head lice infestations remains a stubborn problem in families. Previously, only insecticide-based products (e.g. pyrethroids) were available as treatment but they have been overtaken by physically acting, substance-based medical devices. In other regions of the world such as the United States and East Asia, conventional insecticides still lead the market. However, increasing resistance to these neurotoxic agents and raising safety concerns [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] play in favour of products with a physical mode of action.</p><p>For over a century, petroleum-derived mineral oils (so-called suffocating oils), have been used as topical human and veterinary insecticides and as plant disease control agents, respectively. Their physical mode of action is widely accepted and is based on covering and suffocation of ectoparasites such as mites and lice [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>During the last decades, purification processes have been further optimized, yielding highly refined and pure mineral oils. These oils have been approved by different competent authorities for horticultural, cosmetic as well as pharmaceutical use.</p><p>Covering head lice with mineral oils will result in respiratory spiracle blockage, which in turn will disrupt water and gas exchange. It is also suggested that mineral oils interfere with the insects&#x02019; epicuticular wax layer. These physical interactions finally result in mortality of adult lice and their nits [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The present study aimed to robustly evaluate the efficacy and safety of a mineral oil head lice shampoo (known in Germany as Mosquito<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> L&#x000e4;use Shampoo 10 and in other countries as Paranix or Silcap shampoo) and compare it to a traditional and locally reimbursed, pyrethroid-based pediculicide: Goldgeist<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Forte solution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Set-up</title><p>This randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, comparative study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical chamber of the German federal state of Thuringia and by the German national health authority (BfArM). The Ethics committee approved the study on 8<sup>th</sup> August 2014. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 2013, Good Clinical Practice, and of the European Union Directive 2001/20/EC as well as the requirements of German drug law and data protection laws. The trial was registered to the EudraCT database (EudraCT No. 2014-002918-23). After recruitment was complete, the trial was additionally registered in the &#x0201c;German Clinical Trials Register (GermanCTR)&#x0201d; to make it publicly available (registration number: DRKS00009753).

All diagnoses were made by trained personnel at the clinical facility, using a designated plastic head lice comb (Elimax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, tooth gap 0.2 mm with rigid teeth). First, the hair was detangled in 4 parts. Next, every part of the hair was combed six times, starting at the scalp and ending at the hair tips. Head lice caught by the comb were left in the hair in order not to bias treatment. The severity of the head lice infestation was judged on a four-point severity scale: 0 = no relevant infestation (0&#x02013;4 lice and/or nymphs present), 1 = mild (5&#x02013;9 lice and/or nymphs present), 2 = moderate (10&#x02013;24 lice and/or nymphs present) and 3 = severe (&#x02265; 25 lice and/or nymphs present).</p><p>Only patients with at least five living lice or nymphs and five apparently living eggs present at the first visit were included. Exclusion criteria were: known sensitivity towards product ingredients, use of a pediculicide 4 weeks prior to study start, secondary scalp infection, chronic scalp disease, pregnancy or lactation and prior participation during the previous 4 weeks in any other clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Informed consent, Randomization, and Baseline Data</title><p>Study participants or their legal representative in case of minors gave written consent and the children also provided written or verbal assent, according to age, witnessed by the parent or guardian.

In contrast, all subsequent assessments were performed by blinded study staff to avoid any product bias</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Study medication, dosage and administration</title><p>The test head lice shampoo was supplied in 100 ml plastic bottles by Oystershell Laboratories (Ghent, Belgium). The active ingredient is light, white mineral oil (pharmacopoeia-grade), approved for use in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products (concentration: 69.3%). Other ingredients are surfactants (amine laureth sulfate, laureth-4, and cocamide DEA; concentration range: 29&#x02013;30%) to allow direct wash out, and perfume (&#x0003c;1%). The test shampoo is classified as a medical device as it exerts its effects through a physical mode of action (suffocation).</p><p>The control product, Goldgeist<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Forte solution, is a pediculicide containing pyrethrum extract (0.3%) and piperonyl butoxide (0.7%), which is a synergist of different insecticides, including pyrethroids. Pyrethrum has been used for centuries as an insecticide and lice remedy. It is made from dried flower heads, primarily of <italic>Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium</italic>. The main active ingredients are pyrethrins, but also cinerins and jasmolins. These agents kill head lice by acting on nerve cell membranes and interrupting muscle neurotransmission [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

The cure rate is the proportion of patients without any living lice, corrected for re-infestation. The latter was defined as a) no adult lice or third stage nymphs present following the first treatment, and b) no more than two adult lice or third stage nymphs found by combing on day 10 [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The secondary efficacy objective was to show non-inferiority of the test product (assuming an outcome of 70% at day 10 for the medicinal control product).

Sample size calculation was performed using previous clinical data for the Silcap test product (not published). A sample size of 42 was required for a one sample chi-square-test comparing cure rate of 90% with a fixed limit of 70% (two sided test; alpha-level of 0.05; power = 90%; software nQuery advisor 7.0). For the control group, the identical sample size was used.</p><p>Assuming 10% drop-outs and a 5% rate for re-infestation, the sample size was multiplied by 1.1 x 1.05, leading to approximately 50 cases per group.

On day 0 and 7 (before and one hour after application), and at the final examination at day 10, local tolerability (subjective symptoms for burning, paraesthesia, pruritus) was evaluated. Study staff assessed skin (secondary infection, erythema, excoriation) and eye irritation on days 0, 1, 7 and 10.

An independent statistical consultant performed analyses on the primary efficacy data set. The latter included all patients who received two treatments (50 in each arm at day 10) and one additional patient, who withdrew consent due to treatment failure in the test group (total, n = 101; test group, n = 50; control group, n = 50).</p><p>The cure rate (p) corresponds to the proportion of patients who were cured at day 10 among all patients that received any treatment at day 0.

Prerequisites include a) predefinition of a non-inferiority margin, and b) no correction in terms of multiplicity. As non-inferiority margin (&#x003b4;), a 7.5% worse cure rate was regarded as clinically not relevant. The following null hypothesis (tested &#x003b1;-level of 0.025) was used: H<sub>0, NI</sub>: pT&#x02013;pR &#x0003c; &#x003b4;, whereby &#x003b4; = -7.5%. The lower, one sided 97.5% confidence interval of difference pT-pR was used for the test. If H<sub>0, NI</sub> was rejected, non-inferiority could be shown.</p><p>All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>For better understanding the clinical results, post hoc analyses were performed. In this additional evaluation, only per protocol treated patients, who received two treatments (n = 50 in each arm), were included. This data is known as the &#x0201c;secondary efficacy set&#x0201d;. The absolute difference in cure rate, with two-sided 95% confidence interval, derived from the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, was calculated to compare the cure rates of both treatments.</p><p>Chi-square test for independence was used to compare the cure rate after correction for re-infestation on day 10. These analyses were performed with R version 3.1.1.

For this reason, alternative treatments have taken over the market in Europe during the last years, including silicone-based head lice products with a physical mode of action. For some of these products, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies have confirmed their mode of action, efficacy and safety [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>For over a century, mineral oils have been widely applied as external insecticidal with the aim to cover and suffocate insects [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, limited clinical data is available on mineral oil-based pediculicides. Some manufacturers claim that mineral oil is equally effective as silicones by disrupting water and gas exchange via the respiratory spiracles in a similar manner [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The present study has been set-up to compare efficacy and safety of a mineral oil head lice shampoo (Mosquito Med L&#x000e4;use Shampoo 10 in Germany; Silcap or Paranix shampoo in other countries) with a pyrethroid-based, reimbursed medicinal product (Goldgeist Forte<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> solution).</p><p>All study procedures were standardised and performed in accordance with the clinical trial protocol and the GCP regulations. Only minor deviations from the clinical trial protocol occurred and none was judged clinically relevant. No subject was excluded from the analysis due to protocol deviations. For the results obtained from the present study, no inconsistencies between related measures were observed.</p><p>Two data sets were statistically and independently analysed. From the 107 randomized subjects, 100 completely finished the study and received two treatments. Each arm included 50 subjects. These data have been used for the post hoc analyses. However, the primary data set consisted of 101 patients. One additional patient in the test group, who withdrew consent because of treatment failure during the study, was included for cure rate analysis at day 4.</p><p>Regarding the primary objective of this study, statistical analyses demonstrated that treatment with the test product yields very high cure rates: 96.1% (primary data set) and 98% (secondary data set), respectively, at day 10 for all baseline infestations. The observed values were higher than the pre-defined limit of 70% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The latter value approximates the highest cure rate (67.7%), reported in a recent clinical study with a comparable head lice product [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, in general, lower cure rates have been observed with pyrethroid-based treatments [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>For the control product, the cure rate at day 10 for all baseline infestations was not significantly different when compared to the test product (primary and secondary data set: 94%). In other words, superiority could not be shown by a reliable margin. However, according to the ICH [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is allowed to assess non&#x02013;inferiority in addition to superiority if a non-inferiority margin was predefined (-7.5% in the present study), and no corrections were made in terms of multiplicity. Taking into account a difference of 2.1% in cure rate between both treatment groups, non-inferiority was established.</p><p>Post hoc analysis revealed that over all visits, cure rates were higher for the test product than for the control, with a significant difference (95% CI: 8.5%; 39.5%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) at day 7 prior to treatment (test group, 90%; control: 66%). Day 7 was chosen to perform the second treatment, both based on the German guidelines for head lice treatment [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the instructions for use of both products.</p><p>Interestingly, a single application of the test product was sufficient to keep 78% (95% CI: 64.8%-87.2%) of all patients lice-free until the end of the observation period, being significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) different from the control group (60%; 95% CI: 46.2%-72.4).</p><p>Moreover, the maximum number of live lice in uncured subjects was lower in the test product group when compared to the control group (all visits). However, these higher values lie within the confidence interval of both products.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to mention that a) the overall infestation degree was lower in the control group, and b) the fact that more patients in the control group received larger volumes of product as recommended (n = 8 versus 3 for control and test group, respectively).</p><p>The observed cure rates were higher than typically reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Diagnostic combing might have theoretically biased clinical outcome. However, in both groups, diagnosis was performed in an identical manner by experienced staff in such a way that no lice and eggs were damaged or lost. For the same reason, wet combing following treatment was not intended. Therefore, even if combing would have had an impact on final clinical outcome, the effect would be minimal and comparable in both groups.</p><p>Another explanation for the observed results may be the rigorous compliance with the clinical procedures that characterized this particular study population. A third reason we can offer for the high cure rate is the limited spread of pyrethrin resistance in the German population. Germany is an exception in Europe because it has a tradition of prescription control for pyrethroid and organophosphorus pediculicides on the market. We speculate that the study population in this particular region may have been less exposed to insecticidal treatments. For this reason, there may have been less selection for resistance when compared to other countries. In Germany, pyrethroid-based products are still present on the positive list of the Robert Koch Institute (the central disease surveillance and prevention institute), and are still broadly recommended for head lice control.</p><p>Results of ovicidal testing (at the end of the study) would have added extra value to the clinical data. However, the clinical test facility was not able to do such tests. These assays needed to be performed elsewhere but transport of the samples would have stressed the nits and thus negatively bias hatching results. However, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> tests demonstrated reproducible mortality rates in line with the observed clinical outcome (unpublished data).</p><p>With respect to safety, the tested mineral oil shampoo consists of ingredients which are approved for use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. On a regular basis, ingredient safety are assessed by expert panels (e.g. Cosmetic Ingredient Review expert, Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety&#x02026;) and public health instances. Also, notification and auditing responsibilities for medical devices require a competent level of quality, safety and efficacy control. Present clinical safety data confirm results of different <italic>in vivo</italic> tests, performed according to specific ISO guidelines, to assess product safety. These test results are part of the medical device&#x02019;s technical file and are essential for product approval by the responsible authorities (data not shown).</p><p>As treatment time is very short and the number of treatments to cure patients is low (1 or 2), the risk of side effects is very low. Indeed, the present study confirms that the oil-based shampoo is well-tolerated, with a low number of adverse events. Finally, both short treatment period (10 min) and high efficacy minimize the exposure risk. Similar observations were made for the comparator. Skin irritation and burning was higher in the control group, whereas a limited number of subjects reported eye irritation in the test product group. Nevertheless, there is raising concern regarding potential acute and long-term effects on human health, associated to the use of pyrethroids [<xref rid="pone.0156853.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The higher treatment time (45 min) implies a higher exposure risk, which may in turn have an impact on long-term effects of pyrethroids.</p><p>Finally, the majority of the patients in both treatment arms were satisfied with the esthetical effects after treatment, including wash-out of the oily shampoo.</p><p>In conclusion, when compared to a pyrethroid-based product, the mineral oil shampoo may be a preferred option for head lice treatment. The ease of use (short exposure time), high efficacy, confirmed product safety, good esthetical effects, affordability and low risk for development of resistance are reassuring product characteristics that could improve treatment compliance and epidemiological control</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156853.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156853.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156853.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156853.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to express their sincere thanks to all study personnel at the study centre, especially Mrs. Kr&#x000fc;ger.
