There are two types of glaucoma: open angle and angle closure. Although primary open angle glaucoma is the more common, primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is the more severe (more likely to result in irreversible blindness if not properly treated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. By 2020 PACG will affect 20 million people, and 5.3 million will be blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the UK, PACG affects between 50,000 and 100,000 people, but is estimated to cause 1000 people to suffer irreversible blindness every year, and many more live with the disability and reduced quality of life associated with glaucoma. PACG is more common in East Asia than the rest of the world. Older age and female gender are demographic risk factors. Having a small eye and thus hypermetropia (far-sightedness) is also an important risk factor. Blindness is costly to health care, society and individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The effect of severe glaucoma on patients quality of life is profound (the utility associated with severe visual impairment is approximately half that of full health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The number of people diagnosed with PACG is predicted to increase substantially over the next few years as the result of an ageing population, increased optometric screening, and raised awareness of narrow angle pathologies among clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Within the eye the anterior chamber angle is located between the peripheral iris and the cornea. Within the anterior chamber angle the trabecular meshwork is responsible for aqueous humour (intraocular fluid) outflow. Primary angle closure (PAC) is characterised by contact between the peripheral iris and the trabecular meshwork (appositional closure) leading to an elevated IOP. This contact can ultimately result in a permanent (synechial) closure of the angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PACG occurs when high IOP damages the optic nerve and leads to visual loss and, if untreated or inadequately treated, blindness results. PACG occurs due to anatomic factors (such as a small eye, large lens, thick peripheral iris, anterior position of ciliary processes) within the eye. People with PAC and PACG can be symptomatic as an acute angle closure crisis, or more commonly asymptomatic.</p><p>The current standard care for PACG is a stepped approach of a combination of surgery (laser or incisional) and medical management. Initial surgery uses a laser to make a small hole in the iris (laser iridotomy [LI]) to open the drainage angle, and often eye drops are required as an adjunct to LI to further reduce the IOP. There are several types of drops used to lower IOP but prostaglandin and beta-blocker treatments are the most commonly used. If the drainage pathway is still closed after LI, alternative laser treatment whereby iris tissue is pulled away from the drainage angle, laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPI) is an option. If these first line treatments fail glaucoma surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy) is then indicated. Glaucoma surgery may fail to control the IOP, and in PACG complications are more likely (such as flat anterior chamber and malignant glaucoma) than for other types of glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>These standard approaches to PACG management have been noted to have variable success. A new approach to the management of patients with PACG (lens extraction by phacoemulsification) has, however, gained recent interest among specialists internationally. The lens of the eye plays a major role in the mechanisms leading to PACG including pupillary block and angle crowding. The hypothesis is that PACG could be treated by removing the lens (by phacoemulsification). For glaucoma patients with cataract, lens extraction is always required. However, in the absence of cataract, whether to extract the lens, and the timing of such intervention, remains open to debate. It is likely that many people with PACG (up to 50%) will go on to develop cataracts and require surgery due to ageing and to the effect of conventional glaucoma treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which may accelerate cataract progression but by this stage irreversible glaucoma damage and sight loss may have occurred. It is proposed that early lens extraction will improve glaucoma control by opening the drainage angle. This should reduce the need for medications and trabeculectomy, maintain good visual acuity, and improve quality of life compared with standard care. It will also improve the visual function in patients with hypermetropia (found in the majority of PACG patients), by correcting this refractive error.</p><p>A 2006 Cochrane systematic review by Friedman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] of lens extraction for PACG found no RCTs of lens extraction versus alternative treatment options for PACG. Two included non-randomized studies were deemed of poor quality. The authors concluded that there was not enough evidence to assess the superiority of lens extraction over other interventions to control IOP in this condition, and RCTs comparing lens extraction with alternative treatment options were required.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The following question will be addressed, primarily in terms of Quality of Life and vision as well as the intraocular pressure, stability of the disease and the safety of the interventions at three years after randomisation: For people with PACG what is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early lens extraction surgery compared with standard care (usually laser iridotomy followed by a sequence of medical therapy and glaucoma surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy or another glaucoma operation)?</p><p>The hypotheses being tested are that those randomized to early lens extraction will have a higher EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire score (mean difference of 0.05); lower IOP (mean difference of 1.75 mmHg); and a 15% lower glaucoma surgery rate than those randomized to standard care at three years.</p><sec><title>Participants and eligibility</title><p>All people presenting, in the recruitment centres in the UK and East Asia, with newly diagnosed PACG.

If both eyes are eligible, the eye with more severe disease will be the first to undergo surgery, followed by the second eye within 60 days if the first intervention has been uncomplicated.

Uncontrolled IOP is determined by the local ophthalmologist, and typically additional treatment would be aiming for a target IOP between 15-20 mmHg depending on the degree of optic nerve damage. After medical antiglaucoma therapy fails to control IOP, glaucoma surgery would be initiated. The need for glaucoma surgery will be qualified as a "failure" of the intervention/standard care to control the disease. Patients will remain in the trial and will continue to be followed up according to the protocol.

Unmasked interim analyses will be conducted for the DMC meeting as determined by their agreed terms of reference. The statistical analysis will be based on all participants as randomized, irrespective of subsequent compliance with the treatment allocated.</p><p>The outcomes listed above will be compared between the experimental and control groups using generalised linear models (analysis of covariance) that adjust for the minimisation factors (and where appropriate, baseline values of outcome). Statistical significance will be at the 5% level (2P &#x0003c; 0.05). Analysis of co-variance will also be used in sub-group analyses performed using interaction terms (treatment group by subgroup) all at stricter levels of statistical significance (2p &#x0003c; 0.01). All participants will remain in their allocated group for analysis (intention to treat). Missing data statistical modelling techniques will be used to make use of outcome assessments prior to 3 years, and sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of the treatment estimates to these approaches. The type of methods that would be used include expectation maximisation algorithm, multiple imputation, general linear mixed models, techniques based on survival analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The specific missing data approach will be pre-specified once the pattern of missingness has been determined.</p><p>The unit of analysis for the primary clinical outcome will be the eye. When a participant contributes data from two eyes the clustering will be accounted for using random effects models. For quality of life measures the unit of analysis will be the participant, with bilateral disease included as a covariate. Subgroup analysis of the primary clinical outcome (IOP) will be done according to ethnicity (Chinese or non-Chinese), and diagnosis (PAC or PACG).</p><p>We will validate the quality of life measure (NEI-VFQ25), in this patient group to assess sensitivity to change of increased visual field loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary patient reported quality of life outcome is the EQ-5D. A study with 170 participants in each group would have 90% power at 5% significance level to detect a difference in means of 0.35 of a standard deviation (SD). Our experience of using the EQ-5D in patients with moderate severity of glaucoma suggests that 0.35 SD relates to a change in EQ-5D score of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Such a mean change is likely to be both clinically and economically important. The primary clinical outcome of the study will be the comparison of IOP at 3 years post randomisation. Assuming that the standard deviation of IOP at 3 years is about 5 mmHg in both randomized groups (previous studies in PACG patients have reported standard deviations from 3.6 to 4.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] the study would have 90% power at a 5% level of significance to detect a mean difference in IOP between the two groups of 1.75 mmHg. Previous studies based on RCT evidence in open angle glaucoma have suggested that a 2 mmHg reduction in IOP corresponds to a 20% reduction in the risk of progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We are therefore confident that the study is adequately powered to detect clinically relevant changes in IOP. The study would also have 80% power to detect a difference of 15% in the glaucoma surgery rate (assuming the glaucoma surgery rate was 40% or less). Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up at 3 years, the total number of participants required in the study is 400 (200 in each group). We have conservatively powered the study on participants, not eyes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Glossary of abbreviations</title><p>AMD: Age-related Macular Degeneration; AS-OCT: Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography; BID: Twice a day; CHaRT: Centre for Healthcare Randomized Trials; DMC: Data Monitoring Committee; EAGLE: Effectiveness in Angle Closure Glaucoma of Lens Extraction; EQ-5D: European quality of life in 5 dimensions; ETDRS: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study; GPI: Glaucoma Profile Index; IOL: Intraocular Lens; IOP: Intraocular Pressure; ISRCTN: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number; LI: Laser Iridotomy; LPI: Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty; NEI-VFQ25: National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25; NHS: National Health Service; NRES: National Research Ethics Service; OD: Once a day; PAC: Primary Angle Closure; PACG: Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma; QALY: Quality Adjusted Life Year; QID: Four times a day; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; SD: Standard Deviation; UBM: Ultrasound Biomicroscopy; UK: United Kingdom; VF: Visual Field</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AAB and JB: chief investigators.

Patient reported outcomes used in EAGLE: description, scoring and interpretation</title><sec><title>EQ-5D</title><p>EQ-5D is a generic health status instrument developed by EuroQOL Group that can be used for clinical and economic evaluations as well as population based surveys. EQ-5D consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system which provides a simple descriptive profile of health in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression, each with three levels. The EQ-5D also includes a visual analogue scale on which patients rate their own health between 0 (best imaginable health state) and 100 (worst imaginable health state).</p><p>A single summary index can be generated by applying a formula that attaches values to each level in each dimension. Therefore, patient's health state can be classified into one of the 243 theoretically possible health states (e.g. value of full health is 11111). These value sets are obtained using result of EQ-5D visual analogue scale valuation or the time trade-off (TTO) valuation of a representative sample of the population in several countries.</p><p>Reference for EQ-5D: The Euroqol Group.

It measures the impact of vision problems on vision-targeted functioning and health related quality of life (HR QOL). NEI-VFQ 25 consists of 25-items with 11 subscales and a single general health rating question. A standard algorithm was used to calculate the scale scores which vary from 0 to 100 whereby 100 is the best possible score and 0 the worst. A composite NEI-VFQ 25 score can be generated by averaging the eleven scores (except the general health rating question). A higher score represents better visual functioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Glaucoma Utility Index</title><p>The Glaucoma Utility Index (GUI) is a glaucoma-specific preference based (utility) measure developed for economic evaluation. GUI provides a descriptive profile in six dimensions: central and near vision, lighting and glare, mobility, activities of daily living, eye discomfort and other effects of glaucoma and its' treatment, each with four levels. A single summary index can be generated where patients' health state can be classified into one of the 4096 theoretically possible health states. Value sets are obtained by using results of discrete choice experiment (DCE) of a representative sample of glaucoma population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Appendix 3. Charter and responsibilities of the Data Monitoring Committee</title><p>A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established. The DMC is independent of the study organisers. During the period of recruitment to the study, interim analyses will be supplied, in strict confidence, to the DMC, together with any other analyses that the committee may request. This may include analyses of data from other comparable trials. In the light of these interim analyses, the DMC will advise the TSC if, in its view:</p><p>a) the active intervention has been proved, beyond reasonable doubt*, to be different from the control (standard management) for all or some types of participants, and</p><p>b) the evidence on the economic outcomes is sufficient to guide a decision from health care providers regarding recommendation of early lens extraction for PACG.</p><p>The TSC can then decide whether or not to modify intake to the trial. Unless this happens, however, the TSC, PMG, clinical collaborators and study office staff (except those who supply the confidential analyses) will remain ignorant of the interim results.</p><p>The frequency of interim analyses will depend on the judgement of the Chair of the DMC, in consultation with the TSC. However, we anticipate that there might be three interim analyses and one final analysis.</p><p>The Chair is Mr David Garway-Heath, with Dr David Crabb, and Professor Baljean Dhillon. Terms of reference for the DMC are available on request from the EAGLE study office.</p><p>* Appropriate criteria for proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least three standard deviation in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting, or modifying, such a study prematurely (Peto R et al, Br J Cancer 1976;34:548-612).</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic>Trial steering committee.
