The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the US National Institute of Mental Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have emphasized the need for the development and evaluation of new approaches to the treatment of AN as at present, there is little high quality empirical evidence to support a preferred psychological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Whilst randomised controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evaluating treatment outcomes, process evaluations integrated into trials provide crucial information regarding factors involved in treatment success, such as fidelity and quality of implementation, potential causal mechanisms, and contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Such process evaluations are used to supplement quantitative outcomes by providing a more complete picture of the treatment approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This puts an emphasis on meanings, experiences, and views of all the participants in order to understand treatment in the natural setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Evaluations aim to identify the potential &#x0201c;active ingredients&#x0201d; of a particular treatment approach, and explore interactions between patients and therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The present study is the second stage of a planned process evaluation conducted as part of a large multi-centre RCT, the Maudsley Outpatient Study of Treatment for Adults with Anorexia Nervosa and Related Conditions (MOSAIC). The MOSAIC trial compared two outpatient treatments. The first is a novel therapy, Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with Anorexia Nervosa (MANTRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the second, Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM) is a more established treatment that was developed as a standardised form of treatment as usual, emphasising the importance of the non-specific curative factors of therapeutic relationships and active interest of the therapists in the progress of their patients. This treatment has been shown to be superior to cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy at end of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but with effects lessening over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Full details on the MOSAIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], MANTRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and SSCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] can be found elsewhere. Both treatments were found to be effective, with MANTRA having advantages in more severely ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the first stage of our process evaluation, we explored both therapist and patient experiences of MANTRA and SSCM using in-depth qualitative interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There was a high level of agreement between therapists&#x02019; and patients&#x02019; views of these two treatments, their unique and overlapping features and relative strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>A limitation of the study on patients&#x02019; views [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was that because of resource constraints only a small proportion (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) of participants from one of the study centres were included and they were interviewed at different stages of treatment, i.e. without the benefit of having experienced a full course of treatment. Oakley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have highlighted several methodological issues to be considered in conducting process evaluations within RCTs: All participating treatment sites should be included as well as both qualitative and quantitative data, and importantly, process data should be analysed <italic>prior</italic> to the outcome data to minimize potential biases in interpreting results. The present study has taken into account the aforementioned criteria, in addition to approaching all available MOSAIC trial patients to obtain generalisable results and assessing their feedback after the completion of all treatment sessions, in order to supplement the earlier study by Lose et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to conduct a process evaluation prior to analysis of outcome data to investigate patients&#x02019; experiences of two different treatments within a large RCT of outpatient treatment of AN. The main objective was to combine participants&#x02019; quantitative treatment acceptability and credibility ratings at 12&#x000a0;months with qualitative written feedback. It was hoped that the patients&#x02019; qualitative feedback could shed more light on the factors associated with their treatment ratings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>MOSAIC trial participants were 142 adults (98&#x000a0;% female) with a DSM-IV-TR (2000) diagnosis of AN or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified AN type (EDNOS-AN), recruited between June 2010 and November 2012 from four treatment centres in the UK: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; North East London Foundation Trust Eating Disorders Service; Barnet, Enfield &#x00026; Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust; Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. For inclusion in the trial, participants needed a body mass index (BMI) of below 18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and the absence of any major mental or physical co-morbidities that warranted their own treatment. There was no lower BMI limit provided patients were medically stable. After initial assessment, including a range of eating disorder (ED) and other outcome measures, participants were randomly allocated to receive either 20 once-weekly sessions of MANTRA or SSCM plus four monthly follow-up sessions. Optional additional sessions with a dietician and sessions including a family member were also offered. Patients with a BMI of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the start of treatment were offered 30 weekly sessions. Therapists were expected to see patients in both treatment conditions to control for therapist effects. Follow-up research assessments were carried out at six months (approximately at the end of weekly treatment sessions) and 12&#x000a0;months (end of follow-up sessions). Full details of in- and exclusion criteria and trial procedures can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Ethical approval for the MOSAIC trial was obtained from the Central London REC 4, National Research Ethics Service, Royal Free Hospital, London, (Reference: 10/H0714/9). The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN67720902.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</title><p>The EDE measures eating disordered thoughts and behaviors. The EDE is a semi-structured diagnostic interview that generates 4 subscale scores, the mean of which gives an overall global score. Higher scores indicate more serious eating disordered psychopathology. It has been shown to have good reliability and discriminant validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. EDE interviews were carried out by trained assessors. Inter-rater reliability was checked through second scoring every 10<sup>th</sup> interview.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment acceptability and credibility</title><p>Acceptability and credibility of treatment were assessed using two 10&#x000a0;cm visual analogue scales (VAS). Participants were asked to place a vertical mark on each scale to indicate how they would rate themselves in relation to two questions: 1) &#x02018;How <italic>acceptable</italic> did you find the type of treatment you received from your therapist during this study?&#x02019; and 2) &#x02018;To what extent do you feel that the treatment you received has <italic>helped you</italic> to reduce your eating disorder behaviors?&#x02019; On the two scales, 0&#x000a0;cm corresponds to &#x02018;completely unacceptable&#x02019; and &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; and 10&#x000a0;cm represents &#x02018;completely acceptable&#x02019; and &#x02018;very much so&#x02019; respectively. As a treatment&#x02019;s &#x02018;credibility&#x02019; may be difficult for patients to conceptualize, we operationalised it as the reduction of eating disorder behaviours to assess how the treatment has been effective. Helpfulness of treatment is a key aspect of established credibility scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Scores for treatment acceptability and treatment credibility were calculated separately and to one decimal place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant written feedback form</title><p>This qualitative feedback form asked two questions: (1) &#x02018;What was your experience of therapy in the MOSAIC trial?&#x02019; and (2) &#x02018;Do you have any comments or suggestions?&#x02019; Participants were informed that anonymised quotes might be used in publications and a tick box was provided if participants wished to opt out from this (2/82 participants used this option). To protect anonymity, all participants who completed the written feedback were assigned a pseudonym.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Procedure</title><p>Demographic and clinical information including age, age of onset, illness duration, BMI, and EDE global score were collected at baseline (pre-randomisation) assessment. Process evaluation data were part of the planned 6- and 12&#x000a0;month follow-up assessments. Ratings of acceptability and credibility were obtained at both 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments in order to capture changing views over time. Written feedback was collected at 12&#x000a0;months only. In all cases, participants were posted the process questionnaires to complete in their own time prior to attending the planned follow-up appointment.</p><p>At the time of data collection, research assessors did not read written feedback forms in order to ensure they remained blind to patient treatment allocation. Instead a separate researcher (KAZ), who was not involved in data collection, read and transcribed the feedback for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Quantitative analysis</title><p>Analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20 software. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two treatment groups and between patients who did or did not provide process evaluation data. Independent <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to compare the acceptability and credibility ratings given by MANTRA and SSCM patients at 6-month and12-month follow up assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Qualitative analysis</title><p>Participants&#x02019; written feedback forms were transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo 10 by researcher KAZ. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] six phase thematic analysis process from a realist epistemological standpoint. The approach used is similar to that of our first published process evaluation of the MOSAIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], in which coding was driven by the information obtained from the participants&#x02019; feedback.</p><p>All 82 written feedback responses were transcribed into the software package, before being read and re-read to familiarize the researcher with the data and allow for initial generation of ideas. Through repeated re-reading of the transcripts the researcher identified patterns of common issues raised and data were systematically coded (i.e. a code representing the most basic segment or element of the raw data). At this early stage, as many codes as possible were generated and collated, then grouped into overarching themes and subthemes. Subsequently, codes and themes were constantly reviewed and refined, discarded, combined or split. Broad, higher-order themes and subthemes were labeled and organized to include all relevant codes.</p><p>KAZ, BR and US, researchers blind to treatment outcome, completed data triangulations to improve validity and reliability of the resulting themes, noting down over-arching themes and additional ideas. They came together to consolidate their findings, discussing any disagreements until a consensus was reached. The frequencies with which the codes and themes occurred were calculated and the numbers of words in the transcripts were counted, using the word count facility in Microsoft Office Word 2007. The final thematic map is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Thematic map of participants&#x02019; written feedback</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40337_2016_91_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Global valence ratings of feedback</title><p>In a separate step, two researchers (KAZ, BR) independently rated the overall global valence of participants&#x02019; responses on the feedback form as overall positive, mixed or overall negative. Feedback was rated as overall positive if the experience of therapy was described using only favorable, approving, enthusiastic descriptions (e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;BRILLIANT&#x02026; Really feel that I have been so lucky to be here and it has made all the difference between recovery and not&#x0201d;</italic>), as mixed if there clearly were some positive and some negative descriptions (e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;Mainly positive &#x02013; although I don&#x02019;t think it was very positive or useful for the state I was in at the time so didn&#x02019;t make best use of the trial&#x0201d;</italic>), and as overall negative if the person described their experience in dismissive, disapproving or unenthusiastic terms (e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;Useless and made me worse until landed up in hospital again&#x0201d;</italic>). Seven irrelevant responses were excluded (e.g. where participants had exclusively focused their feedback on the research process or were unable to give appropriate feedback on treatment due to receiving a very limited number of sessions). The ratings were finalised when a consensus was agreed upon. These ratings were subsequently used as comparisons between treatment groups in our quantitative analyses.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Quantitative analyses</title><p>114 of 142 MOSAIC participants (80.3&#x000a0;%) provided acceptability or credibility ratings at six- or 12-month follow-up.

For SSCM, treatment-specific factors included the focus on weight and eating and lack of structure. Treatment outcomes and recovery describe the positive and negative outcomes, and stage of recovery at the end of treatment. Non-specific factors describe those shared between the two treatment groups such as duration and frequency of treatment, external support and the patient-therapist relationship.

This evaluation combined the use of both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess patients&#x02019; treatment experiences.</p><p>Findings show that at 12&#x000a0;months post-randomisation i.e. at the end of both weekly and follow up treatment sessions, MANTRA patients rate their treatment as significantly more acceptable and credible than patients receiving SSCM. This result is strengthened by the clear agreement between the global valence of the qualitative written feedback and quantitative VAS ratings at 12-month follow-up, in that participants who provided overall positive written feedback also rated their treatment as significantly more acceptable and credible than participants who gave mixed or negative written feedback.</p><p>It is also of note that, although overall proportions of MANTRA and SSCM patients who provided some process feedback did not differ, significantly more MANTRA patients gave written feedback when compared to SSCM. Those MANTRA patients who did respond also tended to give a more detailed account of their experiences (as assessed by number of words used). This difference might be explained by the fact that MANTRA aims to reduce AN patients&#x02019; emotion avoidance and suppression, and to increase emotional clarity and adaptive emotion regulation, such as emotional expressivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Arguably willingness to express views about one&#x02019;s treatment experience is a facet of this. Alternatively, it may be that MANTRA patients are simply more practiced in using writing as a form of expression compared to SSCM patients, given that therapeutic writing exercises are incorporated into this treatment, but not into SSCM.</p><p>Overall, themes that arose from the thematic analysis replicate those found in our earlier paper which used qualitative interviews in a subset of patients from one participating centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Participants highlighted both treatment specific (e.g. MANTRA: manual, exercises, comprehensive focus; SSCM: focus on nutrition, lack of structure) and non-specific factors (e.g. relationship with therapist, treatment pacing, duration, frequency and disruption, external social support and concerns about ending therapy) as important aspects of their treatment. Thus MANTRA and SSCM were experienced somewhat differently in terms of their focus, strengths and challenges, but there were also some overlapping features.</p><p>The perceived differences between treatments, both positive and negative, were to an extent, in line with the specific focus and targets of each treatment. MANTRA targets motivational, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal maintaining factors of AN with the aim of effecting nutritional changes via broader cognitive and emotional changes. In contrast, SSCM centrally focuses on improving eating and weight and other topics for discussion arise as chosen by patients, session by session. Thus, in MANTRA many participants valued the flexible, individually tailored manual-based approach and the focus on thoughts and feelings. A small number of patients however, experienced certain therapeutic exercises as unhelpful or even as patronising, and felt the manual-based approach did not address their unique problems or teach them anything new. Whilst these more critical views may be legitimate and appropriate there is a possibility that they may at least in part be linked to AN patients&#x02019; detail-focused perfectionist cognitive style, that makes some individuals dismissive of anything that is not a perfect fit. It is important for therapist to be aware of this possibility.</p><p>In SSCM, patients who gave positive feedback commended the clear focus on nutrition and freedom offered, whereas others saw the focus on nutrition as negative, generating anxiety and distress. SSCM&#x02019;s lack of structure was also seen as unhelpful by some, in facilitating exploration of certain aspects of their illness.</p><p>In addition, across treatment groups disappointment regarding failure to reach desired improvements or a continuation of significant ED symptoms associated with more negative feedback. Thus mixed or negative feedback about treatment appeared to be due to a range of reasons, some to do with the therapeutic focus, content, delivery or structure, others with patients&#x02019; mixed feelings about change or disappointment about limited progress.</p><p>As expected, due to feedback being collected at the end of treatment the theme of recovery and life beyond therapy was more prominent in the present evaluation than in our earlier interview study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. More MANTRA patients addressed this issue than those receiving SSCM. In general, MANTRA patients expressed greater satisfaction with their progress and excitement about working towards their future, despite the recognition that achieving recovery would remain challenging. Of the few SSCM patients mentioning this theme one individual expressed pessimism about recovery whilst the other remained hopeful.</p><p>Several non-specific factors were mentioned by a substantial number of patients. This suggests the importance of basic factors such as structure, duration and timing for the success of a treatment and the difficulties that arise from disruptions through therapist illness or departure. The single most commonly mentioned theme by a long way, unsurprisingly was that of the therapeutic relationship A previous study on therapist characteristics preferred by AN patients identified factors (acceptance, vitality, challenge and expertise) associated with a good therapeutic relationship and also unhelpful therapist characteristics (disregard, prejudice, passivity, pampering) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The views of patients in the present study largely confirm these findings. Overall, our findings support the implications highlighted in the earlier process evaluations of the MOSAIC Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. More specifically, the importance of non- specific factors, such as therapist characteristics, individualisation of treatment and social support are emphasized.</p><p>Since the completion of the process study, the study&#x02019;s main outcomes have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Findings show that MANTRA patients attended significantly more treatment sessions and a higher proportion of MANTRA patients were treatment completers. Whilst overall there were no significant differences at 12&#x000a0;months between MANTRA and SSCM on BMI, eating disorders psychopathology, distress levels and other outcomes, MANTRA appeared to be advantageous in more underweight patients in terms of facilitating greater weight gain at both 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. This suggests that MANTRA patients&#x02019; view of this treatment as more acceptable, credible and all round positive is at least in part rooted in better clinical outcomes.</p><p>The &#x02018;three-legged stool&#x02019; principle of evidence-based medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] suggests that in choosing one intervention over another, best available research evidence about efficacy, clinical expertise and patient preference all need to be considered. With this in mind MANTRA can be recommended over SSCM.</p><p>Finally, due to the more positive initial treatment experience, individuals&#x02019; receiving MANTRA may be more willing to have further treatment should this become necessary. This is particularly important for the many individuals with AN who have a chronic and/or relapsing course of the illness.</p><p>This study has several strengths and limitations. Firstly, over 80&#x000a0;% of MOSAIC trial participants provided some process feedback and there were no baseline differences between those who did and did not provide these data. Thus, our findings are likely to be representative of the views shared by the whole MOSAIC trial sample. Secondly, treatment acceptability and credibility ratings were supported by the written feedback provided. Thirdly, participants were recruited from all treatment sites involved in the MOSAIC trial and data were obtained and analysed before trial outcomes are known. Finally, bias in the interpretation of qualitative data was reduced through performing data triangulations.</p><p>The study also has a number of limitations. First, a significantly higher proportion of MANTRA patients compared to SSCM patients provided written feedback. The fact that the SSCM group were more selected may have biased the results. Second, although the use of written feedback, enabled participants to express their opinions freely and independently (i.e. away from their therapists&#x02019;), the questions asked were broad and the written nature of the feedback did not allow for probing and exploration of key issues as a qualitative interview would. It might have been helpful to include detailed questions in order to obtain more in-depth feedback regarding different treatment components and outcomes. Third, the feedback represents participants&#x02019; retrospective recollections of treatment at the time point of assessment, and there may have been some recall bias. However, this would have operated similarly in both treatments. Fourth, some of the qualitative themes were only reported by one or two participants. Thus caution is required in interpretation of these findings. Nonetheless, current results replicate those obtained from semi-structured interviews carried out as part of the previous evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Fifth, our assessment of credibility was limited to helpfulness of treatment and thus rather narrow. Established expectancy/credibility scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] also include other aspects, such as how logical a particular therapy rationale seems to the patient and whether they would recommend a treatment to a friend or another person in their situation. It is possible that use of a broader credibility scale would have yielded different responses.</p><p>A final limitation is the lack of a treatment expectancy measure taken at the start of therapy. However, in the previous pilot trial comparing MANTRA with SSCM a treatment expectancy measure was included and both treatments were viewed as equally credible and positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together with our earlier interview paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] on patients&#x02019; views of their treatment this study is very much a first attempt to capture some of the qualitative views of patients receiving the two study treatments and is somewhat exploratory in its nature. MANTRA patients viewed their treatment as more acceptable, credible and generally more positive in comparison to patients receiving SSCM at 12&#x000a0;months. Participants also highlighted the useful components of and outcomes associated with their treatment. MANTRA patients valued the use of the manual and the focus on cognitive, emotional and interpersonal factors, while SSCM patients mentioned its less structured nature and focus on nutrition. This study, together with the previous process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], suggests that many individuals with AN perceive MANTRA as a viable treatment option. Further studies should include more sophisticated methods of evaluating treatment process to address the dearth of research in this area.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>US and JT are the developers of MANTRA.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>US and BR conceived and designed the study.
