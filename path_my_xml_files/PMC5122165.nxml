Aims of the study are to understand how both, an existing therapy approach as well as the elements to be integrated, are affected by the integration and to clarify the role of emotional processing as a mediator of therapy outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 130 adults with a diagnosed unipolar depressive, anxiety or adjustment disorder (seeking treatment at a psychotherapy outpatient clinic) are randomized to either treatment as usual (PT) with integrated emotion-focused components (TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT) or PT (TAU). Primary outcome variables are psychopathology and symptom severity at the end of therapy and at follow up; secondary outcome variables are interpersonal problems, psychological wellbeing, quality of life, attainment of individual therapy goals, and emotional competency. Furthermore, process variables such as the quality of the therapeutic relationship are studied as well as aptitude-treatment interactions. Variables are assessed at baseline, after 8 and 16 sessions, at the end of therapy, after 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 sessions, and at 6, 12 and 36&#x000a0;month follow-up. Underlying mechanisms of change are investigated. Statistical analyses will be conducted using the appropriate multilevel approaches, mainly two-level regression and growth analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will indicate whether the integration of emotion-focused elements into treatment as usual increases the effectiveness of Psychological Therapy. If advantages are found, which may be limited to particular variables or subgroups of patients, recommendations for a systematic integration, and caveats if also disadvantages are detected, can be formulated. On a more abstract level, a cognitive behavioral (represented by PT) and humanistic/experiential (represented by EFT) approach will be integrated. It must be emphasized that mimicking common practice in the development and continued education of psychotherapists, EFT is not integrated as a whole, but only elements of EFT that are considered particularly important, and can be trained in an 8-day training plus supervision of therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02822443?term=NCT02822443&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02822443</ext-link>, 22 June 2016, retrospectively registered</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Emotion-Focused Therapy</kwd><kwd>Integration</kwd><kwd>Self-regulation</kwd><kwd>Psychological Therapy</kwd><kwd>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</kwd><kwd>Randomized Controlled Trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100019_159425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caspar</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Grawe formulated an approach designated General Psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in which he postulated that first generation approaches, the original approaches to psychotherapy as developed by their founders, had to be overcome. In his opinion they neglect or even suppress and fight concepts and findings that are not in line with their original stance. Second generation approaches, in contrast, utilize all concepts and evidence relevant for a scope of applications. The domain for which it claims relevance may be limited, but all that is relevant to the claimed range of application should be integrated. As research is continually developing, <italic>General Psychotherapy</italic> stands for a continuous endeavor despite the end state never fully being reached. It is not just another approach to psychotherapy with a fixed set of concepts and interventions, but rather a model in continuous development. <italic>Psychological therapy</italic> (PT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]) as practiced in Bern at the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Psychology and taught in the postgraduate training program as well as in many other German-speaking institutions, follows the idea of General Psychotherapy. It is mainly a cognitive behavioral approach that has its roots in humanistic and learning theories, but also relies on cognitive science, emotion and social psychology, neurobiology, and interpersonal and systemic approaches. Since its origins in the late 70&#x02019;s, there has been an ongoing attempt to follow the principles of General Psychotherapy. This has led to an approach that could be described as integrative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The integration, however, is not eclectic but guided by theoretical concepts such as general change factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These change factors include clarification, resource activation, problem activation, and problem mastery. Psychotherapeutic interventions can be related to these factors, which allows for the description of approaches to psychotherapy in terms of their typical profiles. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for example, has an emphasis on mastery, and problem activation takes specific forms, such as behavioral exposure. Systemic approaches have a traditional strength in resource activation. Client centered therapy and psychodynamic approaches predominantly offer interventions fostering clarification, etc. A problem is that not all patients need the same profile in their therapy, and matching the patients&#x02019; needs with what a traditional approach has to offer is not an optimal solution: The same patient may need different approaches for different problems, there may be a change of needs over time, and not all relevant problems may be known in the beginning of a therapy. Therefore a psychotherapeutic approach should be adaptable to the patient needs and possibilities as reflected in a case formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To reach this goal, it is desirable that for all change factors a sufficient range of interventions and concepts upon which they are based is available, and the use of each has been empirically studied.</p><p>In the past decades Emotion-Focused Therapy (EFT) has become increasingly popular, both in clinical practice and in research. EFT is an approach of humanistic, client-centered, and gestalt origin. Main proponents are Greenberg, Elliott, Paivio, Watson, Pascual-Leone, Goldman, and Pos (for an overview: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). EFT refers to common concepts of emotion psychology and other relevant domains of psychology and includes a number of concepts as well as interventions. EFT is a process-oriented approach that integrates an empathic relationship offer and process-directive interventions aiming to improve a patient&#x02019;s ability to constructively deal with emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to the prescriptive concepts of EFT, various types of emotional experiencing/processing are distinguished, which require different interventions. Important distinctions are primary vs. secondary emotions (roughly: natural/spontaneous vs. transformed/distorted) and adaptive vs. maladaptive emotions (roughly: helpful vs. not helpful for satisfying one&#x02019;s needs). It is assumed that a patient&#x02019;s problems are often related to an inability to understand own emotions and thus an inability to derive appropriate responses. It can also be an inability to expose oneself to threatening or painful emotions, even though such exposure has a potential of fostering personal development. The overarching goal is to enable the patient to become asymptomatic and improve quality of life by transforming maladaptive emotions into adaptive emotions. The therapeutic procedure is led by &#x0201c;markers&#x0201d; (indicators for problems in emotional processing, but also for a patient&#x02019;s readiness to work on emotional problems), which become visible/audible in the therapeutic process and indicate which therapeutic interventions are most promising under which circumstances. Within a relatively short time, EFT has acquired a sound scientific stance in several empirical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It corresponds to APA (American Psychological Association) standards of empirically validated treatments for individual treatment of depression and for couples therapy, for which manuals have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence for positive effects on other disorders.</p><p>In practice, psychotherapists increasingly tailor their interventions to the characteristics of an individual patient and thereby use a number of methods not confined to a single therapy approach. Recent evidence shows that a big part, if not a majority of psychotherapists, adopt a rather integrative stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Trained in one approach, therapists seek complements in other approaches when they find conceptual and practical weaknesses of their initial approach. With experience, therapists acquire elements from other therapy schools and traditions and thus become more flexible in the treatment of their patients, conceptually and technically. Therapists tend to integrate therapeutic elements from a new approach into the old one, once they were found effective through empirical evidence. They rather integrate elements of a new approach into an old one than changing completely from the original approach to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. At the level of training, a recent study conducted in the United States showed that one third of the accredited training programs in psychotherapy offer mandatory or optional training in five major psychotherapy theories (psychodynamic theory, humanistic theory, cognitive theory, behavioral theory, systems theory), 90% reported teaching psychotherapy integration in one or more courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The majority of trainees characterizes their therapeutic approach as &#x0201c;eclectic/integrative&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and in private practice, only two percent of therapists completely identify themselves with one single orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A common type of integration has been named assimilative integration, that is, therapists are trained in a particular approach and take it as a point of departure for integrating other concepts and interventions that appear as particularly useful complements to the original one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent expert panel on the future of psychotherapy in the United States of America (&#x0201c;Psychotherapy in 2022&#x0201c;) estimated a likely increase of integrative approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, it is uncommon to study such integration, and research on its effects on process and outcome is rather rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, more research on psychotherapy integration is needed, if psychotherapy research is to cover real practice in an endeavor to reduce the currently much bemoaned scientist-practitioner gap. The main aim of this study is to compare Psychological Therapy corresponding to the usual practice in Bern to Psychological Therapy with integrated EFT elements. A central characteristic of the presented project is its external validity being particularly evident in the elaboration of naturalistic conditions and treatment as usual (TAU) being part of both conditions (TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT and TAU). Twenty-three therapists per condition treat a total of 130 patients from the outpatient clinic of the University of Bern, suffering from depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders. Therapists vary in their general therapy experience and extent of training. This will allow for evaluating the influence of these variables. To secure balance regarding the amount of training and supervision between the project conditions, TAU without EFT will be supplemented with additional units elaborating on some elements that are already part of PT.</p><p>The overarching question addressed is: What are the consequences of systematically integrating emotion-focused concepts and interventions into Psychological Therapy? This is seen as exemplary for major steps in therapy development in the sense of General Psychotherapy and follows suggestions by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The general research question can be subdivided into the following questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Is there a general superiority of TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT over TAU in the changes from pre to follow-up (with indicators such as stability of change, post-therapeutic gain, and reduction of relapses)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is there a superiority of TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT over TAU in variables indicating deeper levels of processing?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are there negative side effects of the integration e.g. due to less attention and time dedicated to more traditional but useful elements and procedures?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Additional exploratory research questions include the examination of potential predictors, moderators and mediators of outcome (e.g. symptom severity, onset of primary disorder, previous psychotherapies, and process variables such as experiencing ratings).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Some questions are specific in terms of differential effects regarding TAU and TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT (e.g., level of experiential processing, emotion-regulation skills). The example of emotional processing (EP) is used to illustrate the kind of planned analyses. EP is assumed to be a trans-theoretical mechanism of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and emotion-focused interventions are considered potent ways to facilitate emotional processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Moreover, the level of EP has predicted psychotherapy outcome in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients in TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT will show higher levels of EP than patients in TAU, and the level of EP in both conditions will mediate the relationship between emotion-focused interventions and therapy outcome. Higher levels of EP will predict better outcomes at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 130 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for a unipolar depressive (ICD, F32), anxiety (ICD, F40, F41) or adjustment disorder (ICD, F43.2) are being recruited, with 65 participants randomly assigned to the TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT condition and 65 to treatment as usual. Participants are recruited at the psychotherapy outpatient clinic of the University of Bern, once they have registered for therapy and meet the requirements for participation in the study. As both conditions can be offered as treatments with empirically supported effects, it is not expected that many patients will decline, although the standard of 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 sessions may be an obstacle to some.</p><p>With an average of three therapies per therapist, 23 therapists are needed per condition. In support of external validity and generalizability of our findings, therapists of varying experience are included. The participation of five experienced therapists and 18 therapists in training per condition is planned. All therapists in this study have a master&#x02019;s degree in psychology and therapists in training have been in postgraduate training at the University of Bern for at least 1 and a half years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>One important goal of this project is to inform therapists about the effects of integrating emotion-focused elements in Psychological Therapy in a naturalistic and routine practice setting. To maximize external validity and generalizability to common therapeutic practice the patient sample should not be too homogeneous and the sample should be replicable. A good solution seems to focus on patients with unipolar depressive, anxiety and adjustments disorders as the most prevalent patient groups in psychotherapy outpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], making about 50% of the patients in our outpatient clinic. Minimum age is 18. Exclusion criteria are active substance dependence for the previous 6 months, current suicidal risk or immediate threats of self-harm, or meeting criteria for organic mental disorders. In addition, we exclude individuals with health conditions that require medication potentially affecting their mood (e.g., steroids), and individuals receiving concurrent psychological treatments, including psychotherapy. Patients who have been under antidepressant medication at a stable dose for at least 1 month are allowed to participate. Comorbidity with disorders not on the exclusion list does not lead to exclusion as long as anxiety, depression, or adjustment problems are of primary concern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Based on a power analysis with G*Power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] an optimal total sample size of 130 patients allows for the detection of a small effect (Cohen&#x02019;s f&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10) for the interaction between time (pre, post, follow-up) and treatment condition (TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT vs. TAU) (repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA), within-between-interaction; <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05; power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80; number of groups&#x02009;=&#x02009;2; number of measurements&#x02009;=&#x02009;3; pre-post correlation of pre-post values: <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6; non-sphericity correction&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). Multilevel models allow for assessment-by-assessment approaches: Assuming 130 patients and three assessments per patient (pre, post, follow-up), the resulting N would be 390. Further assuming a 20% dropout rate at follow-up, this sample would be reduced to 312. This would enable the detection of small effects of 3.4% explained variance in a regression model (linear multiple regression: random model; H1: &#x003c1;2&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0; &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05; power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80) with three predictors (treatment condition, time, and their interaction); and would still allow the identification of small effects of 5.1% explained variance in a model including additional covariates with a total of ten predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design and group allocation</title><p>This study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial with two active treatments: TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT and TAU. A 2 &#x000d7; 3 design is used with one between-subject factor (two treatment conditions) and one within-subject factor (time: pre, post, 12&#x000a0;month follow-up).</p><p>After completion of the baseline assessment and checking of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a randomization procedure with equal allocation of patients to each treatment condition is used. To ensure a balanced distribution of diagnostic groups in the two treatment arms, a stratified randomization is applied. The allocation lists are created by an independent researcher with a computerized random number generator and are unknown to the investigators.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Description of the interventions</title><p>The treatment conditions are Psychological Therapy as usual and Psychological Therapy with emotion-focused components. Each intervention consists of 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 sessions of 50&#x000a0;min each. Twenty-five sessions is the official standard for short-term therapies in the German health-care system. To standardize the duration to some extent serves to facilitate the comparison of therapies in the planned process analyses.</p><p>
<italic>Case formulation and Plan Analysis:</italic> Both treatments are based on Psychological Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], an integrative form of cognitive-behavioral therapy and are based on explicit individual case formulations. The case formulations include an analysis of the individual etiology for the development and maintenance of patient problems. A first overarching question is which factors lead to inconsistency (i.e., the tension resulting from discrepancies between needs and reality and from internal conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]). Inconsistency has been shown to be closely related to mental problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Second, patient strengths and resources are emphasized and used (e.g., abilities, preferences, favorable circumstances, etc.). The patient&#x02019;s ability to secure and enhance consistency and to solve problems is conceptualized in terms of Plan Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The case formulation also includes an analysis of problems and potentials for the therapeutic relationship.</p><p>Psychological therapy further makes reference to general change factors, and an explicit prescriptive concept for fostering the therapeutic relationship (Motive-Oriented Therapy Relationship as derived by the therapist from Plan Analysis). The main focus of Plan Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is the instrumentality of behavior and experience (what conscious or non-conscious purpose does an aspect of overt or covert behavior hypothetically serve?). From the patient&#x02019;s verbal and nonverbal behavior, the therapist infers underlying Plans of which many are non-conscious. For a specific patient, the therapist defines and implements a customized therapeutic relationship offer based on an individual Plan Analysis. Whereas the Motive-Oriented Therapy Relationship is a prescriptive approach, it is neutral in terms of therapy orientations. Its essence is to recognize, support and foster a patient&#x02019;s positive motives in an active way that is not contingent to the presenting problem behaviors. Whereas the therapeutic procedure is developed individually, it utilizes etiological models and therapeutic procedures as often described in manuals. Following the principles of General Psychotherapy, the choice of helpful concepts and interventions is generally free, but empirical evidence is a strong argument for the therapist to favor one over another. In principle, all change factors, clarification, resource activation, problem activation, and problem mastery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], are utilized, and the whole range of broad-spectrum behavior therapy interventions may be implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, it has been found in the past that working with emotions (instances of the change factors problem activation and clarification) has normally less weight in comparison to more cognitive/rational forms of clarification, skill building, or behavioral exercises. As explained above, this is closely related to lesser familiarity with and a greater insecurity in the implementation of interventions focusing on emotions.</p><p>
<italic>Treatment as usual with emotion-focused components</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] is based on Psychological Therapy, but emphasizes working with emotions, particularly the use of EFT models and techniques. This involves the practice of mainly four psychological skills: empathy, focusing, two-chair work and empty-chair work. These are conveyed in a special 8-day training and supported by supervisions (individually or in small groups of up to four supervisees) on average every 2 weeks, so that therapists feel comfortable using them. In addition every 3 months a supervision of the supervisors by expert EFT supervisors takes place. Manuals, which are relatively heuristic/flexible to allow for individualized procedures, accompany instructions for the interventions. All components of both interventions must be implemented according to the manual&#x02019;s specification. For detailed information on the content of EFT-components see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content of the emotion-focused components</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>EFT-Component</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Empathy</td><td>Empathy forms the basis of the therapeutic work in emotion-focused therapy as a technique and the fundament of the therapeutic relationship. Different forms of empathy play an important role in the shaping of the therapeutic relationship, affect regulation, deconstruction and the establishment of positive behavior towards the self.</td></tr><tr><td>Focusing</td><td>Focusing is a therapeutic technique to help expand the cognitive memories by the corresponding bodily reactions and thereby activate affective schemes usually arising in problematic situations. The goal is to look at current behavior in a larger context and recognize potential relationships to past experiences.</td></tr><tr><td>Two-chair work</td><td>The two-chair dialogue is used for confrontational processes e.g. self-evaluative splits, anxiety-splits and hopelessness splits where the patient operates alternating from both chairs. The main aim of two-chair work is an increase in self-compassion.</td></tr><tr><td>Empty-chair work</td><td>An indication for the empty-chair work is unfinished business with a significant other.

<italic>Treatment as usual:</italic> In an add-on design, it would be problematic to give special training and attention to therapists only in one condition, because it would be hard to retrospectively single out factors such as higher expectancy, additional investment of time, allegiance, etc. To ensure that effects are specifically attributable to the add-on condition, it is important to balance out the conditions by making an equivalent addition also to the TAU condition, while keeping these additions within the concepts that characterize TAU. Thus in the TAU condition, self-regulatory processes as conceptualized by Carver &#x00026; Scheier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and others receive particular attention as an equivalent addition. Self-regulatory processes are part of the consistency theory described by Grawe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are conceptually part of Psychological Therapy as usual. It has been found though, that therapists seldom exploit the concrete possibilities of utilizing the self-regulation perspective in practice. Therefore, concrete self-regulation based interventions including psychoeducation on self-regulation models have been described and conveyed in the training. The self-regulation perspective does not come along with specific interventions. However, the self-regulation perspective determines the planning of interventions in this condition, the way therapists are conveyed to their patients, and the choice of an attention focus.</p><p>In addition, therapists in this condition are advised to use strategies emphasizing emotions not more than considered necessary based on the individual case conceptualization. The first category in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, empathy, is considered to be part of TAU, although plausibly more typical and frequent in the TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT condition. Techniques most typical for EFT (categories 2&#x02013;4 in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are proscribed although in the improbable case that a therapist thinks, that an intervention typical for EFT is absolutely required for a particular patient, he or she can argue in favor of such an intervention vis a vis the supervisor who can approve it, if convinced that no non-EFT procedure would lead to similar effects.</p><p>The amount of training and supervision is equivalent in both conditions. Besides the basic model of self-regulation by Carver &#x00026; Scheier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] other concepts are part of this active control condition, e.g. practicing an inner monologue for the planning and regulation of behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and clarification which factors lead to maladaptive self-organization, in particular ego depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

The originality of this project lies in the examination of the consequences of integrating interventions of another promising evidence-based approach (EFT) into treatment as usual in a way that is directly mirroring common integrative practice. The use of an elaborated and intensively used psychotherapeutic model (TAU) speaks for a general effectiveness of both conditions. Emotion-Focused Therapy has acquired empirical validation for the treatment of depression, trauma and abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Clinically significant improvements with substantial effect sizes for both treatments in primary and secondary outcome measures are thus expected.</p><p>Other projects dealing with the integration of EFT elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] did not report great differences in effectiveness. Newman and colleagues for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] compared an integrative psychotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder that added EFT and interpersonal elements to a standardized CBT treatment with a treatment that added supportive listening to the same CBT component. The integrative therapy was equally effective post treatment and 2 years later, so that the authors concluded that the augmentation of CBT with emotion-focused and interpersonal techniques might not lead to better outcomes for generalized anxiety disorder patients. Similar results were found in an RCT on the treatment of patients with depression by Grosse Holtforth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], comparing Exposure-Based Cognitive Therapy (EBCT) with CBT. Component studies, which look at the effects of either adding particular techniques to a form of therapy (additive design) or taking them away (dismantling studies) rarely find that the presence or absence of specific techniques makes much difference to the overall outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In the history of psychotherapy, there are many examples of interventions that were less effective than expected, showed negative side effects, and worked in a different way than was believed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>Grawe criticized what he called &#x0201c;the myth of an outcome equivalence, an artifact created by research design&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. There have in fact been some deficiencies in studies on comparative therapies that exacerbate the finding of specific change factors, e.g. the uniformity myth, small sample sizes, insufficient control of group assignments, disregard of competences and experiences of the therapists, inconsistent assessments of therapy success, lack of recording complementary interventions, differences in frequencies and durations of therapies, exclusion of drop-outs and missing of follow-up measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. One point of criticism viewed alone results in considerable limitations on the validity of studies. In the summation of individual points of criticism doubt should arise on the general meaningfulness of the results.</p><p>From a General Psychotherapy perspective, newness is always part of a continuous development, of which the integration of a complementary concept with the potential of enriching an existing one can be an important step. This is a methodologically challenging endeavor, and this is a major reason why a relevant part of contemporary psychotherapy practice is not empirically examined. The application of pure approaches can be studied more easily, and consequently more evidence exists relating to such applications. The problem is that in clinical reality, a majority of practitioners do not apply pure approaches, partly because they question their relevance for routine practice. The endeavor of studying an integrative procedure corresponding to widespread practice requires not only an appropriate design but also a group of researchers possessing first-hand clinical knowledge in each of the conditions under investigation. Another requirement is motivated therapists being trained in practicing integrative therapy and at the same time, being able and willing to skillfully implement the procedures defined by the experimental the conditions. Finally, to render such a study realistic, an institution is highly desirable in which a practice similar to the one required by the study design is already well-established routine.</p><p>An obvious question is, of course, what will be different in the current study? This project is characterized by highly naturalistic conditions and thus it can be considered a major step towards closing the science-practitioner gap with respect to psychotherapy integration. On average, therapists will be more experienced and better trained than in previous studies. Certified EFT trainers including Dr. Greenberg have conducted the training. The supervisors have completed an advanced EFT training. Fostering external validity, therapies will be conducted in a regular treatment setting, and the inclusion of EFT will correspond more to regular practice. This will make a competent implementation easier and the procedures will be better integrated in an overarching model. It should be emphasized again that this is not a comparison of complete and pure EFT (which would require more extensive training) with treatment as usual. The spectrum of diagnoses will be larger, therapies will be somewhat longer, and the change processes will be studied extensively. Furthermore, the proposed study uses multilevel models to analyze treatment outcomes, hypothesized moderators and mediators, as well as therapist effects. While this approach is not yet common practice in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is very flexible, and exposes new perspectives on predictors of change at the within-person and the between-person level in the psychotherapeutic process.</p><p>A methodologically fundamental question is how therapist variance shall be controlled. It may seem like an ideal solution to let the same therapists conduct therapies in both conditions, and some studies actually use this strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, having the same therapists in both conditions does not necessarily ensure that their preferences, belief in the methods, fit of the personal profile with the method, competencies etc. are equal between the two conditions, but may vary between the two conditions within one and the same therapist. In addition, it has been argued plausibly that there may be considerable carry-over effects when using therapists in more than one condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Whereas both options seem viable, we decided in this trial to control at the level of relevant psychological variables. Therapist variables (e.g., therapist experience in the respective condition) will be assessed, and their impact on differential change in the outcome variables will be investigated and taken into account in the interpretation of potential differences between the groups. We will also be able to test for differential effects, e.g. whether good effects depend on therapist experience in one but not the other condition. Also higher order interactions can be studied, e.g. whether the readiness of a particular kind of patient to engage in particular interventions depends on the perceived therapist competence, etc.</p><p>To conclude, an essential contribution of this study will be to better understand how an existing and well-elaborated psychotherapy approach may be further enriched by the integration of new elements. In addition to studying the effectiveness of the two treatment protocols, the current study examines unique and joint factors which moderate and mediate treatment effects in TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EFT and TAU. Furthermore, predictor variables are not only assessed before and after treatment but also over the course of treatment through weekly process measures. This provides the opportunity to measure temporal precedence and to make inferences about causality. We hope that insights into which treatment works best for whom and how, will help improve the care for patients with depressive, anxiety and adjustment disorders. Furthermore, the results of this study promise to indicate whether an 8-day EFT-training plus supervision can enhance the effectiveness of treatment as usual. Such an add-on format, if shown effective, would represent a &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; alternative to the full EFT-training, which may be more realistic and attractive for many therapists and would therefore contribute to a deserved larger implementation of EFT concepts and interventions into psychotherapy. The procedures and training could also be modified to treat other conditions as well.</p><sec id="Sec32"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial start date: 2 February 2016.</p><p>Currently recruiting (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28, 13 November 2016).</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BAI</term><def><p>Beck anxiety inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI</term><def><p>Beck depression inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPSR-P/BPSR-T</term><def><p>Bern post-session report patient version/Therapist version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI</term><def><p>Brief symptom inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAMS</term><def><p>Classification of Affective Meaning States</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EFT</term><def><p>Emotion-focused therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EXP</term><def><p>Experiencing scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAMOS</term><def><p>Inventory of approach and avoidance motives</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAS</term><def><p>Goal attainment scaling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDRS</term><def><p>Hamilton depression rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICD</term><def><p>International classification for disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIP</term><def><p>Inventory of interpersonal problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INK</term><def><p>Incongruence questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PT</term><def><p>Psychological therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID</term><def><p>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCL-9</term><def><p>Symptom checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEK-27</term><def><p>Self-assessment of emotional competences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p>Short Form 12 of the Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SR</term><def><p>self-regulation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO-5</term><def><p>World Health Organization 5</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank profusely all therapists in training from the psychotherapy outpatient clinic of the University of Bern, who participate in the project.
