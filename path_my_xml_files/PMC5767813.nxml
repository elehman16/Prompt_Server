WHO estimated that in 2020, cardiovascular disease will cause 25 million deaths and in the elderly accounts for a fifth of disabilities.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In patients with higher stages of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common type of open-heart surgical interventions. Since 1980, the number of CABG surgeries has increased more than 5-fold, and in each year, almost steady rise has been observed in CABG surgeries.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>After CABG, iatrogenic injuries to the pleura and the harvesting of the left internal thoracic artery necessitate the placement of chest tubes. Hence, regularly after surgery, chest tubes are inserted to ensure effective drainage of fluid and air from the chest cavity and earlier detection of postoperative bleeding, prevent cardiac tamponade, and possibly to prevent the development of early postoperative pleural effusions after surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Depending on the method and criteria used for assessment, pericardial effusion is reported to be between 1% and 85%, after cardiac surgery, and delayed cardiac tamponade has been reported to be as high as 15%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Significant pericardial effusion and delayed cardiac tamponade are associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF), prolonged hospitalization and rehospitalization.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Conventionally, large semi-rigid chest tubes are used to prevent these complications. Chest tubes are potentially a source of pain and irritation for patients, that might cause hypoventilation, atelectasis, and increased the use of sedatives and analgesic agents.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>There are reports supporting that the use of smaller and softer silicone drains are as effective as larger drains after cardiac surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Jackson-Pratt drain (Ethicon, USA) is a soft silastic tube with four lateral channels, and a solid core center that is resistant to occlusion and by its small size and flexibility may result in less patient discomfort. One study shows that these drains are associated with a decreased incidence of pericardial effusion, tamponade, and postoperative AF and are more effective than conventional large drains.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Other studies reported that these drains are as effective as larger drains, or are less effective.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Now, few studies with conflict results have addressed the safety and efficacy of Jackson-Pratt drain after cardiac surgery. Hence, the present study was designed to assess the effective of Jackson-Pratt drain in compare with conventional chest drains after CABG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study was a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled, clinical trial, that conducted on 218 patients who have undergone CABG surgery in Chamran hospital affiliated to the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences from February to December 2016.

Despite, the presence of smaller incisions and minimally invasive approaches, use of large rigid chest tubes continues the chest drainage system has not changed for years. There is conflict in literatures results to support the benefits of the use of either silastic drain over the conventional chest tube. Our study illustrates that the patients in Jackson-Pratt drain group experienced significantly lower hospital and ICU LOS and higher pain intensity at first 2 h. There were no significant differences between the Jackson-Pratt drain and conventional chest tube in pleural effusion, tamponade, and pain intensity until discharge. However, the incidence of pleural effusion (2 [2%] vs. 7 [6.7%], respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.171) and tamponade (0 vs. 4 [3.8%], respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.048) in Jackson-Pratt drain were lower. Patients in Jackson-Pratt drain group had significantly lower percentages of AF in compare to patients in conventional chest tube group (2 [2%] vs. 10 [9.6%]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.021). Hence, lower hospital and ICU LOS, pleural effusion, tamponade, and AF show that Jackson-Pratt drain can be superior to the conventional chest tube after cardiac surgery.</p><p>Frankel <italic>et al</italic>., in a retrospective nonrandomized case&#x02013;control study reported that the LOS in ICU in patients from the silastic drain group was similar to conventional drain groups.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This is in conflict to our findings, that shows the significant different in ICU LOS between Jackson-Pratt drain and conventional drain, whereas, patients from the Jackson-Pratt drain had a shorter ICU LOS. Overall hospital LOS in our study like Frankel <italic>et al</italic>., study [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in patients in silastic drain group was significantly shorter when compared to patients from the conventional drain group. It is suggested that greater ease of ambulation with the silastic drain in the early postoperative period may prevent deconditioning and/or immobility related morbidity allowing for a more rapid discharge.</p><p>Use of chest tubes are associated discomfort and pain, and previous studies evaluated the pain intensity after the use of chest tubes after CABG in regard to drains type. In these studies, pain score in silastic drain compared with conventional large chest tubes and reported different results. In Frankel <italic>et al</italic>., study, at 1<sup>st</sup> day after surgery, pain score in silastic drain reported lower than the conventional drain but the difference had not been statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In Bjessmo <italic>et al</italic>. study, pain at removal the day after the surgery was reported to be similar among patients who received plastic or silastic drains.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moss <italic>et al</italic>. also found that pain score was not different between silastic and conventional drains.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Some other studies reported less pain with the smaller silastic drains in compare to conventional drains.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the present study, after 2 h, pain in Jackson-Pratt drain is significantly higher than conventional drain but after that during the presence of drains pain score was similar between two studied drains. The conventional chest tube, because of its large size and rigidity, restricts breathing and causes sufficient pain following surgery. On the other hand, the silastic drains create in more flexible with a smaller diameter drainage tube that cause to decreased risk of tissue injury and erode into adjacent structures or disrupt anastomosis associated with their use compared to the conventional chest tube. Similarity in pain score between groups in our study may be has been because of different in the doses of necessary analgesics in studied patients, whereas, this was not recorded.</p><p>In the present study, Jackson-Pratt drain was as effective as conventional chest tube in regard to the incidence of pleural effusion and tamponade, but AF in Jackson-Pratt drain was significantly lower than conventional chest tube. These finding is in agreement with previous results that often reported the same effects for silastic drains compare to conventional drains. Akowuah <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that flexible fluted silicone drains do not lead to an increase in pleural effusions and tamponade.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Roberts <italic>et al</italic>. reported high incidence of pleural effusions in both Blake drains and conventional drains, but they demonstrated no differences between the two groups for pleural effusions and tamponade.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Moss <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the incidence of significant effusion or tamponade was similar between the Blake group and the conventional group.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These findings are similar to our findings. But in Moss <italic>et al</italic>. study [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] AF reported to be similar between studied groups whereas, in our study frequency of AF in Jackson-Pratt drain was significantly lower than conventional group. The similarity between different types of drains in the incidence of pleural effusions may be explain by the fact that chest tubes are not the only cause of pleural effusions in patients after CABG.</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, surgeons and nurses who recorded outcomes were not blinded to the type of drain used. Second, doses of necessary analgesics in studied patients were not recorded, this may be affected the pain score reported by patients. Third, the generalizability of the findings is limited because data for this study were obtained from only one surgery center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The study results indicate that Jackson-Pratt drain is equally effective for preventing cardiac tamponade, pleural effusions and pain intensity in patients after CABG when compared with conventional chest tubes, but was significantly superior regarding efficacy to the hospital and ICU LOS and the incidence of AF.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work would not have been possible without the financial support of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Grant No. 394795).
