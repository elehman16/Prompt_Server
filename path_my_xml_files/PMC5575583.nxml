Introduction</title><p>Recent estimates from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that India has 69.2 million people with diabetes and this number is predicted to surpass 123.5 million by the year 2040 [<xref rid="B1-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This rapid escalation of diabetes prevalence in India has been attributed to several factors, including rapid urbanization, growth of the middle class, sedentary lifestyle, and diets rich in carbohydrates and calories but low in fiber. These unhealthy patterns in diet and lifestyle in India are influenced by social attitudes and cultural practices [<xref rid="B2-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Over the past 20 years, there has also been an emerging occurrence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents, which parallels the increasing prevalence of obesity in this age group [<xref rid="B5-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Chennai, Tamil Nadu, the prevalence of obesity among schoolchildren was found to be 21.4% in private schools (higher socioeconomic status) and 3.6% in government schools (lower socioeconomic status) [<xref rid="B6-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite India&#x02019;s large diabetes burden, over 50% of individuals with diabetes in this subcontinent are unaware of their condition [<xref rid="B7-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2001, Norris et al. [<xref rid="B8-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have shown that educating people at-risk for diabetes is an effective measure for preventing or managing the disease. The World Health Organization (2009) [<xref rid="B9-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] has also found such population-based interventions to be helpful, cost-effective strategies in preventing at least 80% of non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="B10-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Lifestyle interventions, which are shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in adults, have also been recommended for youth [<xref rid="B11-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To tackle childhood obesity and prevent diabetes, recent literature calls for comprehensive evidence-based strategies, which are both practical and cost-effective [<xref rid="B13-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, other studies emphasize the importance of culturally relevant and community-based programs, which directly engage participants in the intervention process [<xref rid="B14-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>This study was part of a large school-based program in Chennai, South India called Obesity Reduction and Awareness of Non-Communicable diseases through Group Education (ORANGE). In Phase I of the ORANGE study, 18,955 children and adolescents across 51 government and private schools in Chennai, and 1519 children and adolescents in Chennai colonies were screened for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Participants, teachers, and parents were also given a self-administered questionnaire to assess demographics, knowledge about NCDs, and lifestyle practices including diet and physical activity [<xref rid="B6-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B16-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The aim of Phase II of the ORANGE study was to implement a school-based co-curriculum intervention for diabetes awareness, preventative methods, and self-management in adolescents across select private and government schools in Chennai. This intervention strategy used a teacher-peer-training model in each school for long-term sustainability of the lessons learned from this program. During each intervention session, teachers led a classroom discussion on the health topic of interest, and peers facilitated small-group learning activities.</p><p>Most prior studies on diabetes education interventions were limited to analyzing changes in biochemical markers or anthropometric measurements, such as glucose tolerance, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). In addition to collecting these anthropometrical measurements, this study also analyzed and evaluated themes emerging from the participant&#x02019;s qualitative responses to the learning activities. The two-fold objective of this paper is (a) to describe the intervention activities and their outcomes qualitatively and (b) report changes in body mass index of the intervention group participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-children-04-00061"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-children-04-00061" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>ORANGE Phase II is a 1-year, school-based co-curriculum intervention for diabetes awareness, prevention and self-management in children and adolescents across Chennai. The program was implemented in seven private and three government schools across Chennai, purposively selected to represent different socioeconomic groups and geographic localities in Chennai. Students of middle to upper socioeconomic background tend to attend private schools, while those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds usually go to government schools. All sixth and seventh grade students attending these chosen schools were eligible to participate in the intervention program. During this period, pubertal and/or related behavioral changes can further result in a decline in physical activity and adoption of unhealthy dietary habits, which can be directly linked to type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B17-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, this age group was chosen to help the teenagers adopt healthy behavioral changes before their lifestyle habits were permanently established.</p><p>This study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF) with Registration No. ECR/194/Inst./TN/2013 and the trial is also registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) with ID number CTRI/2016/09/007323.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-children-04-00061"><title>2.2. Structure</title><p>The intervention was composed of five classroom activities, delivered at monthly intervals in each school. Each activity provided background information about a certain health topic of interest. The general goal of each activity was to sensitize participants to diabetes awareness and prevention. The activities were conceptualized, designed and developed into an activity manual by Health-Related Information Dissemination Amongst Youth (HRIDAY), New Delhi in partnership with Arogya World Inc., Chicago and Bengaluru and the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), Chennai. The medium of instruction used for delivering the intervention program was English and Tamil at private and government schools, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="children-04-00061-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Detailed activity descriptions have been provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-children-04-00061">Appendix A</xref>.</p><p>Teachers and peer leaders are an essential component to the structure of this intervention program. Teachers were the natural choice to lead each classroom activity, due to their role in influencing their students&#x02019; attitudes and behavior positively. One student from each class was also selected as a peer leader by the teacher coordinator, due to good leadership qualities and amiability among classmates. Peer leaders facilitated small group discussions, led activities, and acted as messengers between students and teachers. Training was held at the MDRF auditorium to train and prepare both teacher coordinators and peer leaders to lead the intervention activities. Teachers and peer leaders are important players in this program because they already maintain social or authoritative ties with the students. Moreover, in this age group hearing information from peers may be more effective than hearing it from adults [<xref rid="B18-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-children-04-00061"><title>2.3. Anthropometric Measures</title><p>Height was measured in centimeters using a stadiometer. Subjects were asked to stand upright without shoes with their back against the scale, heels together, and eyes directed forward. With the help of the headrest, height was measured to the nearest centimeter. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a standard weighing scale that was kept on a firm horizontal surface. The scale was checked every week, and calibration was done with known weight. The BMI was calculated using the formula of weight (kg)/height (m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-children-04-00061"><title>2.4. Data Analysis</title><p>The student responses to activity worksheets and pre-post BMI primarily served as the collected data for this intervention, and were analyzed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA). Participant characteristics including age, gender, school type (private or government), class (sixth or seventh grade), and intervention compliance were described overall and by school type and gender. Intervention compliance was defined as &#x02018;compliant&#x02019; (completed 4&#x02013;5 activities total) and &#x02018;non-compliant&#x02019; (completed &#x0003c;4 activities total). The pre- and post-intervention BMI of participants were also described overall and by school type, gender, and intervention compliance status. Numbers and percentages were tabulated for students completing each activity, different student responses, and correctness and categorization of responses. Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests and Chi-square test of proportions were performed to assess differences in responses and anthropometric measurements between government and private school students split by gender and age group as well pre-post intervention. Finally, emergent themes among student responses to intervention activities were identified by citing common responses to intervention activities, stratifying the responses by school type, and drawing thematic conclusions from the individual student responses and relevant published literature. No measurable data was collected or analyzed for Activities 2 and 4, which involved educational games that taught school children about diabetes and its prevention, rather than assessing their knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-children-04-00061"><title>3. Results</title><p>Overall, 2345 students were enrolled in the ORANGE Phase II intervention program. Out of the total student population, 2293 (97.8%) students participated in Activity 1, 2237 (95.4%) in Activity 2, 2043 (87.1%) in Activity 3, 2229 (95.1%) in Activity 4, and 2255 (96.2%) in Activity 5. We limited our final sample to 2276 students who attended both the pre- and post-intervention assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="children-04-00061-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Of these 2276 students, 95.8% completed 4&#x02013;5 intervention activities (defined as &#x0201c;compliant&#x0201d;), while 4.2% completed less than 4 activities (defined as &#x0201c;noncompliant&#x0201d;). Furthermore, a greater proportion of private school students (98%) as compared to government school students (88%) were compliant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="children-04-00061-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec id="sec3dot1-children-04-00061"><title>3.1.

There was a lower proportion of female participants (43.2%) overall, and this gender bias was larger in government schools. In both government and private schools, the mean age of the students was 11.1 years and there were roughly equal numbers of students from the sixth grade (50.9%) and the seventh grade (49.1%). These results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="children-04-00061-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-children-04-00061"><title>3.2. Pre- and Post- Intervention BMI</title><p>Overall, the mean post-intervention BMI of 18.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was greater than the mean pre-intervention BMI of 17.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), although both of these values are within the BMI cut-points for normal weight children in India (<xref ref-type="table" rid="children-04-00061-t002">Table 2</xref>). The mean BMI of study participants improved across school type (government: 0.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and private: 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase) and gender (boys and girls: 0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase) resulting in an increase in the number of students with normal weight. The percentage of overweight and obesity in adolescents was 16.2% and there was no significant change in the proportion of overweight and obesity in adolescents after intervention. Nearly 32% of the children were malnourished, which reduced to 25% post intervention (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). In government school students, the proportion was higher (56.5%) and decreased to 47.4% post intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-children-04-00061"><title>3.3. Activity Responses and Feedback from Peer Leaders and Teachers</title><sec id="sec3dot3dot1-children-04-00061"><title>3.3.1. Activity 1: Way to Health</title><p>In Activity 1, students were taught about the healthfulness of various lifestyle habits, and asked to identify habits from their life and from a picture that they perceived to be healthy and unhealthy.</p><p>Many private school students perceived eating at restaurants to be a healthy habit, while government school students considered respecting elders or studying to be habits contributing to good health rather than good behavior. Of all perceived unhealthy habits, a few were healthy habits (running, playing, or eating fruits) or those that can be categorized as good habits which do not necessarily contribute to reducing the risk of obesity and diabetes (cleaning, helping parents, etc.) Many students in government schools also identified at least one habit associated with being unhygienic or bad behavior as an unhealthy habit. These include &#x0201c;wearing untidy dress&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;hitting others&#x0201d;.</p><p>In both private and government schools, students were able to identify all five healthy habits better than the five unhealthy habits from the picture shown to them. However, a significantly higher percentage of students in private schools was able to correctly identify all five healthy habits (67.2%) and unhealthy habits (51.4%) as compared to students in government schools (54.7% and 32.9%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="children-04-00061-f003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>In private schools, the peer leaders for Activity 1 claimed the activity was &#x0201c;simple, useful, and enjoyable&#x0201d; and helped them to gain &#x0201c;knowledge about diabetes and obesity&#x0201d; while &#x0201c;identifying healthy and unhealthy habits&#x0201d;. Private school teachers suggested the &#x0201c;pictorial handouts helped to gain more awareness&#x0201d;.

They also enjoyed active participation in the game, as one peer leader claims, &#x0201c;Instead of talking hours of theory, this organization has represented [the information] in a way that makes us easy to understand&#x0201d;. Teachers also agree that &#x0201c;with [snakes and ladders as a] known game, [it] imparted the best knowledge about diabetes in a simple and enjoyable way&#x0201d;.

Activity 3: Pass It on-The Traffic Signal</title><p>Activity 3 required students to design and grade their own recipes using the traffic light colors: red (avoid completely or eat in very limited quantities), yellow (eat in moderation) or green (eat regularly). The selection of zones is based on the ingredients and method of cooking. In government and private schools, most students designed recipes they perceived to be green. Common green recipes that students designed included fruit salad and vegetable sandwiches. Yellow recipes that were popular among students included dosa, cheese sandwiches, and rice dishes such as lemon rice and tomato rice. The few red recipes that students designed included fried rice, biryani, and noodles.</p><p>When a dietician graded these recipes, there was no significant difference in the proportions of private and government school students (64% and 72%, respectively) who were correct in grading their recipe as green. An equal proportion of both government and private school students (36.4% and 37.2%, respectively) designed recipes they perceived to be yellow (<italic>p</italic> = 0.881). In private schools, only 54.2% of students creating yellow recipes were correct in their grading, while 94.2% were correct in government schools (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="children-04-00061-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Peer leaders for Activity 3 appreciated that &#x0201c;students were allowed to make their own recipe rather than being handed a healthy recipe.&#x0201d; They also said, &#x0201c;going through other recipes and helping them understand about eating healthy foods was good&#x0201d;.

Encouraging participants to adopt healthy lifestyle practices (dietary intakes, increasing physical activity, avoiding sedentary lifestyle and avoiding stress) has been the major recurring message across this five-part intervention.</p><p>Although adolescents may be reluctant to make changes related to healthy living [<xref rid="B20-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], timely social influences can positively affect their behavior [<xref rid="B19-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, peer leaders from each school were chosen to guide the program. Each lesson succeeded in engaging students themselves to express and analyze their own opinions and beliefs regarding healthy living, as evident in the high response rates and feedback from peer leaders and teachers. Overall, the findings from this study support such an intervention in empowering children and adolescents to reduce risk of diabetes through healthy living rather than medication or only weight loss.</p><p>Assessing themes that emerge from the participant responses is important, because this knowledge can be spread to their peers, family, and others in the community whereby relevant interventions can be created [<xref rid="B21-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several themes have emerged from the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="children-04-00061-t003">Table 3</xref>), which call for simple modifications to such programs in future.</p><p>The government school students had difficulty in distinguishing between non-communicable and infectious diseases. The underlying reason is that these students come from low-income families who may be unable to think beyond their immediate needs such as clean water and hygiene. Perhaps for such reasons, government school students struggled to comprehend the need to prevent non-communicable diseases like obesity and diabetes.</p><p>In private schools, there was misinterpretation of a costly activity or meal as a healthy habit. We believe that private school students mistakenly associate wealth with a healthy lifestyle, leading them to perceive certain unhealthy behaviors to be healthy. Private school students come from higher income families, who can afford to eat out at restaurants and have access to television sets, video games, and other activities associated with unhealthy eating and physical inactivity [<xref rid="B22-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>There was a general lack of awareness of physical activity and increased emphasis on dietary behaviors in both government and private school students. Specifically, children were unaware of how the built environment influences both their energy intake and expenditure. Certain barriers to exercise include inadequate places to exercise, or a desire to avoid pollution outdoors [<xref rid="B23-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Familial pressure to succeed in school may also cause children to spend more time studying, leading to more sedentary behavior [<xref rid="B24-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In India, urbanization and industrialization have upset the energy balance equation [<xref rid="B26-children-04-00061" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With increased mechanization, the individual workload has decreased, while sedentary activities and energy intake have increased. Lack of awareness of the importance of physical activity suggests that both government and private schools are in dire need of more awareness of the importance of increasing physical activity to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The issues demonstrated in these themes also present the necessity of modified intervention programs tailored for children and adolescents from different socioeconomic classes. An intervention restructured for government school students may aim to address diabetes prevention while acknowledging the basic, life-sustaining needs of lower-income students. On the other hand, an intervention designed for private school students should help students understand that spending extra money may not be always correlated with healthy living.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-children-04-00061"><title>4.1. Strengths</title><p>This study of a school-based co-curriculum diabetes education intervention, was guided by the social-cognitive theory, which takes advantage of adolescence and puberty as a critical development period. Most previous school-based health education interventions in India have only assessed weight-related outcomes or type 2 diabetes risk factors. The main strength of our study is the large sample size and delivery of the program through teachers and peer leaders in a group setting. This approach can help in the scaling up and sustainability of such intervention programs. Finally, the reduction in the number of participants who were malnourished post-intervention, more so in government schools, is an encouraging sign.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-children-04-00061"><title>4.2. Limitations</title><p>Although we assessed BMI both pre- and post-intervention, it is difficult to utilize BMI as a marker for intervention success, as there are many confounding factors including age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the intervention was carried out over a 1-year time span during which time the child would grow rapidly both in height and weight due to pubertal changes and thus the BMI would change. The changes in height and weight are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="children-04-00061-t004">Table B1</xref> as part of <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-children-04-00061">Appendix B</xref>. BMI did increase post-intervention (especially in government schools). These changes could be attributed to changes in lifestyle parameters such as physical activity and dietary pattern of adolescents post-intervention. Unfortunately, we do not have much data on physical activity and diet patterns before the intervention to support this conclusion. This is a limitation of the study.</p><p>Another limitation is due to resource constraints. At times, instead of the school staff trained on the program delivering the intervention the study, team staff would need to help in completing the activities. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-children-04-00061"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that while planning prevention programs for non-communicable diseases at the school level, there is no &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; intervention that can be applied to schools across different socioeconomic groups. This school-based co-curriculum program was effective in educating adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications to prevent diabetes and improve overall health status. However, the themes that have emerged from this qualitative study also indicate the need to adapt the intervention to different types of school settings across India and other developing countries.</p><sec><title>Key Messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A school-based co-curriculum program for educating adolescents about healthy lifestyle modifications to prevent diabetes and improve overall health status was well-received in a sample of government and private schools in Chennai, India.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study found divergences in comprehension of the diabetes education program between students from government (low socio-economic status (SES)) and private (high SES) schools.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intervention strategies must be adapted to the culture and socioeconomic status of students from different school settings.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the field team of MDRF who carried out the pre- and post-assessments at every school.

Activity 1</title><p>The objective of the first activity, <italic>Way to Health</italic>, was to educate students about various healthy and unhealthy lifestyle practices, and to help students classify the healthfulness of their own lifestyle practices. The major theme from this lesson was that healthy living can help one &#x0201c;look healthy, feel good, and be happy&#x0201d;. Following the lesson and classroom discussion about healthy living, students were given a worksheet depicting numerous scenes portraying healthy and unhealthy habits. Students were instructed to identify five healthy habits and five unhealthy habits from the picture. The scenes were culturally relevant to the Indian lifestyle, as they depicted people eating typical Indian fast foods like pav-bhaji and chaatitems, drinking tender coconut water, and practicing yoga. Then, students were asked to identify three healthy and three unhealthy habits from their own lives. Student responses were checked for correctness and analyzed for pertinent themes.</p></sec><sec id="secAdot2-children-04-00061"><title>Appendix A.2. Activity 2</title><p>The second activity, <italic>Climbing the Health Ladder</italic>, introduces students to diabetes, risk factors, warning signs, and strategies to prevent or control the disorder. Following this lesson and classroom discussion, students were divided into small groups to play &#x02018;snakes and ladders,&#x02019; a popular Indian game among children. In this game, snakes were labeled with risk factors while ladders were healthy lifestyle habits. All the students were given game sets to play with their families at home. No data were taken from this worksheet for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="secAdot3-children-04-00061"><title>Appendix A.3. Activity 3</title><p>The third activity, <italic>Pass it On-The Traffic Signal</italic>, educates students about healthy nutrition and balanced diets. They learn about food groups, serving sizes, empty calories, importance of breakfast, and methods of cooking. A three-zone food categorization was also introduced, with red (avoid completely or eat in very limited quantities), yellow (eat in moderation), and green (eat regularly) foods. The worksheet for this activity required students to design their own recipe, identify ingredients and method of cooking, and rate their recipe as red, yellow, or green. A major learning outcome from this activity is an understanding of how different cooking methods and selection of ingredients can affect the healthfulness of a meal.</p></sec><sec id="secAdot4-children-04-00061"><title>Appendix A.4. Activity 4</title><p><italic>Jump Forward and Race with Pace</italic>, the fourth intervention activity, emphasizes the importance of physical activity in providing health benefits and reducing the risk of disease. The lesson introduces minimum physical activity levels for individuals of different age groups, and easy ways to incorporate physical activity into daily life. Obesity and its risk factors, complications, and preventative measures are also explained, along with information about BMI. Instead of a worksheet for this activity, students compete in a racing game with and without their backpacks. The learning outcome from this activity is for students to understand they can run faster and prevent diabetes when they do not have excess weight. A brief discussion ensued on the groups&#x02019; experience after undertaking the activity. Certificates were issued to the top three winners of the race. No objective data was needed from this activity for analysis, as the learning objective was self-evident once they completed the task.</p></sec><sec id="secAdot5-children-04-00061"><title>Appendix A.5. Activity 5</title><p>The final activity, <italic>Doctor Says</italic> &#x0201c;<italic>Be Fit, Eat Right</italic>&#x0201d; is a case study about an 11-year-old boy named Sachin and his lifestyle habits. Students were asked to identify healthy (green), moderately healthy (yellow), and unhealthy (red) habits from Sachin&#x02019;s life, and then provide suggestions for small lifestyle modifications. The puzzle accompanying the case study reads, &#x0201c;Be Fit, Eat Right, Give Diabetes a Tough Fight&#x0201d;. The learning objective of this final activity is to recognize the importance of small lifestyle modifications to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></app><app id="app2-children-04-00061"><title>Appendix B</title><table-wrap id="children-04-00061-t004" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">children-04-00061-t004_Table A1</object-id><label>Table A1</label><caption><p>Anthropometric measures of ORANGE study participants pre- and post-intervention, overall and by gender (<italic>n</italic> = 2276).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
