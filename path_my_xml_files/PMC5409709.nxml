Colostrum bovinum is a natural supplement with a wide range of supposed positive health effects, including reduction of intestine permeability. We assessed influence of colostrum supplementation on intestinal permeability related parameters in a group of 16 athletes during peak training for competition. This double-blind placebo-controlled study compared supplementation for 20 days with 500 mg of colostrum bovinum or placebo (whey). Gut permeability status was assayed by differential absorption of lactulose and mannitol (L/M test) and stool zonulin concentration. Baseline L/M tests found that six of the participants (75%) in the colostrum group had increased intestinal permeability. After supplementation, the test values were within the normal range and were significantly lower than at baseline. The colostrum group &#x00394; values produced by comparing the post-intervention and baseline results were also significantly lower than the placebo group &#x00394; values. The differences in stool zonulin concentration were smaller than those in the L/M test, but were significant when the &#x00394; values due to intervention were compared between the colostrum group and the placebo group. Colostrum bovinum supplementation was safe and effective in decreasing of intestinal permeability in this series of athletes at increased risk of its elevation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intestinal permeability</kwd><kwd>stool zonulin concentration</kwd><kwd>colostrum supplementation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-09-00370"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Recognition of the influence of gut status on a variety of body functions has spurred investigation of the role of intestinal homeostasis [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The effect of the gut physiology on the immune system is recognized [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This may help explain intestinal involvement in generation of allergies and, more recently, auto-aggressive immune responses [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the influence of intestinal malfunction on the immune system dysregulation [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the most compelling of which point to involvement of intestinal permeability status [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The relationship of zonulin, which is a physiological permeability regulator, and the development of celiac disease described by Fasano et al. was the first established pathogenetic axis for an autoimmune disease [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This discovery encouraged additional research, demonstrating that reported increased gut permeability may favor development of type 1 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto&#x02019;s thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, and connective tissue autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other pathologies, including a variety of hypersensitivity disorders, may develop in association with increased gut permeability, but the current supporting evidence is weak. Nevertheless, the currently available evidence indicates that increased permeability of the intestinal barrier is potentially harmful to health.</p><p>Two approaches to maintaining intestinal barrier permeability within physiological limits are available. One very effective, though impractical, approach relies on avoiding factors like gluten, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and intense physical activity that may damage the structure of the barrier or excessively upregulate permeability [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another approach is to restore and maintain physiological permeability by dietary or pharmacological intervention. Blocking the zonulin receptor has been investigated by Fasano [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and that method seems promising in cases of increased permeability developing because of pathologically upregulated zonulin [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other approaches utilizing glutamine and probiotic supplementation have also been studied [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is very likely, however, that zonulin-independent causes of permeability increase are also involved in human pathology, such as inflammatory damage to the gut epithelial structure [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This will require other approaches to restore the integrity of the intestinal barrier.</p><p>Colostrum bovinum has been reported to positively influence gut status in both human and animal studies [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Well-established causes of these effects include participation in restoring the composition of the intestinal microbiome and support of the healing of damaged mucosa [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has also been suggested that colostrum may support the reduction of hypersensitivity associated with allergies and autoimmunity [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These latter claims, although mostly unsubstantiated, generally point to health improvements related to gut changes associated with colostrum supplementation.</p><p>We hypothesized that hypersensitivity-related health problems can be alleviated by colostrum supplementation and that this effect might be attributed to normalization (decrease) of intestinal permeability. To test this, we investigated the changes in gut permeability in response to colostrum bovinum in a group of actively training athletes. We chose athletes because they are known to have increased intestinal permeability [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which is also in line with our previous unpublished results. We tested gut permeability before and after a relatively brief 20-day supplementation with a typical twice daily dose of 500 mg colostrum bovinum.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.

Recruitment</title><p>A group of 16 healthy male volunteers between 20 and 43 years of age (median = 26 years, mean = 27.5 years) was recruited randomly from 40 professional mixed martial arts fighters in active training during the middle of the competitive season. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The participants were free of any symptomatic acute disease and were physically fit to participate in extensive athletic training. On inclusion, all participants received a physical examination that included measurement of lean body mass (LBM), total body water (TBW), and peripheral body fat (PBF). The characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-09-00370-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.2. Double-Blind Study</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-nutrients-09-00370" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.2.1. Blinding and Initial Assessment of Participants</title><p>On trial inclusion (day 0), the 16 participants were randomly allocated by a table of random numbers to two equal groups to receive placebo or colostrum. The administrator did not participate in the participants&#x02019; assessment or laboratory testing, and the investigators were blinded to the group allocation. Participants were tested (stool and urine collection) on day 0 for baseline intestinal permeability by a differential sugar absorption test and assay of stool zonulin concentration. A self-reporting questionnaire was administered on day 0 to inquire about participant health, lifestyle, food habits, and athletic activity. The participants also responded to questions about digestive tract discomfort or symptoms, the character and the frequency of stools and recent use of medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.2.2. Supplementation: Days 1&#x02013;20</title><p>Freeze-dried whole bovine colostrum obtained within 2 h of calf delivery (Genactiv Sp. z o.o., Pozna&#x00144;, Poland) was packaged in unlabeled pouches (500 mg colostrum bovinum and 500 mg desiccated banana). The dose of 500 mg of colostrum powder is within the range of a typical single supplementation dose suggested by various suppliers. Identical pouches (500 mg of dehydrated whey and 500 mg of desiccated banana) were used as the placebo. The difference between colostrum and whey used in the trial was in expected biological activity of bioactive components contained in them. While roughly 250 various bioactive components (mostly proteins) present in colostrum were preserved and undamaged by heat in the freeze-drying process where temperatures reach no more than 40 &#x000b0;C, the whey, which is several folds less biologically active, was spray-dried, with temperatures reaching 160 &#x000b0;C. The latter process is expected to damage function of most of the originally bioactive proteins.</p><p>The trial administrator distributed packages of 40 colostrum or placebo pouches to participants in the intervention and control groups. The participants were asked to start using the provided test substances on day 1 of the trial. The schedule was one pouch orally in the morning and one in the evening; both doses were taken 30 min before a meal. Supplementation was scheduled to last for 20 days. During the supplementation period, the participants were asked to record self-observations and take note of unusual or adverse reactions, if any occurred. The original questionnaire was provided for that purpose, and was intended to attract participant attention to digestive tract symptoms and their general health status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot3-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.2.3. Final Assessment: Day 22</title><p>On day 22, the participants were tested for differential sugar absorption, and assayed with respect to urine samples and stool zonulin concentration (ng/mL). The questionnaires, including the participant reports of events from the previous 22 days, were included in the final assessment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.3. Open-Label Study</title><p>Because the availability of participants was limited by their training and competition schedules, an adequate washout period could not be achieved for a blinded crossover study. Instead, we decided to perform an open-label phase of the trial only for the participants originally receiving the placebo. One participant dropped out from the original placebo group before the crossover phase because of a conflict with the competition schedule. The remaining seven placebo participants were given colostrum supplementation for 20 days starting on day 23 and tested for intestinal permeability and stool zonulin concentration on day 44. The results were compared with those previously obtained from the same patients during their participation in the placebo group of the double blind phase.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.4. Differential Sugar (Lactulose/Mannitol) Absorption Test</title><sec id="sec2dot4dot1-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.4.1. The Test Principle</title><p>The test depends on the difference in pathways of gut absorption utilized for lactulose and mannitol [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. If intercellular tight junctions are damaged or relaxed, urinary excretion of lactulose, which is absorbed primarily through a paracellular pathway, increases relative to mannitol, which is transcellularly absorbed. The differential sugar absorption test can be regarded as a direct marker of intestinal permeability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4dot2-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.4.2. Sugar Ingestion and Urine Collection</title><p>The test began in the morning following an 8-h fast. Each participant emptied their bladder, collected 100 mL of urine as a blank (negative control) sample, and subsequently drank 500 mL of water solution containing 7.5 g lactulose and 2 g mannitol. For the next 6 hours, participants were allowed to eat, except for specified foods (milk and dairy products, simple sugars, large doses of vitamin C and mannitol), and were asked to collect all urine passed into one container. Finally, 400-&#x003bc;L aliquots of urine from the collection container and from the blank sample were assayed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4dot3-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.4.3. Sugar Derivatization</title><p>The 400-&#x003bc;L urine aliquots were mixed with 40 &#x003bc;L of an internal standard (myo-inositol, 20 mg/mL) and evaporated to dryness by lyophilization. Then 200 &#x003bc;L of anhydrous pyridine in hydroxylamine (25 mg/mL) was added, mixed, and heated to 70 &#x000b0;C for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged at 800 &#x000d7; g for 5 min and 200 &#x003bc;L of supernatant was collected. Sugars were silylated with 100 &#x000b5;L of <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilylimidazole for 30 min at 70 &#x000b0;C and assayed by gas chromatography.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4dot4-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.4.4.

Chromatographic conditions included an initial temperature of 220 &#x000b0;C for 5 min, increased at a rate of 10 &#x000b0;C/min for 2 min, 5 &#x000b0;C/min for 4 min, and 3.5 &#x000b0;C/min for 4 min to a final temperature of 274 &#x000b0;C, which was maintained for 7 min. The total time was approximately 22 min, and hydrogen was the carrier gas. Lactulose, mannitol, and myo-inositol were identified by comparing their retention times with those of commercially available standards.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nutrients-09-00370"><title>2.5. Stool Zonulin Assay</title><p>The concentration of zonulin in stool was determined with a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Stool samples were collected 1 day before the mannitol/lactulose test. Assay plate wells were coated with polyclonal anti-zonulin antibody; zonulin in the samples was conjugated to biotinylated zonulin tracer and then immobilized on the plate.

The unpaired t-test was used to compare values of independent variables. For variables with distributions not normally distributed, the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test were used for paired and unpaired comparisons, respectively.

Results</title><p>The interview and questionnaire data revealed that none of the participants in the colostrum group reported any important treatment-associated digestive system side effects. Four participants in the placebo group (50%) reported adverse digestive symptoms (loose stools, bloating, nausea and/or lack of appetite) but the difference in relation to the colostrum group did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08). Both the colostrum and placebo group participants reported their general shape to be good/very good and remaining either the same as it was before the trial or improved after supplementation. Two participants receiving colostrum (25%) and five in the placebo group (62.5%) experienced upper respiratory tract infections during the supplementation period of the double-blind phase of the trial. The difference between groups was non-significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31).</p><p>There were no significant correlations of laboratory test results and participant history data (including dietary and health-related variables) collected by the direct interviews or questionnaires. This was probably because of the small number of participants.

Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, our trial was the first to demonstrate that supplementation with bovine colostrum decreased and mostly restored to normal values two parameters, reflecting intestinal permeability: the lactulose/mannitol ratio in urine and zonulin concentration in stool. Previous human studies demonstrated the beneficial influence of preventive colostrum supplementation on permeability increase due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin treatment or heavy exercise in athletes [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These studies utilized differential sugar absorption test but not zonulin concentration test The rodent studies demonstrated the importance of colostrum as preventive supplement decreasing the direct intestinal mucosa damage resulting from NSAID treatment [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The L/M test directly reflects, while the stool zonulin concentration test indirectly reflects intestinal permeability. Despite the limited number of study participants [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the double-blind study produced statistically significant results in both tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The results of the open-label part of the study confirmed those obtained in the double-blind part, but may be subject to bias because of the participants&#x02019; expectations of a positive effect of supplement administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The results of the differential sugar absorption test, which by its nature more directly reflects the status of intestinal permeability than stool zonulin concentration, were especially interesting. In the double-blind phase of the trial, these results were statistically significant for both the difference before and after colostrum supplementation and for comparison of the change due to intervention (&#x00394;) between the placebo and colostrum groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f001">Figure 1</xref>). All the post-colostrum supplementation results fell within the normal L/M test range even though 75% of the pre-intervention results were above the reference range and some were at double the upper limit of normal (data not shown).</p><p>The results of the stool zonulin concentration test in the double-blind phase of the trial were statistically significant only when the changes due to intervention (&#x00394;) within the placebo and colostrum groups were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In this phase of the trial, the stool zonulin concentration of all but one participant (12.5%) decreased after receiving colostrum, but was restored to the normal range in only three participants (37.5%).</p><p>One of our study goals was designed to determine whether the reported beneficial effect of colostrum on the gut health can be attributed to downregulation of zonulin concentration leading to decreased permeability [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is difficult to draw conclusions on this effect of colostrum on gut permeability based only on our results. Nevertheless, the differential sugar absorption results clearly showed a permeability decrease in response to colostrum supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f001">Figure 1</xref>) that was much more evident than that reflected by the change in stool zonulin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Change in sugar absorption seems to be independent to some extent of zonulin downregulation. In four double-blind study participants in the group receiving colostrum (50%), the zonulin level remained above 40 ng/mL, which was above the predetermined upper reference limit of 30 ng/mL. In those participants, the L/M ratio dropped to below 0.01, which was below the predetermined upper reference limit of 0.035. In the double-blind study, the change in L/M ratio after colostrum supplementation reached a higher level of statistical significance than the change in zonulin concentration.</p><p>The difference in colostrum post- versus pre-supplementation (&#x00394;) zonulin concentration was significantly larger in the open-label than in the double-blind comparison, whereas no comparable effect was observed for intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00370-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that psychological influence may have influenced zonulin release in the gut. Testing this effect will require further study.</p><p>The questionnaire obtained data regarding potential side effects and other health related events were not significantly different between the groups. Moreover, all these events (digestive tract symptoms and upper respiratory tract infections) were found to be reported in similar frequency and variety by the same participants also before the trial has begun. This suggests these events being unrelated to the trial intervention.</p><p>There are currently no objective laboratory tests demonstrating colostrum supplementation effect. In this trial, the L/M ratio in urine decreased in all participants with colostrum supplementation. This suggests that a decrease in L/M ratio might be regarded as the first available measure of colostrum supplementation.</p><p>In conclusion, our trial demonstrated that colostrum supplementation decreased previously elevated intestinal permeability and was able to restore it to a predetermined normal limit within less than 3 weeks of relatively mild supplementation. Colostrum supplementation also decreased zonulin concentration in the gut, but to a lesser degree than its influence on permeability. It is difficult to draw a conclusion regarding the mechanism leading to decreased permeability. It is possible that in addition to partial influence of decreased zonulin concentration; the normalization of permeability might also result from the powerful healing potential exerted on the intestinal mucosa by colostrum, as was observed in previous studies [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With regard to the reported prebiotic potential of some of the colostrum components (e.g., bifidogenic effect of lactoferrin) [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it is also possible that improvement of physiological flora of the gut may have influenced the observed effect on the intestinal permeability in our trial as it was reported in the past by other authors [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Our study provides evidence which suggests that plain bovine colostrum, which is a natural and relatively inexpensive supplement, can be responsible for the effective reversal of inappropriately increased intestinal permeability. The use of it might benefit many patients, in whom increased intestinal permeability would ultimately result in various pathologies [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Bovine colostrum might also have a preventive role in healthy people and help to restore gut status after use of antibiotics or NSAIDs, both of which can increase intestinal permeability. Among those who may benefit the most from colostrum supplementation are athletes, who not only present tendency to have increased intestinal permeability, but have also been discovered to have increased risk of developing some of the hypersensitivity-based diseases, including allergies [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-09-00370" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The experiment has been fully funded by the Pomeranian Medical University, including covering of the costs to publish in open access.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Maciej Ha&#x00142;asa, Ewa Stachowska and Magdalena Ba&#x0015b;kiewicz-Ha&#x00142;asa conceived and designed the experiments; Dominika Maciejewska, Ewa Stachowska and Maciej Ha&#x00142;asa performed the experiments; Krzysztof Safranow, Maciej Ha&#x00142;asa and Magdalena Ba&#x0015b;kiewicz-Ha&#x00142;asa analyzed the data; Bogus&#x00142;aw Machali&#x00144;ski, Ewa Stachowska and Dominika Maciejewska contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools; Maciej Ha&#x00142;asa and Magdalena Ba&#x0015b;kiewicz-Ha&#x00142;asa wrote the paper.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.
