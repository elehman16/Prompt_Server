surface training on the static and dynamic balance of stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] The study enrolled 20 stroke patients and randomly assigned them to visual
feedback training and unstable surface training groups. Both groups performed 30 minutes
of conventional exercise therapy twice a week for 4 weeks. In addition, the subjects in
the visual feedback training group completed a visual feedback training regimen and the
subjects in the unstable surface training group completed training on an unstable surface
(30-minute session three times a week for 4 weeks in both groups). Static and dynamic
balance parameters were recorded immediately before and after the 4 weeks of training. For
data analysis, the paired and independent t-test was used to compare the two groups.
[Results] In the visual feedback training group, the sway line at the postural sway of the
center of pressure and trace length decreased significantly after training. In both
groups, the sway range at the limits of stability in the anteroposterior and mediolateral
directions increased significantly after training. [Conclusion] Visual feedback training
was better at improving static and dynamic balance than unstable surface training in
stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Unstable surface training</kwd><kwd>Visual feedback training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During the 12-month period after discharge from hospital, 55% of stroke patients experience
a fall, which is a higher rate than that reported in healthy older individuals (52%).
Moreover, 42% of stroke patients experience repeated falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, indicating that this population is at a higher risk of falls
relative to healthy older individuals. Stroke patients show obvious gait changes, such as
short stride length, slow gait velocity, and they lack strength and control of static and
dynamic balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the ability to
balance decreases with age, preventive exercises are needed to reduce the rate of falls
among stroke patients.</p><p>To improve disordered postural reactions and standing postural reactions, studies have
suggested training methods using visual, auditory, and tactile feedback to achieve
symmetrical load bearing<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various
exercises involving dynamic rhythm or mechanical devices have also been suggested<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Decreasing asymmetric postural alignment
and strengthening dynamic stability, in stroke patients are important therapeutic
targets<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural symmetry and dynamic
stability can be improved by feedback training using a force plate, and visual feedback on
body weight distribution has been reported to be effective at increasing the symmetry of the
standing posture in stroke patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have attempted to identify
rehabilitation exercises for stroke patients and develop evaluation methods using balance
instruments. However, few studies have compared the effects of different types of exercise.
Therefore, this study compared the effects of visual feedback training (VFT) and unstable
surface training (UST) on the static and dynamic balance ability of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>We recruited 20 patients diagnosed with stroke, asked to participate in this study by their
physicians, at G University Hospital and G Rehabilitation Hospital (both Incheon, South
Korea). After the subjects gave informed consent, they were randomly divided into two groups
using table of random numbers: a VFT group (four men, six women; age, 54.30 &#x000b1; 7.94&#x02005;years;
height, 159.00 &#x000b1; 7.34&#x02005;cm; weight, 58.20 &#x000b1; 5.24&#x02005;kg; time since stroke, 14.20 &#x000b1; 5.12 months;
affected side, right 6, left 4) and a UST group (three men, seven women; age, 54.80 &#x000b1;
13.02&#x02005;years; height, 161.30 &#x000b1; 4.99&#x02005;cm, weight 58.80 &#x000b1; 8.40&#x02005;kg; time since stroke, 15.00 &#x000b1;
13.02 month; affected side, right 5, left 5). The inclusion criteria included occurring
stroke more than 6 month, being able to walk at least 10&#x02005;m with cane or walker, and more
than 24 point of Mini-Mental State Examination. The Balance Trainer-4 (BT-4; HUR, Kokkola,
Finland) balance assessment device was used to evaluate static and dynamic balance before
and after training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This device has a
100-Hz sampling rate and measuring sensors at each corner of its square platform. The
position of the foot was marked on the square platform to assist the subject and the four
sensors determined the subject&#x02019;s center of pressure. Balance ability, based on
time-dependent postural sway, was measured using Smart-suit Balance software (ver. 1.4; HUR,
Kokkola, Finland). Both groups performed conventional exercise therapy for 30 minutes twice
a week for 4 weeks. The conventional exercise therapy was designed to correct abnormal
posture and movements, and to promote normal exercise patterns to perform various functions
and included joint-movement, stretching, and muscle-strengthening exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to this, the VFT group
completed a VFT regimen, while the UST group completed a UST regimen. The VFT was done using
the BT-4, which includes the Chase, Tennis, and Static Pattern built-in balance-training
programs. The patients spent 10 minutes playing each game, giving a 30-minute training
session that was done three times a week for 4 weeks. UST, which used a balance pad (Airex,
Altenrhein, Switzerland) to provide an unstable surface, was also done for 30 minutes a day,
three times a week for 4 weeks. All exercises were administered by a physiotherapist with
more than 3&#x02005;years&#x02019; worth of treatment experience. The statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS for Windows software (ver. 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The paired t-test
was used to compare the results before and after training in each group. The independent
t-test was used to compare results between the two groups. The level of statistical
significance level (&#x003b1;) was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the VFT group, the sway line at the postural sway of the center of pressure and the

balance than UST. Few studies have compared the effect of VFT with other forms of exercise.
One study reported that a virtual reality task using visual feedback exercises improved
static balance, while there was no difference between visual feedback and unstable surface
exercise groups<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. By contrast, we found
that VFT enhanced static balance more than UST. The training might have been more effective
in our study because the time since stroke of subjects in our study were less 10 months than
subjects in previous study. Furthermore, enhanced dynamic balance was seen in our study.
Cheng et al. showed that rhythmic postural change training using visual feedback improved
the dynamic balance of patients with hemiplegia; furthermore, the effect of the training
persisted for 6 months, and the patients had a reduced risk of falls<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study on weight distribution across both legs during
standing, Sackley et al. found that patients with stroke showed recovery of dynamic balance
due to an increase in dynamic movement, in turn due to a shift of body weight to the
affected side<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Limitation of this study
was short-term exercise. Future researchers should examine effect of the long-tern exercise.
VFT might be effective for preventing falls in patients with stroke because this training
improves dynamic and static balance to a greater extent than UST.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ashburn</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyndman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Predicting people with stroke at risk of
