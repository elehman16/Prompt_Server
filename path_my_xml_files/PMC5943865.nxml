Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most effective means in the treatment of ACS in the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> In recent years, with the development of clinical diagnosis and interventional therapy, the dose of contrast agent in PCI is increasing, and PCI can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Therefore, CIN has become a common complication of PCI, and has become the third leading cause of acute renal failure in hospital.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The diagnostic criteria of CIN was that the absolute value of serum creatinine (Scr) in 48 to 72&#x0200a;hours after the injection of contrast agent was increased by &#x0003e;44.2&#x0200a;mmol/L or above the base value of 25%, and was not associated with other renal damage.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> In addition to hydration, there is still no effective prophylactic regimen available to prevent occurrence of CIN recently.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is urgent to explore new methods to reduce the incidence of CIN. At present, most of the research evidence show that CIN is the result of renal hypoxia injury and the direct cytotoxicity of contrast agents to the kidney.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Renal ischemia and reperfusion injury play a key role in the occurrence of CIN.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> So prevention of renal ischemia reperfusion injury may be an effective measure to prevent CIN. Ischemic preconditioning is a kind of measure that can effectively protect the ischemic reperfusion injury. Przyklenk et al, on the basis of ischemic preconditioning, first proposed the concept of remote ischemic preconditioning (remote ischemic preconditioning, RIPC) in 1993.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> It can reduce the ischemia and reperfusion injury of target organs by stimulating endogenous protection, This method was less invasive and stronger feasibility than in situ ischemic preconditioning. It has a good application prospect. Therefore, it is particularly important to find ways to prevent CIN after PCI in patients with ACS. At present, the reports showed that RIPC can reduce myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in the field of animal experimental research. However, there is a lack of large-scale clinical studies in RIPC, and there are different opinions on prevention of CIN. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of RIPC on prevention of CIN after PCI and its impact on major adverse events in patients with ACS, to provide new measure for the prevention of CIN.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This study was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study. A total of 161 patients with ACS undergoing PCI from March 2014 to March 2016 in Tai&#x02019;an Central Hospital were collected and randomly divided into RIPC group (72 cases) and control group (89 cases). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tai&#x02019;an Central Hospital. Signed written informed consents were obtained from all participants before the study. Of these, 54 patients were excluded because they did not undergo PCI. There were 6 cases in RIPC group and 4 cases in control group did not undergo PCI, as coronary angiography showed severe lesions in 3 coronary arteries. Sixteen cases in RIPC group and 28 cases in control group did not undergo PCI, owing to coronary artery stenosis &#x0003c;75%.

Two groups were treated with antiplatelet agents, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, &#x003b2;-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and nitrates and other conventional treatment. According to the 2006 International CIN expert consensus recommended,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> standard hydration was used as preventive treatment to all patients before and after PCI. As a standardized treatment, all patients received 0.9% normal saline intravenously 6 hours before the coronary angiography and 12 hours after the operation. Special patients were adjusted according to the cardiac function and urine volume. Diabetes patients before 48&#x0200a;hours of the operation change metformin to insulin therapy. The RIPC group received remote ischemic preconditioning at 1&#x0200a;hour before PCI; the specific method was 5-minute inflations of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mmHg around the upper arm, followed by 5-minute intervals of reperfusion by 4 times.

At present, it is considered that the key factor of CIN is the change of renal hemodynamics caused by contrast agent, which leads to the occurrence of medulla nephrica ischemia and hypoxia injury.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>RIPC is an effective endogenous protective mechanism against ischemia/reperfusion injury. It protects the heart and has a protective effect on the brain, kidney, small intestine, liver, skeletal muscle and other organs, and has the universality of organs.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> In 2000, Ogawa et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> found that ischemic preconditioning can alleviate the renal damage in rats after 40-minute ischemia. In the study of 924 patients with cardiac or vascular surgery, it was found that the incidence of acute renal dysfunction in the distal ischemic preconditioning group was significantly lower than that in the control group.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In recent years, some researchers reported the role of limb ischemic preconditioning in preventing CIN in patients with renal insufficiency.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> However, for patients with ACS undergoing PCI, there is a lack of large-scale clinical studies to prevent CIN by RIPC. The study of preventing CIN is still in its infancy for patients with ACS undergoing PCI currently. This study shows that recirculation treatment of 5 times of 5-minute ischemia (pressure maintained at 200 mmHg) of /5&#x0200a;min can reduce the incidence of CIN. There were 20 cases of CIN in the study, including RIPC group of 5 cases (10%), and control group of 15 cases (26.3%). It suggests that RIPC can reduce the incidence of CIN in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.</p><p>At present, Cr is the main criterion for CIN. It often rises to peak at 72&#x0200a;hours after PCI. In this study, 107 cases of patients with ACS undergoing PCI treatment, the difference of the creatinine level between 72 hours after operation and preoperation was statistically significant. CysC is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> it has small molecular weight, and it can freely through the glomerular filtration. It can be fully absorbed by renal tubular epithelial cells, and no longer returns to the blood, whereas the renal tubules do not secrete CysC. Because of these characteristics, CysC is superior to Cr, which is a good indicator of renal function.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> NGAL is a kind of trace protein; it is an early and sensitive biomarker of renal injury. It reached the peak at 4&#x0200a;hours after renal ischemia. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most important indicator of renal function. It cannot be directly measured; it is generally believed that the MDRD equation is an effective way to calculate GFR.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>The study found that serum NGAL after PCI 4&#x0200a;hours was significantly higher than that before operation in the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05), and CysC postoperative 24&#x0200a;hours was significantly higher than preoperative (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05). The levels of Cr and GFR postoperative 72&#x0200a;hours were significantly higher than those before angiography. This indicates that the NGAL and CysC are more sensitive than Cr and GFR, and they can detect CIN early. It is of great value in the diagnosis of CIN.</p><p>The mechanism of the protective effect of RIPC is unclear. Previous studies have suggested that the mechanism of renal protection by RIPC is that it can play a role in anti-inflammatory and nerve and humoral pathways by activating a variety of factors.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The latest research finds that the mechanism of effect of RIPC reduces renal damage in CIN through the activation of tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;/nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B pathway, and then increases the high expression of renal enzymes in the body and plays the role of anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant protection of kidney.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup></p><p>Therefore, RIPC, as an effective endogenous protective mechanism against ischemia/reperfusion injury, has broad prospects in the prevention of CIN for patients with ACS undergoing PCI, and provides a new effective way to prevent CIN for ACS patients undergoing PCI treatment.</p><sec><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations and suggestions</title><p>This study is a randomized, controlled, and single-center prospective study of small sample cases; the sample size is relatively small, and the related indexes are limited. Taking into account issues such as patient compliance, we measured related indicators without observing the change process related indicators. Experimental results may exist bias. Because of the shorter study time, all patients were followed up for only 6 months, so the clinical results of the records were relatively small. Therefore, the reliability of this study should be further confirmed by larger and longer clinical observations.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our research shows that RIPC has preventive effects on CIN, which can effectively reduce the incidence of CIN and protect renal function in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.
