In this study, we investigate the role of actomyosin in centration, the movement of the nucleus&#x02013;centrosome complex (NCC) to the cell center. We find that the rate of wild-type centration depends equally on the nonmuscle myosin II NMY-2 and the G&#x003b1; proteins GOA-1/GPA-16. In centration- defective <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes, GOA-1/GPA-16 and NMY-2 act abnormally to oppose centration. This suggests that LET-99 determines the direction of a force on the NCC that is promoted by G&#x003b1; signaling and actomyosin. During wild-type centration, NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates anterior to the NCC tend to move further anterior, suggesting that actomyosin contraction could pull the NCC. In GOA-1/GPA-16&#x02013;depleted zygotes, NMY-2 aggregate displacement is reduced and largely randomized, whereas in a <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant, NMY-2 aggregates tend to make large posterior displacements. These results suggest that G&#x003b1; signaling and LET-99 control centration by regulating polarized actomyosin contraction.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AP, anteroposterior; DIC, differential interference contrast; EL, egg length; F-actin; filamentous actin; MSD, mean-squared displacement; MT, microtubule; NCC, nucleus&#x02013;centrosome complex; NEB, nuclear envelope breakdown.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear movement in animal cells can be driven by pulling forces applied to astral microtubules (MTs) emanating from centrosomes bound to the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Reinsch and Gonczy, 1998</xref>). In the one-cell <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> zygote, asymmetric cleavage is preceded by a series of stereotyped nuclear movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; for review see <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>). Female and male pronuclei invariably meet in the posterior cytoplasm and move as a unit with the paired centrosomes to the cell center during mitotic prophase; this centration of the nucleus&#x02013;centrosome complex (NCC) is accompanied by a 90&#x000b0; rotation that aligns the axis of the centrosome pair with the zygote's longer anteroposterior (AP) axis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albertson, 1984</xref>).

<bold>G&#x003b1; and myosin II contribute to the rate of centration in wild-type zygotes.</bold> (A) Stereotyped movements of pronuclei and centrosomes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote. Male and female signs indicate the sperm and egg-derived pronuclei. Centrosomes are marked with arrowheads. The pronuclei initially appear at opposite poles of the cell and migrate toward each other (top). Because the female pronucleus migrates relatively fast from the anterior, pronuclear meeting occurs in the posterior cytoplasm (middle). The joined pronuclei and sperm- derived centrosome pair then move as a unit to the cell center (bottom). To measure rates of centration, we tracked the centroid of the NCC, which is marked here with asterisks. In all figures, zygotes are oriented with the anterior pole to the left. (B) NCC velocity along the AP axis plotted over time in wild-type (WT; <italic>n</italic> = 10 zygotes) and G&#x0221d;-depleted zygotes (<italic>n</italic> = 9 zygotes).

Note the longer time axis compared with A.

Bar, 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1781177f01"/></fig><p>Laser ablation experiments have revealed that during centration, centrosomes are pulled strongly toward the anterior and weakly toward the posterior (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Labbe et al., 2004</xref>). These forces are likely transmitted by astral MTs, which extend from each centrosome to the cell cortex and are required for centration and rotation (for review see <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>). The molecular motors that pull MTs are unknown, as is the molecular basis of their attachment to the cell cortex. Cortically enriched filamentous actin (F-actin) could provide such anchorage; however, disruption of F-actin by cytochalasin D does not prevent NCC centration (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hill and Strome, 1988</xref>) or rotation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hyman and White, 1987</xref>), leading to suggestions that cortical F-actin is unlikely to be involved (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Grill et al., 2001</xref>). The latter conclusion is surprising, as centrosome movement in other systems is clearly F-actin dependent (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Euteneuer and Schliwa, 1985</xref>).</p><p>A related problem is how the forces that drive centration and rotation are spatially regulated. Although spatial regulation is not in principle necessary for centration (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>), the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote is a polarized cell, and an asymmetrically distributed DEP domain&#x02013;containing protein encoded by the <italic>let-99</italic> gene is required for centration (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Rose and Kemphues, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2002</xref>). The LET-99 protein is enriched in a posterior cortical band coinciding with the initial position of the NCC before centration. In <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes, centration fails, and the NCC undergoes a series of abnormally rapid and extensive oscillatory rocking movements. DEP domains have been implicated in the regulation of heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Koelle and Horvitz, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Hamm, 2006</xref>), with LET-99 regulating a redundant pair of G&#x003b1; subunits called GOA-1 and GPA-16 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). These two G&#x003b1; proteins promote forces that pull on spindle pole centrosomes during anaphase in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Rand, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gotta and Ahringer, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>), as in other systems (for review see <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hampoelz and Knoblich, 2004</xref>), but their importance for centrosome movement at other stages is unclear. GOA-1/GPA-16 depletion in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes eliminates NCC rocking, indicating that during wild- type centration, LET-99 restricts excessive force stimulation by G&#x003b1; signaling (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). Strikingly, GOA-1/GPA-16 depletion also rescues the centration defect in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants, indicating that in the absence of LET-99, inappropriate G&#x003b1; signaling promotes a net force on the NCC directed away from the cell center toward the posterior pole. However, GOA-1 and GPA-16 have not been shown to influence centration in wild-type zygotes.</p><p>In this study, we address two related questions about the control of NCC centration and rotation: the molecular basis of the driving force and the spatial regulation of this force. We show that G&#x003b1; function is required for wild-type rates of centration and rotation and that the nonmuscle myosin II NMY-2 is required to a similar degree for both processes. Like G&#x003b1;, actomyosin opposes centration in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants, suggesting that G&#x003b1; and actomyosin act together to generate a force on the NCC whose direction is determined by LET-99. Finally, we show that cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates anterior to the NCC move with an anterior bias in wild-type zygotes; this bias is strongly reduced in G&#x003b1;-depleted zygotes and is reversed in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes, supporting our conclusion that polarized actomyosin contraction, which is promoted by G&#x003b1; and spatially directed by LET-99, generates part of the force driving centration and rotation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The wild-type rate of centration depends on G&#x003b1; function and myosin II</title><p>Centration, the movement of the NCC to the cell center, occurs during mitotic prophase in wild-type one-cell <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes (Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1</ext-link>). To determine whether the redundantly acting G&#x003b1; proteins GOA-1 and GPA-16 contribute to centration, we used RNAi to deplete both simultaneously and measured the rate of NCC movement along the AP axis during centration (see Materials and methods section DIC video microscopy and analysis&#x02026;). Although not absolutely required for centration, our measurements showed that G&#x003b1; activity is required for the wild-type rate of centration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). In wild-type zygotes, the speed of the NCC (v<sub>AP</sub>, plotted as incremental velocity in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, with peak and mean velocity values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) increased during the first half of centration to a peak value of 7.9 &#x003bc;m/min and a mean value of 6 &#x003bc;m/min followed by a gradual decrease to zero. In contrast to wild-type zygotes, v<sub>AP</sub> in G&#x003b1;-depleted zygotes remained relatively constant during centration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and the peak values of v<sub>AP</sub> were reduced relative to wild type by a factor of approximately two (4.2 &#x003bc;m/min [<italic>t</italic> test; P &#x0003c; 0.00001] compared with 7.9 &#x003bc;m/min in wild type; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The time-averaged value of v<sub>AP</sub> was also reduced to 2.0 &#x003bc;m/min compared with 2.9 &#x003bc;m/min in wild type (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). These results suggest that GOA-1 and GPA-16 contribute to an anterior-directed net force on the NCC during centration. The lack of an absolute requirement could reflect a failure to fully deplete these proteins using RNAi or the presence of multiple additive force-generating mechanisms. Further depletion of GOA-1/GPA-16 results in sterility (see Materials and methods section <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and maintenance), complicating our ability to distinguish between these two explanations (see Discussion).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>

The NCC moved toward the anterior at speeds similar to those observed after reversed fertilization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), invariably moving past the center into the anterior cytoplasm (unpublished data). Finally, the rate of NCC movement in <italic>par-3(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes was reduced more than twofold by NMY-2 depletion to levels slightly below those measured in NMY-2&#x02013;depleted wild-type zygotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), indicating that NMY-2 does not act merely by restricting PAR-3 localization. We conclude that although PAR-3 makes a minor contribution to the rate of centration, the requirement for NMY-2 is at least partially independent of PAR-3 and cell polarity.</p><p>We next examined the rate of NCC rotation to determine whether actomyosin and G&#x003b1; signaling also contribute to this movement.

We also examined <italic>let-99(or513</italic>ts<italic>)</italic> zygotes after the depletion of profilin (PFN-1), an F-actin assembly factor that is required for the accumulation of cortical F-actin in the zygote (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al., 2002</xref>). In PFN-1&#x02013;depleted <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes, the position of pronuclear meeting was highly variable, but, in each case, centration was rescued (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The rescue of centration was again accompanied by a marked reduction of NCC rocking compared with the <italic>let-99(or513</italic>ts<italic>)</italic> single mutant (Video 5 and unpublished data). We also used RNAi to simultaneously deplete two components of the Arp2/3 complex, another F-actin assembly factor required for cortical stability in the early embryo and for gastrulation but not for the myosin II&#x02013;dependent processes of cell polarization and cytokinesis (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al., 2002</xref>). Depletion of Arp2/3 in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes destabilized the cell cortex but did not restore centration (unpublished data), suggesting that the abnormal forces opposing centration in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes are mediated specifically by profilin-dependent F-actin in association with NMY-2 but are not affected by a different perturbation of the F-actin cytoskeleton.

To test this prediction, we used RNAi to deplete MEL-11, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of MYPT (myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit), a protein phosphatase that inhibits NMY-2 activity (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Piekny et al., 2000</xref>). Strikingly, MEL-11 depletion in <italic>let-99(or513</italic>ts<italic>)</italic> mutants caused the NCC to move toward the posterior in seven out of eight cases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref> and Video 6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1</ext-link>).

To account for the suppression of NCC rocking by either the depletion or overactivation of NMY-2, we speculate that the misdirected actomyosin-dependent force in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants is counteracted by an independently generated centration-promoting force and that a balance of roughly equal but oppositely acting forces promotes excess rocking (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Polarized distribution of cortical NMY-2 aggregates during wild-type centration</title><p>Seeking to understand how NMY-2 contributes to NCC movement, we used spinning disc confocal microscopy to image cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP in transgenic zygotes during centration. In agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</xref>), we found the onset of centration to coincide with a sudden reorganization of cortical NMY-2. At the time of pronuclear meeting in wild type, an anteriorly enriched cortical network of relatively large actomyosin bundles is replaced by a more finely reticular F-actin network in which NMY-2 is focused in small, isolated aggregates. Both F-actin and NMY-2 localize most densely to a cap covering the anterior half of the zygote, and a separate, less dense cap of actomyosin also is observed over the posterior pole. The lowest density of NMY-2 aggregates is consistently found in an intermediate zone (50&#x02013;75% EL) that encircles the position of the NCC at the beginning of centration. Interestingly, the highest NMY-2 density is always found at the boundary between this intermediate zone and the anterior cap; until a late stage of centration, this myosin-dense ring is several micrometers anterior to the advancing NCC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, Fig. S1, and Video 7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1</ext-link>). Although aggregates appeared to be highly mobile, the overall NMY-2 distribution pattern persisted past the end of centration. Thus, cortical actomyosin is well positioned to play a role in generating forces that pull centrosomes strongly toward the anterior and weakly toward the posterior (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Labbe et al., 2004</xref>). Although the relative enrichment of NMY-2 in the anterior cap at NEB was slightly reduced in Ga-depleted and <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes (Fig. S1), the significance of this is unclear. Our finding that centration occurs at a near wild-type rate in <italic>par-3(it71)</italic> zygotes, in which NMY-2 aggregates are distributed uniformly throughout the cortex (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Munro et al., 2004</xref>), suggests that a polarized distribution is unnecessary for the action of NMY-2 in centration. Therefore, rather than focus on the overall distribution of NMY-2, we examined the behavior of individual NMY-2 aggregates for clues to actomyosin's mechanical role.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>

For example, pulling force might be entirely generated by an MT-based motor such as dynein, with actomyosin simply providing cortical anchorage for the motor. In this case, every component of the cortical attachment site, including NMY-2, should tend to move toward the centrosomes if at all. Alternatively (or additionally), NMY-2 itself could itself act as a force generator by pulling the actomyosin cortex and attached MT plus ends away from centrosomes. This model predicts that NMY-2 aggregates in at least some region anterior to the NCC will tend to move away from the NCC during centration. To test these ideas, we used automated particle tracking (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Margineantu et al., 2000</xref>) to measure displacements of brightly labeled cortical NMY-2 aggregates in the cortical plane of wild-type zygotes (<italic>n</italic> = 10) during the early stage of centration (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;D</xref>; and Video 8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200703159/DC1</ext-link>; see Materials and methods section Particle tracking for details of tracking procedure).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

In three of these four central octants, however, the largest displacements (&#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;m/12 s) were strongly biased toward the posterior (to a more subtle degree, this bias was also present in the two anterior-most octants, a and e). An abnormally polarized trend in large displacements occurred in octants b and f: large displacements occurred more frequently toward the posterior and more rarely toward the anterior compared with wild type.

</p><p>Surprisingly, the inactivation of LET-99 caused a striking reduction in both the magnitude and directional bias of transverse displacements (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Similarly narrow and symmetrical displacement profiles were measured in most regions of G&#x003b1;- depleted zygotes, with the two posterior octants again showing distinctively nonrandom trends. Thus, both GOA-1/GPA-16 and LET-99 seem to play essential roles in generating the directionally biased movement of NMY-2 aggregates along the transverse axis.</p></sec><sec><title>Time-dependent mobility of NMY-2 aggregates is distinctly altered by inactivating LET-99 or GOA-1/GPA-16</title><p>To better understand the mechanics of NMY-2 aggregate movement and its control by G&#x003b1; and LET-99, we next measured the total mobility of NMY-2 aggregates as a function of time scale. In general, the tendency of a particle to move from its initial position over time reflects the forces it experiences in its local environment, including both active transport and constraining forces. Such forces may act at distinct time scales, leading to time-dependent variation in particle mobility. For a population of particles, this can be measured as the time-dependent mean-squared displacement (MSD; see Materials and methods section Particle tracking). Changes in the character of the movement are reflected by changes in the slope of the MSD as a function of time scale; this slope is proportional to the diffusion coefficient (here termed mobility) of the aggregates and reflects the cumulative contributions of random thermal forces, active transport, and constraining forces acting over a given range of time scale. Active transport, which is driven by molecular motors or cytoskeletal assembly dynamics, is expected to generate a positive change in MSD (increased aggregate mobility) over the range of time scale in which it produces directed motion. On the other hand, opposition to such transport will negatively affect aggregate mobility over an independent range of time scales.</p><p>For each population of aggregates, we measured the projection of the MSD onto the AP and transverse axes. In all wild-type and mutant/RNAi conditions, mobility in some octants increased and/or decreased over time scales ranging from 4 to 16 s (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting that diverse factors or conditions locally modify NMY-2 aggregate mobility. Interestingly, throughout most of the regions examined, mobility over time scales of 1&#x02013;2 s was higher in wild type than in the corresponding octants of G&#x003b1;-depleted or <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes, suggesting that wild-type aggregates move relatively fast and/or in a more directed manner at these short time scales. At longer time scales as well, wild-type NMY-2 aggregates in most regions of the cortex showed relatively high AP mobility, which is consistent with a normal predominance of directed transport that is lacking or constrained in the absence of G&#x003b1; or LET-99.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>

In <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes, an interesting asymmetry was detected: in anterior regions, mobility did not increase over time but rather decreased over time scales of 10&#x02013;15 s. This time-dependent decrease was expected as a reflection of oscillatory cortical flows that occur in approximate synchrony with NCC rocking (unpublished data). Strikingly, mobility in posterior regions of <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes tended to increase over time, showing only a slight decrease at the time scale of NCC oscillation. This regional difference in aggregate mobility could account for the abnormal distribution of NMY-2&#x02013;dependent forces that act on the NCC in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes (see Discussion).</p><p>Transverse mobility increased over time in most regions of the wild-type cortex, but the pattern of regional variation was roughly opposite that of AP mobility, indicating local preferences for aggregates to move along one axis or the other (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

Together with the symmetrically distributed displacements along the transverse axis in both conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), this result suggests that the directionally biased active transport of NMY-2 aggregates along the transverse axis depends on both GOA-1/GPA-16 and LET-99.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that the G&#x003b1; proteins GOA-1/GPA-16 and the myosin II NMY-2 act similarly to promote NCC centration and rotation in wild type and to oppose centration and provoke excessive NCC rocking in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants. In addition to NMY-2, the F-actin assembly factor PFN-1 and the Rho-binding kinase LET-502, which activates NMY-2 by phosphorylating its regulatory light chain, are also required to prevent centration in the absence of LET-99. Moreover, depletion of the inhibitory myosin II light chain phosphatase MEL-11 in a <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant promotes posterior movement of the NCC. Based on these findings, we propose that the G&#x003b1; proteins, acting either through or in parallel to myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation, activate an actomyosin-dependent force that promotes NCC movement and that the direction of this force is regulated by LET-99 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Our findings also suggest that the actomyosin-dependent force acts in parallel with a separate, unidentified centration-promoting force that is independent of actomyosin, G&#x003b1;, and LET-99. Finally, we have shown that elements of the actomyosin cortex undergo intrinsically polarized movement that could directly generate a pulling force on centrosomes, and we propose that G&#x003b1; and LET-99 act by regulating this movement.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Forces on the NCC during centration.</bold> (A) We hypothesize that GOA-1/GPA-16 and NMY-2 contribute to a force-generating mechanism that can promote NCC movement in opposite directions, with LET-99 favoring the anterior direction. (B) Based on the results of this and previous studies, we speculate that two independent forces drive NCC movement: a G&#x0221d;- and NMY-2&#x02013;dependent force (depicted in A) that is oriented by LET-99 (red arrows) and another force independent of these factors (blue arrows). NCC velocity depends on the sum of the two forces. This model accounts for the effects of varying NMY-2 activity in a let-99(&#x02212;) mutant background. (C) Cartoon of two proposed mechanisms driving centration, with arrows indicating force vectors; yellow arrows represent forces on centrosomes. Mechanism 1: fixed MT-based motors (blue arrows) pull cortical sites toward MT minus ends.

In G&#x003b1;-depleted zygotes, only mechanism 1 acts. In let-99(&#x02212;) zygotes, mechanism 1 acts normally, whereas the force vectors of mechanism 2 are spatially reversed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1781177f09"/></fig><p>Our findings challenge the view that actomyosin is not required for centrosome movement in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (see Introduction). Analysis of direct roles of actomyosin in centrosome positioning in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo has previously been complicated by an earlier requirement for the polarization of cortical PAR (partitioning) proteins, which, in turn, are thought to act upstream of G&#x003b1; and LET-99 to control centrosome movement (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>). However, F-actin appears to play PAR-independent roles in the G&#x003b1;-dependent processes of anaphase spindle pole flattening and NCC rotation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Severson and Bowerman, 2003</xref>). Our finding that NMY-2 promotes centration in <italic>par-3(it71)</italic> zygotes likewise indicates a direct role for actomyosin and further suggests that centration is independent of cortical polarity, as neither NMY-2 nor LET-99 is asymmetrically distributed in <italic>par-3(it71)</italic> zygotes at this stage (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Munro et al., 2004</xref>).

</title><p>Centration was slowed but never completely blocked by the depletion of GOA-1/GPA-16 or NMY-2 (see Materials and methods section <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and maintenance). Considering this result with prior evidence that centration can occur independently of F-actin (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hill and Strome, 1988</xref>), we propose that wild-type centration results from the additive effects of two parallel force-generating mechanisms, one of which is promoted by G&#x003b1;/actomyosin and spatially oriented by LET-99. In this scenario, the near-zero net axial movement of the NCC observed in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants can be explained as the result of a balanced conflict between two opposing forces that normally cooperate to drive centration (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>).</p><p>If one or both of the opposing forces in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> varies with centrosome position and velocity, the conflict between them might drive excessive NCC rocking (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pecreaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kozlowski et al., 2007</xref>), and this rocking could be reduced by tipping the balance of force in either direction. We were indeed able to suppress NCC rocking by either reducing or increasing the posterior-directed actomyosin-dependent force in a <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant. Interestingly, simulation of wild-type anaphase centrosome oscillations (which occur with roughly the same period as the prophase oscillations in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes) shows that rocking can be reduced to zero by either increasing or decreasing a cortical pulling force (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pecreaux et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Wild-type NMY-2 aggregate dynamics suggest that cortical actomyosin acts as a force generator</title><p>Based on the behavior of wild-type NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates, we can distinguish between different models for the role of actomyosin in centration. Several current models of centrosome movement in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo posit that force generators bind and effectively shorten astral MTs while anchored to fixed cortical sites (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>, mechanism 1; for review see <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cowan and Hyman, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kozlowski et al., 2007</xref>). Our finding that NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates anterior to the NCC move with an aster-independent anterior bias suggests instead that a pulling force may be generated by the intrinsic motility of MT attachment sites within the cortical plane (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>, mechanism 2). Such actomyosin-based motility of cortical sites indeed appears to move asters in yeast (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rosenblatt et al., 2004</xref>). However, we measured peak centrosome velocities during centration that far exceed the highest rates of NMY-2&#x02013; GFP aggregate movement. We speculate that both types of pulling mechanisms (attachment site motility and tethered MT shortening) may operate in tandem so that the resulting forces are coupled. Alternatively, rapid MT binding and release by NMY-2 aggregates could ratchet them toward MT minus ends, and many such small pulling movements could generate a large summed force on the NCC.</p><p>Remarkably, an anterior bias in aggregate displacement was not found in the most anterior cortical regions but only in regions a short distance anterior to the NCC. Any pulling force exerted on the NCC by these biased movements would therefore be predicted to diminish toward the end of centration. This prediction is consistent with the sinusoidal NCC displacement profile observed in wild type (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kimura and Onami, 2005</xref>), corresponding to the bell-shaped velocity profile shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. As the velocity increase during early centration depends on NMY-2, it is plausible that the local regulation of polarized cortical contraction acts to generate a position-dependent pulling force on centrosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of GOA-1/GPA-16 and LET-99 in cortical NMY-2 aggregate motility</title><p>Given the similar requirements of NMY-2 and GOA-1/GPA-16 for promoting centration in wild-type zygotes and opposing it in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants, we hypothesized that G&#x003b1; signaling influences actomyosin contractility to promote centration in wild-type zygotes. Indeed, the loss of anteriorly biased NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregate movement in cortical regions anterior to the NCC is consistent with a role of G&#x003b1; signaling in directing biased actomyosin contraction. G&#x003b1; is not simply required for NMY-2 aggregate movement, however, as directed movement was evident in octants near and posterior to the NCC in G&#x003b1;-depleted zygotes. An alternative mechanism of G&#x003b1; action is suggested by the bidirectional bias of large AP displacements toward the NCC in <italic>goa-1(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>);gpa-16(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes. We speculate that G&#x003b1; signaling might induce the relaxation of actomyosin in the vicinity of asters, allowing long-range contractile flow toward distal cortical regions. Supporting this model, GOA-1/GPA-16 and their positive regulator GPR-1/2 are also required for the spindle poles to transmit a cytokinesis-promoting signal during anaphase, and GPR-1/2 is enriched at this stage in the polar cortex, where relaxation is thought to occur (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bringmann et al., 2007</xref>). Other G&#x003b1; proteins are known to affect actomyosin assembly and contraction through regulation of the small G proteins Rho and Rac (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>), raising the possibility that GOA-1/GPA-16 may influence aster-associated actomyosin through the local regulation of one of these pathways.</p><p>Because LET-99 has been shown to negatively regulate G&#x003b1;-dependent forces that promote NCC rocking (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>), we expected LET-99 inactivation to also perturb NMY-2&#x02013; GFP aggregate dynamics, but in a manner distinct from the effect of GOA-1/GPA-16 depletion. Indeed, NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant zygotes exhibited a characteristic pattern of abnormal movements throughout a large region of the cortex. In contrast to the anterior direction of large displacements near the forward-moving centrosome in wild type, the largest displacements near and anterior to the NCC in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes were directed toward the posterior. Thus, LET-99 appears to reverse the net directional force acting on a fast-moving subpopulation of cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates near the NCC. If these aggregates bind to astral MTs, their behavior in the <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutant could explain the reversal of the actomyosin-dependent force that promotes centration in wild-type zygotes. Interestingly, posteriorly biased large displacements were similarly observed in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes near the NCC, where active transport predominated, and anteriorly adjacent to this region, where constraining forces predominated. This relationship suggests that NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates in these two regions are mechanically linked and that polarized actomyosin contraction in the posterior cortex of <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> zygotes exerts a pulling force on the anterior cortex.</p><p>It is intriguing that the transverse movement of NMY-2 aggregates was greatly reduced in both <italic>zyg-9(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> and <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> mutants. As this movement requires the normal activity of astral MTs (absent in <italic>zyg-9(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic>), we expected it instead to be increased by the hyperactive aster movement in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic>. We speculate that signaling from astral MTs may induce the directed movement of actomyosin through a mechanism that operates on a relatively long time scale compared with that of NCC rocking. Such a positive feedback effect on actomyosin movement could play an important role in generating smooth and directed centrosome movement during centration. To further elucidate how actomyosin interacts with astral MTs to drive centrosome movement, it will be interesting to examine the correlated trajectories of astral MTs and associated NMY-2 aggregates in doubly labeled zygotes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>

In the case of <italic>goa-1;gpa-16</italic> double RNAi, zygotes were used whose older siblings showed large multinucleate cells, which is a result of cytokinesis defects during late cleavage that indicates the effective depletion of both GOA-1 and GPA-16.</p></sec><sec><title>DIC video microscopy and analysis of NCC movement</title><p>Zygotes were dissected out in M9 salts, placed on 3% agarose pads, and overlaid with a coverslip, under which was placed enough M9 to delay evaporation from the agar pad. For Nomarski differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, 63&#x000d7; 1.4 NA oil immersion objectives (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) were used with microscopes (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). DIC images were collected at room temperature (23 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C) at frame rates of 0.1&#x02013;2.0 Hz using a digital video camera (307,200 pixels<sup>2</sup>; CCDX; Dage-MTI) connected to a frame-grabber card controlled by a computer (G4; Macintosh). The frame-grabber software was Image 1.62 (Scion) run on an OS9 operating system (Macintosh). These image sequences were collected as TIFF stacks and analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH]) and Excel (Microsoft). Image stacks were rotated to align the zygote's AP axis horizontally with anterior to the left. The NCC position, relative to the zygote's anterior pole at the time of NEB, was tracked at 10-s intervals beginning just before pronuclear meeting and terminating at NEB. The center of the NCC (midpoint between the diametrically opposed centrosomes) was approximated by eye. NCC velocity was calculated for each 10-s interval. The mean velocity and SD for each genotype/RNAi treatment were computed for the period between pronuclear meeting and NEB. To estimate peak velocities, incremental velocity measurements for each zygote of a given genotype/RNAi treatment were sorted in descending order; the three highest values obtained for each zygote were selected, and the mean of these values was computed for all zygotes. Net NCC rotation in wild-type, <italic>nmy-2(RNAi)</italic>, and <italic>goa-1 (RNAi);gpa-16(RNAi)</italic> zygotes was measured during the 60 s preceding NEB. NCC angular position was measured as the angle of a line connecting the two centrosomes relative to the AP axis, and the change in this angle over the 60-s period was calculated. NCC oscillations in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> single and double mutants were also measured during the 60 s preceding NEB, when the NCC in <italic>let-99(</italic>&#x02212;<italic>)</italic> single mutants is abnormally rotating in place. At each reversal of NCC rotation, angular position was measured as the angle of a line connecting the two centrosomes relative to the AP axis. To compare any two sets of measurements, we used the <italic>t</italic> test (two-tailed, assuming unequal variance).</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence microscopy and analysis of NMY-2&#x02013;GFP localization</title><p>All fluorescence imaging was performed by spinning disc confocal microscopy. NMY-2&#x02013;GFP was excited using a 300-mW argon laser (Dynamic Laser; Solamere Technology Group) coupled via optical fiber to a spinning disc confocal attachment (Yokogawa; PerkinElmer). The spinning disc head was mounted onto a side port of an inverted fluorescence microscope (TE2000U; Nikon), which was used with either a 60&#x000d7; or 100&#x000d7; plan Apo DIC 1.4 NA objective (Nikon). Transmitted light was shuttered using a custom adapted shutter (Uniblitz; Applied Scientific Instrumentation), whereas excitation and emission light was filtered using two filter wheels (MetalTek) controlled by a driver (Lambda 10&#x02013;2; Sutter Instrument Co.). In the case of DIC imaging, the emission was filtered according to polarization; for GFP fluorescence imaging, the emission was filtered using a 505-nm-long pass filter (Z485LP; Chroma Technology Corp.). Focusing of the objective was controlled by a XYZ automated stage (PZ-2000; Applied Scientific Instrumentation) with a piezo z-axis top plate. All image acquisition was controlled by MetaMorph imaging software version 6.2r6 (Molecular Devices). Zygotes were collected and mounted as for DIC microscopy except that the slide was warmed to 26&#x000b0;C using a Bionomic cell (BC-300W; 20/20 Technologies).</p><p>To quantitate cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP intensity, we imaged the entire thickness of the zygote cortex in a z-series of eight images 0.2 &#x003bc;m apart and used ImageJ to make a two-dimensional projection by summing the signal at each point. We selected a rectangular area corresponding to the median 50% of the zygote (25% egg width on each side of a line corresponding to the AP axis) and plotted the distribution profiles of fluorescence intensity at pronuclear meeting and NEB by adding the signal at each point along the normalized length of the AP axis. To eliminate variation arising from curvature of the cortex at the cell poles, we analyzed only a segment from 0.2 to 0.8 EL. For each zygote, relative distribution of NMY-2&#x02013;GFP along the AP axis was calculated as the fraction of total cortical signal at each point along the axis. Data presented in Fig. S1 A are mean values for each genotype/RNAi condition. A <italic>t</italic> test (two-tailed, assuming unequal variance) was used to compare values between genotypes at each axial position. To simultaneously visualize cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP and centrosomes (Fig. S1 B), we collected a cortical fluorescence z-series and a DIC image of the NCC every 10 s. Fluorescence z-series corresponding to each time point were projected as a sum, and stacks were normalized for EL. Each stack was cropped to a median 50% of egg width, and then the reslice command was used to generate a three-dimensional kymograph. This was flattened by projecting the average (mean) of all slices, thus reducing the AP axis to a row of pixels and generating a kymograph that showed change in the AP intensity profile over time. All kymographs were autoadjusted for brightness and contrast, aligned with reference to the time of NEB, and averaged. Corresponding DIC stacks were likewise normalized for EL, and the centrosomes were marked at each 10-s time point; these marked stacks were used to generate kymographs using the same method as used for fluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Particle tracking</title><p>To quantify the movements of actomyosin aggregates, we measured NMY-2&#x02013;GFP displacements occurring at time scales ranging from 0.25 to 16 s. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> (C and D) shows the trajectories of all cortical NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates in a wild-type zygote imaged over 60 s using 1- and 12-s time scales. The trajectory of each aggregate is described by a single track; sampling the aggregates' displacements at time intervals of 1 s (time scale = 1 s) will yield a set of displacements (in this case, up to 59; shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Sampling at a longer time scale (12 s) yields a smaller number of displacements of more widely distributed magnitude (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Importantly, sampling at this longer time scale reveals directional trends in aggregate movement that may not be apparent at shorter time scales. Note that from the same set of trajectories, a different set of displacements over a 12-s interval would be obtained by shifting the initial sampling time point. Therefore, when measuring displacements over a time scale longer than the acquisiton frame rate, the most complete description is obtained by sampling all possible overlapping time frames in each image sequence. Thus, we extracted all displacements at a given time scale and analyzed frequency distributions of displacement size and direction.</p><p>Zygotes were observed using DIC optics until the time of pronuclear meeting; the objective was then focused on the upper cortex, and images of a single focal plane were collected at intervals of 0.25&#x02013;1 s beginning 30 s after pronuclear meeting. After recording for 30&#x02013;60 s, we determined the direction of NCC rotation and confirmed that the cell successfully divided and that its daughters reentered interphase. Although we could not simultaneously record movements of NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates and the NCC, we found that during the longer 60-s period of data collection, the NCC in wild-type zygotes moves anteriorly a mean distance of 12 &#x000b1; 2% of EL and rotates through a mean angle of 28 &#x000b1; 14&#x000b0; (<italic>n</italic> = 25). In G&#x003b1;- depleted zygotes, the NCC moves 5.5 &#x000b1; 2% of EL toward the anterior and rotates through 14 &#x000b1; 13&#x000b0; (<italic>n</italic> = 16). In <italic>let-99(or513</italic>ts<italic>)</italic> zygotes, the NCC moves 1 &#x000b1; 2% of EL toward the anterior and changes its direction of rotation four to five times (<italic>n</italic> = 16).</p><p>Image sequences were opened using ImageJ, background was subtracted, and the stack was rotated to align the zygote horizontally with anterior to the left before saving as a series of 8-bit TIFF images. Further image processing and analysis were performed using IDL (Research Systems, Inc.). NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates were tracked as described previously (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Marcus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Margineantu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Knowles et al., 2002</xref>) The first image of the sequence was imported and digitally filtered using a Gaussian filter of 11-pixel (0.7 &#x003bc;m) diameter. A set of features was defined (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>) corresponding to the brightest regions distinguishable through the Gaussian filter; most of these were too faint to be discerned by eye and were removed by selecting for brightness. The remaining set of features was overlaid on the original image to confirm identity with observed NMY-2&#x02013;GFP aggregates. The features identified were compiled into a time-dependent trajectory that linked features corresponding to the same aggregates in successive frames. Trajectories were plotted on the x and y coordinates to visualize aggregate displacements (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>). Histograms of aggregate displacements as a function of time scale were constructed from the aggregate trajectories. Distributions of aggregate displacements were analyzed at the time scale of 12 s. This choice represented a compromise between the objectives of detecting biologically driven behaviors (increasingly prominent with increasing time scale) and maintaining a representative dataset: at longer time scales, considerably fewer data points were available from a subset of recordings that lasted 30 s.</p><p>MSDs were calculated as a function of the time scale &#x003c4; from the aggregate trajectories according to the method outlined by <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Margineantu et al.
