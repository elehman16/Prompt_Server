</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Every year, more than 200 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, and more than 600,000 people, mainly children living in sub-Saharan Africa, die from this parasitic disease. Malaria parasites are transmitted to people through the bites of infected night-flying mosquitoes and cause fever that needs to be treated promptly with anti-malarial drugs to prevent anemia (a reduction in red blood cell numbers) and life-threatening organ damage. Malaria transmission can be prevented by using long-lasting insecticides sprayed on the indoor walls of homes to kill the mosquitoes that spread the malaria parasite or by sleeping under insecticide-treated nets to avoid mosquito bites and further reduce mosquito numbers. Widespread use of these preventative measures, together with the introduction of artemisinin combination therapy (an effective anti-malarial treatment), has reduced the global burden of malaria by 45% in all age groups, and by 51% among young children, since 2000.</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Unfortunately, the emergence of insecticide and drug resistance is threatening this advance in malaria control. Moreover, additional interventions&#x02014;specifically, effective malaria vaccines&#x02014;will be needed to eliminate malaria in the large areas of Africa where malaria transmission remains high. Currently, there is no licensed malaria vaccine, but RTS,S/AS01, the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials (the last stage of testing before licensing) in infants and children in seven African countries. The RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership reported encouraging results on the efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 during 12 months of follow-up in 2011 and 2012. Here, researchers report on the 18-month efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is the reduction in the incidence of a disease (the number of new cases that occur in a population in a given period) among trial participants who receive the vaccine compared to the incidence among participants who do not receive the vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers randomly assigned 6,537 infants aged 6&#x02013;12 weeks and 8,923 children aged 5&#x02013;17 months to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 or a control vaccine. During 18 months of follow-up, there were 0.69 episodes of clinical malaria (a high temperature and parasites in the blood) per person-year among the children who received all the planned doses of RTS,S/AS01 (the &#x0201c;per protocol&#x0201d; population) and 1.17 episodes per person-year among the control children&#x02014;a VE against clinical malaria in the per-protocol population of 46%. A similar VE was seen in an intention-to-treat analysis that included all the enrolled children, regardless of whether they received all of the planned vaccine doses; intention-to-treat analyses reflect the real-life situation&#x02014;in which children sometimes miss vaccine doses&#x02014;better than per-protocol analyses. In intention-to-treat analyses, the VE among children against severe malaria (fever, parasites in the blood, and symptoms such as anemia) and hospitalization for malaria was 34% and 41%, respectively. Among infants, the VE against clinical malaria was 27% in both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses; the vaccine showed no protection against severe malaria or hospitalization. In both infants and children, VE waned with time since vaccination. Across all the study sites, RTS,S/AS01 averted an average of 829 and 449 cases of clinical malaria per 1,000 children and infants vaccinated, respectively. Finally, the serious adverse event meningitis (inflammation of the tissues lining the brain and spinal cord) occurred more frequently in trial participants given RTS,S/AS01 than in those given the control vaccine, but the incidence of other serious adverse events was similar in both groups of participants.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These and other findings show that, during 18 months of follow-up, vaccination of children and young infants with RTS,S/AS01 prevented many cases of clinical and severe malaria and that the impact of vaccination was highest in regions with the highest incidence of malaria. They indicate, as in the earlier analysis, that the VE against clinical and severe malaria is higher in children than in young infants and suggest that protection wanes over time. Whether or not the vaccine played a causal role in the observed cases of meningitis cannot be determined from these results, and the occurrence of meningitis will be followed closely during the remainder of the trial. Other study limitations (for example, variations in the clinical characteristics of participants from one center to another) may also affect the accuracy of these findings and their interpretation. However, by showing that even a modest VE can avert a substantial number of malaria cases, these findings suggest that vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 could have a major public health impact in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001685">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001685</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages), including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/malaria/en/index.html">malaria immunization</ext-link>; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/en/">World Malaria Report 2013</ext-link> provides details of the current global malaria situation; the World Health Organization also provides information on its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/immunization/givs/en/index.html">Global Immunization Vision and Strategy</ext-link> (in English and French)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria">malaria</ext-link>, including a selection of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/stories/index.html">personal stories</ext-link> about malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/">Roll Back Malaria Partnership</ext-link> on the global control of malaria and on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/gmap/index.html">Global Malaria Action Plan</ext-link> (in English and French); its website includes a fact sheet about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/cmc_upload/0/000/015/370/RBMInfosheet_3.htm">malaria in Africa</ext-link>

RTS,S was identified as a potential candidate for further development following encouraging results in an experimental challenge study <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Stoute1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

The AS01 adjuvant was shown to be more immunogenic than the AS02 adjuvant used in initial studies <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Kester1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and RTS,S/AS01 was well tolerated and efficacious <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Bejon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Asante1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These encouraging phase 2 trial results led to the decision to conduct a large-scale phase 3 clinical trial involving 15,460 children recruited at 11 sites in seven countries across Africa. We have reported previously overall vaccine efficacy (VE) and safety during 12 mo of follow-up <xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The first analysis, conducted in 6,000 children aged 5&#x02013;17 mo at the time of first vaccination, showed that, per protocol, RTS,S/AS01 gave 56% (97.5% CI 51% to 60%) protection against the first or only episode of clinical malaria and 47% (95% CI 22% to 64%) efficacy against severe malaria during 12 mo of follow-up. VE was lower in young infants vaccinated at the age of 6&#x02013;12 wk when RTS,S/AS01 was given at the same time as routine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines; VE against first or only clinical malaria episode in the per-protocol population was 31% (97.5% CI 24% to 38%) against clinical malaria and 37% (95% CI 5% to 58%) against severe malaria. The vaccine was immunogenic and generally safe, although an imbalance in cases of meningitis was seen in both age categories between participants who received RTS,S/AS01 and the control vaccine (rabies vaccine for children 5&#x02013;17 mo at enrollment and meningococcal C conjugate vaccine for infants 6&#x02013;12 wk at enrollment) <xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The objectives of the analyses reported in this paper were determination of VE in both age categories of children during 18 mo of follow-up, just prior to administration of a booster dose of RTS,S/AS01 and, for the first time, an analysis of variations in the immunogenicity and VE of RTS,S/AS01 by study site. Site-specific measurements of VE provide insight into the determinants of the overall estimates of VE and are used to calculate the number of clinical and severe malaria cases averted, important measures of public health impact that will be useful to policy makers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><p>The trial protocol was approved by the ethical review board at each study center and partner institution and by the national regulatory authority in each country (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001685.s010">Table S1A</xref>).

Children with a moderate or severe illness; a major congenital defect; malnutrition requiring hospitalization; a hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;5.0 g/dl, or &#x0003c;8 g/dl with clinical signs of decompensation; a history of atypical febrile seizures; a neurological disorder; or WHO stage III or stage IV HIV disease at the time of presentation were ineligible for enrollment. ITNs were provided or made available to any child who presented for screening. Reported ITN use or protection by indoor residual spraying was documented during a home visit 12 mo after the third dose of study vaccine. Anthropometric measurements were taken at enrollment and 1 and 18 mo after the third dose of study vaccine.</p><fig id="pmed-1001685-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001685.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study sites and malaria endemicity.</title><p>Adapted from Hay et al. <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Hay1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

One group received RTS,S/AS01 followed by a booster dose 18 mo after completing the primary vaccination series, a second group received the RTS,S/AS01 primary vaccination series without a booster, and the third group received comparator vaccines, rabies vaccine (VeroRab, Sanofi-Pasteur) for children or meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Menjugate, Novartis) for young infants.

Overall estimates were adjusted for study site as a fixed effect, whereas site estimates were unadjusted for covariates. Inter-site variation was evaluated by site interaction terms, and prespecified univariate analyses and multivariate models were used to explore the impact of covariates on post-vaccination anti-CS responses or on VE. Transmission intensity was defined in the models as the malaria incidence in control children or control young infants, depending on the age category included in the model. VE against all other clinical end points was estimated as a relative risk (RR) reduction with Fisher's exact <italic>p-</italic>values. VE over time was evaluated by Schoenfeld residuals <italic>p-</italic>values, Andersen-Gill Cox models with time-varying covariates, and incidence reduction by 6-mo periods. Vaccine impact was calculated as the difference in incidence between the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups, expressed per 1,000 children vaccinated for each 6-mo period of follow-up. The cumulative number of cases averted over 18 mo was calculated by summing the number of cases averted for each 6-mo follow-up period. The per-protocol population included all participants who received three doses of vaccine and contributed to efficacy surveillance, starting 14 d after the third dose. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine. The more specific primary case definition of clinical malaria was used for determination of VE. VE calculated using secondary case definitions is also reported. The co-primary end points of VE in infants and children, presented in prior publications, were described with 97.5% CIs; all other VE end points are presented with 95% CIs. A sensitive secondary case definition (measured or reported fever in the prior 24 h and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite density &#x0003e;0 parasites/mm<sup>3</sup>) was used for the evaluation of the impact of RTS,S/AS01 on clinical malaria because, in clinical practice, sick children who present to a health facility with any level of malaria parasitemia receive treatment for malaria. Data were censored at the time of administration of a booster dose, 20 mo after dose 1, or at the date of emigration, withdrawal of consent, or death.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Results</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Overall, 8,923 children and 6,537 young infants were enrolled.

Four infants with reported meningitis died, two in the RTS,S/AS01 group and two in the control group. Meningitis cases were not temporally related to vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001685.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Most study sites reported 1&#x02013;3 cases of meningitis during the 18-mo follow-up period, while the site in Lilongwe, Malawi, reported 11 cases and the site in Kombewa, Kenya, reported five cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001685.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). An overview of the analyses reported here is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001685.s026">Table S17</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>RTS,S/AS01 provided protection against a range of predefined end points, including clinical and severe malaria, over an 18-mo follow-up period among children aged 5&#x02013;17 mo at first vaccination across a wide range of malaria transmission settings. VE against clinical malaria was 40% or higher in each setting but varied significantly between sites. In contrast to previous phase 2 trials, which found that efficacy decreased with increasing exposure <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Olotu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Bejon2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the variation in VE between study sites seen in this trial could not be explained by differences in the intensity of malaria transmission between sites, as measured by the incidence of clinical malaria in control children or control young infants applied as an average transmission level for all participants at a given site. However, there are several caveats to this finding. First, the presence of moderate anemia at enrollment, which may reflect malaria exposure at the individual level, was negatively associated with VE. Second, in children, while there was no correlation found between VE and transmission in a multivariate model, VE appeared higher at sites with a lower incidence of malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001685-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Differences in the incidence of clinical malaria between sites may be influenced by various genetic and environmental factors independent of the transmission level. Differences in anti-CS antibody GMT across sites did not explain differences in efficacy.</p><p>VE against clinical malaria was lower in young infants than in children. Severe malaria was more frequent, although the difference was not significant statistically, among young infant RTS,S/AS01 recipients compared with controls during the final follow-up period in this analysis, 12&#x02013;18 mo after dose 3. This could be a chance finding or could indicate that the vaccine interfered with the acquisition of natural immunity <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Gatton1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, an effect perhaps compounded by prompt access to diagnosis and treatment. Further follow-up is planned, and will include close monitoring of the 1/3 of participants who received the RTS,S/AS01 primary vaccination series but not the RTS,S/AS01 booster dose.</p><p>The current analysis has provided some clues as to why young infants respond less effectively to RTS,S/AS01 than children. Maternal antibodies are likely to have played a role, as young infants with detectable anti-CS antibodies at enrollment had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS response than young infants without detectable anti-CS antibodies at enrollment, and a high post-vaccination anti-CS antibody titer was associated with VE in young infants. However, maternal antibodies cannot explain fully the lower anti-CS response in young infants, as those without detectable maternally derived anti-CS antibodies still had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS antibody GMT than did vaccinated children. Immune interference due to administration of RTS,S/AS01 at the same time as EPI vaccines remains a possible factor. The fact that phase 2 trials showed that co-administration in one setting was associated with lower anti-CS responses than staggered administration in another setting supports this hypothesis <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Abdulla1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A suppressive effect from exposure to malaria antigens in utero might be more marked in young infants than in older children, who have had a longer period to acquire immunity <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Gbedande1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Dauby1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Finally, the immature immune system of young infants may not respond as well as the immune system of older children. In contrast with findings from a phase 2 trial <xref rid="pmed.1001685-OwusuAgyei1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, we found no evidence that priming with hepatitis B vaccine in children explained their enhanced anti-CS antibody response.</p><p>VE waned over time in both young infants and children, as reported previously <xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. An analysis by 6-mo period showed that the vaccine provided protection against clinical malaria throughout the follow-up period, but that there was a progressive decline in efficacy. However, these analyses need to be treated with caution; although the study groups were well matched during the first 6-mo period, this was not the case subsequently as children in the control group experienced more clinical malaria than children in the RTS,S/AS01 group, and thereby may have acquired natural immunity, making the vaccine appear less effective by comparison. It will be important to determine whether VE can be restored by a vaccine booster dose, which has been given after the 18-mo follow-up to half of the RTS,S/AS01 recipients.</p><p>The trial was conducted to a high ethical and clinical standard, with harmonization of procedures across sites <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Swysen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Vekemans1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nonetheless, some anomalous findings were noted. The lack of VE among young infants in Kintampo, Ghana, despite 47% VE among children and a post-vaccination anti-CS antibody GMT within the range seen at other sites, was unexpected, as was the lack of efficacy against prevalent malaria infection 18 mo post-vaccination in children at Siaya, Kenya. These may be chance findings but warrant further observation.</p><p>Conducting this trial to high standards required facilitating access of trial participants to both outpatient and inpatient care; purchasing additional clinical and laboratory equipment; ensuring reliable supplies of essential medications, oxygen, and blood; and increasing clinical staffing. Consequently, mortality was very low in both study arms. This may explain why, in contrast to the results of trials of other effective malaria control tools, such as ITNs or prophylactic drugs, we did not find any impact of RTS,S/AS01 on overall mortality <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Lengeler1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> or on nutritional status <xref rid="pmed.1001685-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Neither did we find an impact of the vaccine on the incidence of hospitalized pneumonia or septicemia. The impact of RTS,S/AS01 on mortality and co-infections might be greater were the vaccine to be deployed in non-trial situations, where prompt, high-quality care is less readily available.</p><p>The observed interaction between moderate anemia and decreased VE in older children is intriguing. As stated previously, anemia may be a sensitive indicator of individual exposure to malaria. Alternatively, anemia might indicate active malaria infection, which can interfere with the development of a robust immune response to vaccination <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Williamson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Helminth infection is another frequent cause of anemia in toddlers and young children in sub-Saharan Africa, and helminth infection can also result in a reduced immunological response to vaccination <xref rid="pmed.1001685-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Malnutrition is frequently associated with anemia, but malnutrition was not found to be a determinant of VE in our multivariate model.</p><p>The incidence of SAEs overall was similar in participants in each group, but the imbalance in reported cases of meningitis, noted previously <xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001685-RTS2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, has persisted, and the difference between groups has become statistically significant in older children. No obvious explanation for this association has been found, a temporal relationship to vaccination is lacking, and biological plausibility is low. A causal relationship cannot be confirmed or excluded at this point. The occurrence of meningitis will be followed closely during the remainder of the trial, with particular attention paid to the possible impact of a booster dose of vaccine.</p><p>As with all large-scale, multicenter trials, this study had some weaknesses. Although strenuous efforts were made to standardize clinical and laboratory methods across study sites, there may have been some variations in the clinical characteristics of cases recruited at individual centers that could have contributed to the variations in the level of VE seen across sites. It is possible that variations in factors such as the prevalence of co-infections (including HIV), micronutrient deficiencies, or socio-economic status could have contributed to the heterogeneity in immunogenicity and VE seen between sites, but these factors were not evaluated systematically. Finally, the incidence of clinical malaria in infants was used as an indirect measure of the intensity of malaria transmission at each site, and it is possible that this is not a very discriminatory factor, as it may be influenced by other variables such as the transfer of maternal antibodies against malaria or access to treatment. A direct measure of exposure such as the entomological inoculation rate might have provided a different ranking order between sites. Variations in the immunogenicity and VE of RTS,S/AS01 between sites could not be explained solely by variations in the level of transmission of malaria, but the nature of other factors that may be involved remains to be determined.</p><p>During 18 mo of follow-up, RTS,S/AS01 prevented many cases of clinical and severe malaria across the 11 sites in the trial. Despite its lower efficacy in young infants, RTS,S/AS01 also prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria in young infants. Translated to the population at risk of malaria, reductions in clinical cases on this scale as a result of vaccination with RTS,S/AS01 would have a major public health impact.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001685.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
