Subjects were enrolled and randomized to treatment (1:1 ratio) with N1539 30&#x02009;mg or placebo administered via IV push every 24 hours for up to three doses. N1539 is a novel intravenous (IV) formulation of NanoCrystal Colloidal Dispersion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), developed for the management of moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with a mean pain intensity (numeric pain rating scale, 0&#x02013;10) of 7.2 in the N1539 group and 7.4 in the placebo group. In the primary efficacy assessment, N1539 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) through 24 hours following Dose 1 (SPID<sub>24</sub>; p=0.0145) compared to the placebo group. Statistically significant reductions in SPID were also observed through 12 hours (SPID<sub>12</sub>; p=0.0434) and 48 hours post Dose 1 (SPID<sub>48</sub>; p=0.0040) compared with placebo. The study achieved numerous other secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in time to perceptible pain relief (p=0.0050), number of subjects with &#x02265;30% improvement in pain reduction at 24 hours (p=0.0178), number of times subjects required rescue analgesia in the first 24 hours (p=0.0275) and from 24 to 48 hours (p=0.0009), along with other pain endpoints.</p><p>The safety results demonstrated that N1539 was well tolerated with no difference in adverse event (AE) reporting between the groups. Two serious AEs (SAEs) related to bleeding were reported (one event in each treatment group), with two additional SAEs reported in the placebo group. The most common (&#x02265;2%) treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in N1539 treated subjects were nausea, headache, vomiting, and dizziness, which were observed at a lower incidence than in the placebo group. The majority of TEAEs were mild in intensity, with one subject discontinuing treatment due to an SAE of post-procedural bleeding (placebo). Investigator assessments of satisfaction with wound healing and various wound characteristics were comparable between N1539 and placebo groups. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in vital signs, ECGs, or clinical laboratory assessments.</p><p>The data from this study demonstrated that N1539 provided significant pain relief in subjects with moderate to severe pain following abdominoplasty surgery, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.</p></body></article>
