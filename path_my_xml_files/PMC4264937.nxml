Insulin degludec is a basal insulin analogue (approved thus far in Europe, Japan, Mexico and other regions) with a half-life of 24&#x000a0;h. In contrast, insulin glargine has a half-life of 12&#x000a0;h and a greater glucose-lowering effect during the first 12&#x000a0;h after injection compared with the subsequent 12&#x000a0;h. The flat insulin-action curve and 4-fold lower variability of insulin degludec <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> result in similar efficacy, but lower risk of hypoglycaemia with insulin degludec than with insulin glargine <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Risk reduction in nocturnal hypoglycaemia with insulin degludec was demonstrated in a 52-week, randomized, head-to-head comparison (BEGIN&#x000ae; Basal&#x02013;Bolus Type&#x000a0;1; hereafter, BEGIN) of once-daily insulin degludec and insulin glargine, both with mealtime insulin aspart, in Type&#x000a0;1 diabetes <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This paper describes a 52-week extension to the BEGIN main trial and assesses the long-term safety and efficacy of insulin degludec in the same population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In the main trial, 629 patients who had previously used long-term basal&#x02013;bolus therapy were randomized (3:1) to once-daily insulin degludec (472 subjects) or insulin glargine (157) for 52&#x000a0;weeks, with basal insulin titrated to pre-breakfast plasma glucose values of 3.9&#x02013;4.9&#x000a0;mmol/l. Insulin aspart was taken before each meal and titrated to achieve preprandial and bedtime plasma glucose values of 3.9&#x02013;4.9&#x000a0;mmol/l. Patients entering the extension continued their therapy for another 52&#x000a0;weeks with the same titration target. Data are reported from baseline of the main trial to the end of the extension trial (week&#x000a0;104).</p><p>The same assessments were performed during the main and extension trials <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Safety variables were assessed descriptively based on the safety analysis set (patients exposed to trial products) and extension trial set (patients entering the extension) and included adverse events, hypoglycaemic episodes, insulin dose, body weight and standard safety parameters. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes included those with a plasma glucose value of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/l or severe episodes necessitating assistance. Hypoglycaemic episodes occurring from 00.01 to 05.59&#x000a0;h (both included) were classified as nocturnal. Rate ratios of hypoglycaemic episodes were estimated based on the full analysis set (randomized patients) by use of a negative binomial regression model with treatment, anti-diabetic therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors, and age as covariate, for all treatment-emergent episodes.</p><p>Key efficacy endpoints included change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose and 9-point self-measured plasma glucose profiles, with treatment differences from baseline to week&#x000a0;104 estimated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) performed based on the full analysis set, with treatment, anti-diabetic treatment at screening, sex and region as fixed factors, and age and baseline values as covariates. The analysis of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was repeated based on the extension trial set.</p><p>In-person or phone study visits were performed weekly in the first 26&#x000a0;weeks and every 2&#x000a0;weeks thereafter. Missing values were imputed using the last-observation-carried-forward approach. Alpha level was 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline characteristics were similar between groups <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> (see Supporting Information, Table&#x000a0;S1, for baseline characteristics of the full analysis set and extension trial set). A similar proportion of subjects in both groups entered the extension [74% (351/472) insulin degludec; 75% (118/157) insulin glargine] and completed it [94% (330/351) insulin degludec; 96% (113/118) insulin glargine]. A small proportion of subjects withdrew because of adverse events [&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1% (3/351) insulin degludec; 2% (2/118) insulin glargine], hypoglycaemia [&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1% (1/351) insulin degludec; 0% (0/118) insulin glargine] or ineffective therapy [&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1% (2/351) insulin degludec; 0% (0/118) insulin glargine]. Other reasons for withdrawal were generally unrelated to safety or efficacy (see also Supporting Information, Fig. S1).</p><sec><title>Safety</title><p>A similar proportion of subjects in both groups reported adverse events [87.5% (413/472) insulin degludec; 89.0% (137/154) insulin glargine], most of which were mild. A smaller proportion of subjects in the insulin degludec group than in the insulin glargine group reported injection-site reactions [3.0% (14/472) insulin degludec; 5.8% (9/154) insulin glargine] or serious adverse events [15.0% (71/472) insulin degludec; 18.8% (29/154) insulin glargine]. Serious adverse events reported in the extension trial set over the course of the 2-year trial are summarized by system organ class in the Supporting Information (Table&#x000a0;S2). Body weight increase was modest (2.1&#x000a0;kg insulin degludec; 2.0&#x000a0;kg insulin glargine; not statistically significant).</p><p>The rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was significantly lower with insulin degludec [3.9 vs.&#x000a0;5.3 episodes/patient-year of exposure; estimated rate ratio (insulin degludec/insulin glargine): 0.75 [95%&#x000a0;CI 0.59&#x02013;0.95); <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.02; Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1a</xref>].

During the maintenance period [defined post hoc as the period of optimal basal insulin dosage and stable glycaemic control (i.e. from week&#x000a0;16 onwards)], the rate ratio was 0.98 (0.80&#x02013;1.20) (NS) for confirmed hypoglycaemia and 0.73 (0.56&#x02013;0.94) (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.02) for nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia was low [0.17&#x000a0;episodes/ patient-year of exposure (insulin degludec); 0.15&#x000a0;episodes/ patient-year of exposure (insulin glargine); (NS)].</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Safety and efficacy of long-term use of insulin degludec measured in terms of (a) nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia over the treatment period (safety analysis set), (b) overall confirmed hypoglycaemia over the treatment period (safety analysis set), (c) HbA<sub>1c</sub> values over time (full analysis set), (d) 9-point self-measured plasma glucose values over time (full analysis set) and (e) insulin dose over time (safety analysis set).

Four deaths occurred in the insulin degludec group (two myocardial infarction events; one sudden death; one ventricular tachycardia event) and three in the insulin glargine group (one sudden death; one ventricular arrhythmia event; one metastatic gall bladder cancer event). Interpretation of safety results should take into account the 3:1 randomization scheme of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>After 104&#x000a0;weeks, the observed mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reduced by 0.27%-points and 0.24%-points to 57 and 58&#x000a0;mmol/mol (7.4 and 7.5%) (full analysis set) and by 0.31%-points and 0.24%-points to 56 and 58&#x000a0;mmol/mol (7.3 and 7.5%) (extension trial set) with insulin degludec and insulin glargine, respectively (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1c</xref>). The estimated mean treatment difference of -0.04%-points was not statistically significant [(-0.17 to 0.09); full analysis set].</p><p>Fasting plasma glucose and 9-point self-measured plasma glucose were reduced to a similar extent in both groups (NS) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1d</xref>). At the end of 104&#x000a0;weeks, the daily insulin dose was significantly lower in the insulin degludec group: the dose ratios (insulin degludec/insulin glargine) were 0.88 (0.82&#x02013;0.94) (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) for basal insulin, 0.94 (0.86&#x02013;1.03) (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.18) for bolus insulin and 0.91 (0.86&#x02013;0.97) (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.002) for total insulin. Mean daily doses of insulin degludec increased slightly, but generally remained stable, throughout treatment. Insulin glargine doses increased substantially in the first 5&#x000a0;weeks and continued to increase slightly thereafter (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1e</xref>). The mean daily insulin aspart dose increased during the first 12&#x000a0;weeks of the main trial in both groups and remained stable thereafter. Similar to week&#x000a0;1, the basal-to-bolus split of total daily insulin dose at the end of the trial was 48/52% for the insulin degludec group and 47/53% for the insulin glargine group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This 2-year study demonstrated that patients with Type&#x000a0;1 diabetes who continued insulin degludec therapy experienced similar long-term fasting plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> to that of patients treated with insulin glargine, but with lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. These results are consistent with those of the BEGIN main trial and others involving insulin degludec and insulin glargine in Type&#x000a0;1 diabetes <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia observed with insulin degludec may be attributable to its ultra-long action profile and less variable glucose-lowering effect <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The open-label design may have biased safety reporting. Although extension studies may have biased outcomes, because those experiencing more benefit are more likely to enter the extension, few subjects withdrew after 1&#x000a0;year and similar proportions in both groups entered the extension.</p><p>The hypoglycaemia curves showed increased differences in the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia between insulins over time, which suggests that the risk reduction with insulin degludec is a sustained effect and may improve as patients learn to titrate this new insulin optimally. The similarity in overall confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes between groups suggests that the hypoglycaemia benefit of insulin degludec was not observed during the day, when bolus insulin exerts a greater effect&#x02014;a finding that is also consistent with the main trial results <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The results of this extension trial support the long-term safety of insulin degludec and its potential as a useful advance in basal insulin therapy in diabetes, where hypoglycaemia and the fear of hypoglycaemia are barriers to achieving euglycaemia.</p><sec><title>Funding sources</title><p>Novo Nordisk contributed to the study design, statistical analyses, data interpretation, manuscript preparation and the decision to submit this manuscript for publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>BWB&#x0201a;s employer has received research and grant support from Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Co., Sanofi, MannKind and Biodel.
