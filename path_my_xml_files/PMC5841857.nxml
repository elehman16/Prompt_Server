Subsequent studies focused on longer follow-up times, real-world settings, and specific safety profiles. The Ocriplasmin for Treatment for Symptomatic Vitreomacular Adhesion Including Macular Hole (OASIS) study is a Phase 3b clinical trial designed to characterize ocriplasmin efficacy and safety over a 24-month follow-up period (compared to a 6-month follow-up in earlier trials) in a patient population with specific characteristics shown to be associated with higher rate of VMA resolution. As part of the larger OASIS trial, a full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) substudy was initiated. The purpose of the substudy was to specifically investigate a possible association between amplitude reductions in ffERG recordings (hereafter referred to as ERG reductions) and both VMA resolution and changes in visual acuity with respect to ocriplasmin treatment. The substudy was also to assess whether ERG reductions represented relevant clinical events.</p><p>Electroretinograms were not regularly obtained in the ocriplasmin clinical trial program, making the incidence of ERG reductions after ocriplasmin treatment in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials difficult to calculate.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In early Phase 2 trials (TG-MV-001 [NCT00123279] and TG-MV-002 [NCT00412451]), nine of the collective 98 patients exposed to ocriplasmin were reported to have ERG reductions.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, for these trials, there was no standardized ERG technology for the type of instruments used across the sites, no certification was required, and no central reading center (CRC) was involved for the ERG recording. In addition, most recordings from TG-MV-001 were obtained after vitrectomy. These cases were not reported as adverse events (AEs), but were evaluated by the FDA during the market authorization process.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> No safety signal was associated with treatment-related reductions in ERG amplitude.</p><p>In subsequent clinical trials, 10 cases of ERG reductions were reported (9 cases from TG-MV-008 [Phase 2]; 1 case from TG-MV-007 [Phase 3]). The noted ERG reductions included decreases in the a- and b-wave amplitudes, but no responses were isoelectric.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Beyond the clinical trials, abnormal ERG events related to ocriplasmin have been continually monitored from postmarketing sources. As of October 16, 2015, there have been 29 cases of retinogram abnormal event reported from various postmarketing sources per 23,330 vials of ocriplasmin distributed, representing a cumulative reporting rate of 1.25 per 1,000 doses. The low postmarketing frequency could be due to ERG recordings not being typically collected in a clinical setting.</p><p>In the past several years, individual case reports have also been published on abnormal ERG readings in certain patients after ocriplasmin treatment.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In most cases, however, failure to obtain an ERG recording before ocriplasmin injection confounds the interpretation of these results. Without a baseline value, it is not possible to determine whether an ERG abnormality was present prior to ocriplasmin treatment or was due to nonspecific effects of the drug. In addition, ERG recordings can exhibit wide variation;<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> therefore, only reductions of &#x02265;40% are considered abnormal and clinically significant for the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) protocol,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and by the FDA, which uses the ISCEV guidelines.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, baseline ERG recordings have not been previously systematically examined in patients with VMA. The purpose of the ERG substudy was to provide standardized analyses not possible with individual case reports, as part of a larger prospective, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. This standardization included use of the same type of instrument and recording protocol, as well as certification of instruments and personnel and a masked CRC. In addition, the ERG substudy offered other benefits over case reports, such as baseline recordings, a patient population studied concurrently, a long-term follow-up period, and determination of possible associations of ffERG reductions with both anatomic (i.e., VMA resolution on optical coherence tomography) and functional assessments (i.e., visual acuity).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><p>The OASIS study (TG-MV-014, NCT01429441) was a Phase 3b, randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial designed to further evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ocriplasmin in subjects with symptomatic VMA/VMT. Subjects were randomized to receive either a single intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin 0.125 mg or sham treatment. Full details of the OASIS trial methods and results are to be published elsewhere.</p><p>As part of the larger study, an ERG substudy was initiated involving a subset of the clinical study sites. The goal of the substudy was to explore the relationship between ffERG and both VMA resolution and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline through Month 24. A total of 62 subjects from the OASIS study (N = 220) were enrolled in the ERG substudy (41 of 146 [28.1%] ocriplasmin, 21 of 74 [28.4%] sham). One subject in the ocriplasmin group had a baseline but no postinjection ERG assessment and therefore was not included in the ERG subset.</p><p>There were 12 study visits performed as follows: baseline, Day 0 (injection day), Day 7 (&#x000b1;2 days), Day 28 (&#x000b1;3 days), Month 3 (&#x000b1;7 days), and every 3 months (&#x000b1;14 days) thereafter until Month 24. Full-field ERGs were performed in both eyes at each visit, including the baseline visit, with the exception of the injection day visit.</p><p>Full-field ERG assessments were performed by certified study personnel at selected sites. In total, six sites were certified to perform the ERG evaluations. The Espion E<sup>2</sup> console and a full-field ColorDome (Diagnosys LLC, Lowell, MA) were used following a standard setup at each of these sites for the ffERG assessment. Full-field ERGs were completed only in subjects enrolled in the substudy. The recordings were evaluated by the masked CRC for ERGs.</p><p>For the ERG procedure, the ISCEV protocol was followed. The eyes were dark adapted and the pupils dilated with standard dilating drops at the site before recording. Recordings were obtained with a Dawson Trick Litzkow fiber electrode on the surface of the eye along the lower eyelid, in contact with the tear film and cul de sac.</p><p>&#x0201c;Expert-defined ERG reductions&#x0201d; were specified as those ffERG reductions from baseline that were considered relevant by the masked ERG expert assessor based on the ffERG responses only, without consideration of any other visual function, and were identified before unmasking. The judgment to determine the presence of a relevant ERG reduction for a subject at a visit was based on the number and combination of the responses at the visit that were reduced by &#x02265;40%. The threshold for significant reduction (with 95% confidence interval) is fairly similar among ISCEV standard responses.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For a decrease in amplitude at 95% confidence interval, the threshold for the rod response has been reported as 40% (for patients with retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or 41% (for patients without diffuse photoreceptor cell disease).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The comparable threshold for a decrease in light-adapted 30 Hz flicker amplitude has been reported as 35%,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> 37%,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or 52%.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Thus, considering a 40% average reduction in amplitude across the ISCEV standard responses as meaningful is reasonable based on the literature. Only reductions &#x02265;40% are considered abnormal by the ISCEV.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The FDA also uses this level as a guideline.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The reductions occurring just after injection (Day 7 or Day 28 visits) were of particular interest due to a possible association with treatment and are referred to as &#x0201c;acute expert-defined ERG reductions.&#x0201d; All descriptions of ERG reductions in the article are considered acute and &#x0201c;expert-defined&#x0201d; and will be hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;ERG reductions.&#x0201d; Change from baseline in rod response, combined rod&#x02013;cone response a-wave, combined rod&#x02013;cone response b-wave, cone response, 30 Hz flicker, and combined rod&#x02013;cone response peak-to-peak amplitude were assessed throughout the study. The assessment of the ERG reductions was based mainly on the change from baseline in amplitude, although prolonged implicit times and shifts in implicit times from baseline were also part of the evaluation.</p><p>After unmasking, associations between ERG measurements and visual function measurements were examined, including BCVA, Amsler grid evaluation, Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score, Roth 28-hue color vision assessment, and the National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ). Analyses for associations between ERG measurements and anatomical measurements were performed, including central retinal thickness, ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the central 1 mm cube, external limiting membrane in the central 1 mm cube, subretinal fluid, and photoreceptor area and thickness measurements.</p><p>The ERG subset was the set of all subjects who were enrolled at selected sites, and for whom measurements of ffERG were available pre- and post-injection. Analyses were based on actual treatment received. No formal statistical testing was performed. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables included number of subjects with available data, mean and SD, and where appropriate, median. Categorical data were summarized based on counts, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals for the proportion (Clopper&#x02013;Pearson method), where appropriate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographics and Baseline Ocular Characteristics</title><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics for subjects in the ERG subset are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Because prospective ERG recordings are not typically performed clinically, only 1 case report has been published to date with baseline ERGs for comparison to ERGs taken in response to visual symptoms associated with ocriplasmin treatment.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The prospective nature of the ERG substudy allowed for standardization and comparison of changes to baseline&#x02014;analyses not possible with retrospective cases.</p><p>A total of 40% of the subjects treated with ocriplasmin experienced ERG reductions. In addition, 20% of overall subjects who were part of both treatment groups presented with abnormal ERGs at baseline, suggesting in both cases a panretinal phenomenon in these eyes. Both a- and b-waves were affected. The relatively high number of subjects with abnormal baseline ERGs underscores the need for pretreatment recordings. Only three subjects had ERG reductions that did not resolve by study end. Despite this, only one of these subjects experienced a loss of visual acuity (this subject also required multiple surgeries related to macular hole closure and cataract removal).</p><p>The ERG substudy evaluated pharmacological VMA release at Day 28, the primary end point of the OASIS trial and the earlier pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In the ocriplasmin group, ERG reductions were present more often in eyes that achieved VMA release compared to those without (68.8% vs. 37.5%, respectively). Another purpose of the substudy was to determine a possible association between BCVA and ffERGs after ocriplasmin treatment. The ocriplasmin-treated group that had ERG reductions showed greater visual improvement (difference in mean BCVA) compared to those without ERG reductions, with the difference between the two groups being 6.7 letters by study end.</p><p>These results indicate that ERG reductions after ocriplasmin treatment were more prevalent in eyes with successful VMA release and were not associated with a long-term decrease in visual acuity. This latter finding was not unexpected because ffERGs do not correlate with central visual function and are a more global assessment of photoreceptor function. The transient ERG reductions and decreased BCVA after treatment with ocriplasmin may be a consequence of successful release and paradoxically could suggest a favorable long-term BCVA outcome. Short-term assessments of ERGs and BCVA, as typically presented in individual case reports, do not reflect the ultimate visual acuity outcome of treatment with ocriplasmin over a longer period. The results of this substudy indicate that published reports of short-term results will be more fully informed by long-term outcomes.</p><p>Because abnormal ERGs have been reported after ocriplasmin treatment, ocriplasmin has been hypothesized to have an effect on the photoreceptor layer of the retina in some patients. The mechanism of action has been postulated to be either a mechanical effect related to VMA and its release or nonspecific proteinase activity of ocriplasmin beyond its known activity of cleaving fibronectin, laminin, and collagen in the vitreous and vitreoretinal interface. In particular, cleavage of laminin in multiple retinal layers has been proposed,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> using animal studies to support the latter hypothesis.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Ocriplasmin injection has been compared to the phenotypes observed in laminin B2-chain-deficient mice,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> which show abnormal outer segment elongation and abnormal ERGs.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In particular, digestion of laminin in the outer plexiform layer, where it localizes to synapses between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, would be expected to specifically affect the signaling between these neurons that would be revealed in ERG b-wave amplitudes. However, in the OASIS ERG substudy, no clear trends could be observed between ERG amplitudes and subjects with intact and incomplete EZ, and therefore no clear link between intact or incomplete sites of the EZ and ERG reductions could be established. Direct comparisons to the laminin knockout mouse are of limited value because these mice genetically lack laminin pre- and post-natally and therefore display multiple developmental phenotypes that are unrelated to acute ocriplasmin effects on mature retinal structures.</p><p>A more direct comparison can be made with an animal model of ocriplasmin injection.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A rabbit model showing that ocriplasmin temporarily suppresses ERGs<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> has been cited as evidence of nonspecific degradation of laminin.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, the authors of the study demonstrated that a- and b-wave amplitudes recovered by 14 days after injection and were indistinguishable from controls and concluded that ocriplasmin injection induced no ERG or retinal ultrastructural changes.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Furthermore, laminins are heterotrimeric protein complexes with up to 15 different isoforms comprising various alpha, beta, and gamma chain combinations<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> that are unlikely to be equally susceptible to ocriplasmin digestion.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In addition, these isoforms are differentially expressed throughout human development as well as in different retinal tissues,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and among different species, making animal models of laminin digestion difficult to extrapolate to humans.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Moreover, diffusion of a small molecule (27 kDa) with nonspecific enzymatic activity into multiple retinal layers would be expected to affect most or all ocriplasmin-treated patients because all patients would have heterotrimeric complexes comprised of the same laminin chain configurations in each retinal layer. However, only 40% of subjects in the ocriplasmin group reported an episode of ERG reductions, and such changes were also present in approximately 5% of the nonstudy eyes and those of sham subjects. It is possible that if there is an adverse effect of ocriplasmin on the retina, it is not clinically relevant since as in Subject 1 visual acuity increased as did VFQ scores, indicating that foveal function was partially spared despite the ERG reductions.</p><p>A mechanical model has been proposed as an alternative to the toxicity model. The mechanical model suggests that ERG reductions could result from vitreomacular tractional forces that may be panretinal in some patients, and that release of vitreomacular forces perturbs ERG function, which in most cases resolves. Notably, isoelectric ERGs occurred after VMA release. Such a panretinal phenomenon may be the consequence of a generalized retinal abnormality that impacts the vitreoretinal interface and that may predispose some patients to loss of retinal function after manipulation of the retina. Consistent with this hypothesis are the 20% of subjects in the substudy who showed abnormal ERGs at baseline, which are unrelated to ocriplasmin treatment. Only two of six with abnormal ERGs at baseline experienced ERG reductions after ocriplasmin treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, a slightly higher percentage of subjects experiencing ERG reductions had likely/definitive sites of incomplete foveal EZ and subretinal fluid at baseline compared to those without ERG reductions. Although speculative, this is consistent with the possibility that chronic traction distorts current flow in photoreceptor outer segments by producing disruptions in the EZ.</p><p>In addition, more subjects with ERG reductions had thin central retinas at baseline compared to subjects without ERG reductions. This observation is at least consistent with a mechanical effect, as a thinner retina could potentially result in relatively larger disruption of electrical signaling due to tractional and other forces compared with abnormally thick retinas (however, only the central subfield [1 mm] was measured in OASIS and therefore is the only region directly observed). More studies will be needed to confirm or exclude this model.</p><p>Although multiple baseline characteristics slightly differed in subjects with and without ERG reductions, including EZ changes, subretinal fluid, and retinal thickness, none of these can currently be used as predictors for the type of subject that is likely to experience ERG reductions.</p><p>Another aspect that has been underinvestigated is the effect of vitrectomy on ERG responses. A small study performed by Tari et al<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> showed that eight of 10 patients with internal limiting membrane peeling for the treatment of macular pucker showed slightly decreased responses in multifocal ERG at 3 months postoperatively. Another study showed a significant decrease in focal macular ERG b-wave amplitudes in subjects with internal limiting membrane peeling during vitrectomy compared to those with intact internal limiting membrane 6 months after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although these could be reflecting focal macular pathology, it is possible that a more global effect is present and further study of the effect of vitrectomy on full-field ERG is needed.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the small sample size. In addition, the baseline ocular characteristics between the treatment groups were not always equivalent; for instance, the percentage of subjects with a time to VMA diagnosis longer than 12 months was higher in the ocriplasmin group, and the ocriplasmin group had more small versus midsize macular holes compared with the sham group.</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest that a mechanical effect of VMA and release through ocriplasmin may be the cause of ERG reductions rather than nonspecific enzymatic reactions. To date, no clinical trial has been conducted that provides results in support of nonspecific laminin digestion. Enzymatic vitreolysis with ocriplasmin may be associated with &#x0201c;trampoline-like&#x0201d; forces on the middle and outer retinal layers. Acute vitreous release in and of itself can produce traumatic damage to the retina, i.e., evident by both optical coherence tomography and ERG. In this regard, enzymatic vitreolysis through ocriplasmin may be similar to commotio retinae, a condition wherein the vitreous exerts forces on the retina, including the photoreceptor layer, after ocular trauma.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This may cause transient injury not only because of the acute release but also the hydraulic forces transmitted posteriorly. As demonstrated in a recent case report, mfERG recordings can parallel the disruption of the EZ and recover as the EZ improves.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>The results of the substudy show that acute ERG reductions may be an indicator of VMA resolution, but the acute ERG reductions occurring in a proportion of patients suggest that there may be an effect of ocriplasmin on retinal photoreceptors. However, the clinical significance remains unknown, as ERG reductions did not reflect clinically significant events. Although sensitive, ERGs represent a nonspecific diagnostic tool that can be influenced by multiple factors such as the duration and intensity of the photostimulation and the method of recording. Typically, ERG reductions are associated with diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, which do not resolve. Few if any prospective studies have been performed showing resolution of ERG reductions, underscoring the importance of these findings. The ERG substudy provides the most comprehensive and standardized analysis to date of ffERG data before and after ocriplasmin injection together with visual function and anatomical measurements. Several additional long-term studies, including the full results from the OASIS trial, will further assess the efficacy and safety of ocriplasmin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Meridius Health Communications, Inc, provided technical support in preparation of the manuscript.
