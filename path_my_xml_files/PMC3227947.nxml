However, resistance invariably develops, leading to disease relapse. Endocrine therapy&#x02013;induced upregulation of signaling pathways of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptors&#x02014;ErbB-1 (EGFR) and ErbB-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor [HER]-2)&#x02014;and enhanced ER-mediated transcription, which lead to a more aggressive phenotype, are key adaptive changes associated with estrogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Just as estrogen deprivation is the cornerstone of treatment for ER<sup>+</sup> postmenopausal breast cancer, anti-HER-2 therapy is the treatment of choice for HER-2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. Dramatic clinical success is achieved when the HER-2 signaling pathway is blocked in women with breast cancer that overexpresses HER-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Approximately 50% of HER-2<sup>+</sup> breast cancers are hormone receptor (HR)<sup>+</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and HER-2 positivity is considered a marker of estrogen resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, dual treatment for tumors that overexpress both receptors is a logical approach. A randomized trial was conducted in women with HR<sup>+</sup> and HER-2<sup>+</sup> metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to determine the impact of combined treatment with the anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole versus anastrozole alone. The combination was associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) duration of 4.8 months, versus 2.4 months for anastrozole alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other clinical research also supports the role of combination treatment with HER-2 inhibitors and endocrine blockade in HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Synergy has been demonstrated with the combination of tamoxifen and lapatinib in models of endocrine resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A phase I study demonstrated no pharmacokinetic interactions between lapatinib and the aromatase inhibitor letrozole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To further examine the role of estrogen deprivation plus anti-HER-2 therapy, we compared first-line therapy using letrozole plus placebo with letrozole plus lapatinib in a phase III study conducted in postmenopausal women with HR<sup>+</sup> MBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Full results of this phase III study have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Results are presented here for enrolled women whose primary or metastatic tumor was also HER-2<sup>+</sup>. A HER-2<sup>+</sup> tumor was defined as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)<sup>+</sup> (ratio &#x0003e;2), 3+ staining intensity by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ staining intensity by IHC and FISH<sup>+</sup>, as described previously for methods performed in a commercial laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Prior therapy for advanced or metastatic disease was prohibited, but prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, antiestrogens, and radiotherapy were allowed. Adjuvant aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab were permitted if discontinued at least 1 year prior to study entry. A good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status score of 0&#x02013;1) and normal organ function were required, with cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal. Extensive symptomatic visceral disease and current or past central nervous system metastases were causes for exclusion. Enrollment required archived tumor tissue for use in biomarker analyses.</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from appropriate local ethics committees and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. All patients signed informed consent documents before enrollment in the study. This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase III study with stratification by interval since completion of prior adjuvant antiestrogen therapy (at least 6 months or no prior therapy versus &#x0003c;6 months) and location of metastatic sites (soft tissue or visceral versus bone-only disease). Measurable disease was not required at study entry. Eligible patients were randomized to once-daily oral treatment with letrozole (2.5 mg) plus lapatinib (1,500 mg) or to the same dose of letrozole plus a matching lapatinib placebo. Lapatinib dosage adjustments were made in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;approved lapatinib prescribing information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. No dosage adjustments were allowed for letrozole. Patients were continued on the assigned treatment until disease progression or withdrawal from study and were not permitted to cross over to the alternate treatment in the event of disease progression. Permanent withdrawal from study treatment was required for unacceptable toxicity or grade 3 or 4 interstitial pneumonitis, hepatoxicity, or cardiac dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS in the HER-2<sup>+</sup> population determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The PFS time was defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression or death resulting from any cause. The overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS) time, and safety were secondary endpoints. The CBR was defined as a confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least 6 months.</p><p>Initially, toxicity was assessed every 4 weeks according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0), and cardiac function was assessed every 8 weeks. Beginning week 108, toxicities and cardiac function were assessed every 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed every 12 weeks and at the time of study treatment withdrawal, after which patients were followed only for survival.</p><p>The primary endpoint of PFS in the HER-2<sup>+</sup> population was powered at 80% to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.645 with an &#x003b1; of 0.05 with 173 events. PFS and OS were summarized using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, with the stratified log-rank test used for comparisons between treatment arms. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the prognostic significance of PFS for the known prognostic baseline characteristics after retaining treatment and stratification factors: age, ECOG performance status score (0 or &#x02265;1), number of metastatic sites, site of disease (bone only or visceral and soft tissue), interval since prior chemotherapy, interval since prior adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, disease-free interval, and serum HER-2 (extracellular domain [ECD]) at baseline (&#x0003c;15 ng/ml versus &#x02265;15 ng/ml). The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method with stratified log rank was used to retrospectively analyze investigator-assessed PFS in subpopulations within the HER-2<sup>+</sup> cohort to compare treatment arms within each subpopulation: patients without bone as the only site of metastasis, age, presence or absence of liver metastasis, number of metastatic sites, ECOG performance status, and prior hormonal therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>R<sc>esults</sc></title><p>In total, 1,286 HR<sup>+</sup> patients were enrolled, of whom 219 had HR<sup>+</sup> HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of these 219 patients, 111 were randomized to the letrozole plus lapatinib arm and 108 were in the letrozole plus placebo arm. Baseline disease and patient characteristics were well balanced between arms. Most patients had stage IV disease and visceral or soft tissue metastases.

An association between tumor HER-2 positivity and lack of response to endocrine therapy has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The role of growth factors in estrogen resistance was established in human breast cancer cells, whereby inhibition of crosstalk between ER and HER-2 restored the estrogen responsiveness of ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, preclinical data suggest that EGFR/HER-2 targeted therapy combined with endocrine deprivation delays the development of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we applied our understanding of the mechanism of resistance to endocrine-deprivation therapy to the development of a combination regimen that addresses the roles of excess hormones, hormone resistance, and HER-2 overexpression in postmenopausal women with MBC.</p><p>Lapatinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER-2 and has not been associated with significant symptomatic cardiotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We combined lapatinib with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, which has been shown to have favorable clinical efficacy, compared with tamoxifen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The addition of lapatinib to letrozole as first-line therapy in postmenopausal women with HR<sup>+</sup> HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC led to a significantly lower risk for disease progression and longer PFS time, 8.2 months versus 3.0 months, as well as a higher ORR and CBR. These results are consistent with the findings in a similar population in which anastrozole alone was compared with anastrozole plus trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Likewise, benefit for the combination of lapatinib and letrozole compared with letrozole alone was seen in all known prognostic factor subpopulations, including patients who were resistant to prior endocrine therapy (i.e., relapsed on or within 6 months of adjuvant tamoxifen), and those with liver metastases or more than three sites of metastatic disease. This suggests, therefore, that dual treatment for suitable patients with tumors that overexpress both HR and HER-2 is a logical approach.</p></sec><sec><title>C<sc>onclusions</sc></title><p>Women with HR<sup>+</sup> HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC achieved a statistically significant 29% lower risk for disease progression when treated with letrozole plus lapatinib than with letrozole alone. The combination targeted therapy was well tolerated, with primarily grade 1 and 2 toxicities. These data support the use of letrozole plus lapatinib for first-line therapy of patients with HR<sup>+</sup> HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC. This trial further confirms that sustained HER-2 inhibition provides benefit in patients with HER-2<sup>+</sup> MBC. Moreover, the addition of an oral lapatinib therapy provides a convenient option for women who receive oral endocrine therapy for an extended time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>cknowledgments</sc></title><p>We would like to acknowledge the women who participated in this study, the investigators and their staff, members of the independent data monitoring committee, Tim Kelly from GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis Oncology, and The Phillips Group for technical assistance in preparation of the manuscript.</p><p>This research was sponsored and funded by GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>Portions of these data have been published in Johnston et al.
