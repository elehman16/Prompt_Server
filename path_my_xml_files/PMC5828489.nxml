In Ireland however, this shift has been more recent with ongoing reforms since 2012 and a concomitant move toward active labour market &#x02018;work-first&#x02019; policy design (i.e. whereby unemployed people are compulsorily required to work in return for their social welfare benefits). Labour market policies vary from those that require this compulsory approach to those which enable the unemployed to move towards sustainable quality work in the labour market through upskilling (human capital approach). Despite this, however, long-term unemployment&#x02014;a major cause of poverty and social exclusion&#x02014;remains high, while current employment support approaches aimed at sustainable re-employment are, arguably, unevaluated and under examined. This study examines the effectiveness of a new high support career guidance intervention in terms of its impact on aspects of wellbeing, perceived employability and enhancing career sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">The study involves a single-centre randomised, controlled, partially blinded trial. A total of 140 long-term unemployed job-seekers from a disadvantaged urban area will be randomly assigned to two groups: (1) an intervention group; and (2) a &#x02018;service as usual&#x02019; group. Each group will be followed up immediately post intervention and six months later. The primary outcome is wellbeing at post intervention and at six-month follow-up. The secondary outcome is perceived employability, which includes a number of different facets including self-esteem, hopefulness, resilience and career self-efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The study aims to assess the changes in, for example, psychological wellbeing, career efficacy and hopefulness, that occur as a result of participation in a high support intervention vs routinely available support. The results will help to inform policy and practice by indicating whether a therapeutic approach to job-seeking support is more effective for long-term unemployed job-seekers than routinely available (and less therapeutic) support. The findings will also be important in understanding what works and for whom with regard to potentially undoing the negative psychological impacts of unemployment, building psychological capital and employability within the individual, and developing career trajectories leading to more sustainable employment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16801028">ISRCTN16801028</ext-link>.

In 2015, global unemployment stood at 197.1 million, a 27 million increase on the pre-crisis level of 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In fact, across countries and over time, levels of unemployment vary considerably, with current unemployment rates in the OECD as low as 3.1% in Japan (2016) and as high as 24.9% in Greece (2015), and with even higher rates recorded in the emerging and developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the case of Ireland, the unemployment rate over the last three decades has been described as a &#x02018;roller-coaster ride&#x02019; culminating in a sharp rise of 15.1% in 2012, from a low of 4.4% in 2006, and a continuous decrease since, illustrating the variability within countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Thus, government reaction to fluctuating levels of unemployment is important in terms of supporting the unemployed, not only in helping them to re-access the labour market, but also to become resilient in times of high unemployment. Policy responses to unemployment are generally implemented through LMPs, which can differ across countries, but tend to encompass a variety of similar regulative measures that influence the interaction between labour supply and demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], while also addressing imbalances in, for instance, long-term unemployment, income support, skills shortages, discrimination towards &#x02018;disadvantaged&#x02019; labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and ultimately ensuring efficient labour market functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These policies are important in that they are broadly designed to assist the unemployed and those facing barriers to employment to access the labour market.</p><p id="Par27">At the same time, there is considerable epidemiological research suggesting that unemployment can have much deeper impacts than just the loss of manifest benefits of employment (i.e. financial remuneration), with evidence of impacts on both physical and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, many unemployed job-seekers experience decreased wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], high levels of psychological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], low self-esteem and job search self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which can act as barriers to returning to work due to low levels of motivation and attendant ineffective job-seeking strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, many people who become unemployed are at increased risk of developing stress-related disorders or psychological distress which can distance them from the labour market and increase their likelihood of becoming long-term unemployed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, interventions aimed at re-employment tend to concentrate on increasing human capital through work experience and skills training, subsidised and direct employment, and intensifying job search behaviour, with the expected outcome being improved labour market access. Given the compelling evidence for the negative impacts of unemployment on mental health and wellbeing, it is imperative that policy responses to labour market detachment include interventions that help alleviate these adverse impacts and maintain good mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">LMPs which seek to support unemployed people are often defined as &#x02018;active&#x02019; or &#x02018;passive&#x02019;; the latter focuses on income replacement and the welfare of the unemployed, without improving their labour market access. Active labour market policies, on the other hand, include labour market integration measures which aim to improve the employment prospects and wage outcomes for those who have difficulty accessing the labour market such as the unemployed or those threatened by unemployment. Increasingly, governments are using a so-called activation approach in LMP design, where benefit rules and employment or training services are shaped with a view to moving unemployed income benefit recipients into work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In recent decades this approach has emerged in public policy design in North America, Australia and Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed, according to Martin (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], activation policies have become a buzzword in LMP with a global movement towards a more regulatory form of welfare whereby established welfare rights become more conditional on job-seeking efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite its popularity, there remains ambiguity around activation in terms of what it means for policy and practice, with much of this uncertainty arising from how it has been implemented in various countries and under a variety of labels (i.e. workfare, work-first, labour market activation, welfare to work) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">This variation in activation policies across the developed world lies mainly in the intensity of their regulation. Some countries for example, the UK and the US implement a &#x02018;work-first&#x02019; approach whereby the unemployed are required to work for their unemployment welfare. In contrast, countries such as Denmark and the Nordic states employ a &#x02018;human capital&#x02019; approach which aims to enable access to more sustainable quality work in the labour market. Interestingly, job quality has been included in the OECD&#x02019;s wellbeing framework and identified as a key component of individual wellbeing and a means to better economic performance. Having a job is crucial for our wellbeing, but the quality of that job and its impact on our lives is also important and has been found to be associated with both mental and physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Research in Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found that using negative incentives in activation-focused LMP (ALMP) led to lower quality post-unemployment jobs, both in terms of job duration and level of earnings. Studies have also shown that work of poor psychosocial quality can have long-term health impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which can be significantly worse than long-term unemployment itself. A recent systematic review found that people&#x02019;s perceptions of negative psychosocial factors in the workplace is related to their mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with harmful psychosocial job conditions such as low job security, low decision latitude, high psychological job demands and low co-worker support increasing the chance of mental health symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While activation has been shown to increase exits from unemployment, it is important that the aim of effective activation regimes should be to help people access quality jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Relative to many OECD countries, Ireland has been slow to follow suit in terms of active LMP and activation in particular. Interestingly, the recent economic crisis (2008&#x02013;2012), has driven a significant and unprecedented move in this direction. With the rapid rise in unemployment in the early years of the recession,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> the Irish government&#x02019;s policy was proving insufficient in responding to the needs of job-seekers. For example, it was described as &#x02018;under-examined, fragmented and lacking in ambition&#x02026; passive and low intensity in character &#x02026;&#x02019; (Sweeney 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In an attempt to contend with the overwhelming rise in unemployment, recent changes in LMP have prompted a shift from passive to active participation and the strengthening of conditionality with the unemployed now required to engage in job search and activation programmes in order to continue receiving social welfare support. This is comparable with the &#x02018;work-first&#x02019; approaches in the UK, Germany, the US, Australia and other European countries, many of which have been developing their activation strategies since the early 1990s. There are particular similarities between the Irish model and UK welfare reforms principally in relation to the re-design of welfare services (i.e. Jobcentre in the UK and the Intreo service in Ireland), the implementation of conditionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the sub-contracting of re-employment services to private providers on the basis of performance-related results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">This shift towards activation was achieved through the implementation of the Irish Government&#x02019;s LMP, &#x02018;<italic>Pathways to Work&#x02019;</italic> (Department of Social Protection [DSP], 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016&#x02013;2020) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which has been precipitous, and despite an explicit focus on long-term unemployment, there is little evidence of targeted approaches which acknowledge long-term unemployment and/or its impact on psychological wellbeing. Although the policy refers throughout to prioritising and adequately supporting vulnerable groups including the young unemployed and long-term unemployed through the provision of activation services, the response in terms of application is increased frequency of engagement (i.e. one meeting with a case officer per month). Thus, while this new policy is widely considered to be a success in terms of reducing unemployment by the Irish Government [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and in public discourse through the obvious decline in unemployment (15.1% in 2012 to 7.1%, Q4 2016), nothing is known about its impact on the wellbeing and sustainable re-employment of job-seekers in quality jobs and, in particular, the long-term unemployed. This is an important knowledge gap in view of the extensive literature linking unemployment to poor mental health and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], considerable evidence indicates that unemployed people are more likely to experience: anxiety, loss of confidence, low self-esteem, loss of motivation, suicidal ideation, low levels of coping, psychosomatic problems, poor cognitive performance, behavioural problems and paranoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">While there is little evidence of the effectiveness of such programmes, there is much political interest in using ALMPs as a means of reducing levels of unemployment. One of the most cost-effective ALMP are &#x02018;job search and assistance&#x02019; interventions which comprise measures aimed at improving job search efficiency such as job search courses, job clubs and intensified counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Other components include monitoring and sanctions, which aim to incentivise job-seekers to actively seek work and exit the benefit system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of ALMPs remains unclear, despite many experimental evaluations (e.g. randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and micro econometric impact evaluations); while these are a useful starting point, there is a need to examine programmes more closely in order to understand why they work for some and not for others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Evaluations of ALMPs are mostly conducted using gold standard econometric impact evaluations and RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The effectiveness of these interventions is based on their impact on the re-employment of the job-seeker rather than the changes which take place within the individual (e.g. increased employability/improved wellbeing) that, in turn, enable and support re-employment. For instance, labour economists have provided evidence for the effectiveness of the various types of ALMPs available to job-seekers and how they might be used to reduce unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This evidence suggests that some interventions can have a positive effect on re-employment. For example, Card et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] found that job search assistance programmes were most likely to have positive impacts in the short term, with labour market training programmes impacting positively in the longer term. Interventions such as counselling and training were also found to increase transition rates for the unemployed into employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, other findings are mixed where such interventions have been found to be unsuccessful or with little or no impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In one of the most influential meta-analyses of ALMP evaluations, Martin and Grubb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] found that many ALMP programmes were ineffective or often counterproductive in assisting the unemployed to regain access to the labour market. For example, subsidised public sector employment programmes fared least well in terms of impact and improved access to the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Conversely, however, Kluve et al. found that there may be potential gains from matching participants and programme types, suggesting that programmes may work better for some than for others, depending on their labour market needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Current evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggests that there is no &#x02018;one-size-fits-all&#x02019; ALMP which can improve employability, but rather that a shift towards a more tailor-made or individualised approach in practice may be more effective. Interventions targeted at an individual&#x02019;s needs, such as training and counselling, have been shown to have positive effects on wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similarly, evaluations of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)-based employment programmes such as the &#x02018;CHOICES for Well-being&#x02019; project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] showed improvements in the mental health, self-esteem and job-search self-efficacy of participants, as well as a reduction in the occurrence of negative automatic thoughts and employment progression for some participants. Improvements also persisted at three-month follow-up. In a recent systematic review of interventions aimed at reducing the impact of unemployment on mental health, Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that short one- to two-week job club-type interventions can reduce the risk of depression for up to two years, with the largest impacts seen in those who re-accessed the labour market. However, they found mixed evidence for CBT interventions, with only short-term effects on depression symptoms and re-employment in a trial with a longer (seven-week) CBT intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and no effects in a shorter (two-day) intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The question of whether such interventions could be implemented to support the unemployed in overcoming the negative psychological impacts of unemployment remains unanswered. Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] conclude that more high-quality RCTs which follow established guidelines (e.g. CONSORT, SPIRIT) are needed to provide evidence of the effects on mental health, of interventions which could potentially be implemented to support the unemployed.</p><p id="Par36">Psychologists and other social scientists have made important contributions towards understanding the impact of unemployment on an individual in terms of wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and the loss of the latent and manifest benefits of work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, very little is known about the effectiveness of activation as a policy approach, and the impact of ALMPs, in potentially undoing the negative psychological impacts of unemployment and building psychological capital and employability within the individual. Theories of employability, such as the model proposed by Fugate et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], define employability as a person-centred psychosocial construct and something separate from the environment thereby providing the individual with the opportunity to identify their strengths and weaknesses in terms of personal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This is particularly important given the rapidly changing labour market, with its lack of security and increasing demand for flexibility within the workforce.</p><p id="Par37">In the case of the long-term unemployed, many have low or obsolete skills, which leaves them vulnerable to the risk of social exclusion and lifetime unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, the negative impact of unemployment on psychological wellbeing has been found to worsen during the first year of unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; thus, for job-seekers who have been out of the labour market for longer periods of time, the problems they encounter may overshadow their skills and abilities and can pose a significant barrier in terms of their ability to reconnect with the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Arguably, therefore, interventions designed for the long-term unemployed should aim to enable a change in the job-seeker&#x02019;s career trajectory and assist them to access sustainable jobs rather than short-term precarious work where, after a few months, they may become unemployed once more. Yet the work-first approach assumes that any job is better than no job, reinforcing the sustainability of low-paid precarious work in the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Thus, it is important to investigate empirically whether long-term unemployed clients who receive needs-based individualised services become more employable by means of receiving a range of supports that focus on promoting greater self-awareness, improving wellbeing, increasing hopefulness for the future, and enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy. For example, the most recent version of the Irish Pathways to Work 2016&#x02013;2020 policy introduced a new strand called <italic>Building Workforce Skills</italic> which aims, through cooperation with the education and training sectors, to continuously develop the labour force and to provide job-seekers with the opportunities to develop the skills and competencies required to access and sustain employment.</p><p id="Par39">As the Pathways to Work activation model is a recently established approach, no previous evaluations or comparable studies have been undertaken. However, a number of RCTs and pre&#x02013;post comparisons have been conducted in other countries (e.g. Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]) in order to assess the effectiveness of interventions on wellbeing and self-esteem in unemployed participants. These have included a variety of non-traditional employment-focused interventions including CBT, therapeutic training and individualised job search. However, there are few robust evaluations of <italic>non-traditional</italic> interventions targeted at individuals, their wellbeing and employability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This provided the impetus for the present study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The current study: objectives</title><p id="Par40">The principal aim of this study (called &#x02018;EEPIC&#x02019;) is to assess the impact of a newly developed therapeutic career guidance intervention&#x02014;when compared to routinely available support&#x02014;on the psychological wellbeing (including hopefulness and resilience) and perceived employability of a sample of long-term unemployed job-seekers in a disadvantaged urban setting. The goal of the intervention is to support the unemployed in strengthening their wellbeing, build hopefulness, resilience and career self-efficacy in order to improve employability, and increase access to sustainable labour market opportunities.</p><p id="Par41">This new high support intervention uses a career/vocational guidance approach and aims to increase levels of psychological wellbeing when compared to current employment support services (Pathways to Work) provided to the long-term unemployed.

The NGO is situated within an urban area characterised by socioeconomic disadvantage and which has been classified as &#x02018;Very Disadvantaged&#x02019; by the All-Island HP Deprivation Index (2011). This classification is based on demographic profile, social class composition and labour market situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The unemployment rate for the area has remained consistently high since the 1980s and is approximately three times the national average, standing at circa 31% (based on CSO data, September 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participants and eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par44">Participants in this study are unemployed male and female adults aged 18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years who are in receipt of a job-seekers payment for a minimum of 12&#x000a0;months. In Ireland, unemployed people are paid either a Job Seeker&#x02019;s Allowance (JSA) or a Job Seeker&#x02019;s Benefit (JSB) weekly through the Department of Social Protection. JSB is paid for nine months and its recipients are people covered by social insurance (PRSI). When a person reaches the end of the nine-month period, or if they do not have enough PRSI contributions, they may be entitled to a JSA which is a means-tested payment. The majority of participants in this study will be in receipt of JSA in order to meet the 12-month unemployment criterion for entry into the trial. Some participants, however, will be in receipt of a Job Seeker Transition payment which is available to lone parents whose youngest child is aged 7&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years.</p><p id="Par45">Study participants are clients of the DSP&#x02019;s public employment service called <italic>Intreo</italic> which offers clients a single point of contact for all employment and income supports.

Identification of specific needs and their severity is vital in understanding the barriers faced by the individual and the types of supports and actions required to enable them to move towards the labour market. The outcome of the individual needs assessment determines the extent to which guidance practitioners may need to support the individual to engage with appropriate services to address issues which pose barriers to progression (e.g. addiction, literacy).

The GIS normally occurs within two weeks of a social welfare claim being made; however, due to the large number of job-seekers in Ireland who are currently long-term unemployed (100,600 individuals accounting for 56.1% of total unemployment [CSO, Q1 2016]), an accumulation of job-seekers in the Intreo system has resulted in job-seekers who have not yet attended a GIS.

This information will be entered into a database (IBM SPSS statistics version 22) on the researcher&#x02019;s encrypted laptop and backed up every week on a separate removable storage device (also encrypted) which is stored safely in the researcher&#x02019;s office. Data collected by practitioners will be gathered by the researcher post intervention and entered into the SPSS database for analysis.

Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the pre-treatment characteristics of participants. Baseline analysis will be conducted to establish the internal consistency of the outcome measure scales, where a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of above 0.7 will be required. Previous studies have reported Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas of at least 0.7 across all measures<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par96">The study will use a randomisation technique (the SNOSE [sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes] method as described by Doig and Simpson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]) which ensures that participants from both groups come from the same population. Pre-treatment analysis will be conducted on primary and secondary outcome measures to show, for example, levels of wellbeing (primary outcome) as indicated by GHQ-12 scores in comparison with appropriate established norms <italic>(e.g. national wellbeing data, HRB (2008))</italic> so as to indicate how job-seekers present for activation services.</p><p id="Par97">Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) will be used to investigate the effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcome measures (i.e. wellbeing and employability). Continuous outcome data, including the primary outcome measure of wellbeing and five of the eight secondary outcomes which have been shown to contribute to mental health and increased employability (i.e. resilience, career-efficacy, hopefulness, self-esteem, perceived progress towards the labour market) will be analysed using MMRM. Where parametric test assumptions fail significantly, then non-parametric tests will be used.</p><p id="Par98">MMRM will be used to investigate effects at two between (intervention and control) and three within (pre-intervention, post-intervention and six-month follow-up) levels. Initial MMRM analysis will control for age as a fixed co-variate, along with gender, and duration of unemployment or highest educational level, as applicable. Modelling for the primary outcome will be conducted using an unstructured repeated measures co-variance matrix and all other variables as fixed effects.</p><p id="Par99">MMRM was chosen as the main statistical method for analysis as it can reduce several analytic problems that may arise from the EEPIC study design. First, it has the advantage of modelling change within individuals as well as across groups, thus enabling the isolation of factors contributing to the outcome, such as, age, gender, duration of unemployment or highest educational level (common to both intervention and control condition). Second, it allows for different numbers of measurements per participant, thereby tolerating a level of missing data, which are a particular problem with RCTs as follow-up data are often collected many months after treatment has ended and participants may be difficult to contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. This enables us to use all of the data collected as opposed to deleting cases or imputing missing values. Third, it has the advantage of allowing for different time points for each individual, so data collected for one participant at month 4 can be tested alongside data collected for the next participant at month 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Singer and Willet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] identify this as the best approach for longitudinal data which has three or more time points.</p><p id="Par100">The analysis will follow an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle where all randomised participants, including those who stop receiving the intervention, will be analysed &#x02018;as randomised&#x02019;. MMRM analysis is a maximum likelihood statistical modelling technique whereby mean estimates and the repeated measures covariance structure for the observed data are based on a statistical model and possible values are generated for the missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Attrition will also be analysed to assess the differences between those who &#x02018;dropped out&#x02019; and those who stayed, and indeed if there are predictors at baseline to indicate same. MMRM will be used in the main, although t-tests will be employed to detail any significant differences found from the MMRM.</p><p id="Par101">In addition, descriptive statistical summaries (means, standard deviations, frequencies) will be presented for primary and secondary outcome measures at each time point (baseline, post intervention and six-month post intervention). Of most interest will be the identification of changes in primary and secondary outcome measures at group level between T0 (baseline) and T1, and T0 and T2, and between T1 and T2. Additional descriptive analysis (e.g. frequencies) of the re-employment (secondary) measure will be conducted to assess the differences between the two groups in terms of their re-employment outcomes.</p><p id="Par102">Sub-group MMRM analysis will be conducted to investigate if the intervention effects differ for certain participant groups, based on variables such as gender, age, education level and unemployment duration. T-tests and Chi-squared tests will be employed to identify mean differences and associations with regard to primary and secondary outcome measures.</p><p id="Par103">A full statistical analysis plan (SAP)&#x02014;in the form of a Trials (free) update&#x02014;will be provided once all data are gathered and before opening the database.

The researcher will have sole access to the data and will monitor it monthly to ensure that the quality of data is maintained throughout the trial. Furthermore, within the context of this trial, an interim analysis is not practicable as sufficient data may not be available at the interim point for analysis. However, the researcher through monitoring of the data will inform the NGO, should any issues arise with the data collection, the recruitment of participants or the implementation of the intervention. This is of particular importance due to the ongoing changes in LMP implementation in Ireland and its very real bearing on the trial progress. Nevertheless, the flexibility of the NGO will ensure that should any changes to the trial be required, they will within reason be facilitated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Harms</title><p id="Par105">There are some (minimal) risks envisaged in this study. From the researcher&#x02019;s experience of working with job-seekers, there can be a tendency for the client to disclose personal information that may not be sought within the interview/focus group and to express their own experiences, difficulties and barriers and expect that the researcher may be able to offer further assistance. In practice, this involves setting and recognising clear boundaries while still providing an open and supportive environment within which the participant can engage in the interview/questionnaire completion.</p><p id="Par106">Completion of the GHQ-12 may cause some minor distress, but the researcher is an experienced administrator of this measure and other similar questionnaires, as well as having well developed test administration skills. Close adherence to the British Psychological Society Code of Good Practice for Psychological Testing and the Psychological Society of Ireland Code of Ethics will also ensure that any risk will be managed according to best practice. If the client has a negative reaction to the administration of the questionnaires, a referral to an experienced guidance officer (i.e. the client&#x02019;s case worker) in the DSP/NGO and the primary healthcare team will be made. In addition, information on a range of support services will be given to the client.</p><p id="Par107">Other potential risks will be addressed by ensuring that there is appropriate local information pertaining to support services available. Such services include counselling services, addiction services, Local Employment Centre services and other community-based services. The researcher&#x02019;s own training as a psychologist and experience of working with numerous disadvantaged clients will also ensure that each participant is treated with respect and that any signs of distress will be appropriately identified and the participant referred immediately to a suitable service(s).</p><p id="Par108">Questionnaires will be administered in the NGO, which has, through its own Health and Safety policy, procedures in place regarding the safety of clients and staff.

Participants also receive a consent form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) which they are asked to sign; a copy is given to them to retain for their own records. The researcher also talks through both documents to ensure they are properly understood by the participants.

It is likely, therefore, that participants are capable of consenting to participation. However, assent is also sought on occasions where the researcher has concerns regarding the participant&#x02019;s understanding of the process. The researcher also talks through both the information sheet and the consent forms to ensure they are properly understood by the participant.</p><p id="Par114">As this study requires participation on more than one occasion, participants will be contacted before the follow-up assessment (post intervention and six-month follow-up) and continued consent will be sought before the follow-up study commences. Again, a copy of the consent form will be given to participants as soon as possible after consent has been obtained. If the participant does not wish to continue, they may withdraw at any time. Completion of the withdrawal slip which forms part of the information sheet will be requested for the researcher&#x02019;s records.

The information sheet and the informed consent form clearly indicate that there is no conditionality related to this study and that no penalties apply for non-participation. Furthermore, participants are informed that they may, at any time, contact the researcher should they have concerns regarding their participation.

The EEPIC trial is also one of a small number of international trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to incorporate a longer-term follow-up at six-month post intervention as a way of assessing the sustainability of any effects for a period after the intervention has concluded. This six-month post intervention phase is crucial as it is during this period that the career plan is implemented and the job-seeker independently engages in job search-related activities. Research on re-employment shows that self-regulation and effort are important in job-seeking and that individuals differ in their ability in this respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. For some job-seekers, discouragement, rejection and uncertainty may make the job-seeking process more difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, job search activities which are non-self-determined (i.e. carried out because of pressure to do so (as in the case of conditionality) as opposed to the individuals&#x02019; own volition), have been associated with procrastination which, in turn, has been linked with increased hopelessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In addition, the relationship between job search and mental health has been shown to be negative in the short term, although there is significant research confirming the positive relationship between mental health and re-employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], and therefore the role of job search behaviour in re-accessing the labour market. Therefore, the possible maintenance of positive wellbeing and employability during this six-month post-intervention phase could be fundamental to re-employment success.</p><p id="Par126">The trial design has a number of strengths. First, the location of the trial enables access to an existent group of long-term unemployed job-seekers who are in receipt of a Job Seekers payment and who are obligated, therefore, to participate in the Pathways to Work programme/service as usual. This ensures that all potential participants are eligible, meet the inclusion criteria and expect to receive, at a minimum, the service as usual. Second, the data manager performs the randomisation, thereby reducing potential selection bias and participants are assigned thereafter to the intervention or &#x02018;service as usual&#x02019; after baseline assessments have been completed. Participants are analysed &#x02018;as randomised&#x02019;, thereby maintaining participants in their allocated groups and further reducing any selection bias. Delivery of the intervention and &#x02018;service as usual&#x02019; with fidelity also aims to limit participants&#x02019; likelihood to avoid some aspects of the interventions. Third, all randomised participants will be included in the analysis as per the ITT principle. As detailed earlier, an advantage of the MMRM analysis is that it allows for different numbers of measurements for each participant, and uses all available data, thus minimising attrition bias. Lastly, the researcher (initially) and the participants are blinded thereby reducing potential bias in implementation of the services and in the performance of the participants.</p><p id="Par127">There are, however, also limitations to this study. First and foremost, the duration of intervention and control conditions will vary as individual needs differ. To allow for this, the extent of the intervention or control conditions will be documented in terms of the number of contact hours provided across the number of weeks of engagement with the service. These types of data could benefit the design of a model which promotes individualised approaches. Second, the NGO participating in the trial is implementing government policy, which could change at any time. The study is being conducted in a rapidly changing environment, where neither the NGO nor the researcher has the authority to reverse policy decisions. This leaves the trial vulnerable to external influences beyond our control.</p><p id="Par128">Nevertheless, the trial is unique in terms of its timing and its potential contribution towards effective engagement with the long-term unemployed in Irish labour market activation. If the results of the trial show that the positive psychological intervention is superior to the &#x02018;service as usual&#x02019; in terms of increases in employability-related outcomes, it will provide important evidence to support the further design and implementation of a more therapeutic approach to job-seeking support for long-term unemployed job-seekers. It may also provide a model of good practice that could be replicated elsewhere while also identifying key implementation &#x02018;lessons&#x02019; for similar services in other jurisdictions. For these reasons, a mini-process evaluation will be embedded within the trial, running in parallel with the study. A small number of participants, practitioners and managers of services will be invited to participate in a one-to-one interview, in order to capture their experiences of participating in the EEPIC intervention, both in terms of its content and implementation. This process evaluation will be important in terms of supplementing and amplifying the RCT findings by adding to our understanding as to whether the intervention works, how and why it works, and for whom and under what circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par129">The findings from this study will also help to inform future policy in terms of highlighting what is needed to develop an increasingly sustainable labour force.</p><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par130">The trial started in September 2016.
