Fifteen healthy volunteers wore a specific intraoral device for 48 h to form a biofilm in three glass disks. One of these disks was used as a baseline; another one was immersed in a solution of 0.2% Chlorhexidine (0.2% CHX), remaining the third in the device, placed in the oral cavity, during the 0.2% CHX mouthwash application.

These oral antiseptics may kill the microorganisms, reduce bacterial virulence, and retard the dental plaque formation. Due to this action on the bacteria forming dental biofilms, a reduction of the oral disease is expected after their application (Corbin et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Among dental practitioners, the most commonly prescribed oral antiseptics have been those including in their formulation Chlorhexidine (CHX) (Varoni et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) or Essential Oils (EO) (Axelsson, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Although the antimicrobial effectiveness of both has been shown in previous studies (Gunsolley, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), they exhibit different traits when certain methodologies are followed, which, in some cases, may limit the reliability of the results. Some of these differences have been recognized by the scientific community, who cautiously interpret the results of the studies that have used an <italic>in vitro</italic>-formed biofilm (Auschill et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The use of determinate bacteria to create a biofilm in an artificial environment may result in a measure of antiseptic effectiveness that may not be representative of the <italic>in situ</italic> situation (Auschill et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria living in dental plaque develop relationships forming an extracellular matrix which is a highly resistant three-dimensional (3-D) structure. This association makes the biofilm bacteria from 10 to 1000 times more resistant to an antiseptic (Fine et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Davies, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Given this, the handling of the <italic>in situ</italic> formed biofilm is an important characteristic that studies involving oral biofilms should take into account. In some studies the 3-D structure of the oral biofilm is altered when the sample is collected (Pan et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Fine et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) or during the analysis process (Jentsch et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Vitkov et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The distortion of the 3-D structure probably influences the quantification of the antiseptic effectiveness. To avoid this, specific oral devices have been designed to allow the formation of a non-disturbed biofilm, similar to the dental plaque, which has been called plaque-like biofilm (PL-biofilm) (Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the use of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) has allowed the possibility to analyse the <italic>in situ</italic> biofilm in their natural hydrated state without losing its complex structure (Arweiler et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The CLSM has been used in combination with dual live/dead staining solutions. This has given to investigators the possibility to analyse the viability of a non-disturbed <italic>in situ</italic> oral biofilm, before and after the application of the antiseptics. Among the different available staining solutions, the SYTO 9 and propidium iodide has been one of the most successfully employed combinations of fluorochromes for visualizing dental plaque (Fuchslocher Hellemann et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hannig et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tawakoli et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, some authors have stated that the methodology of the application of a given antiseptic could be an important factor which might condition the results on oral antiseptic effectiveness (Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Commonly, in studies with undisturbed biofilm, the application of the antiseptic has been an <italic>ex vivo</italic> immersion of the sample into the solution (Zaura-Arite et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Dong et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gosau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; von Ohle et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, in recent series about the bacterial effect of CHX and EO, the participants have undergone an active mouthwash with the antiseptic <italic>in vivo</italic> (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), differing from the previously described results, mainly in regard to the EO activity.</p><p>Based on these previous findings, the authors of the present study intended to assess if the methodology of the antiseptic application might condition the obtained results in terms of bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to compare the immediate effect of two antiseptic application methods, using separate solutions of 0.2% CHX and EO applied either by a passive immersion or an active mouthwash (<italic>ex vivo</italic> vs. <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>The present study was designed as a randomized, observer-masked, crossover study. The immediate effect of 0.2% CHX and EO solutions was tested using them separately in immersion and mouthwash application on an <italic>in situ</italic> model of PL-biofilm growth.

Assuming these criteria and using the repeated measures ANOVA test, a sample size of 15 subjects was required. The sample size calculation was performed using the program G*Power 3.1.5. The participants were recruited among dental students at the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), where volunteer enrolment was asked by responding to advertisements for the participation in a research study at the faculty hall. All of these volunteers were revised by the same trained clinician to ensure they fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The volunteers chosen met the same inclusion and exclusion criteria of previous publications of our group (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The inclusion criteria were the following: being systemically healthy adult volunteers between 20 and 45 years old, who presented a good oral health status: a minimum of 24 permanent teeth with no evidence of gingivitis or periodontitis (Community Periodontal Index score = 0) (WHO, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and an absence of untreated caries at the beginning of the study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: smoker or former smoker, presence of dental prostheses or orthodontic devices, antibiotic treatment or routine use of oral antiseptics in the previous 3 months, and presence of any systemic disease that could alter the production or composition of saliva. Before the start of each phase, a full mouth scaling with ultrasonic instruments and teeth polishing with rubber cup after dental disclosure was performed by the same trained clinician on all selected participants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Protocol of the study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-06-00655-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Intraoral device of overlaid disk-holding splints (IDODS) for biofilm <italic>in situ</italic> formation</title><p>Some <italic>in situ</italic> models for the growth of the biofilm have been previously described (Netuschil et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Auschill et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Arweiler et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). After their consideration, an individualized splint of a lower hemi-arch was created for each volunteer, following the same protocol given in previous studies (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The Intraoral Device of Overlaid Disk-holding Splints (IDODS) worn by the volunteers held three glass disks (6 mm in diameter, 1 mm thickness); these were polished at 800 grit. This splint has been already described in previous own works (Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Intraoral view of the Intraoral Device Overlaid Disk-holding Splint (IDODS)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-06-00655-g0002"/></fig><p>The IDODS with the glass disks was worn by the subjects for 48 h (2 days) to favor growth of the PL-biofilm. They were allowed to withdraw it from the oral cavity only during meals and to perform oral hygiene measures (while it had to be stored in a previously provided opaque container in humid conditions). In order to not to disturb the growing of the PL-biofilm, volunteers could not use any toothpaste or mouthwash as a complement for the mechanical removal of bacterial plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of the 0.2% CHX and EO to PL-biofilm</title><p>The sample analysis was divided into two phases, each of following the application protocol of the antiseptic. The first consisted of withdrawing the glass disks one by one from the splint (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) after the volunteer had worn it for 48 h. The distal of these disks was used as a baseline sample. The second disk underwent one of two protocols:</p><p>A single, 30-s immersion in 1 mL of 0.2% Chlorhexidine (Oraldine Perio&#x000ae;, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Madrid, Spain) (Im-0.2% CHX).</p><p>-OR-</p><p>A single, 30-s immersion in 1 mL of Essential Oils in a hydroalcoholic solution (Listerine Mentol, Listerine&#x000ae;, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Madrid, Spain) (Im-EO).</p><p>Next, the second phase of the study was conducted.

All subjects performed the two tests with a rest period of 14 days in-between (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of the samples of PL-biofilm</title><p>On the day of the experiment, the volunteers were not allowed to eat or drink during the course of the tests. PL-biofilm samples collection was done individually (samples were taken from just one volunteer per day), starting at 8.30 AM (first baseline sample and immersions) and finished at 9.30 AM (mouthwash).</p><p>Immediately after the glass disks were withdrawn from the splints, they were submerged in 100 &#x003bc;L of fluorescence solution LIVE/DEAD&#x000ae; BacLight&#x02122; and kept in a dark chamber at room temperature for 15 min. A single investigator, masked to the study design, performed the microscopic observation using a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with an HCX APOL 63x/0.9 water-immersion lens.</p></sec><sec><title>Processing of the PL-biofilm samples</title><p>In the present series, the same protocol described by Quintas et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) was followed to evaluate the different fields within the disks. Four selected fields (considered as representative of the whole sample), which were in the central part of each disk were evaluated; their mean measures of the thickness and bacterial viability represented the whole sample thickness and bacterial viability, respectively. The maximum biofilm thickness of each field was divided into three equivalent zones or same sized layers: outer layer (layer 1), middle layer (layer 2) and inner layer (layer 3).</p><p>The capture of the data was done with the same settings in all cases, according to previously presented parameters (Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Representative images of the PL-biofilm (&#x0201c;stacked projection&#x0201d; of images in the &#x0201c;Z&#x0201d; axis) bacterial viability under basal conditions, after immersion and after mouthwash with 0.2% Chlorhexidine and Essential Oils</bold>.

Square capture masks were used to measure the area occupied (&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) by the pixels in each channel, determining the total area occupied by the biofilm and the corresponding percentage of viability. The intensity range was considered a positive signal if it was between 100 and 255.

This is a very important fact because it is much easier to obtain a regular glass disk in size and thickness than from enamel, being this crucial to the construction of the intraoral splints and the stability of the disks into it. Another reason is the difficulty of analysing the biofilm formed on an enamel disk due to the irregularity (it is not a plane surface) giving distorted images at the CLSM. In addition, although the sterility of the enamel disks could be achieved easily, there always could exist the latent risk of prion diseases, which would bring an important moral dilemma.</p><sec><title>PL-biofilm thickness</title><p>The present series showed a constant thickness of the PL-biofilm after all applied situations. The application of the antiseptic, either by immersion or mouthwash, did not change the basal thickness. The previous literature support this situation, no matter the antiseptic solution or the methodology of application used in the studies (Zaura-Arite et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Dong et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; von Ohle et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), so that a single application of 0.2% CHX or EO does not affect the thickness of a mature biofilm.</p></sec><sec><title>PL-biofilm bacterial viability</title><p>In the literature, the mean bacterial viability in a 2-day PL-biofilm oscillated between 60 and 77% (von Ohle et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gu et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the present series showed results in this range (72 and 76% in both baseline situations, before CHX and EO applications, respectively).</p><p>The mean bacterial viability after an Im-0.2% CHX ranged from 0.7 to 35.16% in the previous scientific literature (Zaura-Arite et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Gosau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; von Ohle et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Such wide variations might be caused by the different methodologies used in the studies. These differences mainly arise because of a range of factors, such as the antiseptic concentration or the time lapse of application. In their study on PL-biofilm, von Ohle et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) chose a 0.1% CHX concentration and their immersion times varied between 1 and 10 min. This protocol contrasts with that followed by Zaura-Arite et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and Gosau et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), who evaluated a commercial 0.2% CHX concentration, and selected an immersion time lapse of 1 min. Despite the obvious methodological differences with other series (time of exposure and concentration), the results of the present study in terms of bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm after an Im-0.2% CHX (approximately a 15%) are in accordance with the results reported in the previous literature (Zaura-Arite et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Gosau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; von Ohle et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Respect to the applied CHX protocol, the manufacturer recommendations in terms of time of application were followed (30 s).</p><p>Regarding the Mw-0.2% CHX, there are few evaluations of the bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm after an active mouthwash with this antiseptic (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In the present series, the bacterial viability was near to 5% which is consistent with that reported in previous studies (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the mean bacterial viability after an Im-EO, the results found in the literature ranged from 23 to 31% (Dong et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Gosau et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In these cases, the antiseptic concentration did not vary from one study to another. This is probably one of the reasons why the range is narrower for the EO than for the 0.2% CHX. Gosau et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Dong et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) immersed a 12 and 48 h-PL-biofilm for 1 min, respectively. The present series showed a mean bacterial viability within the named range (approximately a 27%).</p><p>In regard to the assessment of the efficacy of an active Mw-EO, to the best of the author's knowledge, there is only one study in which the bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm has been evaluated (Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This study showed a very low bacterial viability 30 s after the Mw-EO, near to 1%, which is similar to the present results.</p><p>Despite the visible lack of previous literature, the results of the present series, in terms of bacterial viability, have a clear interpretation, according to the authors: doing an active mouthwash greatly reduces the bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm, more so than doing an immersion with the same antiseptic. When differentiating between 0.2% CHX and EO, we found doing an Im-0.2% CHX was more effective than doing an Im-EO.</p><p>On the other hand, when a mouthwash was done, the EO solution was more effective than the 0.2% CHX. In previous research of the authors (Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the immediate effect of the EO vs. 0.2% CHX has been already presented and discussed in detail.</p></sec><sec><title>PL-biofilm bacterial viability by layers</title><p>The distribution of the bacterial viability into the PL-biofilm in the baseline disks was significantly lower in the deepest layers. This distribution pattern of viability, in which vital bacteria overlay non-vital bacteria, has been previously described in other <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm studies that analyzed bacterial viability in layers (Arweiler et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Prada-L&#x000f3;pez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>After the Im-0.2% CHX, the bacterial viability decreased significantly in all layers. However, there were no differences among the layers (18% outer, 16% middle and 11% inner layer). Zaura-Arite et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) analyzed the bacterial viability in the different layers after a 1 min immersion in 0.2% CHX showing its efficacy as well, but with wide ranges of values (outer layer = 16&#x02013;42%, middle layer = 19&#x02013;55% and inner layer = 21&#x02013;58%). These data were probably obtained due to the small sample size and the characteristics of the volunteers (three heavy plaque-formers and three light plaque-formers).</p><p>On the other hand, the Mw-0.2% CHX reduced the bacterial viability similarly in all layers, being these findings in accordance with those previously described <italic>in situ</italic> studies (Garc&#x000ed;a-Caballero et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quintas et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This reduction in bacterial viability obtained by mouthwash, as recorded by layers, was higher than the obtained from the immersion method.</p><p>In the present series, when applying the EO antiseptic, the bacterial viability of the PL-biofilm was reduced in all layers after the immersion. The outer layer showed significant less viability than the other two (16% in the outer layer vs. 26% in the middle and 39% in the deepest layer). In the same manner, Dong et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), after a 1-min Im-EO found less bacterial viability in the outer layer (outer layer = 22% vs. middle layer = 34%, and inner layer = 37%). In both studies, a reduction in the bacterial viability was shown, but a different spatial distribution in the bacterial viability compared to their baselines could be seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). While in the baseline sample the bacterial viability decreased from the outer to the inner layers, after an Im-EO, this distribution was inverted, showing an increase in the bacterial viability from the outer to the inner layers. This fact could be explained by the low capacity of the EO solution to penetrate mature biofilms, resulting in a loss of efficacy in the deepest layers of the PL-biofilm. In the contrast, this effect seen after the Im-EO was completely lost after the Mw-EO. The EO applied following the manufacturer's instructions (a single mouthwash with 20 mL for 30 s) was clearly more effective in all layers than the simple immersion, achieving bacterial viability results near to 0% in the three layers.</p><p>The results of the present series confirmed that, to properly assess the immediate antibacterial effect of 0.2% CHX and EO, an <italic>in vivo</italic> active mouthwash following the manufacturer's recommendations should be done. This series has also shown that an active mouthwash helped to maximize the efficacy of the 0.2% CHX solution and, mainly, the EO solution compared to a single immersion. In addition, the findings of this investigation suggest cautious interpretation of the results of studies that followed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> antiseptic application (immersion) in PL-biofilm. This previous literature about antimicrobial activity of both 0.2% CHX and EO relies on <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> studies that do not follow proper methodologies, pretending to equate a simple immersion (<italic>ex vivo</italic>) with an active mouthwash (<italic>in vivo</italic>). To some extent, this equation could be considered valid when isolated bacteria are studied. However, when talking about bacteria associated in a more complex structure such as a naturally-formed biofilm (that is 10&#x02013;1000 times more resistant than bacteria in planktonic phase) (Fine et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), something more than the simple contact with the antiseptic is needed. This higher activity of the antiseptic when applied as a mouthwash could be due to the hydrodynamic forces that appear in the mouth thank to the action of the tongue, cheeks and other muscles of the oral cavity that contribute to the movement of the mouthwash throughout all the surfaces of the mouth. This movement could achieve something that the passive immersion could not, which is breaking of the surface force of the PL-biofilm, being this crucial for the antiseptic penetration. This is the same theory followed in endodontics with the &#x0201c;hydrodynamic activation&#x0201d; of the antiseptic in the interior of the radicular canal by agitation (Weller et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Peeters et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This movement achieves to break the surface force of small root canals contributing to maximize the chemical action of the antiseptic (Peeters et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the authors would like to point out another possible differentiating variable which may condition the antiseptic effectiveness: the temperature. In the <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiment, the antiseptic was at room temperature (between 18 and 20&#x000b0;C). However, when the application was <italic>in vivo</italic>, the temperature of the antiseptic solution rose by several degrees. In future investigations, it would be interesting to study the role that the temperature might play in the antimicrobial effect of the antiseptic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The method of application conditioned the antibacterial activity of the 0.2% Chlorhexidine and the Essential Oils on the plaque-like biofilm. The <italic>in vivo</italic> active mouthwash protocol was more effective than the <italic>ex vivo</italic> passive immersion in both antiseptic solutions, conditioning the obtained results. There was more penetration of the antiseptic inside the biofilm with an active mouthwash, especially when the Essential Oils were used.</p><p>According to the results of the present study, future investigations on oral antiseptics should take into account the methodology of the application. To obtain a situation as close as possible to the clinical reality, the plaque-like biofilm should be formed <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the antiseptic application should be <italic>in situ</italic>, with an active mouthwash or, at least, take into consideration the role that the movement of the solution may have in the antiseptic antimicrobial activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conception and design the experiments: IT, JS, DS.
