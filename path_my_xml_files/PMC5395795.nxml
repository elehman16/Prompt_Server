A large proportion of people in a care home setting spend most of their time sedentary, and this is one of the leading preventable causes of death. Encouraging residents to engage in more physical activity could deliver benefits in terms of physical and psychological health, and quality of life. This study is the final stage of a programme of research to develop and preliminarily test an evidence-based intervention designed to enhance opportunities for movement amongst care home residents, thereby increasing levels of physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a cluster randomised feasibility trial, aiming to recruit at least 8&#x02013;12 residents at each of 12 residential care homes across Yorkshire, UK. Care homes will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to receive either the intervention alongside usual care, or to continue to provide usual care alone. Assessment will be undertaken with participating residents at baseline (prior to care home randomisation) and at 3, 6, and 9&#x000a0;months post-randomisation. Data relating to changes in physical activity, physical function, level of cognitive impairment, mood, perceived health and wellbeing, and quality of life will be collected. Data at the level of the home will also be collected and will include staff experience of care, and changes in the numbers and types of adverse events residents experience (for example, hospital admissions, falls). Details of National Health Service (NHS) usage will be collected to inform the economic analysis. An embedded process evaluation will obtain information to test out the theory of change underpinning the intervention and its acceptability to staff and residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This feasibility trial with embedded process evaluation and collection of health economic data will allow us to undertake detailed feasibility work to inform a future large-scale trial. It will provide valuable information to inform research procedures in this important but challenging area.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN16076575?q=&#x00026;filters=conditionCategory:Signs%20and%20Symptoms,trialStatus:Ongoing&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=25&#x00026;totalResults=36&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=100&#x00026;searchType=basicsearch">ISRCTN16076575</ext-link>.

While policy and service developments have emphasised alternatives to long-term care, evidence suggests that around one in four older people will spend time in a care home in their last year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and that the need for such care will persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2011, more than a quarter of a million (291,000) people aged 65&#x000a0;years and over were living in care homes in England and Wales, 3.2% of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Research over decades reports that care home residents spend the majority of their time inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Lack of engagement in physical activity (PA), defined as &#x0201c;any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], has detrimental effects on physical and psychological health and quality of life, and contributes to social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, an observational study suggests that 97% of residents&#x02019; days are spent sedentary (e.g. sitting, watching television), with low levels of interaction with staff and each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sedentary behaviour, defined as &#x0201c;any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure &#x02264;1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], has been seen to negatively impact morbidity and mortality independently of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] issued a quality standard call for &#x0201c;older people in care homes to be offered opportunities during their day to participate in meaningful activity that promotes their health and mental wellbeing&#x0201d;. Meaningful activity can range from activities such as caring for plants and helping around the home, to leisure pursuits such as playing cards.</p><p>Existing research has primarily involved the delivery of time-limited interventions by staff external to the care homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It seems necessary that, if such interventions are to be successfully and sustainably delivered, they need to be embedded in routine practice and that care home staff should be involved in developing and delivering the necessary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Further, there is increasing emphasis on programmes which reduce the overall time spent sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and that do not simply involve short bursts of formally organised PA such as exercise classes. Together, these reinforce the need for action to increase levels of PA in care homes, reduce time spent sedentary, and incorporate greater engagement of care home staff in developing and delivering whole practice change which is embedded in daily life routines.</p><p>Through a series of studies we have collaborated with care home staff and residents to develop a multi-component intervention aimed at changing how the routine work of care staff is carried out to encourage and support residents to engage in more PA (above and beyond organised exercise sessions) and reduce the time they spend sedentary. Increasing resident PA and reducing the time they spend sedentary will, we hypothesise, improve residents&#x02019; physical and psychological outcomes.</p><p>The first study for the Research Exploring Physical Activity in Care Homes (REACH) programme involved ethnographic fieldwork in four care homes to understand the contextual and organisational factors that shape care practice, residents&#x02019; existing patterns of PA, and the potential for change. It emerged in this first study, and was reinforced in later studies, that &#x02018;physical activity&#x02019; was a difficult concept for care home staff to understand and engage with, particularly in view of the frailty of many residents. Staff linked the notion of PA with specific time-limited activities which might be undertaken by an activity co-ordinator. Our intent was to engage all staff in encouraging residents to undertake small changes in their daily life. The notion of increasing movement and &#x02018;moving more&#x02019; had greater resonance and intuitive understanding for staff and residents. Thus, this is the language we adopted in the care home setting. We anticipate that &#x02018;moving more&#x02019; will increase levels of PA.</p><p>The second study explored the acceptability, validity, and reliability of different measures of PA and sedentary behaviour, which included the development and testing of protocols for the use of accelerometers by residents.</p><p>In the third study, the researchers worked alongside a reference group of care home managers, staff, residents, and their relatives/friends to identify barriers and opportunities for change through the process of intervention mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the fourth study, through an action research approach with care home staff and residents in a further four homes, we developed and tested elements of an intervention and change process to reduce residents&#x02019; sedentary time and encourage them to &#x02018;move more&#x02019;. An iterative approach, drawing on the previous work and the implementation literature, was utilised during this process. A novel feature of the work was the involvement of an artist to capture and illustrate pictorially the voice of residents, which resonated with staff in a way that words did not.</p><p>Here, we report the protocol for the fifth study, designed to explore the feasibility of training staff to incorporate the intervention into their care home, and the feasibility of trial processes (recruitment, follow-up, data collection) to inform the feasibility and design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The REACH feasibility trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial to explore the practicality and acceptability of implementing a large-scale definitive cluster RCT comparing the REACH intervention plus usual care versus usual care practice alone among permanent residents living in residential care homes in the UK. The REACH intervention is a whole-home intervention designed to assist care home staff to make step-by-step changes in their approach to working with residents, and therefore the care home is the unit of randomisation.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the timing of all trial processes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>SPIRIT figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1921_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>The study objectives relate to the feasibility trial and the linked process evaluation. The former will involve gathering data around recruitment and follow-up, intervention delivery, assessment of outcome measures, and statistical aspects to inform the feasibility and design of a definitive RCT. The process evaluation, drawing on Medical Research Council guidance on process evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], will collect data relating to the &#x02018;how&#x02019; of the intervention and implementation process (the &#x02018;theory of change&#x02019; or assumptions underpinning the programme); the process and quality of implementation as it evolves in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and how implementation impacts on, and is shaped by, the organisational and interactional environment of the care home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the main objectives are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Explore the optimum strategies to facilitate recruitment, and estimate recruitment and follow-up rates at both care home and resident levels;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assess the compliance and feasibility of wearing an accelerometer to obtain data to measure the level of a resident&#x02019;s PA (anticipated primary outcome for the definitive RCT) and time spent sedentary;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluate the most appropriate outcome measures by assessing the feasibility of obtaining questionnaire data among residents related to physical function, ability and mobility, and psychological well-being;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Determine the optimum strategy for collecting data relating to health care resource use and adverse events.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment setting and participants</title><p>The study will be conducted in 12 residential care homes in the counties of West and North Yorkshire in the UK. A care home will be considered eligible if:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Initial scoping indicates that there are sufficient numbers of permanent eligible residents to enable 8&#x02013;12 permanent residents to be recruited from that home (homes will later be excluded if researchers find that they are unable to obtain consent and baseline data for at least 5 residents); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a manager or nominated person who agrees to sign up to the trial protocol as research lead for the duration of the project and to release staff time for data collection, including supporting the use of the accelerometers and, where appropriate, intervention implementation. Signed agreement is required from the care home manager and care home owner or representative.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>A care home will be excluded if:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In the view of the research team it is not suitable for inclusion due to being subject to Care Quality Commission (CQC) enforcement notices, admission bans, or relevant moderate or major CQC compliance breaches;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is receiving other special support for specific quality concerns, such as being currently subject to, or have pending, any serious safeguarding investigations, or receiving voluntary or compulsory admissions bans, or is in receipt of local commissioning special support due to quality concerns;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It has taken part in any of the earlier studies within the REACH programme;</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is taking part, has recently taken part, or is planning to take part, in another trial or initiative that conflicts with the REACH intervention or with the data collection during the course of trial involvement.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>All residents in a care home will be exposed to the intervention should the home be allocated to the REACH intervention. Those considered eligible for individual outcome assessment will be permanent residents aged 65&#x000a0;years or over, not terminally ill nor permanently bedbound, and appropriately consented. A permanent resident is defined as residing in the care home and not in receipt of respite, day-care, or short-term rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Care home recruitment and consent</title><p>All residential care homes in a pre-specified catchment area of West Yorkshire will be identified via the CQC website and assessed for eligibility, as far as is possible, via publicly available information. Those deemed potentially eligible at this stage will receive an information sheet via the post with a reply slip to register interest in participation (a copy of this can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Researchers will contact care homes to answer any queries and determine their interest if a reply slip is not returned within 2&#x000a0;weeks. For interested care homes, a researcher from the Academic Unit of Elderly Care and Rehabilitation (AUECR) will complete an initial eligibility assessment via telephone ahead of visiting the care home to determine full eligibility, obtain agreement to participate, and complete the recruitment process. Documented reasons for ineligibility and declining participation will be closely monitored by the trial team at each stage. The target is for a minimum of two care homes to be recruited per month.</p><p>To ensure the sample of 12 care homes is reached, in close liaison with Clinical Research Network staff, the Enabling Research in Care Homes (ENRICH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enrich.nihr.ac.uk/">http://enrich.nihr.ac.uk/</ext-link>) network will be contacted to assist with identifying homes in an additional catchment area. All care homes registered on the ENRICH network in the York and Harrogate areas of North Yorkshire will be sent the information sheet via email with contact details to register interest in participation. Colleagues from the local Clinical Research Network will follow-up contact with care homes if no response has been received within 2&#x000a0;weeks. For interested care homes, eligibility will be assessed by the study researcher via telephone and visit as outlined above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Resident recruitment and consent</title><p>Following care home agreement to participate, all residents will be screened for eligibility. Demographic data will be recorded anonymously by the researcher through discussions with the care home manager and staff members who know the residents well. Residents will not be identified to the researcher by name, and any information provided will be differentiated only by a screening number.</p><p>An initial assessment of the capacity of each eligible resident to consent will be undertaken by the manager or nominated deputy. All residents will be assumed to have capacity unless assessed to lack capacity in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Those with capacity will be provided with information about the study by the researcher and offered at least 24&#x000a0;h to consider participation if they wish. Formal written consent to take part will be sought by the researcher, and ongoing informal capacity assessments conducted by the researcher at each follow-up visit. If a resident&#x02019;s capacity is uncertain after initial assessment, the researcher will be asked to assist in determining capacity alongside a member of staff if the resident is willing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Process for assessing capacity and obtaining consent</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1921_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment of those without capacity</title><p>It is anticipated that many of the residents will lack the capacity to consent. The MCA requires that those lacking capacity are only included in research that is likely to be of direct benefit to those taking part or to benefit the particular population under study. In this trial, the intervention is delivered at the care home level, hence all residents may benefit directly from enhanced routine PA and indirectly through increasing social engagement. Excluding those without capacity would compromise the generalisability of findings by recruitment of an unrepresentative study sample and excluding this vulnerable population from the benefits of research evidence in improving practice.</p><p>Research Ethics Committee (REC) approval includes agreement to involve residents lacking capacity and the process to include them, namely to seek personal consultee or nominated consultee agreement for such residents to participate. For those residents who lose capacity during study participation following the provision of informed consent, an identified consultee will provide advice on a resident&#x02019;s continued involvement in the trial.

Due to the small numbers of care homes (trial clusters), stratified randomisation will be implemented to ensure balance between the arms with respect to size of the care home (small/medium &#x02264;40 beds, large &#x0003e;40 beds) and whether or not an activity co-ordinator is in post (characteristics expected to be correlated with intervention implementation and outcome evaluation).</p><p>The allocation will be performed centrally by the statistician at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) at the University of Leeds using a computer-generated minimisation program with a random element, following recruitment of residents and completion of their baseline assessments. CTRU will provide the random allocation to researchers involved in intervention implementation and adherence monitoring, so that all care home managers can be informed of their care home&#x02019;s allocation, and arrangements can be put in place for those homes randomised to intervention delivery. Researchers involved in the collection of outcome measures will not be informed of allocation, and efforts will be made to ensure that they remain blind. This will include maintaining separate office locations for &#x02018;blinded&#x02019; and &#x02018;unblinded&#x02019; researchers and requesting that care homes do not disclose their allocation to these researchers.</p><p>Due to the concern that smaller homes may not have enough residents providing baseline data to ensure sufficient outcome data for evaluation (despite initial assessment that there should be 8&#x02013;12 eligible residents at the care home), homes will only be randomised if there are at least five participating residents providing baseline data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention and implementation process</title><p>The REACH intervention is designed to be implemented and embedded in routine care delivery within the care home. It has been cumulatively built up from our earlier work and aims to achieve change in how all members of staff work with residents to encourage and support them to engage in more PA and spend less time sedentary. This will utilise the terminology &#x02018;moving more&#x02019;. The intervention will focus on change in four domains of daily routines that embrace: independent/supervised movement of residents to get about; incorporating movement in social and leisure activities; providing opportunities for residents to engage in &#x02018;meaningful&#x02019; activities; and encouraging residents to do as much of their own self-care and instrumental activities of daily living as is possible for them.</p><p>Implementation will comprise a cyclical service improvement approach. It will be led by a team involving key stakeholders in the change: staff, residents (if possible), and their relatives/friends facilitated by a senior member of care home staff. This synthesises a top-down and bottom-up approach to leading change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; this means that the active involvement of senior staff with the authority and legitimacy to drive the change process forward is aimed at securing organisational commitment to introducing and embedding the programme (top-down), and the engagement of those directly involved in action to deliver it ensures that their views and experiences will inform the pace and direction of change (bottom-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The intervention and implementation process does not prescribe particular kinds of changes that staff should make to increase residents&#x02019; movement, but remains flexible to be adapted to each care home&#x02019;s needs.</p><p>Several strategies are in place to support implementation: identification of an intervention lead and core team in each home; provision of a manual, including an &#x02018;Ideas Bank&#x02019; of resources to assist staff in getting started and keeping going; and training and support comprising a series of three interactive workshops provided individually to each home.</p><p>We have been guided by the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) and the treatment fidelity framework provided by the National Institutes of Health&#x02019;s Behavioral Change Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to capture the intervention (its rationale, materials, procedures, etc.) and to guide approaches to implementation and fidelity monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Usual care</title><p>Usual care is defined as &#x02018;normal&#x02019; care delivered within the care home and will continue in both arms. No restrictions will be imposed on current practices or on care homes undertaking additional training and development as part of usual care.

These data will allow in-depth evaluation of how the intervention enhances attitudes towards and practices relating to PA among staff and residents over the study duration, over and above any changes that may be introduced within the control homes.

One consequence is an increase in demand for long-term care which, despite the increased emphasis on community care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], will remain a necessary component of health and social care provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Residents of care homes are amongst the frailest in our population with significant health and social care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is reported that older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and care home residents undertake little PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and in fact spend the majority of their time sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although &#x0201c;there is sufficient evidence to support a recommendation to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], the majority of such work relates to younger people, and the implications for older adults are not yet robust. Decreasing levels of PA and increasing dependency have many adverse effects. Reduced PA and mobility problems compound health difficulties by directly affecting physical and psychological health, and reducing opportunities to participate in social activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>We aim to address this challenge in our programme of work in which we are evaluating an intervention which actively engages staff within care homes to embed strategies to increase PA and decrease sedentary behaviour during the daily routines of the care home and its residents. This &#x02018;whole-home&#x02019; intervention moves away from a model of time-limited provision of activities such as exercise classes.</p><p>Research in this setting in challenging; this feasibility trial will address important methodological issues, assess intervention implementation, and collect data to inform a definitive RCT to evaluate an intervention which addresses a central component of care for frail, elderly people. The work undertaken will also provide guidance and tested protocols for all research undertaken in the care home setting.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study commenced recruitment of care homes in August 2015, and recruitment of residents in December 2015; 138 residents at 11 care homes had been recruited as of 31 August 2016. The study is projected to complete recruitment by September 2016.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec31"><p>
