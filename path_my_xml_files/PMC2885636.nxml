They are structurally classified as sulfhydryl containing ACEIs, for example, captopril, fentiapril, zofenopril, and so on; di-carboxyl containing ACEIs namely enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, moexipril, and so on; and phosphonate containing ACEIs namely fosinopril, on the basis of their binding with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] It is a well-known fact, that the activity of a drug can be modified by changes in the structure of the drug. Hence, it can be hypothesized that they may have different patterns of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study was prompted by the fact that a large number of people suffer from essential hypertension and ACEIs certainly are among the most widely prescribed agents in its treatment. It is therefore imperative that we should have maximum data on their pattern of utilization and the adverse drug reactions.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to observe the incidence and severity of adverse drug reactions between the di-carboxyl group containing ACE inhibitors (namely enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril) versus the phosphonate group containing ACE inhibitors (namely fosinopril), in patients suffering from essential hypertension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>One hundred and twenty newly diagnosed patients (83 male, 37 female) suffering from stage I / II essential hypertension, according to JNC-VII guidelines,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] without any underlying comorbid conditions or complications, aged between 20 and 70 years, were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent and due approval of the ethics committee. It was a prospective, parallel, open-label, randomized, comparative trial, and the patients were divided into four groups of 30 each. Each group received enalapril (2.5 mg), lisinopril (2.5 mg), ramipril (2.5 mg), and fosinopril (10 mg), respectively, once daily, in the morning with breakfast. As it was an open-label study, to avoid selection bias, a randomization chart was prepared beforehand using the Random Allocation Software (version 1.0.0; developed by M.Saghaei and Isfahan). In this randomization chart, the subject numbers were allocated from 1 &#x02013; 160 (anticipating study dropouts) in four groups. Each subject was enrolled on a first-come basis and received treatment as per his / her randomization number. The investigational drugs were prescribed to the study subjects and purchased from the hospital pharmacy. The individual dose was subsequently titrated in case of inadequate blood pressure control, which was predefined for blood pressure levels of &#x0003c; 140 / 90 mmHg.</p><p>On confirming the diagnosis, the baseline blood pressure in the left arm (sitting position) was recorded after allowing 10 minutes of rest for each subject. The blood pressure of all the subjects was monitored on an hourly basis, for four hours on day 1, after the first dose was administered, under supervision. Every subject was followed up for four months, which included eight follow-ups at an interval of 15 days. During every follow-up, the blood pressure in the left arm (sitting position) was recorded after allowing 10 minutes of rest, the compliance with therapy and use of concomitant medicines was documented; any additional anti-hypertensive medication precluded the subject from continuing in the study. Hematological and biochemical examinations were performed at baseline and end of the study. Adverse Events (AEs) if any, were documented during the follow-up visit and their causality was assessed using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Center (WHO-UMC) causality assessment criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] For grading adverse drug reactions, such as, dizziness, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, headache, and nausea, a visual rating scale (VRS) was employed; cough was further evaluated on the basis of its interference in routine activities and sleep disturbances in the subject. To propose a hypothesis, after comparing the incidence of ADRs between the two groups, namely di-carboxyl containing ACE Inhibitors and phosphonate containing ACE Inhibitors, we employed the statistical hypothesis test of difference in proportion (Z-test), to calculate the P-value in terms of significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The unicentric, prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label study included 120 patients suffering from stage I / II essential hypertension. These included 83 males and 37 females randomized in each study group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>]. It was evident that the number of males in each study group was more than the females. Their mean (&#x000b1; S.D.) age was 50.7 (&#x000b1; 16.9) years; baseline blood pressure (systolic / diastolic), 157.4 (&#x000b1;15.2) / 101.4 (&#x000b1;9.1) mm Hg; and body mass index, 24.0 (&#x000b1;2.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The target blood pressure of &#x02264; 140/ 90 mm Hg was achieved in all subjects by appropriate individualized dose titration. The mean (&#x000b1;SD) blood pressure at end of the study was observed as 129.6 (&#x000b1;10.2) / 89.4 (&#x000b1;7.1) mm Hg. The study drugs were tolerated by the majority, except in five subjects, who presented with adverse events such as neutropenia (n = 1), severe dry cough (n = 2), and skin rash (n = 2), which warranted treatment discontinuation. During the course of the study five subjects dropped out, of which four subjects were withdrawn due to lack of three consecutive follow-up visits and one subject dropped out, as the subject could not bear the expenses involved. New cases were enrolled to compensate the dropouts.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Gender distribution of patients receiving ACEI for hypertension</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-42-27-g001"/></fig><p>The observed age distribution of subjects receiving ACEIs in each study group is expressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>.

Large multi-centric trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] have proved that ACEIs not only increase the life expectancy, but also improve the quality of life in high-risk patients suffering from cardiovascular events. It appears that by their specific effect on myocardial and vascular cell growth, also referred to as remodeling, they have a greater protective potential than any other class of anti-hypertensive drugs.</p><p>Ever since captopril (sulfhydryl group containing ACEI) was introduced as an anti-hypertensive agent in the year 1981, by the USFDA, many adverse effects with its use have been reported. Several other ACEIs followed captopril over the years to come and today we have a surfeit of ACEIs to choose from with more or less a similar ADR profile.</p><p>Our study was designed to monitor the various ADRs seen with the ACEIs containing the di-carboxyl group (namely enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril) and the phosphonate group (namely fosinopril), with the aim to observe the incidence and severity of ADRs between the two groups.</p><p>Among the 11 ADRs [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>] that were encountered with various ACEIs, only three ADRs namely cough, hypotension, and nausea elicited a significant difference related to their chemical structure. The incidence of these ADRs was not related to the age group of the study subjects.</p><p>Dry, brassy cough is commonly reported with the use of ACEIs and is estimated to be in the range of 5-10%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] The cough is usually persistent, paroxysmal, non-productive, worsening in the lying down position, and at times accompanied by a change in voice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] Studies have suggested the involvement of mediators such as, bradykinin, prostaglandins or substance P as mediators of the cough.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] A literature survey suggests about a 6% incidence of cough with enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] whereas, it is reported to be higher (10%) with fosinopril.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the incidence of cough with enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril was similar to that reported in literature, but was distinctly higher (20%) in subjects receiving fosinopril. It was interesting to note that some of the subjects (three males and one female) on fosinopril also complained of sleep disturbances on account of cough, of which two (one male and one female) required discontinuation of drug as cough was very troublesome. This could have possible repercussions on the long-term use of p-ACEIs. Hence, d-ACEIs could clinically be a better option over p-ACEIs since they are better tolerated by hypertensive patients in the long term. However, this needs further assessment in a larger sample of patients.</p><p>The incidence of hypotension with the use of ACEIs is reported to be in the range of 2&#x02013;5% and there is no significant difference in the incidence of hypotension caused by d-ACEIs or by p-ACEIs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] However, in our study, hypotension was observed only in a few subjects receiving fosinopril that needed reduction in dosage from 10 mg/day to 5 mg/day. This feature was observed approximately after a month of starting therapy with fosinopril. On the other hand, none of the subjects in the other study group receiving enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril had hypotension. As our sample size was relatively small, further studies are required to confirm whether the incidence of hypotension is higher with fosinopril (p-ACEIs) and negligible with enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril (d-ACEIs). This could also probably mean that the doses were well titrated against the response in terms of the beneficial effect on blood pressure.</p><p>Nausea with use of ACEIs is around 1&#x02013;5% as reported in the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] It is somewhat higher with lisinopril as compared to enalapril and ramipril[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] and considerably low with fosinopril.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] Our findings indicated that the incidence of nausea was higher (10%) with all three agents, namely, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril (d-ACEIs), whereas, none receiving fosinopril (p-ACEI) had nausea. From the point of view of patient compliance, p-ACEI fosinopril appears to be a better option, if patients complain of nausea with d-ACEIs. This kind of an increased incidence and severity of nausea with di-carboxyl containing ACE Inhibitors, may at some point be noted by clinicians with caution (although not serious), while prescribing them. In such situations a phosphonate containing ACE Inhibitor may prove a suitable option. The causality needs to be confirmed by evaluating a larger number of subjects to make the study representative of the Indian population.</p><p>Based on the observations, it can be concluded that three ADRs, namely, cough, hypotension, and nausea seem to have a probable relationship with the functional group (di-carboxyl / phosphonate). Cough and hypotension have a higher incidence and severity with p-ACEIs, whereas, nausea is associated only with d-ACEIs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>Financial and time constraints not only restricted the number of subjects recruited in our study, but also the duration of the follow-up period and the number of follow-up visits. As this study was limited to 120 subjects, incorporating more number of subjects in each group and conducting the study in different centers across India can establish a more accurate causal relationship. There is a need for an increased number of follow-up visits, over a longer duration, to make this study broad-based and representative of the Indian population.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Scope for further work</title><p>Comparative studies which focus on the association of ADRs with a change in the structure of ACE Inhibitors; involving all the three zinc-binding groups of ACE Inhibitors, namely, sulfhydryl, di-carboxyl, and phosphonate are needed. A phosphonate group replacing the di-carboxyl group was introduced with the intention to increase the potency of ACE Inhibitors. Further studies can be carried out by introducing a newer zinc-binding group in the ACE Inhibitors which may help in discovering a prototype or an ideal ACE Inhibitor having a favourable ADR profile and good tolerability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are indebted to the following doctors for their technical support in this study: Hanumanthugari R, Patil D., Melmane P., Bansode S.G., Yadav H., and Sawarkar S.
