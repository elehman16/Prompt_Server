The study population included 80 HD patients from Imam Khomeini and Fatemeh Zahra hospitals in the Mazandaran city during 2011, who met the inclusion criteria. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Mazandaran Medical Science University. Eighty (<italic>N</italic> = 40 in experimental group and <italic>N</italic> = 40 in the control group) patients were selected randomly based on a random number table. Sampling was parallel, the first eligible patients assigned in the intervention group and the next one in the control group. This process was applied to all samples. All samples who met the inclusion criteria were selected randomly and had the same chance of participation. Sample selection done during week in three times, morning, afternoon and evening.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: Age range between 18 and 65 years; at least 2 months dialysis history; active file recordation in mentioned hospitals; no comorbidity with other chronic disease like cancer, heart disease, etc. (diabetes and hypertension are included, because usually this comorbidities are a part of renal failure; excluding them leads to limitation in generalization). Exclusion criteria were: The unwillingness of a patient, physical disability, regular tranquillizer or sedative drugs; had a previous history of psychiatric disorders, suffered from stress other than dialysis in the past 6 months, incomplete training (below 55 sessions), and peritoneal dialysis or a kidney transplant.

The DASS is a quantitative measure of distress along the three axes of depression, anxiety, and stress. It is not a categorical measure of clinical diagnoses. The individual DASS scores do not define appropriate interventions.</p><p>This questionnaire had been presented for the first time by Lovibond in 1995[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] which included three subscales and every subscale included seven questions. In translated version, each item has choices of never, little, moderate, and many. The lowest score is related to every zero question and the highest score is 3.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In this questionnaire the questions 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, and 20 are related to anxiety; 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 21 are related to depression and the questions 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 18 assess the stress.</p><p>Defined cutoff points are as follows:</p><p>

After patients signed consent to participate, we used video exhibition to train the Benson's relaxation method to patients and their care givers in dialysis center. In first step, the patients and their care givers learned relaxation through exhibition in HD center, then the CD was provided and asked care giver to observe and guide patients to practice correctly twice a day in morning and evening for 15 min during 4 weeks.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Relaxation was practiced whenever they came to the center or contacted them by phone daily to remind on time practice.</p><p>The instruction of the Benson's relaxation technique included the following steps:</p><p>

As it is obvious from [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], there are significant differences in mean and standard deviation of control and intervention groups in case of stress and anxiety scores.</p><p>Same results have been reported in the studies by Lizica <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Mollahadi <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Shafipour <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Eghbali <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and Rajamanickam and Kumar.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] They also suggested that stress reduction influences quality of life in the patients, but they need regular psychotherapy also. This study has shown that there is a difference between the mean and standard deviation of the group who received Benson's relaxation and who did not receive. The changes in stress scores were considerable. There is growing evidence to evaluation of the influence of Benson's relaxation as a cost effective and safe technique on different chronic disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] Hosseini <italic>et al.</italic>, confirmed that psychological training based on the standard protocols and the use of medicine resulted in comparable decreases in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms of HD patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]</p><p>In another study Rahimi <italic>et al.</italic>, which evaluated palliative care effects during 4-6 months on stress, anxiety, and depression; the results showed positive effects of care on HD patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, also explored the effect of music therapy on stress, anxiety, and depression in HD patients and confirmed significant stress reduction in HD patients after music therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] According to evidence practice of the Benson's relaxation technique, results have shown significant gains in tons if practiced regularly for long time period. Hence, in present study insignificancy of intervention and control group in depression is explainable by limited practiced time period. The results of this study and other related studies in this context showed that using cost effective, low risk, and easy methods by patients could help the patients to reduce the stress and lead to several benefits if practiced daily; beside the palliative care and alternative treatments in HD patients. The level of stress was high among HD patients, although it decreased after the intervention, but still it was at a higher level. Regarding some limitations of this study, researchers could not observe all sessions and there can be some fake report from patients or care givers or it could be due to limited practice time (1 month). On the other hand, DASS21 is not a categorical measure of clinical diagnoses. The individual DASS scores do not define appropriate interventions. Therefore, using complementary tools is recommended in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Generally we have mentioned in Benson's relaxation method in text, our findings confirmed the effect of relaxation on stress and anxiety with several studies and the recommendations are mostly emphasized on long-term, regular practice. The most effects of relaxation works through the decrease of metabolism and strengthening of heart contractions, respiration, and blood pressure; and release of epinephrine on the sympathetic system of a patient's physiological condition.
