AZD0837, a new oral anticoagulant, is a prodrug converted to a selective and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor (AR-H067637). We report from a Phase II randomized, dose-guiding study (NCT00684307) to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of extended-release AZD0837 in patients with AF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>Atrial fibrillation patients (<italic>n</italic> = 955) with &#x02265;1 additional risk factor for stroke were randomized to receive AZD0837 (150, 300, or 450 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily) or VKA (international normalized ratio 2&#x02013;3, target 2.5) for 3&#x02013;9 months. Approximately 30% of patients were na&#x000ef;ve to VKA treatment. Total bleeding events were similar or lower in all AZD0837 groups (5.3&#x02013;14.7%, mean exposure 138&#x02013;145 days) vs. VKA (14.5%, mean exposure 161 days), with fewer clinically relevant bleeding events on AZD0837 150 and 300 mg once daily. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups; with AZD0837, the most common were gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. diarrhoea, flatulence, or nausea). <sc>d</sc>-Dimer, used as a biomarker of thrombogenesis, decreased in all groups in VKA-na&#x000ef;ve subjects with treatment, whereas in VKA pre-treated patients, <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels started low and remained low in all groups. As expected, only a few strokes or systemic embolic events occurred. In the AZD0837 groups, mean S-creatinine increased by &#x0223c;10% from baseline and returned to baseline following treatment cessation. The frequency of serum alanine aminotransferase &#x02265;3&#x000d7; upper limit of normal was similar for AZD0837 and VKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AZD0837 was generally well tolerated at all doses tested.

The study was double-blind for AZD0837 doses but open for VKA.

Patients were enrolled by the investigators at each study centre and randomized strictly sequentially as they were eligible for randomization.

Clinically relevant minor bleeding events were defined as clinically overt bleeding causing a fall in haemoglobin level of &#x0003c;20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or leading to transfusion of one unit of whole blood or red cells, bleeding causing temporary treatment cessation or bleeding with clinical implications resulting in medical consultation/intervention.

The incidence of bleeding and suppression of <sc>d</sc>-dimer concentration in plasma was expected to provide data to guide the selection of dose(s) for a Phase III study. In order to evaluate the change from baseline in <sc>d</sc>-dimer values after at least 4 weeks of treatment, it was aimed to include at least 20 VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients in each AZD0837 treatment group and at least 40 VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients in the VKA treatment group.

Given a treatment period of at least 3 months, but no longer than 9 months, the number of patients available for analysis decreases over time and the statistical interpretations focus on analyses of data up to 12 weeks of treatment. The safety data were evaluated using descriptive statistics. For safety laboratory assessments, the randomization visit was regarded as baseline. Fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer is presented by median values (interquartile range given for measurements at 12&#x02013;36 weeks on treatment) by treatment and time. All individual <sc>d</sc>-dimer values have been used to calculate the descriptive statistics presented.

Diarrhoea and flatulence were more common in the AZD0837 groups compared with VKA, without any dose&#x02013;response relationship, and nausea was as common as with VKA. The episodes of diarrhoea most commonly started soon after initiation of study treatment, lasted for 1&#x02013;3 days, and were of mild intensity.</p><p>A greater proportion of patients in the AZD0837 treatment groups (6.7&#x02013;12.5%) discontinued study treatment than in the VKA treatment group (1.6%). The most common reasons for discontinuation were gastrointestinal disorders.</p><p>As expected, since the study was not powered to look at stroke and systemic embolic events, few events were reported. These included ischaemic stroke (two on AZD0837 150 mg od, one on VKA), transient ischaemic attack (one on AZD0837 200 mg bid, one on VKA), and systemic embolus (one on AZD0837 150 mg od). There were also few events with deep vein thrombosis (one on AZD0837 150 mg od, one on AZD0837 200 mg bid) and pulmonary embolism (one on AZD0837 450 mg od, one on VKA). Among the AEs of cardiac origin, three myocardial infarctions were reported (one on AZD0837 300 mg od, one on AZD0837 450 mg od, and one on VKA).</p><p>There were six deaths in the trial, three on treatment (one on AZD0837 and two in the VKA group) and three during follow-up. None of the deaths were judged by the study investigator to be a result of the study medication. On treatment, one patient taking AZD0837 (150 mg od group) died from heart failure, 3 days after randomization, and two patients in the VKA group died from sudden death and pulmonary embolism, respectively. Three deaths occurred in the AZD0837 groups during follow-up; one because of pulmonary embolism (150 mg od group, on VKA when she died), one because of intracranial haemorrhage following a skull fracture (300 mg od group, on VKA when he died), and one because of circulatory collapse after a ruptured gastric ulcer (450 mg od group, no information about anticoagulant treatment at time of death was available).</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Safety laboratory assessments</title><p>There was an increase from baseline in mean S-creatinine of approximately 10% in AZD0837-treated patients. Serum creatinine generally returned to baseline levels following cessation of therapy. Serum cystatine level, a better measure of glomerular filtration rate, was stable for both AZD0837 and VKA treatment. No consistent change or increase in urinary albumin and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio was seen in the AZD0837 treatment groups compared with the VKA group (data not shown).</p><p>The incidence of ALT &#x02265;3&#x000d7;ULN was 2.3% for AZD0837-treated patients and 1.6% for VKA-treated patients, with no dose-dependency found across the AZD0837 treatment groups. One patient (in the AZD0837 200 mg bid group) had elevations of ALT &#x02265;3&#x000d7;ULN, bilirubin &#x02265;2&#x000d7;ULN, alkaline phosphatase, and &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase, without any symptoms.

investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic efficacy of four doses of an extended-release formulation of the oral anticoagulant AZD0837 in the AF population. This was an exploratory study and conclusions are therefore based on descriptive statistics rather than formal statistical testing. There was a trend towards less bleeding with the 150 mg od and 300 mg od doses of AZD0837 compared with VKA. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with serious AEs in the 150 mg od and 300 mg od dose group was lower than with the two higher doses of AZD0837 and similar or lower compared with VKA. An anticoagulant effect was seen with all doses of AZD0837. All doses of AZD0837 suppressed fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels in VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients, but the 150 mg dose appeared to decrease <sc>d</sc>-dimer to a lesser extent than higher doses. Based on this assessment of safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics, AZD0837 300 mg od was regarded as the most favourable dose used in this study.</p><p>Bleeding events occurred with an overall low frequency and with few major bleeding events. Numerically fewer major and clinically relevant minor bleeding events were reported in the AZD0837 150 mg od and 300 mg od groups compared with the AZD0837 450 mg od, 200 mg bid and VKA groups, in the whole cohort. Most major bleedings were reported among the VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients. This group would be expected to be more sensitive to anticoagulant-related bleeding events, given that prior VKA takers would be more &#x02018;anticoagulant-tolerant&#x02019;, since any tendency to bleeding would have become apparent prior to entering this trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Overall, treatments were well tolerated, with a similar proportion of patients with any AE in each treatment group. A somewhat higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders with AZD0837, e.g. diarrhoea and flatulence, was observed both in this study and also in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C12">12</xref></sup> The proportion of patients withdrawing due to AEs was higher in the AZD0837 groups than in the VKA group. However, it should be considered that the study was open to investigational drug allocation, and more withdrawals on AZD0837 could be expected because of more stringent withdrawal criteria in the protocol for this new drug and because of investigator bias to more likely withdraw a new treatment than a well-known routine treatment. No difference with respect to serious AEs of a cardiac origin between AZD0837 and VKA was observed. While the study was not powered to look at stroke and systemic embolic events, few events were reported.</p><p>As previously observed in patients receiving AZD0837,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C12">12</xref></sup> an increase of approximately 10% in mean serum creatinine was noted in this study. A study in elderly healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C14">14</xref></sup> showed that AZD0837 has no effect on glomerular filtration rate as assessed by iohexol clearance. The effect on creatinine associated with AZD0837 is suggested to be caused by an inhibition of active renal tubular creatinine secretion via the human organic cation transporter 2 protein, as seen in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Inhibition of active tubular secretion has been observed with other drugs such as cimetidine. In the current study, cystatine C, which is a more sensitive marker for glomerular filtration rate than creatinine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C15">15</xref></sup> and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio was not significantly changed with AZD0837 (data not shown). The elevation in serum creatinine is unlikely to pose a clinical problem given its modest magnitude and since it does not appear to be related to an effect on glomerular filtration rate.</p><p>After administration of another oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran (active form, melagatran), an increase in ALT was observed;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C17">17</xref></sup> therefore liver function was extensively followed in this study. The incidence of ALT &#x02265;3&#x000d7;ULN for AZD0837 patients combined was 2.3% and for VKA patients was 1.6%. This may appear high in both groups (usually less than 1% for VKA), but may be explained by a fairly large proportion of patients with high ALT levels at baseline, as the exclusion criterion allowed ALT elevations up to 3&#x000d7;ULN in contrast to, for example, the Phase II study of stroke prevention in AF with the oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C18">18</xref></sup> where a &#x0003e;2&#x000d7;ULN limit was used as an exclusion criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C18">18</xref></sup> Results of the present study indicate no evidence of a clinically relevant liver signal with AZD0837 at any of the doses investigated, in agreement with previous findings with the immediate-release formulation of AZD0837<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C12">12</xref></sup> and the Phase II study with dabigatran etexilate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C18">18</xref></sup> Together, these results suggest that the liver function abnormalities leading to the withdrawal of ximelagatran from the market do not appear to be a class effect of oral direct thrombin inhibitors.</p><p>AZD0837 is rapidly metabolized to the active form, AR-H067637, which has a half-life of approximately 9&#x02013;14 h in healthy volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C11">11</xref></sup> At the studied doses, the range of median plasma concentrations of AR-H067637, predominately taken at pre-dose, was approximately 0.3&#x02013;0.6 &#x000b5;mol/L. The anticoagulant effect was demonstrated by the observed prolongation of APTT and ECT coagulation times. Activated partial thromboplastin time was increased by approximately 50%, while the more sensitive ECT assay increased three- to four-fold compared with baseline. The interpatient variability in exposure of the active form was moderate. Relatively small fluctuations during a dosing interval were observed with both od and bid dosing of AZD0837 in the extended-release formulation. In each dose group, the plasma exposure of the active form and the level of anticoagulation assessed as APTT and ECT were stable during the 9-month treatment period.</p><p>Fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer, used as a marker of thrombogenicity, was analysed in the study to gain more knowledge of the antithrombotic properties of the drug, and for dose guidance. The use of fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer is not an established surrogate for clinical efficacy in AF. Although the biomarker has limitations, increased <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels have been detected in patients when changing from sinus rhythm to paroxysmal AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C19">19</xref></sup> Additionally, even though high levels of fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer are not necessarily caused by fibrin formation in a thrombus in the atrium of the heart, low levels could be helpful in excluding the presence of left atrial appendage thrombi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C20">20</xref></sup> Measurement of <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels has shown large variability, which was also observed in the present study. In spite of its limitations and being a non-standardized indirect marker of thrombogenesis, the concept has previously been used to test the benefits on thrombogenesis of different antithrombotic regimens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C21">21</xref></sup> and has been proposed in recent recommendations from a consensus conference organized by the German Atrial Fibrillation Competence NETwork and the European Heart Rhythm Association on outcome parameters for trials in AF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C22">22</xref></sup> In the paper by Kamath <italic>et al.</italic>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C7">7</xref></sup> indices of thrombogenesis (including <sc>d</sc>-dimer) and platelet activation were used to determine the effects of warfarin compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel combination therapy in a randomized trial. From that trial, it was concluded that warfarin suppressed biomarkers of thrombogenesis, whereas aspirin plus clopidogrel was ineffective, although some platelet-activated indices were suppressed. Kamath <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C7">7</xref></sup> concluded that aspirin plus clopidogrel therapy was unlikely to provide adequate thromboprophylaxis in AF patients, a clinical observation subsequently confirmed in the ACTIVE-W trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C8">8</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, the overall proportion of patients in INR range 2.0&#x02013;3.0 during weeks 6&#x02013;36 was 57&#x02013;68%. This is a good level of control compared with the real-life situation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C25">25</xref></sup> and similar to that achieved in other clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C26">26</xref></sup> However, it may still not be ideal since a better protection from vascular events has been shown in patients where INR was controlled &#x0003e;65% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP318C26">26</xref></sup> This illustrates that keeping VKA in range is a challenge even in clinical trials.</p><p>We found that AZD0837 at doses of 300 mg od, 450 mg od, and 200 mg bid suppressed fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels to a similar extent as VKA (INR 2.0&#x02013;3.0) in VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients, whereas 150 mg od appeared to cause less suppression of fibrin <sc>d</sc>-dimer levels compared with VKA. In the VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients, there were reductions from baseline for all dose groups of AZD0837 and VKA. Because of the repeated measurements every second week, the onset of effect during the first 8 weeks was clearly demonstrated in the VKA-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The patients already on VKA treatment at enrolment had suppressed <sc>d</sc>-dimer already and therefore could not, as expected, be further suppressed. These observations suggest that AZD0837 needed to be at an exposure corresponding to the 300 mg od dose in this study or above to have similar therapeutic efficacy to VKA in reducing thrombogenesis amongst AF patients. Together with information from previous clinical studies, data from this dose-guiding study are used in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling work for dose selection.</p><p>This study is limited by the relatively short period of exposure of AZD0837. However, many of the AZD0837-treated patients who completed the current protocol continued in an extension trial (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</uri> identifier: NCT00645853), which will give additional data on prolonged administration of AZD0837.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this Phase II dose-guiding study show that all tested doses of AZD0837 were generally well tolerated, and suggest that AZD0837 at an exposure corresponding to the 300 mg od dose provides a similar suppression of thrombogenesis at a potentially lower bleeding risk compared with dose-adjusted VKA.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding is provided by <funding-source>AstraZeneca</funding-source>.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> the clinical study presented here was sponsored by AstraZeneca.</p><p>A.L.P., E.C.J., U.E., and K.F.C.W. are employees of the sponsor with stock ownership.
