oxygen and nutrient supply, which results in symptoms such as facial muscle weakness,
one-sided extremity muscle weakness, gait difficulty, dizziness, and loss of balance and
control<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diminished motor skills lead to use of non-paretic extremities for extended periods of
time, which causes muscle weakening on the paretic side relative to the non-paretic side.
This results in muscle imbalances, body asymmetry, and impaired balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
reduced lower extremity motor skills lead to impaired gait and balance, which increases the
risk of falls<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is the ability to
maintain a center of gravity and equilibrium during body movements; it is a complicated and
dynamic process of controlling and maintaining posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Falls are defined as
sudden postural changes that result in an inadvertent drop to the floor, ground, or lower
level. Diminished balance greatly increases the risk of accidents associated with falls<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have reported the effects of direct trunk, treadmill, and sling exercises
on improving balance and preventing falls<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Jung and Lee proposed the development
of additional balance-training programs intended to reduce falls<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Bilateral upper extremity activities require the unaffected upper extremities to guide the
affected upper extremities in order to improve mobility and trunk control in the affected
limbs<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Researchers have also reported
that bilateral upper extremity activities reduce stiffening of damaged arms and associated
reactions during passive movements and also induced symmetrical movements to activate trunk
activity<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hodge et al. observed that
trunk muscles are activated before movement of upper extremities through the feed-forward
system, and Lehman et al. reported that movement of upper extremities in diverse
environments was associated with muscle activity in the rectus abdominis, external oblique,
internal oblique, and erector spinae muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are few studies on the
effects of trunk-control enhancement through bilateral upper extremity exercises on balance
and the risk of falls in stroke patients. Therefore, the present study examined the effects
of bilateral upper extremity exercises on trunk control, balance, and risk of falls in
stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 patients diagnosed with unilateral brain damage based on computed tomography

This study was approved by the Daegu Fatima Hospital Institutional Review
Board and informed consent was obtained from each subject after fully explaining the study
purpose.</p><p>The study subjects were randomly divided into experimental and control groups containing 15
subjects each, who underwent bilateral upper extremity activities and conventional
rehabilitation, or nervous-system rehabilitation treatments, respectively. The experimental
group underwent nervous system rehabilitation treatment and the bilateral upper extremity
activity program for 30 minutes at a time, three times per week for four weeks, for a total
of 12 sessions. The control group underwent nervous system rehabilitation treatment for the
same duration and number of sessions. Four bilateral upper extremity activities were
performed in a specific order. Subject trunk control and balance were evaluated before and
after the nervous system rehabilitation treatment and bilateral upper extremity activity
program using the trunk impairment scale (TIS) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS).</p><p>The bilateral upper extremity exercises used in the experimental group were based on the
method presented by Lee et al., except that the position was changed from seated to
standing. The exercise methods are described below<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a ready-position to perform the exercises, each patient stood with feet shoulder-width
apart. Each bilateral upper extremity activity was performed 10 times per set for a total of
three sets. There was a resting period after each set to avoid patient pain and fatigue.
During each exercise, the therapist verbally instructed patients to use their affected
extremities rather than their unaffected extremities. The bilateral upper extremity
activities were as follows:</p><p>1. Patients were instructed to place both hands, with fingers locked, so that they were
located on the sagittal plane of the body; they were then instructed to bend their arms in
the vertical direction until the affected-side shoulder joint reached 90&#x000b0;. The patients then
slowly brought both hands back down to the original position.</p><p>2. Patients were instructed to place their hands, with fingers locked, comfortably on the
sagittal plane of the body, to bend the arms 45&#x000b0; in the diagonal direction to the unaffected
side, until the affected-side shoulder joint reached 90&#x000b0;, and then to slowly bring their
hands back down. At that time, patients were instructed to look at the end of their hands
while turning their trunks naturally.</p><p>3. Patients were instructed to place their hands, with fingers locked, comfortably on the
sagittal plane of the body, to bend the arms 45&#x000b0; toward a diagonal direction to the affected
side, until the affected-side shoulder joint reached 90&#x000b0;, and then to slowly bring their
hands back down. At that time, patients were instructed to look at the end of their hands
while turning their trunks naturally.</p><p>4. Patients were instructed to place their hands, with fingers locked, comfortably on a
table and to extend the elbow joints of both arms against the therapist&#x02019;s manual resistance
to stretch the arms forward. At that time, the therapist applied the minimum possible manual
resistance.</p><p>During all exercises, the therapist stood on the affected side of the patients in order to
protect patient safety and prevent falls.</p><p>In the present study, the TIS was used to objectively evaluate trunk control in chronic
stroke patients. The TIS contains 17 sub-items in three categories: static sitting balance,
dynamic sitting balance, and coordination. This tool offers high reliability and validity
and can be used to evaluate the degree of trunk motor impairment after stroke<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The highest possible TIS score is 23
points, with 0&#x02013;7 possible points for static sitting balance, 0&#x02013;10 points for dynamic sitting
balance, and 0&#x02013;6 points for coordination. The BBS, the reliability and validity of which
have been recognized, was used to examine balance before and after exercise<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS consists of 14 items with 0&#x02013;4
points applied to each item, for a total possible score of 56 points.</p><p>The results were analyzed by using PASW Statistics for Windows, version 18.0. Wilcoxon
signed ranks tests were used to compare the non-parametric TIS and BBS scores before and
after interventions. Mann-Whitney tests, which are also non-parametric, were used to compare
the effects of the interventions between groups. The statistical significance level &#x003b1; was
set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Statistically significant differences (p&#x0003c;0.05) were observed in both experimental and

either only conventional rehabilitation treatment or underwent bilateral upper extremity
exercises along with conventional rehabilitation, respectively, in order to measure the
effects of bilateral upper extremity activities on trunk control and balance in chronic
stroke patients, using the TIS. The BBS is a balance-evaluation tool, while the TIS provides
guidelines for determining stroke patient trunk-function levels and treatment. Since
impaired balance is closely related to falls, enhancing the sense of balance can prevent
falls<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A prior study on the
usefulness of the TIS to predict falls in stroke patient suggested that patients with better
trunk control and dynamic balance abilities are less likely to experience falls, and that
trunk control and dynamic balance are closely related<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both the experimental and control groups showed significant differences in BBS and TIS
scores before and after the interventions. This indicates that both conventional
rehabilitation treatment and bilateral upper extremity exercises are effective in improving
stroke patient trunk control and balance, and are thus helpful for fall prevention.</p><p>Comparisons between groups revealed significant differences in the BBS and TIS items for
dynamic balance and coordination. Therefore, bilateral upper extremity activities may be
helpful for enhancement of dynamic balance and coordination. This finding is consistent with
the results of previous studies indicating that stroke patient trunk control affects TIS
items related to dynamic balance and coordination<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Enhancement of trunk control
through bilateral upper extremity activities is thus believed to provide enhanced dynamic
balance and coordination.</p><p>A previous study of the relationship between chronic stroke patient precursor fall motions
and physical functions reported that TIS-based dynamic balance was the most important
variable among balance-related fall-precursor motions<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bilateral upper extremity activities may help to prevent falls by
enhancing this balance.</p><p>Trunk-control training and balance enhancement are indispensable processes for improving
stroke patient functions; and trunk-control enhancement leads to improved balance, which is
a required for fall prevention: increased balance decreases the probability of experiencing
a fall. Therefore, the bilateral upper extremity activities described in the present study
may increase balance and prevent falls by enhancing trunk control. However, the small number
of subjects in this study prevents generalization of the results. More studies on bilateral
upper extremity activities involving more patients are therefore necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">World Health Organization (WHO)
