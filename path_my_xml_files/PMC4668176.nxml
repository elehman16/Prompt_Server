exercises based on diaphragmatic breathing on pulmonary function, abdominal fitness, and
movement efficiency. [Subjects] Thirty-two physically active, healthy males were randomly
assigned to an experimental group (n = 16) and a control group (n = 16). [Methods] The
experimental group combined diaphragmatic breathing exercises with global stretching
postures, and the control group performed common abdominal exercises (e.g., crunch, plank,
sit-up), both for 15 minutes twice weekly for 6 weeks. Pulmonary function (measured by
forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and peak expiratory flow) and
abdominal fitness (measured with the American College of Sports Medicine curl-up [cadence]
test and the Functional Movement Screen<sup>TM</sup>) were evaluated before and after the
intervention. [Results] Significant changes in curl-up (cadence) test scores, Functional
Movement Screen scores, and all pulmonary parameters were recorded in the experimental
group at the posttraining assessment, whereas in the control group, no significant
differences over baseline were observed in any parameters. [Conclusion] Compared with
traditional abdominal exercises, core stabilization exercises based on breathing and
global stretching postures are more effective in improving pulmonary function and
abdominal fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Respiratory parameters</kwd><kwd>Core stability</kwd><kwd>Diaphragmatic breathing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In recent years, abdominal muscle training has gained increasing popularity, and exercises
like &#x0201c;crunches&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;planks&#x0201d; have become an integral part of both fitness and rehabilitation
programs. Abdominal training serves to improve core stability, which is the ability to
strengthen the lumbopelvic complex and transfer forces from the upper to the lower limbs of
the body while maintaining the spine in a neutral position<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; region of the
body has been anatomically described as a box, with the abdominals at the front, spinal and
gluteal muscles at the back, the diaphragm on the top, and the pelvic floor and hip muscles
on the bottom<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, the core
muscles, which form the primary muscle group for maintaining spinal stability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, can be divided into two groups according to
their functions and attributes: local system and global system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The most common traditional exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>
and training methods to enhance abdominal strength and stability employ body weight
exercises consisting of static or dynamic contractions in various body positions (e.g.,
supine, lateral), starting with isolated movements and then continuing through with more
complex sequences<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> such as crunches, sit-ups, and planks (prone or lateral). However,
such exercises, especially the crunch, are performed with repeated flexions and lateral
bending motions that produce vertebral compression at high lumbar overloads and therefore
may be injurious for the spine<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Correct breathing (especially as it involves the respiratory muscles) is vital to abdominal
training because respiratory muscles are directly involved during common core stability
exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. DePalo et al. found that
the diaphragm is actively recruited in many resistance training exercises, including
sit-ups<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies demonstrated
that the respiratory muscles are involved in a variety of activities in which respiration is
not primarily involved<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because breathing is one of the most basic patterns
directly related to human movement<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, as
seen in neonates<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, inefficient breathing may result in muscular imbalance and motor
control alterations that can affect general motor quality<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To our knowledge, few publications to date have evaluated the impact of breathing in
relation to abdominal exercises. Our hypothesis was that exercises based on a combination of
global stretching postures, which are advantageous for improving respiratory apparatus
efficiency<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and breathing exercises
may exert a concurrent positive effect on core function and body movement. The aim of this
study was to evaluate whether, as compared with a training protocol of common exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, abdominal training plus breathing
exercises would more greatly enhance abdominal fitness, quality of movement, and respiratory
function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All participants gave their written informed consent after having been informed about the
objectives and scope, procedures, risks, and benefits of the study. Participation was
voluntary, and withdrawal from the study was permitted at any time. All procedures were
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; the study protocol was approved
by the university&#x02019;s institutional review board.</p><p>The study sample comprised 32 healthy male nonsmokers without pulmonary disease or a
history of low back pain (Experimental group [EG] n = 16, mean age 30 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;years, height 1.73
&#x000b1; 3 m, weight 67 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;kg; control group [CG], n = 16, mean age 28 &#x000b1; 3&#x02005;years, height 1.76 &#x000b1; 2
m, weight 70 &#x000b1; 3&#x02005;kg). Before the start of the study, all subjects engaged in regular
physical activity at least 3 times per week with a training regimen that included
medium-intensity aerobic activity (65&#x02013;75% heart rate maximum) for at least 45 minutes and a
resistance training program that included free-weight and machine exercises to 60&#x02013;70% of one
repetition maximum (1RM) for 2 days per week. The subjects were matched and randomly
assigned to two groups as determined by a chance process (a random number generator on a
computer) that could not be predicted. Each group performed the assigned exercise protocol
for 15 minutes twice weekly. Data were collected before and after 6 weeks of training. No
other physical exercise, aside from that specified for the purposes of this study, was
performed during the study period.</p><p>Respiratory measurements were taken with the subjects comfortably seated and the trunk at a
90&#x000b0; angle. Pulmonary function was measured with a portable spirometer (Pony FX, Cosmed,
Rome, Italy) while the subjects were wearing a nose clip. The spirometer volume was
calibrated with a 3 L syringe before each test. The test was repeated three to five times to
obtain at least two acceptable trials (variability &#x0003c;100&#x02005;mL), with a 2-minute rest
interval between the trials to ensure adequate recovery. The best trial result for each
subject was used for analysis. Respiratory measurements were taken according to general
guidelines<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A single experienced investigator interpreted the data according to established
guidelines<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> to obtain a target value
for each subject and to ensure that the maneuver had been performed correctly. Forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and peak
expiratory flow (PEF) were evaluated.</p><p>The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) curl-up (cadence) test and the Functional
Movement Screen (FMS)<sup>TM</sup>, two simple, practical, valid, and reliable tests<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>,
were used to assess abdominal muscle fitness. The ACSM curl-up (cadence) test evaluates
local muscular endurance of the abdominal muscle groups, which are important for good
posture and performing various daily tasks. The FMS<sup>TM</sup> evaluates the efficiency of
basic human motion, for example, as during breathing; a proper breathing pattern in turn
influences movement efficiency<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ACSM curl-up (cadence) test protocol is carried out with the subject lying on his or
her back on a mat with knees bent at a 90&#x000b0; angle and feet on the floor. The arms are
extended to the sides with the fingers touching a piece of masking tape. A second piece of
tape is placed 12&#x02005;cm beyond the first piece. For this study, the metronome was set to 40
beats per minute. At the first beep, the subject lifts his or her shoulder blades off the
mat by flexing the spine until the fingertips reach the second piece of tape. At the next
beep, the subject slowly returns the shoulder blades to the mat by flattening the lower
back. The subject performs as many curl-ups as possible without stopping, up to a maximum of
75 repetitions<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FMS<sup>TM</sup>, developed by Cook &#x00026; Burton<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, consists of seven patterns: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line
lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotary
stability. Movement competency is graded on a scale from 0 to 3 points based on how the
tasks are accomplished: 0 indicates movement with pain, 1 indicates inability to perform the
pattern, 2 indicates pattern performed with compensations or imperfections, and 3 indicates
pattern performed as directed. Instruction and administration of the FMS<sup>TM</sup> were
carried out by a certified FMS<sup>TM</sup> instructor according to published
guidelines<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The two training protocols were administered for 15 minutes twice per week for 6 weeks in
both groups; all exercises were performed after a standardized 10-minute warm-up consisting
of cycling on a stationary bike. The EG exercises were focused on achieving and maintaining
a proper diaphragmatic breathing pattern for 2&#x02013;3 seconds during inspiration and 8&#x02013;10 seconds
during expiration, with a vocal sound emitted to induce active recruitment of the pelvic
floor muscles and deep internal abdominals<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.
To do this, the subject inhales, expanding the lower abdominal region, the side and back of
the abdomen, and the lower ribs. The chest is kept relaxed without pushing out the stomach,
and the head is aligned with the spine to avoid excessive bending of the spine or body
compensations. The exercise sequence is as follows:</p><p>1. The subject lies supine with legs extended and arms overhead. On inhalation, he or she
stretches the arms upward, and on exhalation, produces a sound from the mouth, maintaining
the spine aligned and stretched.</p><p>2. The subject sits with the spine erect, lower limbs elongated, and arms extended in front
of the chest. During exhalation, a vocal sound is produced while elongating the spine more
vertically.</p><p>3. The subject sits in a kneeling position with buttocks resting on his heels and legs
slightly apart; the face is directed forward with the left arm bent overhead. During
exhalation, a sound is produced while starting to bend the body laterally and stretching the
opposite side of the body.</p><p>4. The subject sits in a kneeling position, with one arm bent in front of the eyes and the
other resting on the floor. During inhalation, the trunk is rotated to the right while
maintaining normal spinal curvature. During exhalation, a vocal sound is produced while
keeping the body rotated and elongated.</p><p>The entire routine consists of 2 sets per exercise for 6 repetitions.</p><p>The CG exercises were chosen from a variety of common exercises<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> during which a spontaneous breathing rhythm (1 second for
inspiration and 1 second for expiration) is maintained in the following sequence:</p><p>1. Crunch: The subject lies on his back with knees bent, feet on the floor, and hands
resting on the chest. During inhalation, the shoulders are lifted off the ground; during
exhalation, the subject returns to the starting position.</p><p>2. Crunch with rotation: The subject lies on his back with knees bent and feet on the
floor. During exhalation, the trunk is lifted and rotated; during inhalation, the subject
returns to the starting position.</p><p>3. Supine bridge: The subject lies on his back with knees bent and feet on the floor.
During exhalation, the pelvis is lifted an inch off the floor while pressing into the soles
of the feet. During inhalation, the subject returns the pelvis to the floor.</p><p>4. Prone bridge: The subject begins prone in a &#x0201c;table position&#x0201d; with knees under the hips
and arms under the shoulder; on inhalation, the right leg is simultaneously lifted straight
out and behind, and the left arm is lifted straight out in front.</p><p>The routine for exercise numbers 1 and 2 consisted of two series of 15 repetitions each.
Exercise numbers 3 and 4 consisted of two series for 10 seconds in isometric contraction.
All sessions were supervised by an expert instructor to ensure that the exercises were
properly performed.</p><p>Data were entered into a personal computer, and all statistical analyses were performed
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences IBM&#x02122; SPSS&#x02122; version 21.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA). All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM ranges. Results were tested for
normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Two-way [time (before vs. after) 2 group (EG
vs. CG)] repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to measure differences in
respiratory parameters, ACSM curl-up (cadence) test scores, and FMS scores, followed by
Tukey&#x02019;s test. A dependent-measure t-test was used to determine pre- and posttest differences
between the groups. Significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. Partial eta squared (Part
&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>) effect size was used to estimate the magnitude of the difference within
each group; the thresholds for small, moderate, and large effects were defined as 0.01,
0.06, and 0.14, respectively<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All subjects completed the assigned training routine. There was no significant difference

The EG improved by 34.3%, from 40 &#x000b1; 1.01 to 54 &#x000b1; 1.1 (p&#x0003c;0.05) on the ACSM curl-up
(cadence) test, whereas the increase in the number of repetitions was lower in the CG (39 &#x000b1;
2.8 to 43 &#x000b1; 3.4; p&#x0003c;0.05). After 6 weeks of training, there was a significant difference
of +25.6% (p&#x0003c;0.05) with a &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; effect size (0.12) in the EG as compared with the CG.
There was a significant difference in the FMS scores (11 &#x000b1; 2.6 arbitrary unit&#x02005;au,
pretraining vs. 16 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;au posttraining; p&#x0003c;0.05) in the EG as compared with the CG, in
which improvements were smaller (11.0 &#x000b1; 0.3&#x02005;au pretraining vs. 11.7 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x02005;au posttraining).
A significant increase of +41% (p&#x0003c;0.05) with a &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; effect size (0.13) was seen in the
EG as compared with the CG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main finding of this study is that, compared with traditional exercises, a program
including core exercises performed with a focus on muscular chain stretching and breathing
techniques can lead to greater improvement in respiratory function, abdominal muscle
endurance, and movement efficiency. Furthermore, the results suggest that a series of core
exercises performed with a vocal sound emission can be a valid strategy to enhance proper
diaphragmatic breathing patterns and deep internal abdominal activation<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> much more than
in traditional abdominal routines in which people tend to hold their breath or use chest
wall respiration<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In agreement with published data, our results show that, while traditional core exercises
can improve pulmonary function, improvements are greater with muscular chain stretching in
combination with breathing techniques. This difference was expected because the exercises
were specifically designed to train the respiratory muscles and the diaphragmatic breathing
pattern in particular. Indeed, greater improvement in lung function parameters but also in
fitness test scores was observed in the EG.</p><p>In both groups, the baseline ACSM curl-up (cadence) test and FMS scores were in line with
normative data, whereas after training, the scores on both tests were in the above-normal
average only in the EG<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, the raw scores of the FMS test, whole body
stability and balance patterns, as evaluated for the parameters Rotary Stability and Trunk
Stability Push Up, improved from 1.3&#x02005;au to 2&#x02005;au in the EG, indicating improved body control
due to a better respiratory pattern. In <italic>Shoulder Mobility,</italic> the EG improved
from a medium to the highest score (2.4&#x02005;au before, 3&#x02005;au after training), whereas the CG
remained unchanged with a medium score (2.5&#x02005;au before, and 2.6&#x02005;au after training). The same
trend was noted on the Active Straight Leg Raise test. Concerning whole body patterns (Deep
Squat, Hurdle Step, In Line Lunge), the EG improved from a low to a medium score on each of
the three patterns (1.6&#x02013;2.5&#x02005;au, 1.4 &#x02212;2&#x02005;au, and 1.6&#x02013;2.4&#x02005;au, respectively), whereas most
values remained unchanged in the CG.</p><p>As reported in previous studies, proper diaphragmatic breathing is directly linked to
better functional movement<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, but
combining proper breathing with global stretching postures can produce a greater effect on
such functional parameters, as measured on mobility, stability, and whole body pattern
tests. Regarding the biomechanical aspects of breathing, the expiration phase promotes
active recruitment of the abdominal muscles, contrasting the natural elevation of the rib
cage (induced by raising the arms overhead); to the contrary, elevating the arms raises the
anterior chest wall, makes the thoracolumbar column hyperlordotic, and puts the diaphragm in
an oblique position that inhibits its proper function. During exhalation, the thoracolumbar
spine returns to a more neutral position (opposing the previous hyperlordosis), and the
diaphragm is more horizontal without posterior pelvic tilt<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subject should inhale to expand the lower portion of the
abdominal region, the side and back parts of the abdomen and lower ribs, keeping the spine
aligned and the chest relaxed. Using a correct diaphragmatic breathing pattern promotes
co-contraction of the abdominal muscles in the so-called bracing technique, which provides
trunk stiffness and stability<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When focusing on diaphragmatic breathing, it is important not only to reestablish a correct
respiratory pattern but also to ensure lumbar spine stabilization by increasing
intra-abdominal pressure<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup> and activation of the core structures to transfer forces
from the center of the body to the lower extremities. To produce an economic breathing
pattern, all joints must be centered in a stable position to involve all muscular chains.
The head, eyes, and spinal curves should all be aligned with the pelvis and the hips down to
the knees and feet. This can be achieved with proper diaphragmatic breathing and adequate
muscle tone distribution (as can be trained with EG exercises)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The combined EG exercises may offer several other advantages: first, recruitment of the
deep abdominals increases intra-abdominal pressure and coactivation of the entire abdominal
wall<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, which has a fundamental role in
providing adequate support for spine and trunk stiffness<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, in contrast
with crunches, there are no repeated flexions that could be injurious to the vertebrae<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Third, the spine remains in a neutral
posture<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, so the abdominals can be
trained in an elongated and normal position. In sports or activities of daily living, people
rarely flex the rib cage to the pelvis, thus shortening the rectus abdominis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study has several limitations. The sample size was small, and the subjects did
not belong to a specific population. In addition, electromyographic assessment of the
abdominal muscles was not performed.</p><p>In conclusion, EG exercises that incorporate correct breathing patterns and body
flexibility offer an alternative to traditional abdominal exercises. As such, they may be
useful for coaches or physical therapists when selecting core exercises to improve overall
abdominal fitness and pulmonary function and to retrain correct diaphragmatic breathing and
whole body movements. Further research is needed to compare abdominal breathing with other
core exercises in order to clarify the combination of breath and abdominal exercises in
treating painful disorders (low back pain, neck pain) and improving motor control in fitness
and rehabilitation programs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bliss</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Teeple</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Core stability: the centerpiece of any training
