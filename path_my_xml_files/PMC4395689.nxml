subjects using neurofeedback (NFB) training. [Subjects] Twenty-seven stroke subjects were
randomly allocated to the NFB (n = 13) group and the control group (n=14). [Methods] Two
expert therapists provided the NFB and CON groups with traditional rehabilitation therapy
in 30 thirst-minute sessions over the course of 6 weeks. NFB training was provided only to
the NFB group. The CON group received traditional rehabilitation therapy only. Before and
after the 6-week intervention, a brain wave test and motor free visual perception test
(MVPT) were performed. [Results] Both groups showed significant differences in their
relative beta wave values and attention concentration quotients. Moreover, the NFB group
showed a significant difference in MVPT visual discrimination, form constancy, visual
memory, visual closure, spatial relation, raw score, and processing time. [Conclusion]
This study demonstrated that NFB training is more effective for increasing concentration
and visual perception changes than traditional rehabilitation. In further studies,
detailed and diverse investigations should be performed considering the number and
characteristics of subjects, and the NFB training period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neurofeedback (NFB)</kwd><kwd>Brain wave</kwd><kwd>Visual perception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cognition is defined as information processing in one&#x02019;s brain and ability to judge and make
decisions, and it covers various concepts such as attention, memory, executive planning,
insight, and problem solving<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For normal cognitive function, the integration of sensory
information, visual perception, and language ability is required first, and loss of
attention and of memory impair cognitive function, such as problem solving and reasoning
ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In rehabilitation training program, the adaptive approach, which focuses on recovery of
damaged cognitive function in the brain, is one of the common approaches in cognitive
rehabilitation. It is based on the theory that neuroplasticity reorganizes the damaged
cerebral cortex, and it focuses on recovery of the damaged cognitive function and minimizing
the effects of the damage<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a method of functional brain imaging for brain wave testing, many different innovative
methods of radiological examination including the electroencephalogram, positron emission
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and
single-photon emission computerized tomography have been used, and these methods can be used
to confirm the brain&#x02019;s functional changes by comparison with normal brains<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with other experimental brain
imaging methods, brain wave measurement is a commonly used as a noninvasive method for
analyzing the changes in brain functions directly within a short period of time, and
providing a variety of useful information with data from a short examination<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also an electronic neurophysiological
experiment method that can be used to investigate the brain&#x02019;s functional status in real-time
while focusing on a specific assignment. This is applicable to various patients suffering
from brain damage, alcoholism, and/or depression, and it can be used to analyze brain
functions objectively. It makes it especially easy to observe the process of spatiotemporal
changes, and therefore, it is very useful for measuring cognitive load in real time<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neurofeedback (NFB) brain wave training based on the principle of brain plasticity is a
relatively novel method for cognitive rehabilitation. This method involves training to
adjust brain waves within a specific range, and the optimum brain wave adjustment improves
the level of awakening and affects various functional elements of the patient. Therefore,
understanding brain waves should be among the highest research priorities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The beta wave improves concentration and reaction time when activated with a brain wave
between 12&#x02013;35&#x02005;Hz. Through beta wave activation, NFB training aims to improve cerebral
function by enabling patients to activate this brain wave by reinforcing or suppressing
certain frequencies based on visual and auditory feedback<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous research has
shown that NFB is effective in improving cognitive functions including visual perception,
memory, and concentration in patients with brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injury or
stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, research on cognitive rehabilitation through NFB on
existing stroke patients has been limited to single case studies, and sufficient studies on
its effectiveness and clinical usability have not been conducted.</p><p>This study investigated the changes of a brain wave and visual perception following NFB and
the manner in which these changes affect daily life in stoke patients. Also, we aimed to
indicate the effective therapeutic method to clinicians engaged in the cognitive
rehabilitation of patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants were recruited from among 28 stroke patients who received occupational and
physical therapy and were hospitalized at a General Hospital in Kyeongki province, Republic
of Korea, from June to July 2013. Participant selection criteria included that the patient
should be hemiparalytic from a stroke within the previous 3 months to 1&#x02005;year, be able to
follow verbal instructions, and be able to communicate at a certain level. In addition,
participants were chosen from among patients who were able to perform all the tests and had
experienced light cognitive function failure that was scored between 18 and 23 on the
mini-mental state examination (MMSE). A subject was eliminated if he/she had diplegia, never
attended a school, was biased, or had experienced NFB within the past year. Furthermore, all
subjects who participated in this trial provided a signed written consent form after having
the expected result and the side effects fully explained. Randomization was performed by
drawing an intervention from an envelope. A total of 27 subjects eventually completed the
intervention and testing: 13 from the NFB group and 14 from the control group. NFB training
was conducted over a period of 6 weeks, considering the hospitalization period. As the
participants were recruited successively, the training was conducted over a 9-week period.
The evaluation included measurement of brain waves and visual perception. The control group
received occupational and physical therapy for half an hour 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The
NFB group received the same number of traditional rehabilitation sessions as the control
group with extra NFB training, respectively, for half an hour 5 times a week for 6 weeks.
Exercise was prescribed and supervised by two experienced accredited physical therapists.
All of the protocols used in this study were approved by Sahmyook University. Before
participation, the procedures, risks, and benefits were explained to all of the
participants, who gave their informed consent. The participants&#x02019; rights were protected
according to the guidelines of Sahmyook University.</p><p>To perform the NFB training, a NeuroComp System (Neurocybernetics Inc., Encino, CA, USA),
composed of a repeater, a monitor for the clinician and the patient, computer,
electroencephalography (EEG) sensor, cables, and poles, was used for NFB. The poles used in
NFB training were attached to the scalp, and data were recorded on an oscillograph. The
location of the poles followed the International 10&#x02013;20 Electrode System, and the distance
between each pole was 10&#x02013;20% of the whole circumference<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The NFB training method
used in this research was a beta-SMR training method and was conducted with the patient&#x02019;s
eyes open. The reward forms for the feedback were divided into auditory and visual rewards.
The reward brain wave was set with either an SMR wave (12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz) or mid-beta wave (15&#x02013;18&#x02005;Hz)
depending on the location of the cerebral cortex. The inhibitory brain wave was set with
both a delta wave (0.5&#x02013;4&#x02005;Hz) and high-beta wave (22&#x02013;36&#x02005;Hz)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The training time for a single trial was set at 30 minutes, during
which a 3-minute training module was conducted 10 times.</p><p>For monopolar type training, a pole or NFB sensor was attached to a certain part of the
scalp (C5 or C6) within the lesion area, and the remaining 2 poles were attached to both
ears with the participant seated on a comfortable chair. The patient viewed games through a
monitor for brain wave training. We used 4 games that had a low level of difficulty and were
intriguing including Space Race, Mazes, Island, and Boxlight. Participants played the games
by watching the monitor with the poles attached, and his/her awakening level was controlled.
For the Space Race game, the spaceship was set to move forward and backward depending on
his/her level of brain wave activation.</p><p>A quantitative analysis of the brain wave data was performed using the Complexity 2.0
software (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea). The measured brain wave pattern was
checked for any artifact inflow, and data for 180 seconds obtained from pattern observation
with the NFB system from the raw data of the measured brain excluding the first 10
seconds-were used for the analysis. Since delta waves between the 0.5&#x02013;4&#x02005;Hz are likely to be
contaminated with noise such as eye blinking (2&#x02013;4&#x02005;Hz) and head movement due to an unstable
body position (0.5&#x02013;1&#x02005;Hz), the range of 4&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz from the entire brain wave domain was also
extracted for the analysis. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) filtering method was conducted
to convert the raw data into frequencies.</p><p>FFT shows the contributions of frequency components to the frequency domain. The X axis
represents the frequency and Y axis represents the power value, which shows spectral
analysis of evoked potentials in brain. The output value is the absolute band power, which
is the square of the signal amplitude. The relative band power is the absolute power ratio
of a particular frequency band on values of absolute band power between 0 and 1, and could
be in percentage (0&#x02013;100%). This relative band power analysis was used to adjust for the
difference in skull thickness between test subjects and individual brain waves due to the
degree of tension during measurement. The beta frequency band spans 12 to 30&#x02005;Hz<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The motor-free visual perception test (MVPT) was used for visual perception evaluation. It
contains a total of 36 items with four multiple-choice response options worth 1 point each,
adding up to a maximum score of 36. The MVPT is a standardized evaluation tool for
individuals 18&#x02013;80&#x02005;years of age and measures six different parts of visual perception
functions. There are 5 items for visual discrimination (VD), 5 items for form constancy
(FC), 8 items for visual memory (VM), 11 items for visual closure (VC), and 4 items for
spatial relation (SR). Moreover, the processing time to complete each item is measured for
all items (35 items) except for item 4. The MVPT can be used on patients with damaged
physical function who have difficulty with writing, and the confidence level of test-retest
reliability for the MVPT r=0.77&#x02013;0.83<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS ver. 12.0 was used to calculate the averages and standard deviations. The differences
in the brain wave and visual perception within a group before and after the treatments were
tested using the paired t-test, whereas differences between groups were tested using the
independent t-test. For all data, statistical significance was accepted at values of p &#x0003c;
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of participants are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NFB</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CON</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11/3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.9&#x000b1;7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.6&#x000b1;9.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion side (right/left)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration (months)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.6&#x000b1;3.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.5&#x000b1;2.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.8&#x000b1;2.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.5&#x000b1;3.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All variables are presented as the mean&#x000b1;SD.

than in a steady state, alpha waves are controlled and beta waves are increased;
vitalization of beta wave reflects cognitive function improvement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SMR waves
in beta waves were found to be in an appropriately steady state and to maintain attention
and wakefulness. Promotion of SMR wave activity is also used in a treatment to relieve
impulsivity and involuntary movements<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
SMR-beta wave training is an effective interventional approach for treatment of attention
and cognitive impairment, whereas NFB training supports and improves the neurophysiological
function level.</p><p>Performance of EEG before and after NFB training revealed statistically significant
differences in the NFB group&#x02019;s relative beta wave value and ACQ (p&#x0003c;0.05). Comparison of
the differences before and after the interventions between the two groups revealed
significant differences in the NFB group&#x02019;s relative beta wave values and ACQs compared with
the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). Relative beta wave value went up when attention increased,
and ACQ reflects improvements in attention. The results of this study indicate that the
increased relative beta wave value and ACO resulted in significant improvement compared with
the control group. This was similar to earlier findings. Lopez-Larraz et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that NFB increased cognitive
ability and concentration for various diseases, and Gevensleben et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that NFB using the beta wave is effective for
improvement of concentration, although their research was performed with ADHD patients. In
this study, we observed that NFB led to notable differences in attention and concentration
after the intervention. This difference may have been due to the neurobiological reaction to
NFB, which affects the beta wave and the concentration brain waves. Thus, NFB would be a
prevailing choice for patients who require attention and concentration training.</p><p>Visual perception is a process in which the central nervous system integrates visual
information to adapt to the environment and converts the information to cognitive concepts
for decision-making. This process has a hierarchical structure consisting of oculomotor
control, visual fields, visual acuity, visual attention, visual scanning, pattern
recognition, and visual memory, and the highest visual percptual process in the hierarchy is
visual cognition<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through training of
visual scanning, visuospatial orientation, and visual judgment, the damaged visual
perception functions of stroke patients can be improved to enhance recognition ability and
activities of daily living.</p><p>Regarding visual perception before and after NFB, both the NFB group and control group
showed statistically significant differences in MVPT raw score and processing time. For the
NFB group, there were differences in VD, FC, VM, VC, and SR before and after the
intervention. Comparison of the differences between the two groups revealed significant
differences in the MVPT raw score and processing time (p&#x0003c;0.05). NFB training was found to
be more effective in changing visual perception change compared with traditional
rehabilitation training (p&#x0003c;0.05). The NFB program is considered to have been more
effective in improving visual perception ability because the training was on watching and
focusing with the eyes.</p><p>More research into the development of an attention and concentration training program that
fits the rehabilitation purpose of not only stroke patients but also patients with other
illnesses is necessary. In addition, post-test check-ups should be performed to determine
how long the changes last. Standardized and more elaborate EEG measurement and analysis are
required to provide sufficient evidence for neurofeedback brain wave training.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Serruya</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Kahana</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Techniques and devices to restore
