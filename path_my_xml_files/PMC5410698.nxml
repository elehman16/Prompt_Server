This study explores whether a countrywide disease management program is superior to usual care in reducing adverse health outcomes and improving well-being among community-dwelling adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure who have universal access to advanced health-care services and technologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multicenter open-label trial, 1,360 patients recruited after hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation (38%) or from the community (62%) were randomly assigned to either disease management or usual care. Disease management, delivered by multi-disciplinary teams, included coordination of care, patient education, monitoring disease symptoms and patient adherence to medication regimen, titration of drug therapy, and home tele-monitoring of body weight, blood pressure and heart rate. Patients assigned to usual care were treated by primary care practitioners and consultant cardiologists.</p><p>The primary composite endpoint was the time elapsed till first hospital admission for heart failure exacerbation or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included the number of all hospital admissions, health-related quality of life and depression during follow-up. Intention-to-treat comparisons between treatments were adjusted for baseline patient data and study center.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During the follow-up, 388 (56.9%) patients assigned to disease management and 387 (57.1%) assigned to usual care had a primary endpoint event. The median (range) time elapsed until the primary endpoint event or end of study was 2.0 (0&#x02013;5.0) years among patients assigned to disease management, and 1.8 (0&#x02013;5.0) years among patients assigned to usual care (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.908; 95% confidence interval, 0.788 to 1.047). Hospital admissions were mostly (70%) unrelated to heart failure.</p><p>Patients assigned to disease management had a better health-related quality of life and a lower depression score during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This comprehensive disease management intervention was not superior to usual care with respect to the primary composite endpoint, but it improved health-related quality of life and depression. A disease-centered approach may not suffice to make a significant impact on hospital admissions and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure who have universal access to health care.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00533013">NCT00533013</ext-link>.

Typically, these programs include some or all of the following components: delivery of care by multi-disciplinary teams, patient empowerment and self-care education, coordination of care, reorganization of care delivery systems, use of information systems and reliance on evidence-based practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have shown that, compared to usual care, disease management programs reduced hospital admissions and mortality related to heart failure and to all causes among patients with chronic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, some recent large-scale studies in patients with chronic heart failure failed to show any clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or economic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] benefit of disease management programs over usual care. Some of the conflicting results may be attributed to variations in the types of interventions included in these programs, in patient characteristics and in the quality of care given to patients assigned to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Usual care may be more effective in achieving a good outcome among heart failure patients in health systems that provide universal access to health care.</p><p>In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law enables universal access to primary, secondary and tertiary care and advanced health technologies, which are delivered by four health maintenance organizations.</p><p>We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect of a countrywide comprehensive disease management program among patients with chronic heart failure, insured by Maccabi Health Services, the second largest health maintenance organization in Israel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>In this multicenter open-label randomized trial, we compared the efficacy of a disease management program versus usual care among ambulatory adult patients (age &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) with moderate-to-severe chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II to IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]]. Patients were referred within 2&#x000a0;months after hospital admission for heart failure exacerbation or from the community, by nurse supervisors at the public hospitals or by primary care practitioners and consultant cardiologists in the community, respectively. Screening for study eligibility was carried out in ten designated community heart failure centers. Diagnosis of heart failure was based on typical signs and symptoms and objective echocardiographic evidence of functional or structural abnormality of the heart at rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patients with severe comorbidity, functional or cognitive impairment, or substance abuse were excluded (detailed information on eligibility criteria is available in the study protocol, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>After completing eligibility and baseline assessments and providing signed informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to either disease management or usual care, using a computerized randomization program with a permuted-block design linked to the patients&#x02019; electronic medical record. Randomization was in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by heart failure center. The study safety committee reviewed the randomization process and found no evidence of violation or tampering with the randomization protocol.</p><p>The study was approved by the Maccabi Health Services and the Sheba Medical Center research ethics committees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients enrolled in disease management were assigned to nurses who maintained regular remote contact with them between their scheduled visits to the heart failure centers, either through telephone calls or computer video sessions. During these sessions, the nurses provided comprehensive care and support to the patients and their caregivers, including self-care education, monitoring disease signs and symptoms, titration of heart failure medications following designated protocols, monitoring adherence to the medical therapy and its side effects, coordination of care vis-&#x000e0;-vis other caregivers and counselling in the event of an acute change in health status. All disease management activities were recorded in the patients&#x02019; electronic medical records and supervised by the program director. The initial frequency of remote contacts with patients assigned to disease management was once a week and was further modified according to needs. Patients monitored their body weight, blood pressure and pulse rate daily, after a night's sleep and voiding, using home tele-monitoring equipment (Medic4All&#x000ae;). The tele-monitoring records were transmitted to the patients&#x02019; electronic medical records. Automatic alerts were generated and presented to the nurses if the signals were out of the patient-specific preset range.</p><p>The frequency of follow-up visits at the heart failure centers was determined according to the patients&#x02019; needs, but was not less than once every 6&#x000a0;months. During these visits, the patients were evaluated by cardiologists and nurses, and their treatment plan was modified accordingly. Counselling by dietitians and social workers at the heart failure center was provided when needed.</p><p>Patients assigned to usual care were referred to their primary care practitioners, after clinical assessment and provision of a treatment plan by cardiologists at the heart failure center. In general, ambulatory heart failure patients insured with Maccabi Health Services are cared for by primary care practitioners and consultant cardiologists. The frequency of visits to the cardiologists was determined according to the patients&#x02019; needs. In addition, patients assigned to usual care were evaluated every 6&#x000a0;months by cardiologists at the heart failure center. These patients did not receive any intervention from the nurses at the call center, or from dietitians and social workers at the heart failure centers (detailed information is also available in the study protocol, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study assessment and endpoints</title><p>All patients were evaluated at the heart failure centers at baseline and at 6-month intervals thereafter. These assessments included obtaining patient history and patient-completed questionnaires, a 6-minute walk test and NYHA classification. From 2009 onwards, assessments included also point-of-care brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing (using Triage&#x000ae; BNP Test and Triage&#x000ae; MeterPro, Alere, Switzerland). Except for the baseline evaluation, assessors were not blinded to the patients&#x02019; assigned intervention.</p><p>The primary composite endpoint was the time to first hospital admission for heart failure or to death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included the individual components of the primary composite endpoint; the total number of hospital admissions and in-hospital days for heart failure and for all causes; follow-up assessments of a 6-minute walk test, NYHA classification, health-related quality of life assessed with the 36-item short-form questionnaire (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], depression symptoms assessed with the nine-item patient health depression scale (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], BNP levels (in a subset of patients), and purchases of recommended medications for patients with chronic heart failure [i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]].</p><p>Information on hospital admissions and deaths during follow-up was obtained. Discharge summaries, available for 5,748 (99.7%) of 5,766 hospital admissions, were adjudicated by two independent investigators blinded to the patients&#x02019; assigned treatment, and were classified as either related to heart failure (i.e. decompensated heart failure, complications of heart failure or heart failure treatment) or other causes. Disagreement between the assessors occurred for 581 (10.1%) of the hospital discharge summaries, and a third assessment was provided by a third blinded investigator, with the final classification following the majority opinion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Safety committee</title><p>A safety committee, comprising a statistician, cardiologist and epidemiologist, monitored the cumulative event rates of hospital admissions and deaths from all causes among the study participants every 6&#x000a0;months. The committee members were not blinded to the participants&#x02019; assigned intervention. The committee discussions were not disclosed to the investigators during the trial. Guided by a predefined level of statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the mandate of the committee was to provide warning in the event of an excess number of deaths or hospital admissions from all causes in the disease management arm. In practice, no such excess was found and the study continued to its planned conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size consideration</title><p>The planned sample size of 1,200 patients, 600 in each treatment arm, was based on the assumption that 50% of the participants assigned to the usual care arm would be admitted to hospital for heart failure or die during the first 12&#x000a0;months and that the odds ratio (OR) for this primary endpoint was 0.67 for disease management versus usual care. The assumptions were based on a published meta-analysis of previous disease management trials among heart failure patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This sample size provided 90% statistical power, using a two-sided 0.05 significance level. The final study sample included 1,360 patients, to account for drop-outs and the time needed for organizational learning and adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was performed according to a pre-specified plan. Unadjusted comparisons between the two treatment groups with respect to the primary composite endpoint (time to first hospital admission due to heart failure or death from any cause) and its two individual components were made using the log-rank statistic.</p><p>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the two treatment groups with respect to the primary composite endpoint and its components, adjusted for baseline characteristics (sex, age, heart failure center, 6-minute walk test and NYHA classification). In supportive analyses, adjustment was also made for other baseline variables that were significantly associated with hospital readmission due to heart failure or death from any cause (including source of recruitment, the main underlying cause of heart failure, body mass index, renal failure and hemoglobin level). The median time to first hospital admission for heart failure and its 95% confidence interval were estimated in the two treatment groups, standardized to the most common patient baseline profile using an inverse transformation of the predicted survival curve at 50%. Predefined interactions between the treatment group and baseline variables were also tested. The proportional hazards assumption for the treatment group was tested in all of these models.</p><p>To compare hospital admission data recorded every 6&#x000a0;months in the two treatment groups, non-linear mixed models were used with a random intercept for each subject, allowing for correlation between repeated measurements of the same subject. Due to the over-dispersion commonly seen in hospital admission data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a negative binomial model was used. Using the NLMIXED procedure (SAS version 9.4), this method was implemented for the following four secondary outcomes: number of hospital admissions and days of hospitalization, for heart failure and all causes. These models were adjusted for baseline characteristics and time since randomization in intervals of 6&#x000a0;months, and effectively dealt with the varying length of follow-up among individuals due to censoring. The coefficient of the treatment group variable represented the log incidence rate ratio for 6&#x000a0;months. Absolute differences between treatment groups in the number of hospital admissions and in-hospital days over the first 2&#x000a0;years were calculated from the estimated incidence rate ratio and the mean outcome in the usual care group.</p><p>Other secondary endpoints were dichotomously categorized to represent successful attainment (or not) of a minimal clinically important difference from baseline, as follows: physical component summary and mental component summary scores of SF-36 (&#x02265;2.5 points increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]); NYHA classification (&#x02265;1 class decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]); 6-minute walk test (&#x02265;50&#x000a0;m increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]), and moderate-to-severe depression symptoms at follow-up (PHQ-9 score &#x02265;10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). The treatment OR of success was estimated using a logistic model within the same mixed-model framework described above. Interactions between the treatment group and baseline value of the endpoint were tested.</p><p>Using the Maccabi Health Services database on drug purchases, adherence to medical therapy was defined as the number of days in a 6-month period covered by therapy with ACE-I/ARBs and beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents according to the defined daily dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], classified into five categories (the first category representing no treatment and the second to the fifth categories representing defined daily dose quartiles for patients taking the medication). The treatment OR of attaining a higher level of coverage by drug therapy was estimated using an ordered logistic regression model within the mixed-model framework. The assumption of proportional odds for each cut-point of the adherence variables was tested.</p><p>All analyses were carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle, at a critical two-sided significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants were recruited between August 2007 and June 2011, and followed until death or end of study (July 2012).

The study intervention prolonged the time to first hospital admission for heart failure, especially among patients enrolled after recent hospitalization for heart failure or with ischemic heart failure. There was also a trend, although not statistically significant, towards a reduction in the number of hospital admissions and in-hospital days for heart failure. The intervention was also effective in achieving clinically important improvements in health-related quality of life and it reduced the likelihood of depression.</p><p>The disease management intervention tested in this study was comprehensive and included delivery of care by multi-disciplinary teams within designated heart failure centers and a central call center, home tele-monitoring, employment of information technology to promote sharing of patient information among all caregivers and utilization of standardized care processes. Nevertheless, the intervention did not conclusively reduce the number of hospitalizations due to all causes, nor did it reduce mortality. In this respect, our study confirms the results of recent studies showing little or no effect of disease management in reducing recurrent hospital admissions or mortality in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Much of the marginal effect of disease management interventions tested in controlled trials depends upon the type of care delivered to patients assigned to the control group. In Israel, there is universal access to primary, secondary and tertiary health-care services and advanced health-care technologies. This was reflected by the high proportion of patients receiving evidence-based drug therapy upon recruitment and the small difference between the treatment groups with respect to the number of contacts with cardiologists during follow-up.</p><p>The intervention tested in this study included remote contact with the patients between their scheduled visits to the heart failure centers. Some studies reported that disease management programs that included home visits by nurses were effective in reducing recurrent hospital admissions or deaths among patients recruited after recent hospitalization for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, other studies failed to show the efficacy of such interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Although most patients in our study had at least one hospital admission during follow-up, fewer than half were hospitalized because of heart failure, and heart failure accounted for only 30% of the total hospital admissions. Mejhert et al. reported that among Swedish patients with heart failure, non-cardiac and cardiac hospital admissions accounted for 40% and 30% of the total long-term health-care expenditure, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Patients with heart failure often have other comorbidities, of which the most common are hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This was also the case in our study. Thus, a disease-centerd approach may not suffice to make a significant impact on all-cause hospital admissions and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. A recent systematic review showed that case-management interventions addressing the complex needs of patients with chronic heart failure who had been previously hospitalized for heart failure exacerbation were associated with a 12-month reduction in all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In our study, disease management had no significant effect on the long-term adherence to drug therapy recommended for patients with chronic heart failure. A possible explanation may be the high proportion of patients who were already treated with these medications upon recruitment.</p><p>We found that the study intervention was highly effective in improving patients&#x02019; health-related quality of life and depression symptoms, but these improvements were not associated with objective evidence of improved physical functioning, as tested with the 6-minute walk test. It may be that the psycho-social support delivered during the frequent contacts with the disease management nurses is the main factor in these changes.</p><p>Interestingly, the diagnosis of heart failure, taken from administrative health-care data, was not confirmed in 1,452 (27.4%) patients screened for eligibility in this study. This highlights the importance of reliance on explicit diagnostic criteria, including echocardiographic examination, for the diagnosis of heart failure. A recent systematic review showed a high variability of the positive predictive value of heart failure diagnosis based on administrative data, ranging between 12% and 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study limitations and strengths</title><p>This study was powered to detect a 33% reduction in the hazard for hospital admission for heart failure caused by the disease management intervention. Thus, it may be that the study sample did not provide enough statistical power to detect a smaller effect. In fact, the point estimates for the intervention effect on the total number of in-hospital days and hospital admissions due to heart failure show less than a 33% reduction, and point in this direction.</p><p>The patients assigned to usual care were evaluated by the cardiologists at the heart failure centers every 6&#x000a0;months during follow-up, thus some contamination of the control intervention may be possible. In addition, the follow-up assessments of the patients' NYHA classification and 6-minute walk test were performed by assessors who were not blinded to the patients' assigned intervention. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the two study interventions in patients&#x02019; likelihood of experiencing a clinically important improvement in the 6-minute walk test during follow-up. Thus, this measure may be less prone to biased assessments due to lack of blinding.</p><p>Our study was carried-out in an environment with universal access to high-quality health care. In other health-care systems with barriers to universal access, the study intervention might have proven more effective in reducing hospital re-admissions and deaths.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study included a large sample size with a long follow-up, had a relatively small attrition rate and complete ascertainment of the major study endpoints. The information derived from this study may apply to other countries with similar health-care systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This comprehensive disease management program among ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure was not proven to be superior to usual care with respect to the primary study endpoint, but delayed the time until first hospital admission for heart failure and significantly improved patient-centered outcomes, i.e. health-related quality of life and depression. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of alternative clinical service organization methods in improving the outcomes of ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p>
