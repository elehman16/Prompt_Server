There is a reason to believe that it is inherent in any life linked with consciousness. Although, pain is of considerable significance to all health providers, many patients consider pain and orthodontic treatment to be synonymous and go hand in hand.</p><p>International Association for the Study of Pain describe pain as &#x0201c;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Stedman's Medical Dictionary gives a more complete definition of pain as &#x0201c;an unpleasant sensation associated with actual or potential tissue damage and mediated by specific nerve fibers to the brain, where its conscious appreciation may be modified by various factors&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This definition recognizes that pain may have a noxious transmission component, a psychological component and a very important modulatory component.</p><p>According to O&#x02019;Connor's survey, pain is the greatest dislike during treatment and fourth among major fears and apprehensions prior to orthodontic treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There is an increase in the expression of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide and Substance <italic>P</italic> during the first 2 days after application of an orthodontic force in the rat.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Similarly, clinical human studies show pain symptoms reach the peak approximately 1-2 days after force application.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Many factors like intensity and duration of forces applied, age, gender, the degree of crowding of the arch/arches, patient's psychological background and past experiences affect the extent of the symptoms. Therefore, orthodontic therapy with minimal patient discomfort is essential for an orthodontist to avoid noncompliance.</p><p>One would assume a large volume of research on the treatment related to pain, but unfortunately little is discussed by clinicians and orthodontist. Preoperative use of NSAIDs decrease the intensity of postoperative pain and swelling by inhibiting the &#x0201c;formation&#x0201d; of prostaglandins.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin are first line analgesics which are generally available over the counter. Paracetamol (acetaminophen), which was first described by Von Mering (1893), is used commonly for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Ibuprofen was the first member of propionic acid derivatives to be introduced in 1969. It is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 pathway.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Aspirin introduced in 1895 has been known to be an effective analgesic for many years and is commonly used throughout the world for many different pain conditions.</p><p>This randomized, double-blinded, prospective clinical trial aims at studying pain characteristics after separator placement; to compare the efficacy of various commonly used analgesics in pain management and to determine the efficacy of pre- and post-operative analgesics in pain management.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The proposed study was submitted for ethical committee approval and the same was approved based on ICMR guidelines. A total of 154 patients who attended Department of Orthodontics for fixed orthodontic appliance treatment were selected. Patients and their parents were informed about the procedure and informed consent was obtained for the same. A detailed case history which included past dental, past medical, allergic to any specific drugs was taken for all the patients.</p><p>The selection criteria were as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>The patients and the research assistant were blind to experimental groups. The patients were instructed to take two tablets, one tablet 1 h before separator placement and the other one after 6 h. Separators (AlastiK S-2 separator modules, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) were placed for first molars in all 4 quadrants preferably in the morning between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.</p><p>All patients were provided with a questionnaire which is in a form of seven page booklet that contained 100 mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). The patients were advised to mark the degree of pain as per the instructed time period in VAS. Pain intensity was recorded by the patients 2 h, 6 h after separator placement, bed time on the day of appointment, next day morning, and 2<sup>nd</sup> day morning, 3<sup>rd</sup> day, 7<sup>th</sup> day morning after separator placement. Patients were advised to record the severity of pain with teeth not touching (TNT), biting back teeth (BBT) together, and chewing food (CF). Patients were advised not to take any additional medication during the study period. The filled in questionnaire were collected in subsequent visit. Patients who did not take the given drug or who did not completely fill the questionnaire or who lost/removed the separators were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The above data's were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS IBM version 20 (Chicago, USA) systems.

Maximum pain is perceived on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> day of orthodontic movement and decrease to minor levels after 5 days.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The sources for the pain in connection with orthodontic treatment are primarily due to the periodontal inflammatory reactions and consequent inflammatory reaction in pulpal tissues. The pulp circulation and tissue metabolism and even vitality may be affected or compromised by the applied forces.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>During orthodontic separator placement, the collagen fibers of periodontal ligament are disrupted. Initial healing of wounds in the periodontal ligament begins with blood clot and granulation tissue formation subsequent to necrosis regardless of the type of the periodontal challenge.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] During organization of granulation tissue, vascular, and nervous components[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as new periodontal connective tissue[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] enter the area. Nociceptive nerve fibers of periodontal ligament transmit pain impulses centrally and also release neuropeptides peripherally.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Nerve sprouting within the pulp in response to orthodontic forces, affect the functional properties of the intradental nerves and might potentiate dental pain sensitivity by multiplying the receptor sites.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] All these factors induce pain, which peaks in 1 or 2 days of tooth movement. Hence, it would be appropriate to control pain with NSAIDS.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Measurement of pain</title><p>The VAS is a direct pain intensity scaling method in which the subjects evaluate the level of pain by making a mark on a continuous line. One end of the line means &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and the other end &#x0201c;worst pain.&#x0201d; The advantages of using the VAS over observational, self-report, behavioral, physiological, or verbal rating scales, are the higher sensitivity, reproducibility, and reliability of the direct scaling techniques.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It also allows the use of parametric statistical tests.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] On the other hand, the limitation of VAS is that the recorded values are mostly related to the intensity component of pain.</p><p>In this study, pain started 2 h after separator placement reached to peak level at the bed time and next day morning, approximately 24 h after separator placement. This is in agreement with the results of several other studies. Omur Polat and Karaman[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have reported that pain intensity reached the maximum peak value 24 h after archwire placement.</p><p>Since any orthodontic procedure creates periodontal vasodilatation,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] injury, pain and inflammation, analgesics should be prescribed for the effective control of pain. Preoperative analgesics reduces inflammatory response by effectively controlling prostaglandin production.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In this study, the analgesics taken both pre- (1 h before) and post-operatively (6 h after) created significant reduction in pain intensity compared to the placebo group.</p><p>2 h after separator placement, the patients taking Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Aspirin showed low pain values at TNT, BBT together and CF. This is because of the preoperative analgesic effect, whereas the placebo group felt moderate pain.</p><p>6 h after, analgesics had a good control of pain. Aspirin and ibuprofen group felt mild pain during CF and BBT together, whereas in paracetamol group, the pain was moderate. Placebo started experiencing severe pain. Patients were advised to take postoperative analgesics at this time.</p><p>Visual analog scale scores measured at bed time and next day morning showed good pain control by analgesics. Paracetamol group again had moderate pain on next day morning, particularly during BBT together and CF. This is because of mechanism of action of paracetamol. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis within the central nervous system and has little influence on peripheral prostaglandin synthesis, especially within inflamed tissues.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Placebo group continued with higher pain index at this time interval.</p><p>From 3<sup>rd</sup> day onwards, there was no pain in analgesic groups, whereas the pain slowly reduced in intensity in placebo group.</p><p>Throughout the course, NSAID's (Aspirin and Ibuprofen) elicited good control of pain followed by paracetamol (acetaminophen).</p><p>An analgesic with less side-effects should always be advised for pain management. NSAIDs are contraindicated for patients who have a current history of nephropathy, erosive or ulcerative conditions of the gastrointestinal mucosa, anticoagulant therapy, hemorrhagic disorders, or intolerance or allergy to any NSAID. They also should be avoided during pregnancy because prostaglandins maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus during fetal development. In all cases, where NSAIDs are contraindicated, paracetamol is the conventional nonopioid alternative and it can be given for orthodontic pain management, since it has analgesic efficiency comparable with other NSAIDs.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study was performed to assess the experienced pain as reported by the patients at different times after the placement of separators.
