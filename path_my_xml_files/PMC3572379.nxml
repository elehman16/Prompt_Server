Given the different mechanisms of action of these two agents, combining them has the potential for additive and perhaps synergistic reductions in thromboembolic events but may also lead to increased bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa&#x000ae;; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Ingelheim, Germany) is an oral prodrug that is rapidly converted to dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because of thrombin&#x02019;s multiple roles in coagulation, thrombin inhibitors not only block fibrin formation but also attenuate further thrombin formation and platelet activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dabigatran is subject to conjugation with activated glucuronic acid, yielding pharmacologically active glucuronide conjugates that comprise about 20% of the total dabigatran in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dabigatran is not metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes and does not affect the metabolism of other drugs that utilize this system. However, the prodrug but not dabigatran is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clopidogrel also has been shown to have some affinity for P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Platelet activation can occur via the platelet thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> pathway, the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) pathway and via phosphodiesterase.</p><p>Clopidogrel inhibits the platelet-surface ADP receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub>, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clopidogrel, also a prodrug, has no intrinsic antiplatelet activity and requires hepatic CYP metabolic activation to produce its pharmacologically active metabolite, which irreversibly inhibits ADP receptors on platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Multiple CYP enzymes have been implicated, although CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are more important in the formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Polymorphisms in CYP enzymes may contribute to the high variability in responsiveness to clopidogrel. Studies suggest that a high loading dose of clopidogrel may reduce intra-individual variability and enhance responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], hence use of a clopidogrel 600&#x000a0;mg loading dose is widespread in clinical practice.</p><p>Concomitant use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy is frequent in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Atrial fibrillation patients on anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention commonly have concomitant conditions such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, for which antiplatelet drugs are prescribed. In these patients concerns about increased bleeding risks exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Accordingly, the potential for increased risk of bleeding when the combination of an anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug is taken is addressed in the label of dabigatran etexilate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study was conducted to evaluate whether any pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions exist.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) the PK and PD effects of concomitant administration of multiple doses of clopidogrel 75&#x000a0;mg once daily (qd) (preceded by a loading dose of clopidogrel 300&#x000a0;mg) with multiple doses of dabigatran etexilate 150&#x000a0;mg twice daily (bid) and (2) the PK and PD effects of concomitant administration of single loading doses of clopidogrel (300 or 600&#x000a0;mg) with dabigatran etexilate (150&#x000a0;mg bid). Secondary PD parameters evaluated were activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), thrombin time (TT), inhibition of platelet aggregation as well as effects on capillary bleeding time (CBT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects were healthy males aged 18&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5&#x02013;29.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and judged to be healthy based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests.

The calibration curves for free and total dabigatran covered a range from 1.00 to 400&#x000a0;ng/mL plasma in undiluted samples. The calibration curves were linear over the calibration range and no interference from endogenous compounds was observed. Maximum imprecision and inaccuracy for quality control samples at concentrations of 3, 30, and 320&#x000a0;ng/mL were 6.62 and +5.86%, respectively.

For blood coagulation parameters aPTT, ECT, and TT (PD analyses), &#x0223c;3&#x000a0;mL of blood were collected in sodium citrate monovettes at the time points indicated for PK analyses. The blood samples were centrifuged, frozen, and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C or below. The aPTT, ECT, and TT parameters were analyzed on an MC10PLUS coagulometer using validated methods by BiochemA, Riegel, Germany. aPTT was measured using a kit from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, and the ECT assay utilized ecarin from Pentapharm (Basel, Switzerland).

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation and removed from the red-cell sediment. Approximately 0.5&#x000a0;mL platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from PRP by further centrifugation. Inhibition of platelet aggregation was performed by light transmission aggregometry in citrated PRP, using an 8-channel platelet aggregation profiler (PAP 8) aggregometer (m&#x000f6;Lab, Germany).

Different test and reference treatments were compared by applying the average bioequivalence method. Point estimates for the test/reference ratios and the corresponding 90% CIs were calculated using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on the logarithmic scale regarding PK parameters (multiplicative model) and on the original scale for PD parameters (additive model). The ANOVA model included effects accounting for the following sources of variation: &#x0201c;sequence,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;subject within sequence,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;period,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; (crossover design of part 2). The effect &#x0201c;subject within sequence&#x0201d; was considered as random, whereas the other effects were considered as fixed. For parts 1 and 3 &#x0201c;sequence&#x0201d; was not considered because of the fixed sequence design. Two-sided 90% CIs for the test/reference ratios were interpreted exploratively, and no statistical hypotheses were tested in a confirmatory sense.</p><p>In pilot part 1 and main part 3, the following primary PK and PD parameters were compared intra-individually:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub> of total dabigatran</p></list-item><list-item><p>C<sub>max</sub> and the AUC from 0 to 24&#x000a0;h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>) of clopidogrel and inactive metabolite SR26334</p></list-item><list-item><p>AUEC<sub>IPA,0&#x02013;24</sub> and E<sub>max,IPA,0&#x02013;24</sub></p></list-item></list></p><p>In main part 2, the following primary PK or PD parameters were compared intra-individually:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>AUC<sub>&#x003c4;,ss</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub> of total dabigatran, clopidogrel, and inactive metabolite SR26334</p></list-item><list-item><p>AUEC<sub>IPA,&#x003c4;,ss</sub> and E<sub>max,IPA,ss</sub> (syn. to AUEC<sub>IPA,0&#x02013;24</sub> and E<sub>max,IPA,0&#x02013;24</sub> at steady state)</p></list-item></list></p><p>AUEC and ER<sub>max</sub> of aPTT, ECT, and TT as well as CBT, and safety and tolerability were assessed descriptively as secondary parameters.</p><p>For the CBT individual listings including the baseline value, the maximum value of the post-dose measurements, and the corresponding time of the maximum value were provided. Frequency tables of the three categories (&#x0003c;10, 10&#x02013;30, &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;min) for the maximum CBT values were provided (part 2 and part 3).</p><p>Sample sizes of 8 subjects in part 1 and 12 subjects in part 3 of the trial were considered sufficient to achieve the exploratory aims. The sample size of 24 subjects in part 2 was chosen to ensure that the estimation of ratios is precise. The desired precision is represented by the half-width of the 90% confidence interval of the point estimate on the logarithmic scale. In previous single-dose studies, intra-individual variabilities (gCVs) ranging from about 40 to 50% were observed for PK exposure parameters.

Accordingly, the effect of dabigatran and the PK/PD relationship were essentially the same when dabigatran etexilate was given with or without concomitant clopidogrel. A high loading dose of clopidogrel 600&#x000a0;mg also had no effect on the thrombin-related coagulation markers.</p><p>Clopidogrel inhibits the platelet-surface ADP receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub>, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Dabigatran did not influence the inhibition of ADP-dependent platelet aggregation by clopidogrel. Furthermore, dabigatran alone did not prolong CBT, a measure to assess platelet-driven coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Maximum CBT was clearly prolonged by any treatment regimen that included clopidogrel compared with dabigatran monotherapy. However, there was no difference in CBT between clopidogrel given alone or in combination with dabigatran etexilate. In atrial fibrillation patients, however, from the RE-LY trial, concomitant intake of clopidogrel and dabigatran etexilate led to an increased rate of major and any bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a phase I trial, the first oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) further prolonged CBT by about 40% compared with ASA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Bleeding time with the combination rivaroxaban and clopidogrel was significantly prolonged in four subjects, compared with either drug alone, which increased the overall least square means to 3.77 (90% CI 2.82&#x02013;4.73) times baseline with the combination, compared with 1.13 times baseline (90% CI 0.17&#x02013;2.09) with rivaroxaban and 1.96 times baseline (90% CI 0.10&#x02013; 2.91) with clopidogrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The results with dabigatran observed in this study seem to some extent different from previously observed data with other oral anticoagulants such as ximelagatran and rivaroxaban.</p><p>A high loading dose of clopidogrel 600&#x000a0;mg was associated with an increase (32%) in the bioavailability of dabigatran. Exposure to clopidogrel and SR26334 was similar when clopidogrel was administered alone or with multiple doses of dabigatran etexilate 150&#x000a0;mg bid. The efflux transporter P-gp in the gastrointestinal tract can directly limit oral drug absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; dabigatran etexilate, but not dabigatran, is a substrate for P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Concomitant administration of strong P-gp inhibitors, including quinidine, amiodarone, verapamil, ketoconazole, and clarithromycin, raises dabigatran serum concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Clopidogrel also has been shown to be a substrate of P-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clopidogrel absorption, and thereby formation of its active metabolite, is diminished by P-gp-mediated efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A high loading dose of clopidogrel (either 300 or 600&#x000a0;mg) may have the potential to competitively inhibit intestinal P-gp, causing an increase in dabigatran bioavailability. A high, 600&#x000a0;mg, loading dose of clopidogrel is widely used in clinical practice, especially in acute settings, to reduce intra-individual variability and enhance responsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, this clopidogrel loading dose is given for only 1&#x000a0;day. This transient increase in dabigatran exposure for a single day by about 30% should be taken into consideration particularly in vulnerable patients at high risk of bleeding. However, it remains to be determined whether this effect, which is only observed for the first day of a combination treatment, is likely to have any clinical impact at all.</p><p>Unlike dabigatran, which is not metabolized via CYP isoenzymes, clopidogrel requires hepatic CYP metabolic activation to produce its pharmacologically active metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition to CYP3A4, CYP2C19 is particularly important relative to other CYP enzymes in the formation of the active metabolite of clopidogrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As neither dabigatran nor its prodrug is an inhibitor of any CYP, dabigatran comedication should not diminish the therapeutic efficiency of clopidogrel. In accordance with published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], subjects carrying the ultrarapid metabolizer allele <italic>CYP2C19*17</italic> had a trend to more efficient inhibition of ADP-dependent platelet aggregation. However, in general the <italic>CYP2C19</italic> genotype did not influence PK and PD after comedication with dabigatran etexilate.</p><p>Concomitant administration of dabigatran and clopidogrel did not reveal any unexpected safety findings in the healthy male subjects included in this clinical trial. All AEs observed were of mild to moderate intensity, none were serious, and all had resolved by the end of the study, with the exception of ongoing hemorrhoids in one subject. Reported AEs, including hematoma, hematuria, and rash, were consistent with the labelling of dabigatran and clopidogrel and were not unexpected, even in healthy volunteers. Three bleeding events were potentially related to drug effects on coagulation: two cases of moderate hematoma (one subject given clopidogrel alone; one subject receiving clopidogrel&#x02009;+&#x02009;dabigatran) and one case of moderate hematuria (subject received clopidogrel&#x02009;+&#x02009;dabigatran and subsequently discontinued treatment). However, there was no correlation between the individuals&#x02019; PK data and these bleeding events. Although these results are not conclusive, dabigatran etexilate in this study did not seem to cause any safety issues, whether given alone or in combination with clopidogrel.</p><p>The study was designed as a phase I study in healthy volunteers and aimed to clarify any PK/PD interaction between clopidogrel and dabigatran etexilate. This type of study does not allow any conclusions to be drawn with respect to the clinical effects of long-term use of the combination in atrial fibrillation patients. However, dabigatran etexilate was administered at the therapeutic dose of 150&#x000a0;mg bid, and clopidogrel was administered at dosages used in clinical practice. The designs of the pilot and two main parts of the study were purposefully chosen. The pilot study (part 1) had a fixed-sequence design (multiple doses of dabigatran 150&#x000a0;mg followed by a single dose of clopidogrel) for safety reasons. In the main study, the crossover design was used as is usually done for drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies due to its efficiency, i.e., the comparison between treatments based on a comparison within subjects rather than between subjects (part 2). A washout period of 14&#x000a0;days was considered to be sufficient to separate the three treatments, based on the half-life of dabigatran (8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;h and 14&#x02013;17&#x000a0;h with single- and multiple-dose administrations, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The combination of dabigatran with a high clopidogrel dose (600&#x000a0;mg) warranted a fixed-sequence design (one drug alone followed by the combination) for safety reasons (part 3).</p><p>In summary, steady-state dosing of clopidogrel 75&#x000a0;mg qd (following a 300&#x000a0;mg loading dose) and dabigatran etexilate 150&#x000a0;mg bid demonstrated no effect on dabigatran PK or PD, or its PK/PD relationships (aPTT, ECT, or TT). Similarly, the PK of clopidogrel and its PD effects on the inhibition of platelet aggregation were unchanged by chronic administration of dabigatran etexilate. There may be modest but very transient effects on dabigatran PK (30&#x02013;35% increase in AUC) when a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 or 600&#x000a0;mg) is administered, with no impact on the PK or PD of clopidogrel.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary materials</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material id="Fig3" content-type="local-data"><media id="MO7" xlink:href="228_2012_1304_Fig3_ESM.jpg"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><caption><p>Part 2.
