To avoid or delay its chronic complications, patients with type 2 diabetes should improve blood glucose management by adapting their life style. This involves changing the way in which diabetes is controlled. We believe that, thanks to technological innovations in connected health-monitoring devices, the telemonitoring of type 2 diabetes patients using therapeutic educational tools is likely to help them adapt their treatment and lifestyle habits, and therefore improve blood glucose management.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, prospective study. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of telemonitoring to standard monitoring in terms of changes in glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) after a 1&#x000a0;year follow-up period. The secondary objectives are clinical (changes in knowledge, physical activity, weight, etc.) and medical-economic. 282 patients are required (141 patients in each group) to satisfy the primary objective. For patients in the intervention group, the device will be given to them for 1&#x000a0;year and then withdrawn during the second year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The anticipated benefits of this research are an improvement in blood glucose management in patients with type 2 diabetes by improving their lifestyle whilst rationalizing recourse to consultations in order to reduce the incidence of complications and cost in the long term.

This qualifies as a genuine pandemic since progression is considerable. Thus the WHO is forecasting that 622 million people will be suffering from diabetes between now and 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Over 90% of these people present type 2 diabetes. The severity of diabetes, from both a human and economic perspective, is the onset of chronic complications associated with the disease. To avoid or delay their onset as much as possible, patients with diabetes must improve the way in which they manage their blood glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes patients can be treated in different ways, depending on disease advance, ranging from a change in lifestyle alone, oral treatments or multiple insulin injections, or a combination of all options. The French Health Authorities (HAS) continue to advocate the following first-line therapy: a change in lifestyle with a change in diet and regular physical exercise for improved blood glucose management together with weight loss, if applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These measures must be maintained long-term even when combined with medication. Numerous studies have shown that a change in lifestyle can improve patients&#x02019; blood glucose levels but long-term results are difficult to maintain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thanks to technological innovation, health-related devices can now be used to monitor patients remotely in their own homes and play a greater role in daily routines by helping patients to improve their lifestyle and adjust their treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">We want to compare telemonitoring management incorporating therapeutic education tools for type 2 diabetes with standard monitoring.

Secondary objectives are changes in knowledge (evaluated using questionnaires focusing on dietetics and physical activity&#x02014;GPAQ), hygiene and dietary approaches (3-day dietary questionnaires including 1&#x000a0;day at the weekend), quality of life (EQ&#x000a0;5D and DQOL questionnaires), clinical (weight, waist circumference) and laboratory parameters (lipid and mean glycemic fractions). These parameters are evaluated at baseline and after 1&#x000a0;year of follow-up. Patient and care satisfaction is also assessed after 1&#x000a0;year with continued efficacy (HbA1c) at 2&#x000a0;years. A medical-economic evaluation is also carried out and assessed after 1 and 2&#x000a0;years, respectively (cost-efficacy ratio, Markovian modelling for the longer term forecasting of medical and economic consequences).</p><p id="Par25">Secondary objectives, specifically for patients in the intervention group are combined with the use of connected devices.

It allows patients for whom a profile and nutritional requirement record has been created to enter their meals (in the form of photos with various portions of food), to establish whether or not their meals are balanced and to obtain one or more suggestions for improving the nutritional balance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These meals can be recorded and used in the patient telemonitoring process.

Nutri-Educ is an interactive, educational, nutrition software application that provides personalized help in the composition of meals. Each user has a personalized folder that contains some of its physiopathological characteristics. It was developed by the department of Diabetology of the University Hospital of Toulouse in collaboration with a computer engineer. It has several features: the system evaluates the energy needs of the subjects by a set of rules, taking into account age, sex, size, physical activity. The caloric goal is then adapted according to the BMI of the subject. It helps the user to balance his meals with personalized advice. It takes into account the daily fractionation of the feed. The user enters the foods that make up his/her meal with photos to choose the type of food and its portion. Nutri-Educ makes a diagnosis of the meal calorically and on the carbohydrate-lipid-protein distribution according to the international recommendations. It mentions the lack of fiber, calcium&#x02026; and then indicates several food combinations involved in the imbalance of the meal. It is able to offer balanced meal solutions from the foods seized by the user while trying to respect the choices of the subject as well as possible</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13098_2017_252_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

Some of the connected devices such as the scales do not require any intervention on the part of the patient to send the data, whilst others require data to be downloaded (blood glucose monitor) or the device has to be positioned next to the tablet (actimeter).

Medical alerts are programmed and can be adapted for individual patients and e-mailed to investigating physicians with a link to connect to the monitoring platform. These alerts highlight hypoglycemia with cases of hyperglycemia accounting for over 30% of the blood glucose levels recorded, and excessive weight loss or weight gain.</p><p id="Par43">In this study a hypoglycemia alert is triggered when the patient&#x02019;s blood glucose level is under 3.3&#x000a0;mmol/l (59.45&#x000a0;mg/dl) and a hyperglycemia alert is triggered when the patient&#x02019;s blood glucose level is over 8.8&#x000a0;mmol/l (160&#x000a0;mg/dl).

The calculation is based on the comparison between the two study arms of the mean of 4 post-treatment measurements during the 1st year of follow-up (at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months). Assuming a standard deviation of 2 points of HbA1c, a correlation of 0.4 between the pre- and post-randomization measurements, and a correlation of 0.5 between the post-randomization measurements, 117 patients are required per arm (234 patients in all) to detect a difference of 0.5 points of HbA1c with a power of 80%, a two-sided type I error of 5%. This calculation was computed using Stata SE 11.2 software. To avoid any loss of power due to patients lost to follow-up, the cohort obtained is increased by 20% to give a total of 282 patients to be enrolled (141 per arm).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Allocation</title><p id="Par71">Randomization was based on a 1:1 ratio and stratified on the baseline HbA1c level (&#x0003c;7.5% vs&#x000a0;&#x02265;7.5%).

The mixed model will be adjusted for the baseline value of HbA1c, as well as additional baseline variables that might be potential confounders: center, age, gender, treatment by insulin, duration of diabetes and history of diabetes complications. To manage missing data, a sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) technique will be applied. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed according to the same principles.

Apart from medication, the management of patients with type 2 diabetes is multi-faceted and includes education to promote greater independence, the monitoring of blood glucose levels and changes in lifestyle.

Similarly, it is not easy to sustain the change of attitude needed to control the disease.</p><p id="Par90">Teleeducation tools and connected health devices for telemonitoring purposes can provide both doctors and patients with objective data to discuss optimum solutions on a case-by-case basis.
