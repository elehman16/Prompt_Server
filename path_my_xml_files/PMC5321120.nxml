<bold>TRIAL DESIGN: </bold>To compare the difference in pain score during flexible cystoscopy between patients undergoing the procedure with plain lubricating gel&#x000a0; only and plain gel with diclofenac suppository in a randomized control trial.</p><p>
<bold>METHODS</bold>:&#x000a0; A total of 60 male patients with an indication of flexible cystoscopy were enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized in two groups. In group &#x0201c;A&#x0201d;, patients received diclofenac suppository one hour prior to the procedure while group &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; did not receive diclofenac suppository. Both groups received 10 ml of intra-urethral &#x000a0;plain gel for lubrication during flexible cystoscopy. Pain score was recorded immediately after the procedure using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Pre- and post-procedure pulse rate and systolic blood pressure was also recorded. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test and student t-test. Regression analysis was performed to address the confounding variables.</p><p>
<bold>RESULTS</bold>: Both groups were comparable for variables including age, duration of procedure, level of operating surgeon and indication of procedure. Most common indication for flexible cystoscopy was removal of double J stent. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean pain score between two groups (
<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;= 0.012).&#x000a0; The difference in post-procedure mean pulse rate in the two groups was statistically significant (
<italic>p</italic>= 0.01) however there was no difference observed in mean post procedure systolic blood pressure. Regression analysis showed that none of the confounding variables were significantly affecting pain perception.</p><p>
<bold>CONCLUSIONS:</bold> Intra rectal diclofenac suppository is simple and effective pre-emptive analgesia. We recommend its routine use during flexible cystoscopy for better pain control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>diclofenac suppository</kwd><kwd>pain control</kwd><kwd>flexicystoscopy</kwd><kwd>office urology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>University of Research Council Grant</funding-source><award-id>70823</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by a University of Research Council Grant (70823) to HA.</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The earliest reported use of flexible endoscope for examination of bladder neck was by Tsuchida and Sugawara
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. It is now one of the most commonly performed diagnostic as well as therapeutic urologic interventions
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Pain associated with cystoscopy varies from patient to patient and there is continuous effort using various methods to reduce pain during and after the procedure to improve patient compliance for flexible cystoscopy. The majority of patients require local anesthesia or lubricant solution only but some patients may require intravenous sedation
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> or inhalation analgesia (nitrous oxide)
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Factors contributing to severity of pain include: lubrication, use of topical anesthesia and duration of cystoscopy
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but the available evidence for best practice in terms of treatment is continuously evolving
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. The important issues regarding the correct use of intra-urethral gels are, for the most part, left to individual preference
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Effect of different intra-urethral gels, their dosage, temperature and time of instillation on pain perception has been evaluated in literature. In a randomized control trail, 2% lidocaine gel in two different doses (10 and 20 ml) and plain lubricating gels were found to be equally effective for pain control during flexible cystoscopy
<italic>(p=</italic>0.406)
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Pain perception with use of lidocaine versus plain lubricating gel is less as reported in a meta-analysis by Aaronson
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> while another meta-analysis by Patel
<italic>et al.</italic> has reported no statistical difference among the two gels for pain control
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In a study by Komiya
<italic>et al.</italic>, oral zaltoprofen has been used as pre-emptive analgesia for rigid cystoscopy and it has been proved to provide better pain control than 2% lidocaine gel alone (11.35 versus 13.69 with a difference of pain score -2.8, p-value 0.0087)
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Intra-rectal diclofenac suppository administration used by Irer
<italic>et al.</italic> has a proven role to reduce pain and improve patients&#x02019; tolerance of trans rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory drug with local and systemic effects; the local effects include reducing the impact of pain mediators. The diclofenac suppository in comparison to the oral has a rapid onset and a slower rate of absorption. The maximal plasma level Is reached within 2 hours, and is maintained for up to 12 hours and that forms the basis of using suppository rather than oral NSAID in our study
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In the current study we have attempted to assess the use of diclofenac suppository as a pre-emptive analgesia during flexible ureteroscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Study protocol, patient recruitment and randomization</title><p>The Ethical Review Committee of the Aga Khan University and the Clinical Trial Unit approved the study protocol.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The principal investigator of this study obtained the written consent from all the qualified patients before randomization. All male patients of 18 years of age and older with indication for flexible cystoscopy, were assessed for recruitment in the trial. We included all adult males who attended for evaluation of hematuria or lower urinary tract
<bold>s</bold>ymptoms and those for removal of double J ureteral stent. All patients undergoing the procedure had a urinalysis and culture to exclude UTI. Patients were requested to empty the bladder immediately prior to the procedure or within 30 minutes. Prior to the procedure, patients were explained the visual analog scale (VAS; score zero means no pain and 10 means worst pain). Eligible patients were randomized by a computer-generated list and sealed envelopes. Patients were randomized into either Group A (those patients who received diclofenac suppository prior to procedure) or Group B (those patients who did not receive diclofenac suppository prior to procedure) using a web-based random number generator (RANDOM.ORG, Dublin, Ireland;
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.random.org">https://www.random.org</ext-link>). Diclofenac suppository (100 mg) was administered rectally 1 hour prior to the procedure in the pre-operative area. Both groups received 10 ml of plain lubricating gel immediately before the procedure for the purpose of lubrication.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1. </label><caption><title>CONSORT statement describing the details eligibility, allocation, follow up and analysis of the patients.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="f1000research-5-10254-g0000"/></fig><fig fig-type="figure" id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2. </label><caption><title>Numeric pain rating on a scale of 1&#x02013;10.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="f1000research-5-10254-g0001"/></fig><p>The procedure was performed at the surgical day care unit in supine position by a consultant urologist or senior urology resident (residency year 5 and 6) that was blinded to the randomization group.

<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We followed stringent criteria for enrollment of patients in this trial to eliminate confounding factors for pain. Computer generated sequences were used for randomization in order to give equal chance of being selected in either group to all recruited patients.</p><p>Flexible cystoscopy is often performed repeatedly in particular during the follow up of urothelial cancer. As repeated cystoscopy did not increase the patient's tolerability to pain associated with cystoscopy, Muezzinoglu noted the need for more effective anesthesia to improve tolerability during the procedure and maintain quality of life of the patients under long-term follow-up with repeated cystoscopies
<sup><xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Till date various techniques have been used to ameliorate the perception of pain during flexible cystoscopy. Use of NSAID as pre-emptive analgesia has been tested for various surgical procedures
<sup><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Komiya and co-workers examined the effect of anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) zaltoprofen that inhibits the generation of prostaglandins as well as the pain induced by bradykinin during rigid cystoscopy
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The mean age of the patients in their study was 69.3+/- 8.2 (range: 41&#x02013;83) while in our study we had relatively younger study subjects (mean age+/- SD, range: 46.75+/-16.1 years, 18&#x02013;80 years) who are presumably more anxious with lower pain threshold. Despite this fact, diclofenac suppository significantly improved the pain perception and proved to be effective regardless of age on regression analysis. Another matter of debate is the statistical method used in the study by Komiya
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> where they used a &#x0201c;one sample Wilcoxon test&#x0201d; for comparing the two groups which is rather an inappropriate test to demonstrate the effect. The one-Sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric alternative to a one-sample t-test. The test determines whether the median of the sample is equal to some specified value. Data should be distributed symmetrically about the median. In the present study we have used regression analysis, which is a more stringent method to demonstrate the effect.</p><p>In our study, we used diclofenac suppository as pre-emptive analgesia. The pharmacokinetics of the suppository form is quite different from the orally administered agent. It acts as an anti-inflammatory drug both locally and systemically, by minimizing the effects of local mediators involved in the pain response. Diclofenac has been marketed internationally since 1973 and is currently available in oral, rectal, parenteral and topical preparations
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The efficacy of the diclofenac suppository is due to more rapid onset of effect, and a slower rate of absorption (it takes approximately 4.5 hours for complete absorption) than oral enteric-coated tablets. The maximal plasma level is attained within 2 hours, and it is maintained for up to 12 hours
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The terminal half-life of diclofenac in plasma is 1 to 2 hours. The major route of excretion is the urine (~60%) and a small percentage through bile in the feces
<sup><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Its role has proven to be effective for pain control during trans rectal ultra sound guided prostate biopsy in study by Haq
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In a case control the investigators noted that it is a simple and safe method. While Irer
<italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> showed additional benefit of using lidocaine gel for pain control during the same procedure but statistical significance of this study is in question due to its smaller sample size.</p><p>In the present study, appropriate sample size, stringent criteria for recruitment, computer generated randomization, proper statistical methods and analysis has increased the scientific rigor. This was not a placebo controlled as various per rectally medications or &#x0201c;dummy drugs&#x0201d; may have some local inflammatory effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Intra rectal diclofenac suppository is a simple and effective method to reduce pain during flexible cystoscopy regardless of age.

Worldwide there are many used local anesthetic drugs or substitutes transient analgesia, without much success in the best case or side effects to their use in the worst. However, the use of an analgesic which may be readily obtained from the patient while avoiding adverse effects associated with the gastric tolerability, for maintaining a sufficiently efficient to meet the requirements as a pain reliever during flexible cystoscopy, is not only necessary but also imperative. We will certainly take into account the fact that during both rigid and flexible cystoscopy, there is a potential of greater momentary discomfort when the stent is being pulled through the bladder neck and due to the length of the urethra.

Effect of diclofenac suppository on pain control during flexible cystoscopy-A randomized controlled trial [version 1; referees: awaiting peer review]. F1000Research 2016, 5:2834 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.9519.1)&#x0201d;</p><p> Firstly, I congratulate the authors for a well-chosen study topic, and running a well-designed trial. Flexible cystoscopy, being a commonly practised office procedure without the involvement of anesthetists on most occasions, the choice of appropriate analgesics always remains a dilemma to the practising urologist. A gamut of approaches ranging from local anaethetic usage, lubricant solution to usage of inhalational agents has been practiced with mixed reports. Usage of diclofenac suppository, as has been advocated in this study appears to be a simple and effective approach for conducting this procedure. The statistics supports the claim of the proponents regarding the efficacy of this drug. Considering the ease of administration it will be a good option for the practising urologist conducting office flexible cystoscopy.</p><p> It would be interesting to know the authors&#x02019; feedback on the following aspects from their experience in this study-
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Was there a difference in pain perception in individuals undergoing diagnostic flexible cystoscopy and those undergoing flexible cystoscopy for stent removal as the latter often involves added pain stimulus to the patient due to additional instrumentation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Was the benefit of diclofenac suppository equally perceived in males and females - our personal observations are flexible cystoscopies are presumably easier and well tolerated in females than males.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The last sentence in the introduction says- &#x0201c;In the current study we have attempted to assess the use of diclofenac suppository as a pre-emptive analgesia during flexible ureteroscopy&#x0201d; - we presume this is a typographical error and should be &#x0201c;flexible cystoscopy&#x0201d; instead of flexible ureteroscopy &#x02013; this needs to be corrected if so.</p></list-item></list>

Buccholz and Das for their valuable comments on the above submission. In response to the questions raised:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>No we did not find any difference in the diagnostic cystoscopy versus interventional flexicystoscopy(JJ stent removal). The subgroup analysis not shared in the data (as the numbers were small) was insignificant, however, our own experience was that there is indeed is a momentary discomfort when the stent is being pulled through the bladder neck.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Again an important point as indeed due to the length of the urethra there is a potential of greater discomfort in men during flexible cystoscopy. We, however, notice no significant difference in our practice (perhaps due to routine use of low pressure irrigation during introduction of the scope to keep the urethra open.) However, in our current work we only studied men.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indeed it is a typographical error, many thanks for pointing this out.</p></list-item></list>
