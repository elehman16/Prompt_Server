With CRT, a cytostatic is used as a radiosensitizer enhancing the damaging effect of radiotherapy (RT).</p><p>Cisplatin is a radiosensitizer that is often used in CRT of H&#x00026;N cancer. Besides its radiosensitizing effect, cisplatin is known to have many side effects. Nephrotoxicity is one important example. To reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity, a substantial amount of saline solution is administered to the patient before and after the administration of cisplatin. This hydration during CRT of H&#x00026;N cancer can potentially alter the anatomy of the patient.</p><p>Several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] described geometrical changes of organs-at-risk (OARs) during treatment. The organ most studied is the parotid gland (PG), showing a decrease of volume during treatment with a medial shift of the center-of-mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The study of Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] demonstrated that the largest volume decrease occurs in the second week of treatment. No significant difference was distinguished between the volume decrease of the ipsi- and contralateral PG. Several studies pointed out that the medio-lateral distance between the parotid glands (PGs) decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This shift sets in during the second week of treatment with the largest displacement during the fourth week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Preliminary investigations on PG geometrical variability in our institute showed an occasional increase of the PG volume on Cone Beam CT (CBCT) scans of H&#x00026;N cancer patients treated with CRT. These patients were all treated with concomitant cisplatin and received hydration. Based on these findings it was hypothesized that the geometry of the PGs is influenced by hydration during CRT and this comparative study was designed.</p><p>Generally, the mean dose to the PGs is kept below 26Gy to prevent long term xerostomia and preserve quality of life. The volume decrease and medial shift of the PGs as described above, result in an increase of the delivered dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, adaptive RT has emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] where a repeat CT scan is acquired and the treatment plan is adjusted to account for these or other relevant geometrical changes and reduce toxicity. However, if the geometry of the PGs is influenced by hydration, this needs to be taken into account, in deciding when to make a repeat CT scan for adaptive RT.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine geometric changes of PGs as a function of hydration during CRT compared to a control group treated with RT only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient and treatment characteristics</title><p>This retrospective study included 38 patients treated for H&#x00026;N cancer: an experimental group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) receiving CRT and a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) receiving RT only. Patients with daily CBCT scans and the standard chemotherapy regime were selected. Patients in the CRT group received cisplatin with hydration in the first, fourth and seventh week of the treatment according to the RADPLAT intravenous protocol: with each chemotherapy cycle, 100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin with about 9&#x000a0;l of saline solution during hydration was administrated intravenously in three days.</p><p>Both groups received a total dose of 70Gy on tumor site in 35 fractions of 2Gy. For the CRT group, these fractions were given in 7&#x000a0;weeks. Most patients in the RT alone group received RT with an accelerated scheme of 6&#x000a0;weeks: once a week 2 fractions a day separated by a time interval of at least 6&#x000a0;h.

The planning CT (pCT) scan (Hispeed LX/I, General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA or Somatom Sensation Open, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) was acquired with a slice distance and thickness of 3&#x000a0;mm from the cranium to the sternum. The patient setup on the linear accelerator (Elekta, Synergy, Crawley, UK) was verified by registration of the bony anatomy from the pCT to the CBCT using chamfer matching and was corrected using a regular offline protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additional CBCT scans were acquired for research purposes within the context of other studies. A total of 1170 CBCT scans were evaluated for this study with an average of 31 CBCT scans per patient. CBCT scans were acquired over a 360&#x000b0; arc in 1&#x000a0;min (16&#x000a0;mA &#x02013; 40&#x000a0;ms &#x02013; 120&#x000a0;kV, per projection) with an isocenter dose of ~1&#x000a0;cGy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Volume and center-of-mass</title><p>For each patient, the PGs were delineated on the pCT scan. PG geometry during treatment was determined in the CBCT scans by propagating these delineations using deformable image registration (DIR). First the CBCT scan was rigidly registered with the pCT scan on local bony structures near the PGs. Next, soft tissue deformations were determined with DIR. An in-house developed BSpline deformable registration algorithm was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The accuracy and precision of this algorithm is reviewed in the discussion. Finally, the deformation fields were used to propagate the delineations of the PGs from the pCT to the CBCT scan.</p><p>Volume and center-of-mass (COM) of both PGs were determined with the propagated delineations of the PGs on the CBCT scans. The COM was given by x-, y- and z-coordinates corresponding to the medio-lateral, dorso-ventral and cranio-caudal direction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Volume and position parameters of the PGs were calculated. Volume change was evaluated by dividing the PG volume on the CBCT scan by the volume on the pCT scan. According to Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] no difference between the volume decrease of the ipsi- and contralateral PG is expected. Also both PGs received the same amount of hydration. Therefore, we hypothesized that volumes could be combined and the average volume of the two PGs was calculated.</p><p>To obtain information on positional changes, the 3D distance between the left and right PG was calculated by subtracting the COMs. Subsequently, the distance between the PGs on the pCT scan was subtracted from the distance on the CBCT scan. In this manner the pCT was used as a reference to calculate relative volume and position of the PGs with all CBCT scans that were acquired during treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used to test for statistical difference between relative volume of the ipsi- and contralateral PG at treatment day 19 (just prior to the second chemotherapy cycle). Baseline patient and treatment characteristics (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were tested for statistical difference between the CRT and RT alone group with the Fisher&#x02019;s Exact, Pearson Chi-Square or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test.</p><p>Relative volume and position of the PGs were tested for statistical differences between the CRT and RT alone group around the second chemotherapy cycle (week four) and at the 35th fraction. For a statistical analysis there was not enough information with the first chemotherapy cycle (week 1: no CBCT scans prior to hydration) and the third chemotherapy cycle (week 7: not sufficient CBCT scans in the RT alone group due to the accelerated 6&#x000a0;week scheme for most of these patient). For the analysis around the second chemotherapy cycle, the starts of hydration for all CRT patients were redefined as day 0 (usually Sundays). For each patient, the difference in relative volume and position between the days after start of hydration (day 1 till day 5) and the reference day (day &#x02212;3; three days before the start of hydration; baseline volume) was calculated.

Moreover, the medial shift is reversed just after the start of hydration. When hydration was stopped, no significant differences between the CRT and RT alone group, regarding both volume and position of the PGs, were measured anymore. Although the effects of hydration are temporary, in the context of adaptive RT, caution should be taken in timing a repeat CT scan. A repeat CT scan made at the time of hydration will not be representative for the remaining fractions with respect to the PGs.</p><p>Overall during treatment, the PG volume decreased and the PGs shifted in medial direction in both groups. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] described a similar result. Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] performed a study including 5 patients who were treated for H&#x00026;N cancer with helical tomotherapy with daily MVCT scans. The study described an average decrease of the PG volume of 1.1&#x000a0;% per treatment day. According to Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the average decrease in PG volume was 1.1&#x000a0;% per day in the first four weeks of treatment (31&#x000a0;% by week 4). For this study, 20 patients underwent a repeat CT scan in week 2, 3, 4 and 5 during RT. In the study of Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], 10 patients were included who were treated with helical tomotherapy with daily MVCT scans. The study showed a median decrease in volume of 0.4 to 1.3&#x000a0;% per day. In the study of Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] it appeared that the largest decrease in volume takes place in the second week of the treatment. At the end of treatment, mean PG volumes can decrease with more than 50&#x000a0;%, i.e., Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] found a decrease of 59.8&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17.4&#x000a0;% of the original volume. The PG volume decrease with the patients of the current study is smaller.</p><p>Vasquez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that the lateral regions of the glands move during RT while the medial regions are relatively fixed. This would imply that a change of the COM is more the result of volume change than an indicator of positional change. Still, a movement of lateral areas to a more medial position because of shrinkage could increase the mean dose to the organ. Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] correlated an average decrease of the PG volume of 0.21&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup> per treatment day with an average increase of the dose to the PGs of 1.7&#x000a0;cGy per treatment day. Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] correlated the COM change of the PGs with the percent difference between plan and cumulative mean dose. With the CRT group in the present study, decrease of the PG volume and medial movement is temporarily interrupted during hydration. Based on the study of Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], hypothetically the fraction dose received by the PGs is temporarily reduced, with a limited effect on the total dose. However, Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] demonstrated only a significant increase in mean dose to the ipsilateral gland at week 4. When the mean dose to the PGs were analyzed together it did not show a significant increase in mean dose.</p><p>Our study has a number of limitations. First, the fractionation schemes of the two groups differs. However, at the end of week three, three days before the start of prehydration of the second chemotherapy cycle, no significant differences between the CRT and RT alone group, regarding both relative volume and position of the PGs, were measured.</p><p>Second, it was only possible to verify the volume and position of the PGs during the second chemotherapy cycle (week four). Although comparable trends were seen during hydration of the first and third chemotherapy cycle, respectively first and seventh week of treatment, there wasn&#x02019;t sufficient data for the applied method to confirm these findings. However, the timing of adaptive RT will predominantly be mid-treatment, making our findings relevant to clinical practice.</p><p>Third, the position of the PGs was specified with respect to each other. Shifts in dorso-ventral and cranio-caudal directions could be better specified if the position of the PGs is measured in comparison with an immobile structure, for example a bone structure. However, the applied method is adequate to determine changes in medial-lateral direction, which is the most relevant direction of positional change for the PGs.</p><p>Fourth, the planned dose on the ipsi- and contralateral PG within both groups showed large variations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We did not take this into account in this study based on the results of Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. He distinguished no significant difference between the volume decrease of the ipsi- and contralateral PG. To test this with our data, we compared the relative volume of the ipsi- to the contralateral PG at the end of week three: no significant difference was found. This confirms the observation of Bhide et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, both the ipsi- and contralateral PG are subjected to the same amount of hydration. This justifies combining the ipsi- and contralateral PG volume for the purpose of the present study.</p><p>As a final limitation, we used DIR to propagate the delineations from the pCT to the CBCT scans. With DIR, uncertainties in accuracy are present. However, an independent validation of the DIR algorithm that was used in this study, by Mencarelli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with gold markers around the tumor showed submillimeter accuracy. Whereas, the precision was around 3&#x000a0;mm. Since the precision is a random effect, this will not bias our results. Furthermore, according to Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], geometrical uncertainties of automatically generated contours are comparable to those of manual contours. They concluded that the deformable registration process provides a tool for automatic evaluation of anatomical PG changes occurring during treatment.</p><p>In this study, the influence of intravenous hydration, consisting of 9&#x000a0;l in three days in combination with a 3 weekly cisplatin based CRT treatment, was verified. Different amounts of fluid during hydration or a different CRT scheme could have a different influence on volume and position of PGs. Moreover, there are several other factors that could be considered of having a possible influence on the geometry of the PGs. For example: tumor volume, tumor site, cytostatics, feeding status, BMI and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These factors are not investigated in this study. Possible influence of tube feeding on the geometry of the PGs also is not investigated in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study confirms overall PG shrinkage during (C)RT and an overall decrease of the mean medial distance between the PGs. Hydration during high dose cisplatin based CRT treatment of patients with H&#x00026;N cancer, results in an increase of the PG volume in combination with a lateral movement of the COM. These effects of hydration are small and temporary. Unless, in the context of adaptive RT, a repeat CT scan is timed during a chemotherapy cycle, these effects are of minor clinical relevance. However, since the effect of hydration on PG geometry has not been investigated before, these results are relevant to share with the research community.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBCT</term><def><p>Cone Beam CT</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COM</term><def><p>Center-of-mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRT</term><def><p>Chemoradiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIR</term><def><p>Deformable image registration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H&#x00026;N</term><def><p>Head and neck</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OARs</term><def><p>Organs-at-risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pCT</term><def><p>Planning CT</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PG</term><def><p>Parotid gland</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGs</term><def><p>Parotid glands</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>Radiotherapy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PK and SVW performed the literature study, designed and executed the study and drafted the manuscript.
