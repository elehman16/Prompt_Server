<bold>Objective</bold> To determine the effectiveness of lessons in the Alexander technique, massage therapy, and advice from a doctor to take exercise (exercise prescription) along with nurse delivered behavioural counselling for patients with chronic or recurrent back pain.
</p><p>
<bold>Design</bold> Factorial randomised trial.
</p><p>
<bold>Setting</bold> 64 general practices in England.
</p><p>
<bold>Participants</bold> 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain; 144 were randomised to normal care, 147 to massage, 144 to six Alexander technique lessons, and 144 to 24 Alexander technique lessons; half of each of these groups were randomised to exercise prescription.
</p><p>
<bold>Interventions</bold> Normal care (control), six sessions of massage, six or 24 lessons on the Alexander technique, and prescription for exercise from a doctor with nurse delivered behavioural counselling.
</p><p>
<bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Roland Morris disability score (number of activities impaired by pain) and number of days in pain.
</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold> Exercise and lessons in the Alexander technique, but not massage, remained effective at one year (compared with control Roland disability score 8.1: massage -0.58, 95% confidence interval -1.94 to 0.77, six lessons -1.40, -2.77 to -0.03, 24 lessons -3.4, -4.76 to -2.03, and exercise -1.29, -2.25 to -0.34). Exercise after six lessons achieved 72% of the effect of 24 lessons alone (Roland disability score -2.98 and -4.14, respectively). Number of days with back pain in the past four weeks was lower after lessons (compared with control median 21 days: 24 lessons -18, six lessons -10, massage -7) and quality of life improved significantly. No significant harms were reported.
</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold> One to one lessons in the Alexander technique from registered teachers have long term benefits for patients with chronic back pain. Six lessons followed by exercise prescription were nearly as effective as 24 lessons.

</p><p>Lessons in the Alexander technique offer an individualised approach designed to develop lifelong skills for self care that help people recognise, understand, and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination. Lessons involve continuous personalised assessment of the individual patterns of habitual musculoskeletal use when stationary and in movement; paying particular attention to release of unwanted head, neck, and spinal muscle tension, guided by verbal instruction and hand contact, allowing decompression of the spine; help and feedback from hand contact and verbal instruction to improve musculoskeletal use when stationary and in movement; and spending time between lessons practising and applying the technique (also see appendix on bmj.com).</p><p>The Alexander technique is thus distinct from manipulation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> back schools,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> and conventional physiotherapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> The practice and theory of the technique, in conjunction with preliminary findings of changes in postural tone and its dynamic adaptability to changes in load and position,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> support the hypothesis that the technique could potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm, strengthening postural muscles, improving coordination and flexibility, and decompressing the spine. A small trial, not fully reported, showed promising short term results for back pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> We are not aware of a trial reporting long term results.
</p><p>Systematic reviews and a recent trial highlighted the importance of research to assess the effectiveness of holistic therapeutic massage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>; we particularly wanted to assess massage as it provides no long term educational element, in contrast with lessons in the Alexander technique.

Patients were given information that there was suggestive preliminary evidence to support each intervention (Alexander technique, massage, and exercise).

A statistician had prepared a secure program using computer generated random numbers so that the next allocation could not be guessed. For each practice contributing 10 patients a block of eight numbers existed, and two were added from a block that supplied four other practices. Practices were not told how many patients would be recruited to each trial group or informed of the block randomisation. When possible each practice was matched to two Alexander technique teachers.

Patients indicate the number of specified activities or functions limited by back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> (for example, getting out of the house less often, walking more slowly than usual, not doing usual jobs around the house).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
</p><p>Secondary outcome measures were quality of life, measured using the short form 36,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> and secondary measures for back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>: pain and disability using the Von Korff scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> and Deyo &#x0201c;troublesomeness&#x0201d; scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> overall improvement using health transition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> and fear avoidance beliefs for physical activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></p><p>For other measures we asked patients to agree or disagree with statements on 7 point scales from 0=strongly agree to 7=strongly disagree. We developed a back health scale (my health has improved, I feel better, I have less back pain, I am able to be more active; Cronbach&#x02019;s a=0.96), and a modified enablement instrument<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> (mean of six items: I am able to cope better with life, I am able to understand my (back) problem better, I am able to cope better with my (back) problem, I am better able to keep myself healthy, I am more confident, I am able to help myself; Cronbach&#x02019;s a=0.96).</p><p>We measured outcomes at baseline, three months, and one year using postal questionnaires, with two mailings to non-responders and telephone follow-up for a smaller dataset (Roland disability scale, days in pain, Von Korff scale, health transition) for those not responding. Data entry was blind to study group.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated using the Nquery program. The Medical Research Council back pain working group for the back pain exercise and manipulation trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> agreed that a 2.5 point change on the Roland disability scale was a clinically important change in the context of several sessions of manipulation (that is, a relatively intensive intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). In the context of both intensive and less intensive interventions we assumed that changes in the range 1.5 to 2.5 could therefore be important. This was also justified in our cohort: patients who rated their back pain as slightly improved after one year compared with those rating their pain as not improved (a difference of 1 point on a 7 point scale) had changed Roland disability scores by an additional 2.2 points; 50% of patients achieving this change (a 1.1 point difference) might still be important clinically. We assumed the standard deviation to be 4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> The limiting element in the sample size calculations was the Alexander technique factor. For a=0.01 and 80% power<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> and assuming the interventions could achieve an effect in the clinically important range (six Alexander technique lessons 1.5 points lower than normal care, massage 2 points lower, and 24 Alexander technique lessons 2.5 points lower) then 292 patients were required for the Alexander technique factor (73 in each group), or 365 allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. The trial had no cluster design effects as it was individually randomised. We wanted, however, to allow for clustering effects (of practice, general practitioner, and teacher or therapist) if these proved statistically significant: we included an inflation factor of 1.45, which required 529 patients (365&#x000d7;1.45), or 536 in total to provide eight balanced factorial groups.
</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>The analysis plan was agreed in advance by the trial management group. The primary analysis was an analysis of covariance for a factorial study at one year for the primary outcome between groups (Roland disability score) and for the secondary outcomes. The days in pain data were skewed so we used non-parametric (quantile) regression. We assessed interaction between factors before reporting the main effects: those of the Alexander technique factor are reported controlling for the effect of exercise and those of the effect of exercise are reported controlling for the Alexander technique factor. As the study was powered for only moderately large interactions we also report the individual groups for the main outcomes at one year. We assessed the statistical significance of clustering by therapist, teacher, and practice, and if these were not significant we did not allow for clustering in the models.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Most eligible patients who responded agreed to attend for assessment (figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>). We wrote to 687 consecutive patients who did not respond to the original invitation, to assess potential eligibility of non-responders: 553 responded, of whom only six were eligible. A total of 579 people were randomised and completed the baseline questionnaires, 469 (81%) completed the questionnaires at three months, and 463 (80%) the questionnaires at 12 months. Responders at one year were more likely to have left full time education later and to be self employed or homemakers; response was not related to baseline Roland disability scores. Including education and employment status in the final analysis did not alter the estimates or the inferences. No significant cluster effects (practice, therapist or teacher) were found, except for enablement, where a practice clustering effect was found, so only these results are presented allowing for clustering. Baseline characteristics were similar for all variables (table 2<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"/>) except there were fewer women in the Alexander technique groups, probably a chance finding. Including sex in the models did not alter the estimates, so the results are presented unadjusted.

Both six lessons in the Alexander technique and general practitioner prescription for aerobic exercise with structured behavioural counselling by a practice nurse were helpful in the long term; classic massage provided short term benefit. Six lessons in the Alexander technique followed by exercise prescription was almost as effective as 24 lessons.</p><p>Most patients we contacted were not eligible. The majority of the eligible patients who responded to an invitation to participate in the trial were randomised so the results should apply to most patients with chronic or recurrent back pain. The long previous duration of pain (79% had pain for &#x0003e;90 days) and the little change in pain and function in the control group after one year (still had significant limitation in activity and pain on most days after one year) suggest that we selected a predominantly chronic, severely affected, and currently ineffectively managed population. All had attended primary care with back pain in the past&#x02014;that is, the sample was a clinically relevant population. Since patients were required to be able to walk, we excluded those most severely disabled by pain.</p><p>Adherence was good for both six and 24 lessons in the Alexander technique, and for massage compared with adherence in other back pain intervention trials,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> possibly as a result of the perceived symptomatic benefit. As this was a large pragmatic, multipractice, multiteacher, multitherapist study, the results are unlikely to be due to the good work of a small number of enthusiasts.</p><p>The consistent pattern of outcomes at three months and one year and number of highly significant results suggest that a type I error (chance) was unlikely. The study was powered to detect a reduction of 1.5 to 2.5 activities affected by back pain. Although the study was underpowered to assess significant interactions (none was found) the results suggest that the effect of exercise and 24 Alexander technique lessons combined is less than the sum of the two individual effects. We found no evidence of confounding or bias from losses to follow-up.</p><p>The Roland disability scale is one of the best validated self report measures for assessing the impact of back pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> The effect of intervention on our other primary outcome, reported days in pain, is unlikely to be explained by recall bias owing to the large effect size and short period of recall. Recall over such periods is likely to be valid: pain or discomfort for both short recall periods (2-4 weeks) and longer recall periods in a variety of conditions compare favourably with diaries completed prospectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>

Comparison with the United Kingdom back pain exercise and manipulation trial suggests the benefits are similar to a supervised exercise scheme in the short term, and potentially greater in the long term, since the effect of supervised schemes in that trial was no longer apparent by 12 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Six lessons on the Alexander technique followed by prescription for exercise provided nearly as much benefit as 24 lessons on the Alexander technique.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Other interventions</title><p>A recent study of acupressure in a Chinese orthopaedic clinic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> and single practitioner trial of yoga suggest substantial benefit for back pain,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> but trials were small (&#x0003c;130 participants) with six months of follow-up.

This benefit can be provided by 24 lessons in the Alexander technique, or six lessons combined with exercise prescription.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Combined manipulation and physiotherapy-supervised strengthening exercises helps functioning moderately (1-2 activities no longer limited by back pain)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that massage and lessons in the Alexander technique might help in the short term</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Six sessions of massage, prescription for exercise and nurse counselling, six lessons in the Alexander technique, and 24 lessons helped with back pain and functioning at three months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lessons in the Alexander technique still had a beneficial effect on pain and functioning after 12 months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Six lessons in the Alexander technique followed by exercise prescription are nearly as effective as 24 lessons</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank the patients, practices, general practitioners, practice nurses, teachers, and therapists for their time and effort; Carolyn Nicholls, who helped develop the Alexander technique teachers&#x02019; record forms and organised the pilot of the trial; Andy Fagg, who helped develop the massage intervention; and the trial steering committee (chairman Martin Underwood) for their help throughout the trial.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Contributors: PL and GL had the original idea for this protocol; DS and FO had been working on a parallel protocol.
