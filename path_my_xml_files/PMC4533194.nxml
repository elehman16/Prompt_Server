The animals were housed paired in cages, with 12 h light-darkness cycle. Food and water were provided <italic>ad lib</italic>. The National Research Council's guides for care and use laboratory animals were taken into consideration. This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the School of Dentistry, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences. The animals were quarantined for a week to get acclimated with new situations before the study begins. The body weight was measured every other 3 days using a digital scale (Moment, model number 6836, Hungary).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Application of orthodontic force</title><p>The orthodontic appliance was installed using a previously described method.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The animal was generally anesthetized by 25 mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride (Rotexmedica, Trittau, Germany) and 8 mg/kg of xylesine (Rotexmedica, Trittau, Germany), administered intra-peritoneally. A 50 g nickel-titanium closed coil spring (Sentaloy<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, GAC, Iship, NY, USA) was ligated between right incisor and first molar. The lower incisors were cut every 4 days to prevent the animal from incising over the appliance. The rat was nourished with soft pellet, afterwards.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Budesonide administration</title><p>The animals were randomly divided into 2 15-rat groups, test and control. From first day, the test group was nebulized by 2.5 mg/rat/day of budesonide 0.5 mg/ml (Pulmicort, Astra Zeneca, Sweden); in the control group, normal saline was administered.</p><p>An exposure box was made of glass in dimensions of 20 cm &#x000d7; 50 cm &#x000d7; 70 cm. This box was then divided into 16 equal chambers, each to receive a specimen. This was to prohibit the animals from aggregation in a corner during nebulization. The animals were given 45 min before the nebulization began. This was to let the transformation stress to relief and the respiration rate to slow down to the base level. The exposure box was then connected to the nebulizer (OMRON<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, model #NE-C28-E, Matsuzaca City, Japan). The rate of nebulization was set to 0.4 ml/min with 3 &#x003bc; particle size.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Histopathology</title><p>All the animals were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> overdose after 14 days of force application and nebulization. The maxilla was amputated, fixed in formalin 10%, and decalcified by formic acid 10%.</p><p>Using a microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), the mesial root of right and left first molar was dissected in a horizontal plane. The dissections were done in 2 levels: Cervical, defined as the first section containing alveolar bone, and apical, at a distance of 1150 &#x003bc; from the cervical level. At each level, 3 sections were obtained, 7 &#x003bc; in thickness and 150 &#x003bc; apart from each other. The sections were then stained by hematoxiline and eosine. Using a light microscope (Magnum<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Ceti Co., GB), with &#x000d7;40 magnification, images were shot by a digital camera (Dsch50 cybershot<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sony, Japan).</p><p>The images where transferred to Photoshop software ver.8 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), where the periphery of mesial and distal halves of the root was delineated in cervical and apical sections, respectively. On each periphery, the scalloped parts were considered as the resorptive lacunae regardless of the existence of cementoclasts. These parts were delineated separately [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The delineated curves were then transferred to AutoCAD 2009 (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, USA), where the length of each was measured. Ten randomly selected sections were reevaluated by the same examiner. The <italic>t</italic>-test revealed a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 and intra-examiner error was considered to be negligible.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Histological section of the root at cervical level.

This can be attributed to the trauma of appliance placement and also change in the diet after the lower incisors where cut-off. For the rest of the course of study, a gradual weight gain was observed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The difference between test and control groups was insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>The rats were exposed to budesonide for a 2-week period which could be considered as acute administration. The budesonide is usually prescribed for acute situations such as asthma.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] It was also proposed that this is during the acute phase of corticosteroid administration that the tooth is significantly susceptible to OIRR; afterward remodeling would increase due to secondary hyperparathyroidism and OIRR is no longer a special consideration.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>The rationales for choosing the mesial root for evaluating root resorption were that this root is the largest one from which better sections could obtain, and is located centrally in the buccolingual dimension in the same plane as the force applied. In addition, it was used by several other investigations.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>In order to quantify root resorption, different methods have been used in studies. Some have evaluated the root surface on a longitudinal sagittal section. While this method could reveal the defects from the cervical area to apical, it omits the buccal and lingual. In this study, the buccolingual sections were obtained in cervical and apical region. One shortcoming of this method is the underestimation of the defect due to the fact that the section could simply pass through a narrow part of the defect. To overcome this, at each level 3 parallel sections were passed with 150 &#x003bc; interval.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>To evaluate the spread of defect, some investigators used a grid and counted the lines passing through the defect.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Due to the ovoid geometry of the root, the buccal and lingual regions would receive fewer grid lines. Thus, the spread of the defects in this area could be underestimated. In this study, software was used to delineate the border of the defect and measure its length that could give a more realistic image. Another point is that, in this study, the ratio of defect to root surface was less than other studies that used a grid.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Beside the study parameters such as the drug used, one explanation lies in the fact that the defect located in mid-part has received more grid lines than the intact root surface in buccal and lingual parts.</p><p>Root resorption was evaluated on mesio-cervical and disto-apical region. Since the tooth was undergoing simple tipping movement in which the center of rotation is located in mid-root region,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] regarding the relation between OIRR and compression area in the PDL,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] the reason for this selection becomes clear. A pilot study undertaken by the authors also justified this selection.</p><p>Review of data reveals that the root resorption increased between the study subgroups by the following order: (1) nB-nF, (2) B-nF, (3) nB-F, and 4. B-F; although the difference between the last 2 was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>An interesting observation is that, in nF group, root resorption was also observed. This could be due to several factors: Occlusal trauma,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] dentinal antibody,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the last but not least, the systemic side-effect of budesonide.</p><p>This study revealed that budesonide could increase root resorption, since the root resorption was more in B-nF than nB-nF (<italic>P</italic> at apical level = 0.007, and at total = 0.009). The budesonide may stimulate the odontoclastic activity and/or suppress the reparative action of cementoblasts. It should also be mentioned that at cervical level the difference between B-nF and nB-nF was insignificant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.934). Although difference in biomechanical parameters as well as the effect of systemic factors at cervical level may be responsible, this finding could not easily be explained and further investigations on this issue are recommended.</p><p>The difference between nB-F and B-F was insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) that is, when the orthodontic force was applied, it made no difference whether budesonide was administered or not. This finding revealed that the major factor in root resorption was the application of force and that the effect of budesonide faded out in the presence of force.</p><p>The clinical conclusion of the above mentioned results is that, in an orthodontic patient, during the acute phase of budesonide administration, there is no need to cease the course of treatment, nevertheless monitoring the root resorption by means of radiographs is a safe caution.</p><p>The results of this study are in contrast with those of other investigations. Ong <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] administered 1 mg/kg of prednisolone in rats. The result was decreased root resorption. Gonzales <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] investigated the effect of high dose (0.67 mg/kg) and low dose (0.13 mg/kg) prednisolone on a rat model and observed the same results. On the other hand, Ashcraft <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] exposed a rabbit model to osteoporotic dose of cortisone (15 mg/kg) and found the root resorption to increase significantly. The same result was achieved by Verna <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who found that during the acute phase of administration, 8 mg/kg of prednisolone increased the root resorption in rats. The differences can be explained by various animal models and methods used, for example in the study performed by Ashcraft <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] rabbit model and osteoporotic dosage of the drug have been used. Rabbit's molars have continuous eruption which may flaw the results. Ong <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] used a lower dosage in rat and did not report information about root resorption occurrence, therefore, direct comparison was impossible. The total experimental period of Ong <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] study was only half the period used in the study done by Verna <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (24 days against 49 days). The reason for these differences could be found in several factors such as animal model, the type of corticosteroid administered, method of administration, duration of administration, and method for evaluating root resorption. One should pay special attention to the type of corticosteroid administered; inhaled budesonide compared to other types of corticosteroid, has low systemic absorption, high first pass metabolism, and affect the hypophyseal-pituitary-adrenal axis less frequently. These mean less systemic side-effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, Budesonide could increase root resorption, but in the presence of orthodontic force, this effect is negligible.
