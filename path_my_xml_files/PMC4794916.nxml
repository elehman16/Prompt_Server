Long-term controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used with the aim of achieving daily control of asthma symptoms and preventing exacerbations. The addition of a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist (LABA) to ICS therapy is more effective than increasing the dose of ICS for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who are symptomatic despite low- to medium-dose ICS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the ICS/LABA, budesonide&#x02013;formoterol (BF) fumarate dihydrate, has shown greater improvement in pulmonary function and overall asthma control compared with either individual compound alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The therapeutic efficacy of an inhalation therapy such as BF requires that the drug/s reach the lower lung (specifically the smaller airways of the lungs). As such, not only the prescribed medication, but also the inhaler device plays an important role in the efficacy of drug delivery to the lungs and subsequent improvement of asthma control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the European Union, the FDC of BF is administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) and its approval includes use for the long-term, twice-daily, maintenance treatment of asthma. DPIs were developed with the aim of simplifying the inhalation process compared with the available pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs). pMDIs require coordination with actuation; the patient needs to press down the canister and inhale the medication simultaneously. DPIs are breath-activated (most pMDIs are not), precluding the need to coordinate actuation with inhalation and may therefore be easier to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although DPIs might be perceived by patients to be easier to use compared with pMDIs, many patients still have difficulties in using DPIs correctly. This may lead to loss of asthma control, or increased frequency and severity of current asthma symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Providing patients with the option of using a device that is easier to use may facilitate the correct handling of the inhaler and can ensure that the prescribed medication reaches the targeted areas of the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The Spiromax device is a DPI that uses a novel X-ACT&#x000ae; technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The DuoResp&#x000ae; Spiromax formulation (BF Spiromax FDC) has been approved for use in the European Union for the treatment of adults (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years old) with asthma and for patients with COPD for whom an ICS/LABA combination is indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. BF Spiromax is indicated for the long-term, twice-daily, maintenance treatment of asthma or COPD as maintenance and as an &#x02018;as-needed&#x02019; reliever for asthma.</p><p>The bioequivalence of medium- and high-strength BF Spiromax to BF Turbuhaler was previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Here, we present results from a phase 3b study (<bold>A S</bold>piromax <bold>S</bold>afety and <bold>E</bold>fficacy <bold>T</bold>rial [ASSET]) where the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes of BF Spiromax (160/4.5 mcg [medium strength]) were compared with BF Turbuhaler (200/6 mcg [medium strength]) over 12&#x000a0;weeks in patients (&#x02265;12&#x000a0;years) with persistent asthma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, parallel-group, 12-week, phase 3b study comprising a 14-day (&#x000b1;2&#x000a0;days) run-in period and a 12-week double-blind treatment period (NCT01803555/BFS-AS-306 [ASSET]; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

This system was used to ensure a balance across treatment groups; no effort was made to maintain a balance among treatment groups within an investigational center. Patients and materials number were centrally randomized and distributed using the IRT. The randomization code was generated by the Clinical Supply Chain (CSC) department following specifications from the Biostatistics Department. A statistician not assigned to the study was responsible for reviewing the randomization code, and the final randomization code was maintained by the CSC department. BF Spiromax and placebo Spiromax were presented in a Spiromax inhalation device, contained in a sealed foil pouch, and packed in an individual carton. Similarly, BF Turbuhaler and placebo Turbuhaler were presented in a Turbuhaler inhalation device and packed in an individual carton. To maintain the study blinded there was no discernible differences between BF Spiromax and placebo Spiromax or BF Turbuhaler and placebo Turbuhaler; both were identically labeled for each inhaler. Patients in each arm randomly chose which device they used first (placebo or active).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study assessments</title><p>Lung function was measured by spirometry tests. Patients were required to record daily morning (ante meridiem [AM]) and evening (post meridiem [PM]) asthma symptom scores, AM and PM peak expiratory flow (PEF) values, and medication administration in the paper diaries provided. The asthma symptom scores were recorded on a linear scale from 0 to 5 (PM assessment) where 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms during the day and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;symptoms so severe that the patient could not go to work or perform normal daily activities, and from 0 to 4 (AM assessment) where 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms during the night and 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;symptoms so severe that the patient did not sleep at all. The PEF was measured twice-daily by the patient using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter. Peak flow measurements were performed at each of the participating centers using the center&#x02019;s own equipment, which were calibrated daily. Three measurements were taken and the highest value was recorded (the two largest FEV<sub>1</sub> values had to be within 150&#x000a0;mL of each other). The best result, according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], was recorded and used in the analysis.</p><p>The pulmonary function tests (FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF) were measured in the morning by spirometry at the clinic visits within&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;h of the time of the spirometry testing at the screening visit.</p><p>Patients completed the ACQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] at each visit to provide an assessment of clinical impairment due to asthma and any change in asthma control. Additionally, the Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire for Inhalation Devices (PASAPQ<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> [Copyright by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH 2004]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a question on satisfaction with the overall quickness of using the inhaler were completed for each device at baseline (day 1 of week 1 of the double-blind treatment period) and at the end of the study. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was completed at baseline and at subsequent visits.</p><p>Patient compliance to administration of study medication was assessed at each visit by reviewing patient diaries for completion of the study procedure entries and by dose counter readings on the inhaler devices.</p><p>Serial spirometry, with pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEF) tests being performed from 30&#x000a0;min before dosing to 3&#x000a0;h after dosing, was conducted in a planned subset of 30 patients from three to four sites at the baseline visit (visit 2). Drug safety was monitored throughout the study by recording of adverse events (AEs) by the investigator (all reported or observed signs and symptoms were recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state). When such a diagnosis was made, this was recorded collectively as a single diagnosis in the case report form provided and, for serious AEs (SAEs), this was recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Transmittal Form. Measurement of vital signs and oropharyngeal examination for candidiasis, clinical laboratory testing (blood eosinophil count and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels [as appropriate]) was conducted at screening and at the final clinic visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in weekly average of daily trough (pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) AM PEF over the 12-week treatment period.

It demonstrated that BF Spiromax was non-inferior to treatment with BF Turbuhaler with respect to the mean change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough AM PEF (the relationship between the variability of the PEF 20&#x000a0;L/Min and the non-inferiority reference value 15&#x000a0;L/Min was based on a non-inferiority limit of a value equating to a third of the assumed standard deviation of the PEF at any given time point, which was set at 45&#x000a0;L/min). Similar improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> were achieved with both devices.</p><p>BF administered in a FDC is an established and effective therapy with a long-standing, good safety profile for the treatment of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study, BF Spiromax showed similar efficacy (lung function and symptom control) and safety compared to BF Turbuhaler over the 12-week treatment period. Furthermore, serial spirometry in a subset of patients performed to test and compare the formoterol portion of the combination showed that the time to onset (increase [from baseline] in FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;12&#x000a0;%) and the duration of this effect were similar between the devices, further supporting the therapeutic equivalence of BF Spiromax to BF Turbuhaler.</p><p>Although the efficacy and safety of a medication are important considerations when selecting a treatment for asthma or COPD, the effectiveness of therapy is also dependent on the patient using their inhaler correctly and as prescribed every time. In addition, the choice of an inhaler device and the patient&#x02019;s opinion on a particular device are also important factors in asthma management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, many patients with asthma have poor adherence to therapy. According to the medication adherence taxonomy recommended by Vrijens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], poor or non-adherence in the context of patients with asthma is one or a combination of the following: (1) not taking medication at the correct time (example: twice-daily regimens &#x02013; patient should normally separate each dose by ~12&#x000a0;h) or late in taking the treatment as prescribed (e.g. &#x02018;missing a dose&#x02019;); (2) suboptimal implementation of the dosing regimen (e.g. not using the inhaler correctly); and (3) early discontinuation of treatment (e.g. the patient stops taking the medication) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In asthma, poor adherence can lead to loss of asthma control and/or worsening of asthma symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The ultimate goal of treatment is optimal pharmacotherapy due to its implicit association with optimal clinical outcomes &#x02013; this requires good medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An inhaler that is easy to use, carry, and store, and that is reliable and intuitive might improve patients&#x02019; adherence.</p><p>Compared to the Turbuhaler device, which requires a number of steps for actuation (removing the cap, holding the inhaler in an upright position and turning the grip as far as it will go and back), the Spiromax device has the theoretical advantage of being more intuitive and easier to use as it can be ready for actuation after the single step of opening the cap. Therefore, in this study, patients were asked to provide feedback with regards to the performance and convenience of the Spiromax and Turbuhaler devices (at baseline and after 12&#x000a0;weeks) using the validated PASAPQ. The outcomes from the PASAPQ analysis indicate that Spiromax was superior to Turbuhaler for all performance domain questions asked. However, no statistical or numerical differences were observed between the two devices when comparing the total convenience scores. When assessing the individual device convenience scores, Spiromax was also superior to Turbuhaler at baseline and week 12 for its &#x02018;instruction for use&#x02019;, &#x02018;durability of the inhaler&#x02019;, &#x02018;ease of cleaning&#x02019;, and &#x02018;ease of holding during use&#x02019;, which might be related to the reduced number of steps required up to the point when actuation of the BF dose from Spiromax can occur. On the other hand, the Turbuhaler was deemed superior to Spiromax for its size and &#x02018;convenience of carrying&#x02019;. Patients were more willing to &#x02018;continue use&#x02019; of the Spiromax device compared with Turbuhaler (after the 12-week treatment period) and reported &#x02018;preference&#x02019; for the Spiromax device over the Turbuhaler. These results might reflect the more intuitive handling of Spiromax and could have positive implications for future adherence to treatment.</p><p>Among the strengths of this study is the assessment of patient preference via the validated PASAPQ in addition to assessment of clinical efficacy. Not all phase 3 controlled studies consider patients&#x02019; opinions and instead focus on clinical efficacy and safety only. The ASSET study was conducted to reassure physicians and other healthcare professionals (HCPs) of the practicability of Spiromax in terms of its patient-reported &#x02018;greater ease of use&#x02019; (preference, &#x02018;willingness to continue&#x02019; use and performance) and its similarity to BF Turbuhaler in clinical efficacy and safety (incidence/frequency of AEs/vital signs, etc.). However, it should be noted that these data were collected as part of a phase 3, controlled, clinical trial in patients with asthma, which limits the transferability of the results to everyday practice. In the &#x02018;real world&#x02019;, the asthma population is more heterogeneous and disease monitoring is according to physicians&#x02019; routine clinical practice (vs a clinical trial setting).</p><p>Ultimately, real-world effectiveness trials will be needed to determine if these improvements can lead to improved adherence and clinical outcomes. Data from real-world studies where patients would be randomly allocated to receive treatment with either Spiromax or Turbuhaler would be of particular interest in the context of this study. Such real-word effectiveness studies are required to determine whether improvements based on patients&#x02019; preference and satisfaction with the Spiromax inhaler would lead to improved adherence and clinical outcomes in real-world scenarios. Detailed patient and HCP opinion regarding the &#x02018;ease of use&#x02019; of the Spiromax device vs Turbuhaler and also the proportion of patients achieving mastery (absence of observed errors) in Spiromax/Turbuhaler inhaler technique are being assessed in separate studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>BF Spiromax 160/4.5 mcg was shown to be similar to BF Turbuhaler 200/6 mcg in relation to efficacy and safety in the treatment of asthma; however, specific domains of the PASAPQ showed greater benefits with Spiromax over Turbuhaler. The PASAPQ analysis suggests that Spiromax was superior to Turbuhaler for all the performance domains. No differences (statistical or numerical) were observed when comparing the total convenience scores for Spiromax and Turbuhaler. Patients preferred the Spiromax over the Turbuhaler and considered it easier to use. Studies looking to substantiate patient preference, inhaler ease of use and inhaler handling errors (critical and non-critical errors) comparing BF Spiromax and Turbuhaler are currently ongoing and will clarify if the benefits observed in this trial are repeated. Ultimately, real-world effectiveness trials will be needed to determine if these improvements can lead to improved adherence and clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12890_2016_200_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>List of Independent Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards.
