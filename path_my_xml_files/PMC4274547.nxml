For instance, Almiron-Roig and Drewnowski comparing the effects of orange juice, low-fat milk (1%), regular cola, and carbonated water consumption on the short-term energy intake reported that energy containing preload decreased hunger and increased fullness compared with water but energy intake at next meal was not significantly different between all four beverages. They also showed that the total energy intake in participants who consumed orange juice, low-fat milk (1%), and regular cola was higher than subjects who consumed water.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Soenen and Westerterp-Plantenga when assessed the effect of sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), milk and diet drink (orange flavored custom-made beverages) consumption on satiety and energy intake of <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal, found that although energy intake of test meal was significantly lower after intake of energy containing beverages in comparison with diet drink but the total energy intake (energy intake from preload plus energy intake of test meal) was higher after intake of sucrose, HFCS and milk compared with the diet preload.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Tsuchiya <italic>et al</italic>. showed that when subjects consumed fruit drink, dairy fruit drink, liquid yogurt and semi-solid yogurt as the snack, the total energy intake (breakfast, snack, test meal) was not significantly different.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We are aware of the only study trying to assess the effect of dairy intake compared to isoenergetic drinks including glucose beverage and a half milk/glucose beverage on appetite and short-term energy intake.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Brindal <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the three iso-energetic beverages had same effects on appetite and the energy intake 3 h after the ingestion of preloads among 10-12 years children. To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of dairy intake on the total daily energy intake among children; therefore, the present study was designed to assess the effect of consuming 240 ml low-fat milk in breakfast compared with 240 ml of apple juice (with the same volume and energy) and 240 ml of water on the total daily energy intake in the context of a randomized three-way cross-over clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from an elementary school located in the 4<sup>th</sup> educational district of Isfahan, Iran.

Subjects were excluded if they refused to participate in a study at least in two of the intervention periods. Parents were asked to fill an informed consent before the start of the study. Height and weight were measured before intervention days. Characteristics of participants in this study were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Participants were randomly assigned into 6 rolling methods to receive one of the three iso-volumic drinks (low-fat milk [1.5% fat], apple juice, water) along with a fixed energy breakfast. Intervention periods lasted for 2 consecutive days, and there were 7 days wash-out period between interventions. On the intervention days, boys attended to school, while they were in fasted state at 7 a.m. Subjects were given breakfast meal that was included 65 g of an Iranian whole-wheat bread (called sangak), 15 g of low-fat cheese and 12 g of walnut with one of the three test beverages: Low fat milk, apple juice or water. Subjects completely ingested their breakfast till 7:30 a.m. The energy and nutrient profile of breakfast meals be represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. After breakfast, the boys were prohibited to eat and drink anything until lunchtime except water and a small portion of the fruit (apple) that contained approximately 10 gr of carbohydrates. Lunch meal was provided 5 h after breakfast at 12:30 p.m. that was the same list between three groups. An <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch was provided for subjects that consisted of rice, chicken, boiled potato, yogurt, cola beverage, pasta, tomato sauce and botteled water for the first days of the intervention periods and rice, chicken, potato, roast ground, yogurt, botteled water and colla beverage for all second intervention days. Subjects were allowed to freely select their food. Lunch was served in the school hall. Subjects were asked to continue to eat until they felt absolutely full. The boys were given 30 min to eat their lunch.

However, total whole day energy intake was not significantly different between the three interventions. In contrast with this study, Soenen and Westerterp-Plantenga showed that the intake of energy containing preload including milk, sucrose, HFCS lead to increased total energy intake from time that subjects consumed the beverages till they consumed <italic>ad libitum</italic> test meal in comparison with diet preload.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Also, Dougkas <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that although the dairy snacks lead to decrease energy intake at next meal in comparison with water, however, when the energy of dairy snacks and water were added to the energy of next meal that subjects consumed, the total energy intake (snack plus next meal) in dairy groups was higher than in water group.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] DellaValle <italic>et al</italic>. found that when test meal was served as a caloric beverages including regular cola, juice and milk or noncaloric beverages including water and diet cola or without any beverages, energy intake from test meal was not significantly different but when the energy from beverages was added to the energy that consumed from next meal the energy intake was higher for caloric beverages than noncaloric beverages.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Tsuchiya <italic>et al</italic>. showed that when subjects consumed fruit drink, dairy fruit drink, liquid yogurt and semi-solid yogurt as the snack, the energy intake at next meal was not significantly different. The situation did not change when the energy intake from breakfast, snack and test meal was added.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Studies showed that dairy can affect the energy intake through its protein content. Diets with higher content of protein can increase diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) than the carbohydrate or fat;[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] because the high amount of ATP is needed to synthesize protein.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Studies have shown that diets which produced higher DIT lead to reduced satiety compared with diets with lower DIT.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Also, studies found that whey protein lead to increased DIT compared with casein,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] on the other hand Hursel <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that casein has higher satiating properties than whey protein.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Furthermore, it is proposed that the intake of casein lead to increased lipid oxidation compared to whey protein when supplied in small amounts.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Protein might also stimulate the secretion of gastrointestinal (GI) hormones with have satiating properties and reduce the rate of gastric emptying such as cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1. The level of this hormone in circulatory system affects the intake of the next meal.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Dairy is one of the high protein dietary group that consisted of 80% casein and 20% whey protein that is high in branched chain amino acids and it is associated with stimulation of CCK secretion and induced satiety. It also affects the motility of GI tract and reduced the rate of gastric emptying.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Whey and isoleucine that are highly found in milk lead to down regulate expression of genes that play a role in lipogenesis like acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-COA) carboxylase, cholesterol absorption and synthesis like 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-COA redoctase; therefore, dairy product could be involved in controlling energy intake thorough these pathways.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The other component of dairy that might help in controlling the energy intake is calcium. The mechanisms to justify the effects of calcium intake on satiety and energy intake are not fully cleared, but studies reported that presence of calcium represents availability of energy for the body.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] A recent study showed that high calcium diet lead to increasing peptide YY (PYY) concentration that it may contribute to increasing sense of satiety.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Investigation was showed that PYY regulate a region in the brain that is contribute to behavior of appetite in human, so it can reduce food intake.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Some studies showed that calcium intake can lead to weight loss through a decreased lipogenesis, increased lipolysis and fat oxidation[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] but few study assessed the effect of calcium intake on regulating of appetite. It is also proposed that medium chain triglycerides in dairy products affect the DIT and lead to decrease energy intake and satiety.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>The present study has some limitations. One of them is that all of the participants were taking their breakfast together and were not blinded about the beverages. Participants may have changed their habitual diet because they were aware that the food intake of them during the whole day was recorded by their parents. Only obese boys were included in the present study. Therefore the generalization of our results to children must be done with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Including one serving of low-fat milk in the breakfast of obese boys might affect their short-term energy intake in their subsequent meal; however, this effect might not remain for the whole day. Studies with longer intervention periods which include more dairy in the child's diet through the day are highly recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors
