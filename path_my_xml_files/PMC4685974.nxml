High-intensity exercise is associated with a decrease in power and overall performance during subsequent bouts of exercise (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This negative impact on performance, measured as decreased muscle force production or strength loss, can be associated with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and is usually observed about 24 h post-exercise and can last as long as 5&#x02013;7 days (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The consensus of research suggests that decreased performance occurs in response to muscle microtrauma, which initiates a cascade of inflammatory and oxidative stress&#x02013;related events. Accordingly, an intervention that could improve performance in the days following a high-intensity exercise bout would allow an athlete to train more frequently at higher intensities with less discomfort (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Green tea and its catechin components are known to stimulate antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting pro-oxidant enzymes, and stimulating antioxidant enzymes (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition to potent antioxidant qualities, catechins and catechin-rich green tea extracts have both been shown to increase lipid utilization during exercise, which may allow for improved exercise capacity (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Research suggests that theaflavins, a polyphenolic compound found in black tea, decrease both oxidative stress and inflammation that result from various physiological stressors. Theaflavins have been shown to reduce oxidative stress via free radical-scavenging (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Most of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of theaflavins have been examined in relation to disease (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). There is limited research evaluating the effects of theaflavins, or their black tea source, on inflammation associated with exercise, oxidative stress, and the related systemic responses to exercise in humans. Green and black tea extracts have been researched independently; however, they have not been examined in combination to evaluate their complementary benefits for sports nutrition.</p><p>
There is a noticeable absence in the marketplace for natural approaches with proven evidence to address the issues associated with muscle soreness post-exercise and the resulting performance decrements (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, ibuprophen, and acetominophen, can be taken to temporarily reduce pain and inflammation associated with DOMS. However, these drugs do not address oxidative stress and performance strength loss linked to DOMS (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, in some individuals, prolonged or repeated NSAID usage can lead to nausea, stomach upset, and other digestive issues. Athletes involved in training sessions on successive days have traditionally relied on carbohydrate or protein/amino acid supplementation to replenish glycogen stores and stimulate muscle protein synthesis; however, data is still inconclusive regarding the benefits of carbohydrate/protein supplementation on subsequent exercise session performance and DOMS (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A few recent studies have shown the ability of certain food extracts high in antioxidants to promote recovery following a bout of intense exercise (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Polyphenolic constituents, including catechins and theaflavins, can provide both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may be beneficial to athletes and non-athletes during competitive training and in general exercise regimens. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a novel ingredient, a proprietary polyphenolic blend (PB) containing catechins and theaflavins, on muscle performance, oxidative stress, and inflammation post-exercise.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Design</title><p>The current study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design to investigate the influence of 13 weeks of supplementation with PB on exercise performance and recovery following an eccentric exercise challenge in recreationally active men. The longer supplementation period was chosen based on success in animal models (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Recovery was assessed through measurement of strength losses (Biodex), perceived muscle soreness, and markers of muscle stress (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], creatine phosphokinase [CK], cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones), inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1;), and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, and ferric reducing ability of plasma [FRAP]) at pre- and post-exercise time points during the 13th week of supplementation. This investigation tested the hypothesis that 13 weeks of supplementation with PB would improve post-exercise recovery.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Subjects</title><p>Men between the ages of 18&#x02013;35 years, who were recreationally active in both cardiovascular and resistance training, yet not exercising for more than 6 h/week, were included.

During their first screening visit, all participants performed a treadmill running test to determine their maximal cardiorespiratory capacity, followed by a practice Biodex leg extension to evaluate muscle strength, which was repeated at two additional screening visits. Participants returned for baseline testing within 1&#x02013;2 weeks of their final screening visit. In addition, participants completed an activity log throughout the screening period to document their habitual exercise regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline (pre-supplementation) and follow-up 
(post-supplementation) testing</title><p>Baseline and follow-up testing consisted of four visits per participant. Prior to all test visits, participants were asked to consume all medications as prescribed, drink at least 32 oz. of water within the previous 24 h, and abstain from the following: alcohol for 48 h, caffeine for 5 h, and vigorous exercise for 24 h prior to testing. Vigorous exercise was defined as those exercises outside of those reported as a part of their normal exercise routine as documented on their activity logs during the screening period. Participants consumed a regular meal 2&#x02013;3 h before both the baseline and follow-up visits. Food records were completed 3 days prior to and during baseline testing, for a total of 7 days. These dietary records were then collected and redistributed during week 12 of the intervention. This meal was not standardized for all participants; however, each participant was instructed to replicate the type and quantity of the food during the follow-up testing in week 13 for consistency within the subject across the study. During baseline and follow-up testing, exercise was limited to only the study protocol and participants were asked to refrain from the use of ibuprofen, ice, or massage therapies. In addition, during the intervention period study participants were asked to complete daily activity logs to ensure that intensity or duration of their exercise regimen as captured during the screening period was unchanged.</p><p>At the first visit during the baseline and follow-up period upon participant arrival, blood was drawn for a complete metabolic panel and to analyze indices of muscle stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Current muscle soreness status was assessed by questionnaire before initiating any of the exercise protocol. Each participant was then given a 120 kcal snack (a commercially available cereal bar) and 8 oz. of water. At each time point during the follow-up testing period, participants also consumed a dose of their respective treatment on-site along with the snack. The rationale for the administration of the supplement during the follow-up testing period was to ensure the study design best reflected what an individual might expect following a chronic dosing regimen. Sixty minutes later, participants performed the Biodex leg muscle strength test and then performed the downhill treadmill run. Fifteen minutes after the downhill run, another blood sample was collected to examine the acute effects of the run on indices of muscle stress, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</p><p>During both the baseline period and the follow-up period, visits occurred at 24, 48, and 96 h after the downhill run. Upon arrival on the post-downhill run days, a blood draw was performed. Each participant was assessed for muscle soreness and provided with a light snack and water (plus treatment during the follow-up period). After 60 min, participants performed the Biodex leg muscle strength test.</p></sec><sec><title>Maximal cardiorespiratory assessment</title><p>A running protocol was utilized to determine VO<sub>2</sub> max so that the downhill run could be conducted at a speed associated with 65% of the VO<sub>2</sub> max. Testing was initiated on a treadmill at a controlled walking speed of 2.5 mph before progressing to 3.5 mph and then to 4.5 mph. Participants then used a series of hand signals to progress the speed. Each stage performed on a flat surface was 3 min in duration and proceeded as such until the participant achieved a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.0. Once the respiratory exchange ratio reached 1.0, the speed was held constant and grade was increased by 1% every minute until volitional fatigue. Treadmill tests were monitored with a 12-lead ECG (Quinton Q-Stress 12 Lead) for heart rate and oxygen consumption via open circuit spirometry using a Parvomedics TrueOne<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2400 Metabolic System (Salt Lake City, UT, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Downhill treadmill running protocol</title><p>The downhill running protocol consisted of running on a treadmill (Lode Valiant Treadmill ergometer) at a 10% decline for 40 min at a speed associated with ~65% of the VO<sub>2</sub> max determined during the screening visit. Heart rate was monitored continuously (Polar). Downhill running protocols have been shown in previous studies to decrease post-exercise muscle function and increase markers of muscle stress (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Biodex leg muscle strength</title><p>All muscle strength tests were performed on a Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). The Biodex was chosen because muscle groups of the upper leg would most likely be affected by downhill treadmill running. Prior to Biodex testing, participants completed a warm-up routine consisting of walking for 5 min on a treadmill at a slow pace. Participants performed three sets of quadriceps leg extensions on their dominant leg (identified during the screening visit and kept constant throughout the study) for 12 repetitions at 120 degrees/sec for evaluation of isokinetic extension. Subjects were instructed to kick (extend) as hard as they could and remain passive while the Biodex returned to the start position for each extension repetition. Each set was interspersed with 2 min of rest. Peak torque (highest repetition, N m), low torque (the average of the three consecutive lowest repetitions at the end of the set, N m), total work (N m), average power (Watts), and the fatigue index (%) were calculated for each set of exercises. Fatigue index was defined as the high torque (the average of the three consecutive highest repetitions at the beginning of the set) minus the low torque, divided by the high torque. For each of these variables, the average of three sets was used to represent a single visit.</p></sec><sec><title>DOMS</title><p>Muscle soreness was assessed using a 7-point Likert scale questionnaire for a variety of muscle groups including the gastrocnemius, hamstrings, quadriceps, gluteus maximus, lower back, abdominals, and the whole body (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Participants were asked to rate their perceived level of muscle soreness at rest as 1) no pain, 2) dull ache, 3) slight pain, 4) moderate pain, 5) painful, 6) very painful, or 7) severe pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood chemistry</title><p>A comprehensive metabolic panel was conducted to evaluate the safety of and tolerance to the dietary supplement. Blood was also evaluated to examine potential mechanisms of action of the treatment through the evaluation of various markers of inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1;), oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, FRAP), muscle stress (LDH, CK), and muscle catabolism (cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone). Whole blood was collected and serum was isolated, banked, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C to be analyzed in a batch at the end of the study.</p><p>Accordingly, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#x003b1; were assayed from frozen serum samples using an immunoassay with fluorescent detection (Luminex Labmap 100, Lincoln, St. Charles, MO, USA). LDH and CK were analyzed from frozen serum using an immunoassay with chemiluminescent detection (Beckman Coulter DXC600, Brea, CA, USA). Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone were analyzed using immunoassay chemiluminescent detection on an Immulite 2000 (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA). FRAP, which measures the antioxidant capacity of the blood, was measured by a colorimetric assay (Beckman Coulter DXC600); and 8-isoprostate was measured by enzyme immunoassay (Tarrytown, NY, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>The two active study groups consumed different doses of PB (Kemin Foods, L.C., Des Moines, IA, USA), a blend of water-extracted black and green tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) containing a minimum of 40% total polyphenols, 1.3% theaflavins, 5&#x02013;8% epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 7&#x02013;13% caffeine, and 600 ppm manganese and formulated under good manufacturing practices.

Supplementation with PB for 13 weeks resulted in significant improvements in serum antioxidant status accompanied by a quicker recovery from a muscle damaging exercise protocol as compared to the placebo treatment. PB supplementation resulted in a significant attenuation of peak torque losses over 96 h post-exercise, a quicker return of cortisol and CK to pre-exercise values over the 96 h evaluation period, and significantly lower muscle soreness ratings 48 h following the downhill run. These results indicate that supplementation with PB can help minimize exercise-induced performance decrements, thereby allowing individuals to train harder and/or more frequently. Prior to the current study, no human clinical data existed supporting the ability of tea polyphenols to attenuate post-exercise losses in muscle strength. These findings are supported by a recently published study by Haramizu et al. which found that catechin supplementation of male ICR mice for 3 weeks attenuated the downhill running-induced decrease in wheel-running activity by 35%, increased running endurance by 13%, and enhanced recovery from loss of muscle contractile force concurrent to reduction in markers of muscle damage and oxidation (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These animal data suggest that supplementation with tea polyphenols may diminish post-exercise muscle damage, hasten recovery, and improve physical performance. The animal study conclusions support the findings of the current study which provides the first solid evidence that supplementation with a proprietary blend of tea polyphenols, including catechins and theaflavins, may help athletes overcome post-exercise strength losses brought on by the intense exercise perhaps through the suppressive action of polyphenols on oxidative stress and inflammation. These findings have critical importance to establishing a scientifically proven and clinically relevant nutritional ingredient that facilitates post-exercise recovery and may have positive implications on athletic performance.</p><p>The literature shows that following eccentric exercise reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate cell signaling mechanisms resulting in a downstream cascade of events, including elevated serum cortisol and CK (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), as observed in the current study. CK levels post-exercise vary from less than 1,000 IU/L for a mild muscle damaging protocol to greater than 10,000 IU/L for severe muscle damaging protocols (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Data is more limited for cortisol levels post-exercise, but concentrations 1.1 to 2 times the pre-exercise levels are reported in the literature (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The reported presence of ROS in muscle tissue post-exercise suggests that antioxidant supplementation may minimize the downstream effects and reduce DOMS after exercise (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, despite numerous studies conducted on the use of antioxidant vitamins C and E, either administered in combination or separately, there is no consensus in the literature that these antioxidants are effective in reducing the loss of strength, power, or the onset of DOMS associated with exercise (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Polyphenols are a promising group of antioxidants that have been evaluated by researchers (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). A number of studies indicate the effectiveness of polyphenols, such as catechins, as antioxidants through suppression of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, a key initiator of the cascade of cell signaling, thus showing the potential of catechins to attenuate the activation of exercise-induced inflammation and soreness (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the downhill run was intended to trigger oxidative stress and the associated post-exercise cascade of events. This was achieved in all groups as evidenced by losses in strength, increases in both CK and cortisol, and higher muscle soreness ratings immediately post-exercise. CK significantly increased post-exercise peaking at 24 h post-exercise, with no differences between groups, suggesting similar levels of muscle damage and oxidative stress. However, at 96 h post-exercise, the placebo group had significantly higher CK values, whereas both the PB supplemented groups returned to pre-exercise levels, suggesting a quicker CK clearance and enhanced muscle recovery.</p><p>Similar findings were also obtained for cortisol, corroborating the effects seen with CK following chronic PB supplementation. Cortisol responses are directly related to exercise intensity and duration, increasing post-exercise (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Although no between group differences were identified at earlier time points, circulating cortisol in the placebo group remained significantly higher at 96 h compared to the PB-H group. Studies have shown that supplementation with either N-acetyl cysteine or EGCG alone in active men did not affect cortisol levels over a 72 h post-exercise recovery period (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, supplementation with theaflavin-enriched black tea extract has been shown to lower overall cortisol secretion within the first h post-exercise (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the current study, the subsequent continued exercise on days 1, 2, and 4 may have allowed differences in cortisol and oxidative stress responses to be identified. Due to of the catabolic nature of cortisol, the ability of PB to significantly reduce cortisol secretion post-exercise may facilitate improved recovery and decreased muscle stress. Although initial elevations in cortisol may be beneficial, prolonged elevations in cortisol can lead to chronic inflammation. Excessive cortisol secretion in response to exercise may contribute to overtraining (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>One of the major deterrents to performing subsequent activities after an intense bout of exercise is DOMS. Although an eccentric exercise was used as a trigger to inflict muscle soreness in the current study, DOMS is often felt after vigorous exercise. Compared to placebo, PB-H supplementation significantly blunted the increase in both whole body and hamstring muscle soreness ratings at 48 h post-exercise. The individuals in the current study were not sedentary, reporting (amongst all groups) approximately 5 h of activity per week at screening. The more active subjects used in the current study may have displayed enhanced tolerance to DOMS and blunted physiological responses after training, thereby impairing our ability to detect greater changes in DOMS and markers of muscle damage or catabolism (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>After an intense or unaccustomed exercise bout, secondary damage associated with inflammatory processes may occur over several days following the initial insult (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Research has focused on nutritional strategies aimed at reducing the oxidative stress and inflammation traditionally associated with fatigue and impaired recovery post-exercise. Although changes in CK, cortisol, and muscle soreness were observed after the downhill run, several markers of inflammation, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1;, and isoprostanes did not significantly increase after the downhill run. However, this difficulty or inability to detect changes at the circulating level suggests future work should incorporate muscle biopsies. An additional confounding factor is that trained subjects often display attenuated stress response to exercise challenges, which has been attributed to several physiological adaptations including increased heat shock protein levels or an enhanced antioxidant capacity (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In addition, the ability to accurately assess changes may have been missed due to the time points chosen for analyses, which were not ideal for all biomarkers (15 min, and 24, 48, and 96 h post-exercise).</p><p>The current study also demonstrated that chronic PB supplementation increased FRAP over placebo, which is in agreement with other studies showing increased FRAP in exercising populations after supplementation with green tea (600 mL/day) or grape extract (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Grape extract was able to limit the reduction of FRAP in elite athletes during training compared to the placebo group (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Green tea extract significantly increased plasma FRAP in the context of resistance training workouts after 14 days and showed a trend after 7 days (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Although the active constituents of PB were not directly measured in blood in the current study, the significant chronic increases in serum FRAP in the treatment groups over placebo support that the supplement was bioavailable. The ability to increase serum antioxidant status may minimize the oxidative stress-induced cell signaling post-exercise, thus positively affecting biomarkers (such as CK and cortisol) and ultimately muscle soreness and performance during the recovery period.</p><p>Strengths of the current study include a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design and supplementation intake compliance at greater than 95%. The performance strength testing used is regarded as the best functional marker of muscle damage aside from muscle biopsy collection which is both invasive and expensive (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Furthermore, participants were introduced to the protocol through three familiarization sessions during the screening period to minimize any potential learning effects. Still another asset of the current study is that strength recovery, blood biomarkers, and muscle soreness were all measured simultaneously. Arent et al. (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) also showed that supplementation with 1,760 mg black tea extract per day for 9 days containing 700 mg theaflavins improved peak and average power during bouts of high-intensity cycling, but unfortunately the authors did not evaluate strength recovery concurrent to muscle soreness and cortisol measurements. The simultaneous measurements carried out in the current study revealed that the greatest strength recovery corresponded to the time point when cortisol and CK returned to pre-exercise levels suggesting a possible mechanism of action for the enhanced recovery and performance.</p><p>Limitations of the study include that the downhill treadmill run protocol may not have been as intense of a muscle insult as anticipated, at least for these participants, and hence, likely did not result in high levels of muscle damage. The downhill run exercise stimulus in the current study can be regarded as mild to moderate muscle damaging due to the less than 20% reduction in muscle strength post-exercise and peak CK values that were less than 1,000 IU/L (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Strategies to increase the muscle stress in future work could include a steeper treadmill slope, concurrent monitoring of the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gases to ensure all participants were consistently at 65% VO<sub>2</sub> max, or the use of sedentary participants. Nevertheless, the ability to see significant differences with PB supplementation even in the absence of an intense muscle damaging insult may benefit a wide range of active individuals.</p><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrates that 13 weeks of supplementation with PB, a proprietary blend of polyphenols including catechins and theaflavins, improves antioxidant status alleviating oxidative stress associated with exercise. In the current study, supplementation with PB resulted in reduced muscle soreness and improved post-exercise recovery as assessed through functional and objective measures of muscle stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors express appreciation to the participants of the trial.</p><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>Source of funding for the study was Kemin Foods, LC.
