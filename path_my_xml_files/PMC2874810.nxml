To achieve this goal, we aimed at identifying expression changes in genes which could be mediated by virgin olive oil phenol compounds in the human.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Postprandial gene expression microarray analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells during postprandial period. Two virgin olive oil-based breakfasts with high (398 ppm) and low (70 ppm) content of phenolic compounds were administered to 20 patients suffering from metabolic syndrome following a double-blinded, randomized, crossover design. To eliminate the potential effect that might exist in their usual dietary habits, all subjects followed a similar low-fat, carbohydrate rich diet during the study period. Microarray analysis identified 98 differentially expressed genes (79 underexpressed and 19 overexpressed) when comparing the intake of phenol-rich olive oil with low-phenol olive oil. Many of these genes seem linked to obesity, dyslipemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these, several genes seem involved in inflammatory processes mediated by transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, activator protein-1 transcription factor complex AP-1, cytokines, mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs or arachidonic acid pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that intake of virgin olive oil based breakfast, which is rich in phenol compounds is able to repress <italic>in vivo </italic>expression of several pro-inflammatory genes, thereby switching activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to a less deleterious inflammatory profile. These results provide at least a partial molecular basis for reduced risk of cardiovascular disease observed in Mediterranean countries, where virgin olive oil represents a main source of dietary fat. Admittedly, other lifestyle factors are also likely to contribute to lowered risk of cardiovascular disease in this region.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a very common condition that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and type 2 diabetes mellitus, itself a risk factor for CVD. Its diverse clinical characteristics illustrate the complexity of the disease, involving several dysregulated metabolic pathways and multiple genetic targets. When caloric intake exceeds caloric expenditure, a positive caloric balance and subsequent storage of fat in adipose tissue appears; this often is cause of adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity. Depending on interaction of genetic and environmental factors, this hypertrophy can be followed by macrophage accumulation within adipose tissue leading to local hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These deleterious effects favor adipose functional failure resulting in changes in systemic energy delivery; these also impair glucose consumption and activate self-regulatory mechanisms that extert influence over whole body homeostatic systems and link obesity to numerous health problems associated with MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A low-level systemic chronic inflammation, with abnormal cytokine production in adipose tissue, increased acute-phase reactants, and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, often acting over a period of many years, appears to constitute a potential link to atherosclerosis development in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, changes in postprandial metabolism undergoing every time we have a meal as well as alterations in this state may play an important role in the development of cardiovascular and cardiovascular associated diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Moreover, Van Oostromet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] provides evidence that postprandial triglyceridemia is related to a pro-inflammatory state due to high expression of markers of neutrophilic and monocyte activation.</p><p>The anti-atherogenic effects associated with Mediterranean Diet (MD) rich in Virgin Olive Oil (VOO) consumption, could contribute in explaining the low rates of cardiovascular mortality found in Southern European Mediterranean countries, in comparison with other Western populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been demonstrated recently that inhibition of circulating immune cell activation could be a protective mechanism by which MD exerts its healthy effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Bonani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] showed that extra VOO consumption reduces inflammatory markers and increase serum antioxidant capacity at postprandial state. Previously, our group has showed how a VOO-rich MD, during postprandial state, reduces inflammatory response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) mediated by transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, when compared to, butter and walnut-enriched diets or Western diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These results have been replicated by others and support the hypothesis that decreasing NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation is a mechanism involved in the anti-inflammatory effect of a VOO-rich MD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that healthy effects of VOO may be due not only to its oleic acid content but also to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of minor components, especially the phenol-rich fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our group demonstrated that the VOO phenol fraction also improves endothelial dysfunction and haemostatic profile during postprandial state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other studies showed how these compounds ameliorate lipid profiles and decrease oxidative stress <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, in animal models, it has been showed that hydroxytyrosol, a phenol found in olive oil, administered after being extracted from its original matrix could be not only non beneficial but indeed harmful for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>It has been speculated that potentially beneficial effects could be due to olive oil modulation on genes involved in proliferative, antioxidant and inflammatory pathways. In order to clarify this question, some human, animal models and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies were undertaken using gene expression microarray platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These studies showed that olive oil is able to modify gene expression coding for proteins participating in cellular mechanisms involved in oxidative stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and other atherosclerosis-related traits/pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is unresolved whether these changes in gene expression are mediated by oleic acid or executed by olive oil polar minor components, maybe as a consequence of their antioxidant capacity, or by interacting directly with receptors, enzymes or transcription factors. To date, no intervention studies in humans have thoroughly explored the effects of VOO phenol compounds on gene expression. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to identify genes which undergo changes in expression in PBMCs in patients with MetS, after acute intake of breakfast based in phenol-rich virgin olive oil, compared to phenol-poor olive oil breakfast.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Postprandial metabolic parameters</title><p>No significant differences were observed in any of the iAUCs of the main metabolic variables (glucose, insulin, non-sterified fatty acids, serum triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol) after intake of phenol-rich virgin olive oil compared with olive oil with lower content of these compounds (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Postprandial metabolic parameters.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center">Low-phenol<break/>OO breakfast</th><th align="center">High-phenol<break/>OO breakfast</th><th align="center">p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">iAUC Glucose (mg.dL-1. min-1)</td><td align="center">1775 &#x000b1; 5156</td><td align="center">1556 &#x000b1; 2661</td><td align="center">0.876</td></tr><tr><td align="left">iAUC Insulin (U.L-1.min-1)</td><td align="center">3722 &#x000b1; 2904</td><td align="center">4141 &#x000b1; 2239</td><td align="center">0.627</td></tr><tr><td align="left">iAUC NEFA (mmol.L-1.min-1)</td><td align="center">-4257 &#x000b1; 3321</td><td align="center">-4029 &#x000b1; 2626</td><td align="center">0.990</td></tr><tr><td align="left">iAUC TG (mg.dL-1. min-1)</td><td align="center">4256 &#x000b1; 3504</td><td align="center">4277 &#x000b1; 6441</td><td align="center">0.995</td></tr><tr><td align="left">iAUC HDLc (mg.dL-1. min-1)</td><td align="center">112 &#x000b1; 689</td><td align="center">135 &#x000b1; 1036</td><td align="center">0.395</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Incremental area under the postprandial serum concentration curve (iAUC) of glucose, insulin, NEFA, TG and HDLc after the acute intake of both types of olive oil.

Of the 98 differentially expressed genes found in patients with MetS during the postprandial period after intake of olive oil phenols, two transcripts (LOC284454, AF351612) showed no entries within the knowledge base and only 81 genes were eligible for network analysis.

From these, 35 genes (<italic>PTGS2, IL1B, IL6, OSM, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCR4, NAMPT, DUSP1, DUSP2, EGR1, EGR2, EGR3, EREG, FOSB, G0S2, JUN, JUNB, NFKBIA, NFKBIZ, NR4A1, NR4A2, PER1, SOCS3, SOD2, TAGAP, TNFAIP3, ZFP36, AREG, CA2, CD69, CD83, CDKN2A</italic>) were under-expressed and after intake of virgin olive oil with high content in phenolic compounds, 4 genes were over-expressed (CCR2, <italic>CA1, CPVL, FN1</italic>). Cellular functions most strongly associated with the differentially expressed genes were cell death (41 genes, <italic>p </italic>= 7.53E-11), cell migration (24 genes, <italic>p </italic>= 3.88E-8), cell division (23 genes, <italic>p </italic>= 6.29E-8), cell proliferation (32 genes, <italic>p </italic>= 9.90E-7) and transcription (25 genes, <italic>p </italic>= 3.55E-05).

This finding draws interest since pro-inflammatory state remains as one component of MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and low-grade inflammation is often associated with endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which by itself is associated to the development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>PTGS2 </italic>gene encodes prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2), an inducible isozyme involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis using arachidonic acid as substrate. In macrophages, and other cells, COX-2 activity is rapidly increased by various stimuli, such as pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1&#x003b2;. Substantial evidence indicates that up regulated <italic>PTGS2 </italic>expression and prostaglandin synthesis indeed influence chronic inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. De la Puerta et al. observed that murine macrophages showed significantly reduced IL1&#x003b2; production and COX-2 activity after olive oil-enriched diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that hydroxytyrosol, one of the most important phenol compounds found in virgin olive oil, attenuates <italic>in vitro </italic>LPS-induced transcription of <italic>PTGS2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our study showed that <italic>in vivo </italic>intake of phenol-rich virgin olive oil in humans is associated with a decreased expression of both <italic>IL1B </italic>and <italic>PTGS2</italic>, as compared to low-phenol olive oil intake. Those effects could contribute to reduced inflammation during postprandial state in agreement with anti-inflammatory effects observed after VOO-rich MD consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The cytokine-cytokine interaction pathway contains a network of proteins (chemokines and their receptors) involved in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes during inflammatory response. Expression of genes such as <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CXCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL3</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, and <italic>OSM </italic>is described under-expressed after acute intake of phenol-rich olive oil in our intervention study on diet. <italic>CCL3 gene</italic>, which codes for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), has been implicated in monocyte infiltration of adipose tissue, an action that could significantly influence a pro-inflammatory pattern within endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>CXCL2 </italic>(<italic>MIP2A</italic>), and further, <italic>CXCL3 </italic>(<italic>MIP2B</italic>) are genes for small and structurally related chemokines that regulate cell trafficking of various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of G protein-coupled receptors. Elgazar-Carmon et al. have demonstrated in mice that early neutrophil infiltration of adipose tissue may be mediated by <italic>CXCL1</italic>, a process that would precede macrophage infiltration after long-term consumption of a high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>IL6 </italic>encodes a cytokine which is secreted to serum and induces a transcriptional response involved in a wide variety of inflammation-associated conditions, including MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been proposed that <italic>IL6 </italic>and <italic>OSM</italic>, which encodes oncostatin M, a growth regulator and member of the <italic>IL6 </italic>group of cytokines, can contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in obese patients by up regulating PAI -1 in adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathway, a cascade of phosphorilation events that result in the activation of transcription factors like CREB and AP-1, synergize for expression of inflammatory genes through coordinate bindings of transcription factors to &#x003ba;B and AP-1 sites which have been found together in the promoters of e.g. IL6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, and many other inflammatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Chemokine repression found in our study could be consequence of phenols interaction with this inflammation signaling system, since expression of some genes involved in NF-&#x003ba;B/MAPK/AP-1 signaling pathways was also modulated after phenol-rich olive oil based breakfast. NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and oxidative stress mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recently Pierce et al. have demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B activation is important in mediating vascular endothelial dysfunction in obese humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The product of <italic>SGK1 </italic>gene, encoding a serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase with a role in stress response and by itself being a downstream target for PI<sub>3</sub>K signaling, enhances nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B activity by phosphorylating an inhibitory kinase IKK&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; so repression on expression of <italic>SGK1 </italic>gene by olive oil phenols would decrease the NF-&#x003ba;B activation. In addition, <italic>NFKBIA </italic>gene, which encodes to I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, a member of an inhibitory I&#x003ba;B family that retains NF&#x003ba;B into the cytoplasm, remained under-expressed after acute intake of phenol-rich olive oil. It has been reported that NF-&#x003ba;B binds to the I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; promoter in order to activate its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, this negative feedback mechanism results in rapid cycles of inhibition and stimulation of NF-&#x003ba;B where a decrease on NF-&#x003ba;B activation is accompanied by a reduction on <italic>NFKBIA </italic>gene expression, as observed in our results. The hypothesis that NF-&#x003ba;B activation is decreased by olive oil phenols is also supported by two <italic>in vivo </italic>studies which showed reduced NF-&#x003ba;B activation after olive oil consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies showing attenuated NF-&#x003ba;B activation by resveratrol support the hypothesis that this pathway employs a shared mechanism by which polyphenols reduce expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>After intake of virgin olive oil with high content in phenolic compounds we found a decreased postprandial expression of <italic>DUSP1 </italic>and <italic>DUSP2</italic>. Those genes encode dual serine-threonine phosphatases, which down regulate members of p38, MAPK/ERK and SAPK/JNK, the three final effectors of the MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, <italic>TRIB1</italic>, another gene repressed by phenol-rich olive oil, is involved in MAPK signaling, participating in the activation of ERK proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and being up regulated in human atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, reduction of <italic>TRIB1 </italic>expression by olive oil phenols could promote decreased ERK activation. This observation agrees with <italic>in vitro </italic>studies demonstrating that phenol compounds of green tea down regulate <italic>PTGS2 </italic>expression by decreasing ERK and p38 MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Our results allow us to hypothesize that olive oil phenols influence activation of AP-1, which consists of a variety of heterodimers of Jun, Fos and activating transcription factor families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], by means of two different mechanisms: a) one direct, involving repression of <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>JUNB </italic>and <italic>FOSB </italic>as observed after phenol-rich olive oil intake; and/or b) another one indirect, through MAPK pathway, where the relative intensity and duration of activation determine the type of response.</p><p>Lastly, biomedical literature and text mining tasks were performed to identify interactions of differentially expressed genes in PBMCs as response to phenol-rich VOO with conditions clustered around MetS such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipemia, hyperglycemia, or T2DM. Recently, Chen et al. have described a macrophage-enriched gene network (MEGN) of ~1237 genes referred as having causal relationship with complex-disease traits associated with MetS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thirteen genes share our set of differentially expressed genes in PBMCs after acute intake of phenol-rich olive oil and MEGN: <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>RGS1</italic>, <italic>CXCL2</italic>, <italic>ANXA3</italic>, <italic>RASGEF1B</italic>, <italic>CD83</italic>, <italic>CA2</italic>, <italic>EGR2</italic>, <italic>DIAPH3</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, and <italic>TLR7</italic>, <italic>PSAP </italic>and <italic>IFIT3</italic>. De Mello et al. assessed individuals with both impaired glucose metabolism and MetS on how long-term weight loss affects expression of cytokines in PBMCs. Weight reduction resulted in a decrease in of <italic>IL1B </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Kaiser et al. showed by microarrays analysis in PBMCs a set of 22 over-expressed genes in T1DM and T2DM compared to healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, 8 of the identified 22 over-expressed genes in T2DM were repressed by olive oil phenols, according to our intervention study (<italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>EGR2</italic>, <italic>EGR3</italic>, <italic>PTGS2</italic>, <italic>FOSB</italic>, <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>SGK</italic>, and <italic>TRIB1</italic>). In addition, <italic>PBEF1</italic>, another gene involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], was also found repressed after consumption of phenols-rich olive oil. Taken together, this finding could lead to potential therapeutic implications in T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study shows that intake of breakfast based in virgin olive oil being rich in phenol compounds is able to repress expression of several pro-inflammatory genes <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby switching activity of PBMCs to a less deleterious inflammatory profile. These results provide at least a partial molecular basis for risk reduction of cardiovascular disease observed in Mediterranean countries, where VOO represents a main source of dietary fat. Admittedly, other lifestyle factors are also likely to contribute to lowered risk of CVD in this region. Nonetheless, our data suggest that mechanisms by which these micronutrients in phenol-rich olive oil would exert their anti-inflammatory effect could involve pathways related to NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, arachidonic acid metabolism, and MAPK. These findings strengthen the relationship between inflammation, obesity and diet and provide evidence at transcription level of control of healthy effects derived from VOO consumption in humans. However, it would be interesting to evaluate whether these beneficial effects are maintained after prolonged feeding and if these effects are carried out by one or several olive oil phenolic compounds, or if they are consequence of a synergic effect of the total phenolic fraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty (56 years old; range, 40-70) subjects (9 men, 11 women) from the Lipids and Atherosclerosis Unit at Hospital Universitario Reina Sof&#x000ed;a (Cordoba, Spain) participated in this study.</p><p>All subjects fulfilled three or more of the proposed criteria proposed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) for MetS: a) central obesity (waist circumference &#x0003e; 102 cm in men or &#x0003e; 88 cm in women); b) high blood pressure &#x02265; 130/85 mmHg or documented use of antihypertensive therapy; c) high fasting glucose (&#x02265; 100 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup>); d) hypertriglyceridemia (&#x02265; 150 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup>), and e) low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) (&#x0003c; 40 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup> for males or 50 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup> for females). Subjects had an average body mass index (BMI) of 38.98 (27.95-44.42) kg.m<sup>-2</sup>, waist perimeter of 132.2 cm (103.0-137.0), systolic blood pressure of 146 &#x000b1; 19 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 89 &#x000b1; 10 mmHg, plasma glucose levels of 102.8 &#x000b1; 17.0 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup>, plasma insulin levels of 11.5 &#x000b1; 6.5 mU.L<sup>-1</sup>, total cholesterol (TC) plasma levels of 201.7 &#x000b1; 27.1 mg.dlL-1 triacylglyceride (TAG) plasma levels of 185 &#x000b1; 78 mg.mL-1, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels of 120.3 &#x000b1; 19.7 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup> and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) levels of 50.7 &#x000b1; 11.8 mg.dL-1. No subjects showed evidence of chronic diseases (hepatic, renal, thyroid, cardiac), smoking, alcohol consumption, or family history of cardiovascular disease of early onset, nor were they taking drugs. The Human Investigation Review Committee at Reina Sofia University Hospital approved this study. All participants gave informed consent before joining the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and dietary intervention</title><p>Before the first breakfast intervention, participants followed a 6-week washout period in which they were instructed to not take vitamins, soy supplements, or any drug. To eliminate the potential effect that might exist in their usual dietary habits, all subjects followed a low-fat, carbohydrate rich (CHO) diet during this period through the end of the study. Compliance with the CHO diet was assessed after two and four weeks using a three-day recording and a food frequency questionnaire. 24 hours prior to each breakfast intervention, participants were instructed to avoid consuming phenol-rich foods such as fruit or juices, wine, grape juice, chocolate, coffee, tea, olive oil, or soy, and to refrain from intense physical exercise. After a 12-h fast and following a randomized sequential crossover design with one-week washout period, participants reported to the hospital and received two fat meals consisting of 60 grams of white bread, 40 mL of VOO (CANOLIVA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Antonio Cano e Hijos&#x02122;, Cordoba, Spain) with high (398 ppm) or low (70 ppm) content in phenolic compounds, and 60,000 IU of vitamin A per m<sup>2 </sup>of body surface. Throughout the 4-hour duration of the study session, subjects performed no physical activity, nor did they consume anything but water.</p></sec><sec><title>Olive oil characteristics</title><p>Olive oil with low content in phenolic compounds was obtained by physical extraction of most phenolic compounds from the high-phenol olive oil, so that both oils retained a similar composition of the remaining macro- and micro-nutrients with the exception of phenolic content (70 ppm vs 398 ppm) (data not shown). Hydroxytyrosol content was 0.2 &#x003bc;mol.g<sup>-1 </sup>and 45.4 &#x003bc;mol.g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively in low-phenol and high-phenol olive oil. High-phenol olive oil was washed in separating funnels with the same volume of distilled water. This operation was repeated seven times at room temperature under reduced light to avoid oxidation. Fatty acid composition of oils was determined by gas chromatography in a Perkin-Elmer Autosystem (SGE Scientific, Australia) according to EU Regulation 2568/91 (CE, 1991). Tocopherol composition was analyzed by HPLC in a Perkin-Elmer HPLC, applying IUPAC method 2432 (IUPAC, 1992).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>Venous blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after consumption of each breakfast. Samples from fasting and postprandial states were collected in tubes containing 1 g EDTA/L and stored in containers with iced water and kept in the dark. Special care was taken to avoid exposure to air, light, and ambient temperature. Plasma was separated from whole blood by low-speed centrifugation at 1500 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C within the hour after extraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid analysis and biochemical determinations</title><p>Lipid parameters were assessed with the modular autoanalyzer DDPPII Hitachi (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), using specific reagents (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany).
