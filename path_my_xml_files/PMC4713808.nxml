applications on pain and physical function in grade 3 knee osteoarthritis (OA). [Subjects
and Methods] A total of 102 patients with grade 3 knee OA were randomly divided into three
groups: Group 1 received a single injection of PRP, Group 2 received two injections of PRP
two weeks apart, Group 3 received three injections of PRP at 2-weeks intervals. All
patients were evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Timed-Up and Go test (TUG) before the
treatment and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the treatment. [Results] Ninety-eight patients
(15 males, 83 females) completed the study. The mean ages of the patients were 53.5&#x000b1;6.6,
54.9&#x000b1;5.3, and 55.1&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;years in Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3, respectively. Statistically
significant improvements were noted in all of the evaluated measures in all of the groups.
The mean differences of Group 1-Group 2 and Group 1-Group 3 WOMAC total, WOMAC pain, WOMAC
stiffness, and WOMAC function scores were statistically significant. [Conclusion] PRP is
an effective treatment for functional status and pain in moderate knee osteoarthritis and
a minimum of two injections is appropriate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Platelet-rich plasma effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Moderate</kwd><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disorder, and it causes detrimental
effects on the quality of life and functional status. These are characterized by
progressively occurring cartilage destruction, osteophyte formation, and subchondral
sclerosis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The histopathological findings of OA show that homeostasis between
the destruction and repair mechanisms of the joint cartilage is disturbed by the increased
expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF alpha), matrix metalloproteinases,
aggrecanases, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins. This causes degradation of the joints along
with the insufficiency in the synthesis of growth factors (GFs), collagens, proteoglycans,
and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Conservative treatments have been reported to increase the quality of life of patients
particularly in the early phases, when the pathophysiology of the disease doesn&#x02019;t
change<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of these treatments
are short term and their local and systemic side effects cause frequent problems. Therefore,
recent studies have focused on stimulating cartilage healing processes through
administration of growth factors (GF), cytokine inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase
inhibitors, or IL-1 receptor antagonists<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous concentration of a high number of platelets in
a small volume of plasma, and it is prepared by centrifugation of blood. Platelets contain
significant amounts of cytokines and growth factors which are capable of stimulating
cellular growth, vascularization, proliferation, tissue regeneration, and collagen
synthesis. Delivery of high concentrations of cytokines and GFs to damaged tissues by PRP is
considered to have a beneficial effect on tendon and cartilage tissue regeneration<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
some in vitro and in vivo studies, anti-inflammatory and reparative effects of PRP on
cartilage, tendon, and ligament recovery have been shown<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, there is no consensus on eligible patient selection, the
number and frequency of injections, the preparation technique, or the appropriate platelet
concentration<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In knee OA, PRP injections aim to promote cartilage repair and relieve osteoarthritic
symptoms, potentially delaying the need for joint replacement surgery<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some studies have reported a reduction in PRP efficacy in
moderate and advanced (Kellgren Lawrence grade 3&#x02013;4) knee osteoarthritis, as this group of
patients have higher pain and functional impairment, which require more medical
attention<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In some studies, it was suggested that in terms of PRP activity,
OA and chondropenia level is more critical than platelet number and function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Grade 4 OA generally requires surgical
treatments such as tibial osteotomy and total knee replacement. In the present study the
effects of PRP administration to control the disease activity of grade 3 knee OA either with
one injection, two injections two weeks apart, or three injections separated by 2-week
intervals on the patients&#x02019; pain, quality of life and physical activity levels were
investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Patients in the age range of 40&#x02013;75 years who visited our physical medicine and
rehabilitation outpatient clinic between May 2014&#x02013;October 2014 because of single knee pain
for a minimum 6 months were recruited for this study. OA was diagnosed according to the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Radiological assessment was conducted by standing anteroposterior
and lateral knee radiography according to Kellgren- Lawrence grading system<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A total of 102 patients identified with
grade 3 knee osteoarthritis (with multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing,
sclerosis and bony deformity) were studied. The exclusion criteria were bilateral
symptomatic knee OA; age older than 75&#x02005;years; receiving physical therapy, intra-articular
steroid, hyaluronic acid or PRP injections in the last 6 months; recent history of severe
trauma of the affected knee; active infection, inflammation or tumor existence around the
knee; history of diabetes mellitus, severe cardiovascular diseases, coagulopathies,
malignant, immunosuppressive, collagen vascular or autoimmune disorders; Hb values of &#x0003c;
11&#x02005;g/dl or platelet values of &#x0003c; 150,000 per micro- liter; receiving treatment with
anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications or systemic corticosteroids 10 days before
injection, or use of NSAIDs 5 days before injection; genu varum or valgus greater than 5
degrees; pregnancy, or breastfeeding.</p><p>After receiving the approval of our Hospital&#x02019;s Ethics Committee, the aims and methods of
PRP therapy as well as the benefits and the possible adverse effects of study participation
were presented to the patients in a written form. Only the participants who signed a written
consent form were included in the study. The study participants attended a screening visit
that included recording of medical history, physical examination, laboratory testing
(complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, coagulation
profile, routine biochemistry), and a survey of medication use. Subjects&#x02019; age, gender,
height and weight were recorded and their body mass index (BMI) was calculated.</p><p>The participants were randomized by block randomization into three groups: 34 participants
in Group 1 received a single injection, 34 participants in Group 2 received two injections
two weeks apart, and 34 participants in Group 3 received three injections of PRP separated
by 2-weeks interval. One patient in Group 1, 2 patients in Group 2, and 1 patient in Group 3
did not complete the follow-up period due to personal reasons.</p><p>To prepare 4&#x02013;5 cc PRP with platelet concentration of 4&#x02013;6 times the average normal value, a
30&#x02013;40 cc venous blood sample from antecubital vein was collected in a sterile sodium
citrated tube using an 18G needle to avoid traumatizing platelets. Approximately 1&#x02005;mL of
whole blood was separated for a complete blood count. Then, the blood with anticoagulant was
centrifuged twice: first at 1,800&#x02005;rpm for 15 minutes to separate erythrocytes; then at
3,500&#x02005;rpm for 5 minutes to concentrate platelets. The final product was 4&#x02013;5 cc of
PRP-containing leukocytes. Approximately 0.5 cc PRP was collected for platelet counting.
Finally, 0.0425&#x02005;mL of 10% calcium chloride per 1&#x02005;mL of PRP was added to the final product to
activate the platelets.</p><p>PRP in a sterile condition was injected by a physician using a classic lateral approach
with a 22 G needle with the subjects in a supine position with the knee in full extension.
Since some studies have indicated that a local anesthetic may have toxic effects on
chondrocytes and affect platelet activation by modifying the ambient pH, a local anesthetic
agent was not used before the injection<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The second and third injections were administered under the same
conditions as the first injection. After the injections patients were told to actively flex
and extend their knees a few times to allow the PRP to spread throughout the joint before
gelling. Patients in each of the three groups were discharged to home after 15&#x02013;20 minutes of
rest with instructions to have rest, to limit weight bearing and to use cold packs 3&#x02013;4 times
a day for 10 minutes for 72 hours. During the follow-up period, the patients were asked to
take acetaminophen only when necessary, or acetaminophen with codeine for persistent pain.
The patients were instructed to not take them in the 48 hours before an assessment. Patients
were prohibited from using other analgesics, NSAIDs, steroids or medications which might
have influenced platelet count or function. Exercise or physical treatment was not allowed
during the study period to eliminate synergistic effects.</p><p>Patients were evaluated before the treatment and at the 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
after the treatment with a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Timed- Up and Go test (TUG).
Post-injection measurements were recorded by a different physician to ensure a blinded
status.</p><p>VAS assessment was done with numbers from &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;10&#x0201d;, equidistantly marked on a 10&#x02005;cm
line. The patients were explained that &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; meant they were experiencing no pain, &#x0201c;5&#x0201d;
moderate pain and &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; unbearable pain, and they were asked to mark the appropriate score on
the line describing their own pain during rest and physical activity<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The WOMAC osteoarthritis index is a disease-specific
questionnaire for the disease, which assesses pain, stiffness and physical functions of OA
patients. It consists of 24 questions in total: 5 on pain, 2 on stiffness and 17 on physical
functions. Individual subgroups scores or the total score can be calculated. A Likert scale
(1: none, 2: low, 3: medium, 4: high, 5: very high) is used to assess all parameters on the
WOMAC OA index. High WOMAC scores are indicative of intense pain and stiffness and
impairment of the physical function. In our study, the patients&#x02019; WOMAC sub-scores (pain,
stiffness, function) and total WOMAC score were calculated. The Turkish validity and
reliability of the Turkish version of the WOMAC index was examined by Tuzun et al<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was
measured from when the patients rose from sitting with their feet on the floor and their
arms resting on the armrest of a chair. The patients were asked to stand up without using
their arms, walk for three meters, turn around, walk back and sit down. Measurement was
ended when a subject&#x02019;s buttocks regained contact with the chair. Three measurements were
taken and the best value was recorded and categorized as: &#x0003c; 10 seconds = freely mobile,
10&#x02013;19 seconds = mostly independent, 20&#x02013;29 seconds = variable mobility, &#x0003e;30 =impaired
mobility<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables. The means of age
and BMI of the groups were analyzed by one way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc
test.</p><p>Repeated-measures ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more matched groups. The
term repeated-measures strictly applies to treatments repeatedly administered to each
subject, and the term randomized block is used for randomly assigned treatments within a
group (block) of matched subjects. A repeated-measures experimental design can be very
powerful, as it controls factors that cause variability between subjects. If the matching is
effective, the repeated-measures test will yield a smaller p value than ordinary ANOVA. The
repeated-measures test is more powerful because it separates between-subject variability
from within-subject variability<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data were analyzed using repeated ANOVA and multiple comparisons (the Bonferroni test)
test. The SPSS statistical program was used to perform statistical analyses and values of
p&#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>One hundred and two patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly and equally

physical function in grade 3 knee OA. However the effectiveness of a single injection was
found to be significantly lower than that of two or three injections. In this study, during
the follow up period, significant improvements were observed in the VAS, WOMAC and TUG
values of all of the three groups compared to their pre-injection values, and they showed a
tendency of gradual decrease over time.</p><p>According to the study of Kon et al. which examined PRP effectiveness on the knee joint,
better results were achieved in patients with a low degree of cartilage degeneration<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chang&#x02019;s meta-analysis showed that PRP
effectiveness was higher at the degenerative chondropathy stage, and the effect decreased at
two or lower doses when degeneration was worse<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study administering a single injection of PRP, a longer
sustained period of pain relief was observed in milder cases of OA<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, while Sampson et al. noted in a study of 14 patients&#x02019;
cartilage thicknesses measured by ultrasonography, that responses to PRP decreased as the
level of OA and chondropenia increased<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
As joint degeneration increases, factors such as decrease of viable cells, muscle function
deficiency, joint instability due to increased ligament laxity, decrease in anabolic
response to growth factors, loss of chondrocyte and thinning of cartilage plate may diminish
the effectiveness of PRP<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite poorer results, patients with advanced OA still benefit from PRP. In a comparitive
study of PRP and hyaluronic acid (HA) in grade 1&#x02013;3 knee OA, the PRP group showed
significantly better results after 6 months and the worst results were observed in
HA-treated subjects with grade 3 knee OA<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kon et al. speculate that, additional biological mechanisms, not
currently known, are responsible for the improvement of OA symptoms after PRP treatment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the advanced stages of OA, PRP might not
have a direct effect on the chondrocyte anabolic process, but an anti-inflammatory effect
through the regulation of joint homeostasis and the cytokine level<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
contrary to this opinion, Calis et al. showed that PRP administered three times at weekly
intervals to patients with grade 3 and 4 knee OA reported improvements in their quality of
life, and reduced levels of pain, and had increased cartilage thickness as measured by
ultrasonography at the 6-month follow up<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is not enough data regarding the effectiveness of PRP in the regeneration of
substantial and irreversible bone and cartilage damage<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, objective studies conducted using magnetic resonance
imaging or arthroscopic methods will be valuable in this regard. To our knowledge, there are
no studies in the literature which have compared different doses of PRP administered to
patients with grade 3 knee osteoarthritis. In the present study, 3 PRP injections separated
by 2-week intervals were found to be more effective for the improvement of pain and mobility
than 2 injections in Grade 3 OA patients; however, no significant differences were observed
in the WOMAC values. A significant effect was observed in the early period after a single
injection of PRP, but the effect decreased in a short time. Based on the present results, we
recommend 2 or 3 injections of PRP for patients with moderate knee OA, and physicians&#x02019;
decisions should be based on various factors such as the level of pain, level of activity,
cost-effectiveness, and BMI. We further speculate that repeating the application after 6
months may further relieve symptoms for a longer period and delay OA progression.</p><p>In the studies conducted so far, the lack of standardization of PRP dosing regimens makes
it difficult to compare outcomes of studies for the evaluation of clinical
effectiveness<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The amount and
effectiveness of platelet concentration and the GFs related to platelets in PRP content will
vary according to PRP preparation techniques. For example, using an activator, the existence
of leukocytes in PRP content, application frequency, and platelet number range are currently
debated issues. In addition, the follow-up period in many studies was short term, and there
were no control groups<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. PRP preparation technique in this study was standardized
by our transfusion medicine department and no commercial filters were used. The platelet
numbers injected in this study were between 1.1 billion&#x02013;1.4 billion, 4&#x02013;6 fold higher than
the baseline value, a number similar to that used in many studies, and it was also within
the recommended range<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study had certain strengths and limitations. The strength of this study was the
prospective randomized design. The absence of a control group and the relatively small
patient numbers were the limitations of the study.</p><p>Considering the evidence, this minimally invasive injection procedure appears to be safe
and effective, and since PRP injections biologically change the articular cartilage, they
may be a worthwhile treatment option even in moderate knee osteoarthritis. Further studies
are required with larger sample sizes with longer follow-ups and objective outcome
measures.</p><p>In conclusion, PRP is an effective and reliable treatment for functional status and pain
for Grade 3 OA, and a minimum of two injections appears to be appropriate.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The influence of exercise on an unstable surface on the
