impairment that strays from a normal walking pattern. Due to diminished walking function of
the affected side, the stance phase time of the affected side lower limb decreases and the
swing phase time of the unaffected side lower limb decreases in patients with a stroke.
Moreover, they experience walking asymmetry and decreased gait speed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most patients with stroke develop contracture in the ankle joint due to spasticity. They
also experience dragging symptoms of the ankle joint in the early swing phase and
difficulties in heel striking in the early stance phase. Patients with stroke sometimes
exhibit typical abnormal walking patterns, such as excessive hip joint flexion or
circumduction walking as a means of compensating for the walking impairment. Patients with
stroke that have foot drop symptoms due to spasticity must secure a decreased angle of ankle
joint dorsiflexion to prevent foot drop symptoms<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes regeneration after injury to nerves in the central
nerve system. Some study reported that combination with the NGF acceptor increases following
therapeutic intervention and promotes the expression of the cytoskeletal protein of motor
nerves and the neuronal growth-associated proteins that are related to axonal growth of
nerve recovery, eventually promoting the maturation, growing, differentiation, and axonal
plasticity of nerve cells<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study by Moon et al. that examined the effects of ESWT on lower limb spasticity of
subacute patients with stroke, instant improvement was observed after ESWT in the modified
Ashworth scale<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study examined the
effects of applying extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) to the affected side
gastrocnemius muscle of stroke rats. The NGF expressions were assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, sixteen eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly divided
into two groups: an experimental group, a control group. The experimental group received
extracorporeal shock wave therapy after the stroke. During the experimental period, the rats
were bred under the temperature and humidity conditions of 23 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and 50 &#x000b1; 5% in a
breeding room where each cage contained four rats. A 12-hour light cycle from 7am to 7pm and
12-hour dark cycle from 7pm to 7am were applied.</p><p>The collagenase-induced model was used to produce ICH inside the left striatum<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. All surgical procedures and experimental
protocols followed Daegu University&#x02019;s guidelines and were approved by the Institution of
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p><p>Histologic evaluation was conducted 30 days after ICH. For NGF among neurotrophic factors,
only post-evaluation was conducted 30 days after ICH. For ESWT, initial therapy began the
second day after ICH, and ESWT was applied three times a week for five weeks from the next
day.</p><p>For ESWT, a magnetic-type ESWT device (HAEMIL, Soltar, Korea) was used and it was applied
to the gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side hind limb with low intensity using the PAD5
head.</p><p>Western blot analysis was conducted for the evaluation of the NGF. To collect the spinal
cord from the experimental animal subjected to the completed experimental treatment, Zoletil
(Virbac, France) and Rompun (Bayer Korea, Seoul) was mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and injected
into the visceral cavity for general anesthesia, at a rate of 2&#x02005;ml/kg. Myocardiac perfusion
was performed using 0.9% NaCl to remove blood, and the spinal cord tissue was extracted.</p><p>The results obtained from each experiment were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (mean
&#x000b1; SD). The independent t-test was conducted to examine the between-group differences of the
effects before and after the intervention. SPSS version 20.0 was used for data analysis, and
the statistical significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Western blot analysis was used for quantitative analysis in the time course evaluation of
NGF expression. A significant between-group difference existed in the NGF expression in
western blot analysis (p&#x0003c;0.05). NGF expression was statistically significantly higher in
the experimental group that received ESWT compared to the control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of NGF expression between groups (Mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=8)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=8)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NGF (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112.7 &#x000b1; 6.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.0 &#x000b1; 0.0*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.05, NGF: nerve growth factor</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In a study that examined the impact of low-energy ESWT on pain and walking of patients with
polyneuropathy, ESWT was applied three times a week for two weeks. According to the study
results, pain decreased most prominently after two weeks, and the effects persisted up to
eight weeks. As for the index for walking, step length and gait speed increased 14.6% and
24.8%, respectively, compared to before the experiment. The dual support duration also
statistically significantly decreased by 12.2%<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number of studies have been conducted that investigated promotion of nerve regeneration
of damaged nerves, survival of nerve cells, and maintenance of neurotrophic factors.
Increase of neurotrophic factors after nerve injury develops as a natural recovery method
for restoration that can promote nerve regenerative response with stimulation that is
additionally provided from an exogenous supply or injection of neurotrophic factors<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. ESWT is one of the exogenous stimulations
that promote expression of neurotrophic factors. Because high-energy ESWT can destroy nerve
tissues, low-energy shock waves should be applied for the regeneration of nerves<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study examined the effects of applying ESWT to rats with central nerve injury on the
expression of the neurotrophic factor, NGF. NGF expression of spinal cord level L4&#x02013;L5 was
investigated 30 days after nerve injury using western blot analysis. In the study results,
NGF expression was statistically significantly higher in the experimental group compared to
the control group. That is, ESWT promoted expression of NGF that affected the regeneration,
survival, and remodeling of nerves. The application of ESWT is postulated to promote NGF
upregulation through formation of a microenvironment at the spinal cord level related to the
injured area.</p><p>This study has limitations in that it is difficult to generalize the results to human
subjects, because the experiment was conducted using rats. As the post-evaluation was
conducted four weeks after the initial evaluation, the locomotion ability changes in the
rats that occurred after nerve injury was not observed during smaller segments of time.</p><p>The impacts of ESWT on manifestation of neurotrophic factors among patients with stroke
should be examined according to various application methods of shock waves.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The work was supported by the 2015 Gimcheon University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Melzer</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzedek</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Or</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Speed of voluntary stepping in chronic stroke survivors
