Most maternal and infant deaths occur during this time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In this period, neonatal hypothermia is an important challenge associated with morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hypothermia increases the newborn&#x02019;s metabolic requirements and is associated with hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and ultimately severe infections and newborn mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Preventing neonatal hypothermia is important in high-resource countries, but is of fundamental importance in low-resource settings where supportive care is limited.</p><p>Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a low-cost intervention that has the potential to prevent many complications associated with preterm birth and may also provide benefits to full-term newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>KMC is care of a small baby who is continuously carried in skin-to-skin contact by the mother and exclusively breastfed (ideally). It is considered the best way to keep a small baby warm and it also helps to establish breastfeeding. KMC can be started in the hospital as soon as the baby&#x02019;s condition permits (i.e., the baby does not require special treatment, such as oxygen or intravenously administered fluids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Whenever possible, KMC is strongly recommended for temperature maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During KMC, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend the following approach: &#x0201c;clothe the baby with a pre-warmed shirt open at the front, a napkin, a hat, and socks&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies show that neonatal heat loss following delivery may be reduced or prevented by the application of simple woolen hats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but the effect of a cap on thermal control of neonates during the first postnatal days remains to be defined. On the other hand, hyperthermia should also be avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Doctors with Africa CUAMM is a non-governmental organization supporting health programs in different African countries. In the hospitals participating in the CUAMM projects, KMC represents a standard of care, but the heads of the babies often remain uncovered due to local habits or, more simply, to the unavailability of a cap. However, although WHO guidelines recommend the use of a cap/hat during KMC, the effect on neonatal temperature during the days and weeks following childbirth has not been previously studied. It is unknown whether covering the head of the neonate with a woolen cap during KMC may help temperature maintenance. The results of the present study will allow us to understand whether the use of a cap during KMC is effective and safe.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that neonatal heat loss following delivery may be reduced or prevented by the application of a woolen hat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These studies assessed patients immediately after birth and for a short period. On the other hand, hyperthermia can be dangerous to the newborn infant and should also be avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no previously published studies that have evaluated the effect of using a woolen cap in the course of KMC.</p><p>The aim of the present study will be to assess the effectiveness and safety of using a woolen cap in maintaining normothermia in low-birth-weight infants (LBWI) during KMC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a multicenter, prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial of KMC treatment with and without a woolen cap in LBWI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be conducted at three hospitals that have three different levels of healthcare in three African countries where Doctors with Africa CUAMM has ongoing projects on maternal-neonatal health.

The logarithm of the number of measurements during hospital stay will be used as an offset, in order to take into account the different lengths of hospital stay of each participant. The effect of the treatment on the number of episodes of apnea will be assessed using a Poisson model adjusting for hospital and a set of clinically relevant confounders (neonatal and maternal temperatures, environmental temperature, birth weight, postnatal age). The logarithm of the number of measurements during hospital stay will be used as an offset. The effect of the treatment on binary secondary outcome (sepsis and mortality before hospital discharge) will be assessed using a logistic regression model adjusting for hospital and birth weight. The effect of the treatment on continuous secondary outcome (in-hospital growth) will be assessed using a regression model adjusting for hospital.
