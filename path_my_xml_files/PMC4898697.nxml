In the 56-week, open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized FIND-CKD study, 626 anemic patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) and iron deficiency not receiving an erythropoiesis stimulating agent were randomized (1:1:2) to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), targeting higher (400&#x02013;600&#x003bc;g/L) or lower (100&#x02013;200&#x003bc;g/L) ferritin, or to oral iron. Serum hepcidin levels were measured centrally in a subset of 61 patients. Mean (SD) baseline hepcidin level was 4.0(3.5), 7.3(6.4) and 6.5(5.6) ng/mL in the high ferritin FCM (n = 17), low ferritin FCM (n = 16) and oral iron group (n = 28). The mean (SD) endpoint value (i.e. the last post-baseline value) was 26.0(9.1),15.7(7.7) and 16.3(11.0) ng/mL, respectively. The increase in hepcidin from baseline was significantly smaller with low ferritin FCM or oral iron vs high ferritin FCM at all time points up to week 52. Significant correlations were found between absolute hepcidin and ferritin values (r = 0.65, p&#x0003c;0.001) and between final post-baseline increases in both parameters (r = 0.70, p&#x0003c;0.001). The increase in hepcidin levels over the 12-month study generally mirrored the cumulative iron dose in each group. Hepcidin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) absolute values showed no correlation, although there was an association between final post-baseline increases (r = 0.42, p&#x0003c;0.001). Absolute values (r = 0.36, p = 0.004) and final post-baseline increases of hepcidin and hemoglobin (p = 0.30, p = 0.030) correlated weakly. Baseline hepcidin levels were not predictive of a hematopoietic response to iron therapy. In conclusion, hepcidin levels rose in response to either intravenous or oral iron therapy, but the speed and extent of the rise was greatest with intravenous iron targeting a higher ferritin level. However neither the baseline level nor the change in hepcidin was able to predict response to therapy in this cohort.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The FIND-CKD study was funded by Vifor Pharma, Glattbrugg, Switzerland.

It maintains iron homeostasis by controlling intestinal absorption of dietary iron and release of iron from the liver and spleen [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hepcidin acts by binding to, and inducing internalization of, the transmembrane iron transporter protein ferroportin, thus blocking export of iron from enterocytes, macrophages and parenchymal hepatocytes into the circulation. When iron availability is inadequate, low hepcidin levels promote enhanced intestinal iron uptake and release of stored iron. Hepcidin levels rise in response to iron repletion such that iron absorption and release are reduced. Stimulation of erythropoiesis, conversely, lowers hepcidin levels through increased production of erythroferrone by erythroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, hepcidin levels are increased in the presence of chronic inflammation, such as in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], contributing to the functional iron deficiency which is frequently observed in this patient population.</p><p>The key regulatory role of hepcidin has prompted interest in the possibility that it may represent a more reliable indicator of iron status than current biomarkers such as ferritin [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and indeed may represent a useful therapeutic target [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As with ferritin, however, the predictive value of hepcidin is complicated by the influence of inflammation on hepcidin levels [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and by high intra-individual variation [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Data are conflicting regarding an association between hepcidin and the erythropoietic response to erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) therapy [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or iron therapy [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The longitudinal response of hepcidin levels to iron therapy has not been examined, nor are there any data comparing the short- or long-term hepcidin response to intravenous (IV) versus oral iron therapy. Additionally, the associations between hepcidin and other markers of iron status, or anemia, are poorly defined.</p><p>The Ferinject<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anemia and Non-Dialysis dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) study was a randomized, international, trial of IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) versus oral iron in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD, anemia, and iron deficiency not receiving ESA therapy [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As part of the study protocol, hepcidin levels were measured in a subset of patients throughout the 12-month study. The current exploratory analysis was undertaken <italic>post hoc</italic> with the objective of determining the response of hepcidin levels to IV or oral iron treatment over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized, three-arm study undertaken at 193 nephrology centers in 20 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00994318).

Hepcidin was measured at King&#x02019;s College London in serum using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer based on published methodology [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Hepcidin data were analyzed for all ITT patients with a baseline hepcidin value and at least one post-baseline value (i.e. the 'hepcidin subpopulation'). The statistical analysis plan specified that hepcidin values were included only up to the point at which the primary endpoint was met (i.e. another anemia therapy was initiated) or the end of the study (for patients who did not meet primary endpoint).</p><p>All analyses were based on the natural scale (i.e. untransformed data). Summary statistics are provided for baseline and post-baseline hepcidin levels by treatment group. The change in hepcidin level from baseline to each post-baseline time point was compared within each treatment group using the Student paired t-test. The pairwise comparisons of treatment groups in the change in hepcidin values from baseline to all post-baseline visits were assessed by a mixed model with repeated measures procedure, using treatment group, baseline hepcidin value, visit, age at baseline and interaction between visit and treatment as covariates. The correlation between observed hepcidin levels versus ferritin, TSAT, Hb and estimated GFR (GFR) levels, and between changes in levels from baseline, was assessed by Pearson coefficients across patients in all treatment groups, using endpoint values (i.e. the last non-missing post-baseline value recorded). Correlations were analyzed similarly within each treatment group at weeks 8 and 24. Patient numbers were considered too low after week 24 for within-group analyses, although positive correlations in either FCM treatment arm prompted an additional assessment at week 52 or endpoint, and/or in pooled FCM groups. All assessments of correlations between hepcidin and ferritin, TSAT, Hb and eGFR included only values recorded on the same sample date. Ferritin and Hb values measurements were based on central analysis; TSAT values were obtained locally. eGFR based on locally-measured serum creatinine values was calculated based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-4 (MDRD-4) equation.</p><p>As an exploratory analysis, the hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals for the primary endpoint of the study (time to initiation of other anemia management or occurrence of hepcidin trigger [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling adjusting for (a) hepcidin at baseline (b) change in hepcidin to week 8 and (c) change in hepcidin to week 24.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.

This is consistent with published data in hemodialysis patients [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and, as in our population, non-dialysis dependent patients with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The utility of hepcidin as a marker for iron stores is limited, however, due to the high intra-individual variation in hepcidin levels [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An important regulator of hepcidin is inflammation, which stimulates production of hepcidin [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and chronic inflammation becomes most prominent as renal function declines [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hepcidin levels correlate with the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein in patients on dialysis [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or in non-dialysis dependent CKD [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the wide intra-patient variability in hepcidin levels may reflect short-term fluctuations in the inflammatory state [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, hepcidin levels may not be a reliable guide to whether iron therapy is required for patients with chronic inflammation, a situation which is already known to apply when ferritin is used as a biomarker for iron status.</p><p>In the complete cohort the correlation between hepcidin and TSAT levels was not significant, although the change from baseline to endpoint in both values did attain significance. However the window between iron administration and sampling may have influenced this result [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] since in the oral iron group, iron was administered daily whereas in the IV iron group iron was administered at least 4 weeks prior to blood sampling. Other authors have observed a significant positive association between hepcidin and TSAT in peritoneal dialysis [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and non-dialysis dependent patients with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but Ford <italic>et al</italic>, in their assessment of 28 hemodialysis patients, also found no significant correlation [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Neither baseline hepcidin levels nor change in hepcidin levels predicted the response to iron therapy whereas a very weak association between endpoint hepcidin levels and hemoglobin levels was found. Theoretically low baseline levels of hepcidin are associated with reduced systemic iron levels and increased capacity to absorb oral iron, and thus identify successful candidates for oral iron therapy. The effect of a marked increase in hepcidin on treatment response is harder to anticipate. If hepcidin is a marker of iron load and concurs with increased iron stores, increased levels are associated with successful therapy. However, if increased levels of hepcidin designate reduced absorption and reduced iron release from the iron stores a marked increase in hepcidin would be associated with resistance to therapy. In this study we observed no evidence that the latter contention is true. Overexpression of ferroportin in response to high iron levels may permit export of iron from macrophages into the circulation even when hepcidin levels are elevated [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our analysis, there was no significant association between change in hepcidin levels and achievement of Hb thresholds or the primary endpoint of the study. Reports in the literature regarding a role for hepcidin in predicting response to therapy are relatively limited [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A single-arm study in 51 patients on hemodialysis with iron deficiency examined the association between hepcidin levels and response to oral iron therapy [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. All patients had been receiving an ESA but no iron therapy for the three month prior to study entry, at which point oral ferrous fumarate 50 mg/ day was given for eight weeks. In the 16 patients who were Hb responders (i.e. Hb increase of 2 g/dL or higher), mean hepcidin was significantly lower than in non-responders (10.8 versus 32.8 ng/mL, p&#x0003c;0.05) [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Chand <italic>et al</italic> studied 129 patients with non-dialysis CKD given IV iron therapy, and on multivariable analysis observed hepcidin to be significantly predictive of Hb increase by week 8 after the start of iron infusion (p = 0.002) [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In contrast, Tessitore <italic>et al</italic> found baseline hepcidin levels to show no significant association with the response to IV iron [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In their series of 56 hemodialysis patients, multivariate analysis indicated that serum hepcidin level was not a significant predictor for an increase in Hb following IV iron therapy in addition to maintenance ESA therapy [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Research into the role of serum hepcidin as a biomarker has been hampered by accurate, consistent concentration measurements [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Different assay methods and a lack of standardization have made between-study comparisons difficult [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Absolute values for hepcidin in urine or plasma samples can vary by up to 10-fold between assay types and centers [<xref rid="pone.0157063.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157063.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here, we used a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. This is more robust than immunoassays for detecting hepcidin (such as ELISA) which have been used in other investigative studies of hepcidin as a biomarker, and which cross-react with other hepcidin isoforms such as hepcidin-22 and hepcidin-20. The study also benefitted from its prospective, randomized design, and the extended 12-month longitudinal recording of hepcidin values. The population size was limited by the fact that only patients recruited in the UK took part in the substudy, but this ensured consistent measurement of hepcidin at a single center using a single assay. It should be noted that hepcidin values were excluded if patients reached the primary endpoint&#x02014;which included initiation of ESA therapy&#x02014;so these findings do not necessarily apply to CKD patients receiving ESAs. Similarly, baseline hepcidin values were low, indicating that the patient population did not have chronic inflammation (the study protocol excluded patients with active infection or baseline CRP &#x02265; 20 mg/L), limiting extrapolation to more inflamed patient groups. Lastly, we recognise that over the course of this one-year study hepcidin data were available in a declining number of patients, with fewer than half the hepcidin population providing values at one year. This effect was exacerbated by exclusion of patients in whom alternative anemia management was started. This avoided contamination of data regarding the relative effect of the randomized therapies, and effectively provided a 'per protocol analysis', but it also substantially reduced the data set over time.</p><p>This is the first analysis to prospectively assess the response of hepcidin levels to different iron treatments. Results from these pre-specified and <italic>post ho</italic>c analyses showed that baseline hepcidin levels were in the normal range, consistent with the presence of iron deficiency, anemia and low inflammatory state. With either IV or oral iron therapy, the increase in hepcidin correlated with the administered dose of iron. Changes in hepcidin levels showed a close correlation with the level of stored iron, as measured by ferritin, but not either TSAT or Hb levels. Hepcidin levels were not predictive for hematopoietic response to iron therapy in this population, although the size of this population and the increasing proportion of non-evaluable patients as the study progressed precludes firm conclusions. Further prospective studies, specifically in patients with chronic inflammation, are awaited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157063.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>FIND-CKD trial: Ethics Committee approvals.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157063.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157063.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Proportion of patients receiving high dose FCM over time (FCM group, n = 154).</title><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157063.s002.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157063.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157063.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0157063.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Nicholas</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bennoun</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Devaux</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Beaumont</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Grandchamp</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
