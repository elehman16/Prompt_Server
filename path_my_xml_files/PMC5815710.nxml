This is because children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have limited reserve of cardiovascular function. The period of anesthetic induction may be associated with adverse systemic hemodynamics, and therefore requires particular attention.</p><p>Inhaled sevoflurane and intramuscular ketamine are both extensively used in unmanageable and ambulatory children undergoing cardiac catheterization or surgery, to obtain sedation, facilitate venous access, and intravenous anesthesia induction.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> But knowledge about their effects on systemic hemodynamics remains limited largely due to the technical difficulties in direct assessments of these variables. Sevoflurane has been considered as well tolerated and does not induce significant change in pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in children with CHD.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Ketamine, as a potent analgesic and sympathetic stimulating agent, is preferred by some others.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> In most of those studies, only heart rate and arterial pressure, that is, indirect indicators in clinical routine monitoring, were used. It has been learned that these indirect indicators do not accurately reflect a true hemodynamic status.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>Efforts have been made to develop techniques to directly assess hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, etc. Among them, thermodilution method has been widely used. But the presence of interventricular shunt, pulmonary, and tricuspid regurgitation commonly seen in CHD precludes its use. In addition, the repeated cold saline injections may affect the physiological status. The Fick method using the directly measured systemic oxygen consumption such as by respiratory mass spectrometry remains the gold standard method, and has been used in varied circulations in children with CHD.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> However, respiratory mass spectrometry is technically and timely highly demanding and hardly used outside of clinical research setting. Pressure recording analytical method (PRAM, MostCare, Vygon Vytech, Padova, Italy) is a minimally invasive and user-friendly method to provide direct and continuous measurements of systemic hemodynamics based on mathematical analysis of the arterial waveform. One recent study<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> validated PRAM against the Fick method in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, which found a close correlation in the measurements of cardiac index. PRAM has been increasingly used in many studies in children with CHD before and after cardiac surgery and provided meaningful data.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Therefore, our study aimed to use PRAM to examine the effects of ketamine and sevoflurane on systemic hemodynamics during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation in children undergoing surgery for complete repair of ventricular septal defect.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital. During the period from September 2014 to February 2015, children younger than 3 years scheduled for complete repair of ventricular septal defect using cardiopulmonary bypass in Beijing Anzhen Hospital were enrolled in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of children. Patients were excluded if they had severe pulmonary artery hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure&#x0003e;50 mm Hg), aortic disease (e.g., aortic valve regurgitation and aortic coarctation), cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction &#x0003c;50%), and malignant arrhythmia.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study protocol</title><p>This was a prospective observational study. Children were randomized into 1 of the 2 induction protocols according to a computer-generated random numbers table created by investigators not participating in data collection. A sealed envelope containing random numbers was opened by data collecting investigators after patients&#x02019; arrival to the operating room. Investigator analyzing the data was unaware of the patients&#x02019; group assignment.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Direct systemic hemodynamic monitoring using PRAM</title><p>The design and setup of PRAM has been described in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> PRAM provided averaged beat-to-beat calculated data in 30&#x0200a;seconds and displayed data on the screen continuously. Data was stored in the device and could be downloaded in spread sheets for offline analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Anesthetic induction procedure</title><p>In both the groups, routine clinical standard monitoring consisted of 5-lead electrocardiography, digital pulse oximetry. 100% oxygen at 5&#x0200a;L/min was delivered via a facemask. In inhaled sevoflurane group (Group S), the anesthesia machine circuit was primed with 6% sevoflurane till end-tidal concentration was 2.0 minimal alveolar concentration. After body immobility was obtained in less than 2 minutes, the concentration of sevoflurane was decreased to 1.5 to 1.0 minimal alveolar concentration. In intramuscular ketamine group (Group&#x0200a;K), intramuscular injection of ketamine (10&#x0200a;mg/kg) was administrated, body immobility was obtained in 3 to 5 minutes.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In both groups after children were sedated, a peripheral intravenous catheter and a radial arterial catheter were inserted in 3 minutes to establish intravenous access, clinical routine monitoring of arterial pressure, and advanced monitoring of PRAM. Fast flush test<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> was employed to investigate signal artifacts. Then intravenous pipecuronium (0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg), midazolam (0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg), and sufentanil (1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg) were given quickly. After sufentanil delivered, sevoflurane administration was stopped immediately in Group S, 5 minutes later tracheal intubation was performed in 3 minutes in both the groups. Mechanical ventilation was initiated with FiO<sub>2</sub> 50%, tidal volume 10&#x0200a;mL/kg and respiratory frequency 15 to 25&#x0200a;/min to maintain P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> at 35 to 40 mm Hg in order to maintain a relatively stable PaCO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Parameters studied</title><p>Hemodynamic data recorded by PRAM included heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) blood pressure, stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), the maximal slope of systolic upstroke (dp/dt<sub>max</sub>). Systemic hemodynamic parameters were collected immediately after radial artery cannulation (T0), 1, 2, 5&#x0200a;minutes after midazolam-sufentanil delivered (T1, T2, T3, respectively), and 1, 2, 5, and 10&#x0200a;minutes after intubation (T4, T5, T6, T7, respectively).

The data demonstrated that inhaled sevoflurane facilitated intravenous anesthetic induction was associated with a relatively stable and favorable systemic hemodynamics during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation. In contrast, intramuscular ketamine facilitated intravenous anesthetic induction was associated with unfavorable status of systemic hemodynamics, with a higher HR, arterial pressure, SVRI, and dp/dt<sub>max</sub>, but lower SVI, CI. Furthermore, the latter was associated with an unfavorable myocardial energetics as indicated by a greater RPP for each increase of CPO in Group K as compared with Group S.</p><p>Inhaled sevoflurane and intravascular ketamine are usually used in weeping and uncooperative children to obtain analgesia and sedation. Then intravenous access was established for the administration of intravenous anesthetics or rescue drug when necessary. While induction and intubation condition could be achieved with inhalation of high concentration sevoflurane alone, it would decrease heart function in a dose-dependent manner<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and cannot provide satisfactory intubation within 3 minutes.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Ketamine cannot induce intubation without adjunct use of sedatives and muscle relaxants. Once intravenous access is obtained by sevoflurane or ketamine or other agents, it is routine to complete anesthetic induction by intravenous anesthetics with minor circulatory depressant effects. Midazolam supplementation with an opioid is favored as it provides adequate analgesia, stable hemodynamics in cardiovascular surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Ikemba et al<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> examined the effect of midazolam-fentanyl combination in 30 CHD children with functional single ventricle. They observed hemodynamics by echocardiography and found this combination did not significantly affect myocardial systolic or diastolic function.</p><p>Most previous studies on hemodynamics have used clinically routinely used indirect parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure. Sungur Ulke et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> compared ketamine and sevoflurane in 47 CHD children with different cardiac malformation including atrial or ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot during anesthetic induction. Their data showed that ketamine maintained a higher arterial pressure and heart rate, whereas sevoflurane induced a transient decrease in arterial pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Based on these observations, the authors suggested that ketamine was a safer alternative in pediatric cardiac surgery. It must be noted that these indirect indicators do not accurately reflect a true hemodynamic status.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> It is well documented that ketamine exerts sympathetic stimulating effects in the presence of intact sympathetic and autonomic nervous system. It has also been learned that intravenous anesthetics may effectively block sympathetic reflex activity and reduce heart rate. Our study showed that arterial pressures in ketamine group rapidly declined and became close to the levels in sevoflurane group after the administration of midazolam-sufentanil. The initially higher heart rate and arterial pressures after ketamine injection and their subsequent fast decrease after midazolam-sufentanil reflect substantial and unfavorable fluctuations in systemic hemodynamic following intramuscular injection of ketamine.</p><p>More importantly, the direct monitoring of systemic hemodynamic using PRAM in our study helps to reveal other unfavorable effects of ketamine as compared with sevoflurane. The substantial fluctuations found in heart rate and arterial pressure were also observed in most of the directly estimated parameters, that is, SVI, CI, SVRI, dp/dt<sub>max</sub> in the ketamine group. Moreover, SVRI was significantly higher throughout the entire induction and intubation period, and associated with a continuously and significantly lower SVI (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.02). This may be attributed by 2 factors. First, the sympathetic stimulating effect of ketamine may not be completely blocked by the subsequent combined intravenous anesthetic agents. Second, sevoflurane may serve as a weak vasodilator.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The overall level of CI was significantly lower in ketamine group as compared with sevoflurane group, although ketamine caused higher heart rate, dp/dt<sub>max</sub>, and RPP, manifesting higher myocardial oxygen consumption. Indeed, CPO tended to be lower in ketamine group, and each increase of CPO was associated with a greater RPP, indicating unfavorable myocardial energetic effects.</p><p>Clinical implications. The information obtained from our study has important clinical implications in CHD children undergoing surgery. Ketamine preserved myocardial contractility with higher SVRI. In children with large ventricular septal defect, the direction and magnitude of cardiac shunt depends on impedance of systemic and pulmonary circulation. Significant increase in SVRI may lead to an undesirable increase in left-to-right shunt and pulmonary blood flow. Additionally, ketamine has been suggested for anesthetic induction in children with severe heart failure,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> because it appeared to enhance myocardial contractility and cardiac output. Data from our study reveals antisympathetic anesthetics following ketamine could result in dramatical decrease in cardiac contractility and cardiac output, this should be paid attention to avoid life-threatening hemodynamic instability. In another aspect, our study evaluates the clinical practice of a minimally invasive hemodynamic monitor to provide insight into advanced hemodynamic information during the crucial and delicate induction period. This technique may be applied to children with varied biventricular or functionally single ventricular circulations undergoing different cardiac surgeries.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has several limitations. As an initiative study, we chose to study CHD patients with less severe conditions. The different hemodynamic effects of sevoflurane and ketamine might be more significant in large-sized ventricular septal defect or cyanotic CHD, which warrants further study. Hemodynamic measurements prior to sevoflurane and ketamine administration were not provided. Therefore, alterations in patient hemodynamics during anesthetic induction were not fully depicted. This is because it is impossible to place an arterial catheter without sedation in children. Nonetheless, our study was conducted with randomization and tight control of the study protocol in both the groups. Our results of comparison between the 2 agents during the entire course of anesthetic induction and intubation were considered valid. The differences observed in our study between the 2 groups may be confounded by the fact that the 2 anesthetic induction agents, inhaled sevoflurane and intramuscular ketamine, are eliminated with different kinetics, sevoflurane is fast and ketamine slow. But our study aimed to compare the 2 anesthetic induction regimen and their ongoing effects on hemodynamics during the entire period of induction and intubation, rather than just the 2 drugs when administered. There is concern that after inhalation of 100% oxygen the intracardiac shunting can be substantially different with parallel influence caused by the different hemodynamic effects of anesthetics. Nevertheless, a previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> found sevoflurane administered with 100% oxygen did not change systemic and pulmonary blood flow ratio. PRAM device has limitations in itself, there have been some concerns of some factors that might limit the reliability of PRAM in pediatric patients, such as location of arterial catheter, an over-or under-damping signal from arterial transducer.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> We used fast flush test to preclude artifacts exit. Consequently none of our patients were excluded from the study due to artificial arterial pressure contours, potentially due to special arterial properties in children.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>PRAM provides direct measurements of hemodynamics in children undergoing cardiac surgery. This advanced technique helps to reveal that ketamine, as compared with sevoflurane, exerts unfavorable effects on systemic hemodynamics and myocardial energetics in children with ventricular septal defect during anesthetic induction. This finding indicates sevoflurane may be a good alternative anesthetic to facilitate intravenous anesthetic induction and intubation in children undergoing cardiac surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CHD = congenital heart disease, CI = cardiac index, CPO = cardiac power output, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, HR = heart rate, MBP = mean blood pressure, PRAM = pressure recording analytical method, RPP = rate pressure product, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SVI = stroke volume index, SVRI = systemic vascular resistance index.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>JL and CO-Y made equal contributions.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Denmark</surname><given-names>TK</given-names></name><name><surname>Hargrove</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group>
