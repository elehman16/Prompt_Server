It has four serotypes, i.e., DEV 1&#x02013;4 and is transmitted by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection, dengue fever (DF) occurring in 50%&#x02013;90% of cases, to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) with the latter two being life threatening. Early recognition, adequate bed rest, and intravenous (IV) fluid therapy in DHF and DSS decrease fatality rates to 1% or less.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Capillary leak and hemorrhagic diathesis/thrombocytopenia are the clinical hallmarks that differentiate DHF from DF. Factors contributing to the hemorrhagic diathesis/thrombocytopenia are hemostatic disequilibrium, increased capillary fragility, thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, and consumptive coagulopathy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Thrombocytopenia is a predominant feature of dengue infection. While the virus-induced bone-marrow suppression causes reduced platelet synthesis, immune-mediated platelet destruction also contributes to thrombocytopenia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Saito <italic>et al</italic>. showed an inverse correlation between platelet-associated IgG and IgM antibody levels with the thrombocytopenia, accounting for immune-mediated platelet destruction.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Dengue virions or virus-antibody immune complexes adhere to the thrombocyte surface, with subsequent complement activation leading to platelet destruction. Lei <italic>et al</italic>. showed IgM but not IgG anti-NS1Ag antibodies to cross-react with platelets and cause immune-mediated platelet destruction.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There is no evidence till date to support prophylactic platelet transfusions even in profound thrombocytopenia without bleeding.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Adjunctive therapies including high-dose dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been evaluated in DHF but did not prove to be beneficial.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Anti-D immune globulin has been studied recently in Rh+ DHF patients to improve thrombocytopenia based on its role in blocking Fc&#x003b3; receptor and reducing immune destruction as already demonstrated in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Anti-D immune globulin is the IgG fraction of plasma prepared from D-positive-red-cell-immunized individuals and likely rich in polyclonal anti-D specificities.

Institutional Ethics Committee clearance was obtained, and informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. Diagnosis of dengue at screening was made with NS1Ag IgM and IgG RAPID STRIP TEST and confirmed subsequently with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM and IgG. Patients with signs of capillary leak and platelet count &#x02264;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup> were classified as DHF. Thrombocytopenia &#x02264;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup> was considered severe.

Diagnosis of all the study participants was confirmed by ELISA. The median age of the patients was 35 years; 93% were men and 7% were women; mean platelet count at baseline was 13,300/mm<sup>3</sup>. The mean duration of illness before admission was 4.8 days. Since our institute is a tertiary level facility, all the patients were referred from other hospitals, in view of the development of danger signs and severe thrombocytopenia, but none had received platelet transfusion before the enrollment into the study, and there was no history or documentation of any prior episode of dengue infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Efficacy</title><p>At the end of 48 h, there were 9 (60%) patients from the intervention arm who had achieved platelet counts of &#x02265;50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> as compared to 1 (6.7%) patient from the control arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0019) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Adequate bed rest, IV fluid replacement, antipyretics, and analgesics form the main stem of therapy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Thrombocytopenia is the key parameter determining the severity and the prognosis. Minimizing immune platelet destruction and preventing associated complications are additional goals in treating DHF/DSS. Efficacy of empirical and therapeutic platelet transfusion is not proven in DHF/DSS patients with severe thrombocytopenia without bleeding manifestations.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Over the years, there is a tendency to use minimal platelet/blood products to reduce the risk of alloimmunization. Since the risk of blood borne viruses being transmitted has declined, this has forced us to lower the threshold for platelets transfusion in thrombocytopenic patients. The current recommendations are not to transfuse platelets if the platelet count is above 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. However, risk factors for bleeding at higher platelet counts are disseminated intravascular coagulation with contributory clotting factor deficiencies, structural lesions with loss of vascular integrity, and refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Since DHF/DSS are associated with compromised endothelial integrity resulting in capillary leak, the threshold for supportive therapy in severely ill patients should be slightly lower.</p><p>Anti-D immune globulin is studied in DHF/DSS to improve platelet counts because it can effectively block the IgFc&#x003b3; receptor, thus preventing opsonization of platelets and reducing their immune destruction. Anti-D is the IgG fraction of plasma prepared from D-positive red cell-immunized individuals, likely rich in polyclonal anti-D specificities and originally used in preventing alloimmunization of Rh&#x02212; woman delivering Rh+ infants.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Moreover, anti-D is particularly interesting drug because of its relatively low cost when compared with immune globulin fractions therapies such as IVIG. The limited availability of IVIG, large dose, and the risk of viral infections makes anti-D a better alternative.</p><p>The previous studies have shown benefits of anti-D administration in patients with proven DEV infection and thrombocytopenia. Kharya <italic>et al</italic>. described mean platelet count rise of 37,800/mm<sup>3</sup>, 48 h after anti-D administration in five DHF patients with refractory platelet counts &#x02264;10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, this was only a retrospective case series involving five children; did not have any control group and anti-D was given only after thrombocytopenia was refractory to platelet transfusions. The mean time for an increase in platelets &#x02265;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup> in our study was 43 h after anti-D.</p><p>de Castro <italic>et al</italic>. in their randomized controlled trial involving 47 participants with DHF and thrombocytopenia &#x02264;50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> observed that 75% of the anti-D group had an elevation in platelet counts against 58% in the placebo group though they did not mention the statistical significance of this rise.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The authors had not described the mean time interval taken for platelet count elevation. Since the chances of bleeding at a platelet count above 20,000/mm<sup>3</sup> are minimal, there is no rationale to administer platelets or drugs at a platelet count of &#x0003e;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Our study results have documented that a single dose can be safely administered and would result in a rapid rise in platelet count above 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> without any serious adverse effect.</p><p>The strength of this study is that it is a randomized control trial and all participants had severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &#x02264;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup>). In the current study, platelets were increased by 29,000/mm<sup>3</sup> after a mean time of 36 h. We found that the rise in platelet count was statistically significant. This study highlights the efficacy of anti-D in reducing the severity of all grades of bleeding in DHF. We also found that the requirement for therapeutic platelet transfusions was significantly low post anti-D therapy compared to the control group. Thus, there was a significant decrease in the morbidity due to bleeding in patients receiving anti-D and platelets. However, the final platelet count achieved did not significantly differ. The duration of hospital stay for both the groups did not differ significantly which is probably due to the prolonged admission of the intervention group participations for the purpose of monitoring the platelet counts for a period of 7 days.</p><p>An important limitation of our study is that anti-D cannot be used in Rh&#x02212; patients. Another pitfall is the small sample size and no follow-up of the participations after discharge. Since the majority of the study participants were males and aged between 20 and 50 years, the efficacy shown here may not hold true for females and the elderly age group (&#x0003e;50 years). We have also not studied the immune modulatory effects of anti-D, which may have a bearing on the ultimate outcome in severely ill dengue patients.</p><p>Anti-D seems to be an effective, promising therapy in Rh+ DHF with severe thrombocytopenia. In future studies, the effect of anti-D on the inflammatory cytokine and a possible antivirus role can be studied in addition to the above involving a larger study group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>onclusions</sc></title><p>Anti-D in addition to conventional treatment in patients with DHF with severe thrombocytopenia (&#x02264;20,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) resulted in a rapid reversal of thrombocytopenia at 48 h, improvement of bleeding grades, reduced requirement of platelet transfusions, and showed no adverse reaction. The convenience, efficacy, and safety of anti-D make it an appealing alternative to other currently available modalities of treatment for dengue fever in Rh+ patients with DHF/DSS.</p><sec
