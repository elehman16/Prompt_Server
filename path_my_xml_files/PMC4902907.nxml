One part of the intervention involves a 30&#x000a0;% increase of strength exercises in the physical education lessons. The other part is based on Motivational Interviewing, promoting autonomous motivation of students to become more physically active outside school.

It is an established risk factor for chronic metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In overweight and obese children and adolescents, not only metabolic health, but also psychological wellbeing is at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Besides overeating and genetic susceptibility, an insufficient level of physical activity is one of the main contributors to childhood overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and the target of many obesity reduction programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, most of these interventions are not successful (see e.g. meta-analyses by Guerra, Nobre, Silveira, &#x00026; Taddei, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; Guerra, Nobre, da Silveira, &#x00026; Taddei, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; Harris, Kuramotoda, Schulzer, &#x00026; Retallack, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]).</p><p>In this paper we describe the study protocol of the new, Dutch, school-based &#x02018;Focus on Strength&#x02019; intervention. Recent evidence indicates plausible effects of the role of strength exercises in combating the negative health effects of childhood obesity (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). Overweight youngsters do not only have a higher fat mass, but also a higher fat-free (muscle) mass compared with their normal-weight counterparts ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]; Ten Hoor, unpublished data). With that, they are also stronger and better in exercises wherein the focus is on absolute strength, making them &#x02013; under the right circumstances &#x02013; more motivated to engage in strength exercise and ultimately maintain a physically active lifestyle. In the past, it has been suggested that strength exercises are harmful for youngsters, particularly during growth (i.e. growth plate injuries or stunted growth). However, more recent data indicate that this is a persistent misperception devoid of any evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As long as strength exercises are performed under qualified supervision, they can even prevent injuries and cause a rapid rehabilitation from injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Lately, the short-term and long-term benefits of youth resistance exercises have become more and more evident (for an elaborate overview, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). Although resistance exercises do not reduce weight or BMI per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], they can induce a shift in body composition by increasing one&#x02019;s fat-free mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], strength, motor skills, and energy balance on the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>In the Focus on Strength programme, we do not focus on what youngsters have to do, but we try to (intrinsically) motivate youngsters to engage in physical activity health behaviour that they like to do, thus promoting behaviour change maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We aim to minimize obesity stigma by focusing on the general 11&#x02013;13 year old high school population, and not only on overweight or obese youngsters. Also, we do not aim to focus on weight loss, or weight adjusted for height (BMI) improvements, but on improvements in body composition. Compared to body mass or BMI, body composition (ratio fat free mass: fat mass) is a better predictor of health, also for young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The development of the Dutch, school-based &#x02018;Focus on Strength&#x02019; intervention is based on the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. IM describes the iterative path from problem identification to problem solving or mitigation. The six steps of IM comprise several tasks each of which integrates theory and evidence. The completion of the tasks within a step creates a product that guides the subsequent step. The completion of all of the steps serves as a blueprint for designing, implementing and evaluating an intervention based on theoretical, empirical and practical information. The six steps of the IM process are displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention Mapping steps</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The key words in IM are planning, research, and theory. IM provides a vocabulary for programme planning, procedures for planning activities, and technical assistance with identifying theory-based determinants, and matching them with appropriate methods for change at different ecological levels including target group, stakeholders, environmental agents, and programme implementers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Methods and results</title><p>This intervention focuses on first year students in preparatory secondary vocational education (11&#x02013;13 years of age) as target population, and their teachers as implementers. Therefore, in this school-based approach, there is both a students&#x02019; programme and a teachers&#x02019; programme. For step 1 to 4 of the IM protocol, the two pathways are described in parallel.</p><p>A school-based approach may induce stigmatization in particular when an intervention only would include a focus on overweight and obese youngsters. Therefore, in accordance with the merits of social comparison theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], we chose to develop a programme in which overweight and normal weight youngsters exercise together. Because our programme includes the general 11&#x02013;13 year old high school population, and not only on overweight and obese youngsters, we strongly reduce the risk of stigmatization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although the entire programme development focuses on all youngsters, it is expected to be more beneficial for overweight and obese youngsters in terms of programme outcomes. Given that overweight youngsters are better in strength exercises than normal weight youngsters, overweight youngsters may find out that they perform better in the domain of strength exercises (contrary to the domain of aerobic exercises) which, in time, is hypothesized to improve their feelings of competence and relatedness and their self-worth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Some authors have suggested that stimulating social comparison may have detrimental effects on autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] while others suggest that social comparison is part of typical classroom settings and that perceptions of competence and relatedness are predictive of autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Positive social experiences with strength exercises may, in time, increase intrinsic motivation for exercise in overweight youngsters. Moreover, having youngsters compete as teams in multi-component exercises, combining aerobic and strength tasks, might encourage interpersonal appreciation of various skills, e.g. speed vs strength.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Step 1 and Step 2: Needs assessment and programme objectives</title><p>In the first step of IM, the health problem, the related behaviour and the associated determinants for the at-risk population need to be clarified. In this needs assessment, a description of a specific health problem, its impact on quality of life and behavioural and environmental causes and determinants are formulated (as indicated in the Background). In the second IM step, behavioural, performance and change objectives are formulated. Here, the foundation for the intervention will be provided by specifying who and what will change when the intervention will be executed.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Programme objectives</title><p>The overall objective of this intervention is to improve body composition of 11&#x02013;13 year old students, and with that to ultimately improve their quality of life. Participation of all stakeholders is guaranteed through regular meetings with the school management, and teachers, and a survey among students. The most important implementers are the teachers. To improve body composition, the health promoting behavioural programme objective for the physical education (PE) teachers is to promote strength exercises in their students. This requires a sharper focus on strength exercises in physical education lessons, resulting in the students spending at least 30&#x000a0;% of the PE lessons on strength exercises (an average of approximately 15&#x000a0;min per lesson). The choice for 30&#x000a0;% was the outcome of meetings with PE teachers about the feasibility of integrating strength exercises in the standard curriculum. The behavioural programme objective for the students is that they, in addition to the PE lessons, become more physically active outside school (i.e. at least 1&#x000a0;h/day of physical activity per day, and preferably more, according to internationally accepted recommendations) (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Programme objectives</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Performance objectives for teachers and students</title><p>Performance objectives are the description of the specific preparatory and sub-behaviours that the students and teachers have to perform to achieve the desired change.

Change objectives combine determinants and performance objectives and are the basis for choosing theory- and evidence-based change methods and other program content. To change the behaviour with the performance objectives in mind, the most important and changeable determinants of the behaviour should be taken into account. In this programme, these determinants are based on theory (Theory of Planned Behaviour/Reasoned Action Approach; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; Self Determination Theory, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; Social Comparison Theory, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]) and on meetings with teachers as well as (unpublished) survey data from students. In Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> the change objectives for students and PE teachers are presented.</p><p>For PE teachers, the current situation in many high schools is that they have little support for the execution of strength exercises.</p><p>From interviews with PE teachers, the most important change objectives derived were that they are aware of the positive influences of strength exercises, that they have a positive over-all attitude about strength exercises, and that they have a high perceived support from their environment, i.e. the school management, and other PE teachers. Furthermore, it is important that they have high self-efficacy and perceived skills to create the possibilities to execute strength exercises in their lessons.</p><p>Change objectives for the students are that they know the advantages and disadvantages of physical activity and inactivity, and understand that different physical activities require different qualities (e.g. a 100&#x000a0;kg judoka is not a good 100&#x000a0;m distance runner and vice versa). They develop a more positive attitude (e.g. fun), perceived norm and self-efficacy towards their own physical activity behaviour outside school. Finally, students report a higher intention, are more aware of the possibilities for exercising outside school, and more autonomously motivated to engage in physical exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 3 and Step 4: Programme plan and design</title><p>To achieve the overall programme objective of a healthier body composition in students, the PE teachers are the intermediates that implement the strength program. However, the implementation of strength exercises in PE lessons is not sufficient to achieve the programme objective for the students to enhance their out of school PA level. To help the students through the process of self-regulation related to physical activity, a motivational program was developed for this study. This motivational program was based on Motivational Interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Motivational Interviewing is:<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;A collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change. It is designed to strengthen personal motivation for and commitment to a specific goal by eliciting and exploring the person&#x02019;s own reasons for change within an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion&#x0201d;</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], pp. 29).</p></disp-quote></p><p>In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> the overall design of the intervention is presented. The PE teachers integrate strength exercises in their PE lessons; overweight and obese children experience higher levels of competence and relatedness; students learn that strength exercises can be fun; a motivational intervention including autonomy support intends to enhance feelings of autonomy. Consequently, this combination of adjusted PE lessons and a motivational intervention would result in the enhanced feelings of autonomy, competence an relatedness that are required to increase the autonomous motivation for PA that helps students to continue engaging in out of school sports activities.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Overall design of the focus on strength programme</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The methods used to prepare the PE teachers for the intervention are facilitation and participatory problem solving (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], pp. 378 and 391). The teachers are instructed about the program, participate in workshops to improve their motivational speaking skills, and are provided with materials to make them able to include strength exercises in their lessons. Furthermore, teachers receive a book with strength exercises and games as inspirational material. This inspirational material is based on literature, ideas from experts in the field, and from the PE teachers themselves (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> for an example, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the complete Dutch book).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Example of the teacher&#x02019;s book with strength exercises</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p>To motivate students to be more physically active after school, and to improve the determinants of their physical activity behaviour, the basic principles of Motivational Interviewing are applied. All students receive a workbook and once a month lessons to increase their motivation to be physically active outside school. The motivational intervention challenges students to make their own decisions and choices, herewith appealing to their feeling of autonomy. Together with the feelings of competence and relatedness the students experience during the PE lessons, the complete programme, therefore, aims at improving all three of the basic psychological needs required for autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The motivational lessons are facilitated by a trained mentor or PE teacher. In the first 5&#x000a0;months, a monthly extra online motivational lesson is given, in which students are provided with the opportunity to establish a shielded personal environment in which they do not feel judged by their fellow classmates.

Commitment from the school management is essential to optimize communication with parents and within the school, and with that to optimise the support from the teachers. Moreover, involvement of the school management is important in order to make this program part of the regular curriculum of the school. Therefore, regular meetings with school managements guaranteed proper participation from the schools and improvement the study.</p><p>PE teachers organize and prepare strength exercises for their lessons using the workbook, locate and use appropriate (safe) equipment, and if not or not sufficiently available, get (extra) support from the schools management. Finally, they adapt and continue strength exercises throughout the school year, implementing the programme with high completeness and fidelity. Project team members visit the schools regularly to provide assistance in case of difficulties, keep the PE teachers motivated and confirm support from the school management.</p><p>The performance objectives for the teachers who implement the motivational intervention are: organize, prepare and implement the motivational lessons. To promote implementation with high completeness and fidelity, these teachers participate in one or two training sessions, given by an expert Motivational Interviewing trainer.

Schools are recruited via meetings with school managements. Three schools are used for pilot testing the program and its components. The other 9 schools are randomized in an intervention group (4 schools) and a control group (5 schools). In this 12&#x000a0;month RCT, it is the objective that at least 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min of all physical education lessons in the intervention schools contain strength exercises (see also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This intervention, study methods and consent procedure were approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, the Netherlands [ERCPN, dd. 06-09-2015: ECP-04-09-2012; ECP-05-09-2012; ERCPN-04-09-2012A; ERCPN-05-09-2012A1].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>After consent from the schools, the parents and their children are informed about the intervention and its measures. At all times, both parents and students are allowed to refuse participation in the measures. After the measures, all students in the intervention group participate in the PE lessons and motivational group lessons as this becomes part of the curriculum. The control group continues with their usual curriculum, without extra emphasis on strength exercises in their PE classes or on physical activity motivation. No motivational lessons are given in the control group. After 12&#x000a0;months, participating students will be included in a post measurement, using the same measurement procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Measures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Gender and date of birth</title><p>Gender and date of birth are provided by the schools&#x02019; students administration.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Anthropometrics</title><p>Anthropometrics are measured using standard procedures (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, III, 1988&#x02013;94. National Center for Health Statistics, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). Both height (using the SECA 213 stadiometer) and weight (using the SECA 877 scale) are measured without shoes or heavy clothes to the nearest 1&#x000a0;mm and 0.1&#x000a0;kg respectively. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight/height squared (kg/m2) and Z-scores from age- and sex specific reference values. The right arm, right wrist, waist and hip circumferences are recorded to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a measuring tape.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Body composition</title><p>Two methods are used for measuring fat mass and fat-free mass. For the first method, total body water is measured with Deuterium Dilution using a slightly modified Maastricht Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. After a baseline urine sample, the students drink 75&#x000a0;mL deuterium enriched water, increasing the deuterium body concentration with 100&#x02013;150 parts per million. At the end of the school day (a minimum of 4.5&#x000a0;h later), a second urine sample is collected. To calculate total body water, the two urine samples (baseline and enriched) are analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. From total body water, fat-free mass is calculated using age-specific hydration fractions of fat-free mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>For the second measure, skinfold measurements are taken to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;mm. The thickness of skin folds is measured at four different sites, over the m. biceps brachii, the m. triceps brachii, sub-scapular, and supra-iliacal. From the sum of the four folds, body composition is estimated.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Muscle strength</title><p>A calibrated and validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] <italic>back leg chest dynamometer</italic> (BLCD; Baseline, New York, USA) measures isometric muscle strength, recorded in kilograms (kg) of force. When an external force is applied to a handle, which is attached to an adjustable chain, a steel spring compresses and a pointer moves. For the test, the length of the chain is adjusted to the participants&#x02019; height by asking the subject to stand on the base of the BLCD with extended knees. Subsequently, the handle is positioned at the height of the intra-articular space of the knee joint. For the test, participants have to stand on the base, with flexed knees (ca. 30&#x000b0;) and hips while the lower back has to maintain an appropriate lordotic curve. Subjects are asked to lift with a continuous vertical motion by extending the knees, hips, and lower back while holding the handle. After demonstration and a familiarization trial, three trials of which each trial last for circa 3&#x000a0;s is performed, with rest periods of 30&#x000a0;s between trials. Maximal strength attained over the three trials is used for further analysis.</p><p>Dominant and non-dominant handgrip strength is measured using the Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Isometric HGS is measured according to the American Society of Hand Therapists. In short, the participants sit in a chair without arm rests. The shoulder remains at 0&#x000b0; flexion, abduction and rotation, the elbow is flexed at 90&#x000b0; and wrist is positioned between 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; dorsiflexion and between 0&#x000b0; and 15&#x000b0; of ulnar deviation. First, a demonstration and a familiarization trial are given for each arm. Then, the participants are instructed to continuously squeeze for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;s for three trials, with a 30&#x000a0;s rest period between trials. The maximum value of the three trials is used for further analysis. Testing order (dominant/non-dominant) is balanced.

Students run back and forth over a distance of 18&#x000a0;m (officially the distance for a shuttle run test is 20&#x000a0;m, but because not all schools have a 20&#x000a0;m gym court, this test is taken over 18&#x000a0;m &#x02013; therefore, comparisons within this study are valid, but the results cannot be compared with other studies). The running speed is determined by the interval between two sound signals (&#x02018;beeps&#x02019;). Every minute, the speed increases by shortening the interval between two beeps. When a student fails to reach the 18&#x000a0;m-line at the sound signal two times in a row, the test stops for this individual.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Physical activity behaviour</title><p>Physical activity in daily life is measured by accelerometer (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]). The Actigraph GT3x (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) triaxial accelerometer is a small device and measures acceleration in three directions (vertical, antero-posterior, and mediolateral). The first grade students were asked to wear the device for five consecutive days, except during sleep and water activities (e.g. taking a shower or swimming). The device is worn on their lower back by using an elastic band.

Based on a combination of physiological and psychological insights, teachers will integrate strength exercises in their PE lessons and will provide motivational lessons. It is hypothesized that overweight students will find out they are better in strength exercises and all students will get more autonomously motivated to be more physically active outside school. The Intervention Mapping process helped planners to identify who and what should change and to select appropriate behaviour change methods, practical applications and a feasible programme that could be implemented by trained teachers.</p><p>In this paper we described the study protocol of the Dutch, school-based program &#x02018;Focus on Strength&#x02019; that aims to improve body composition of 11&#x02013;13 year old students through additional strength exercises, and with that to ultimately improve their quality of life. In this intervention, we focus on youngster&#x02019;s motivation, we aim to minimize obesity stigma, and we do not aim to focus on weight loss, but on improvements in body composition by encouraging strength training. To make overweight and obese youngsters healthier, stronger, happier, more confident (and feeling better in general), strength exercises may be a fruitful way to go in approaches to promote physical activity among children and adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BLCD, Back-leg-chest dynamometer; BMI, Body mass index; BREQ, Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire; HGS, Hand grip strength; IM, Intervention mapping; NCD, Non communicable diseases; NUTRIM, School for Nutrition, Toxicology and Metabolism catalyzes translational research into metabolic and chronic inflammatory disorders; PA, Physical activity; PACES, Physical activity enjoyment scale; PE, Physical Education; PO, Performance objective; RCT, Randomized controlled trial; SMS, Sport motivation scale; ZonMw, Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2016_3150_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>Inspirational Materials for PE teacher.
