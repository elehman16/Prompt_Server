During spine stabilizing exercise, multiple
muscles must be activated simultaneously<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Trunk muscles are classified as major or minor depending on their role. Major muscles,
including the rectus abdominis, the external oblique, and the erector spine are
superficially located, connect the trunk and pelvis, and provide control for the ability to
bear weight applied to the trunk<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Minor
muscles, including the multifidus, interspinales, intertransversarii, transversus abdominis,
and internal oblique, are located in the deep plane, and ensure the dynamic stability of the
spine. The minor muscles are particularly effective for controlling the stiffness of spinal
segments and maintaining spinal posture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are several trunk stabilizing exercise methods, such as the Swiss ball exercise on
uneven ground, core exercises, curl-up exercises, and pilates<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among equipment that
accelerates trunk stabilization using vibration, recently, the Flexi-Bar has been used in
hospitals and fitness centers<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Flexi-Bar is weighted and flexible and is designed for use at small amplitudes of 5&#x02005;Hz,
transmitting a vibration when held by the user while maintaining its physical shape<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Flexi-Bar is safe as the vibratory
stimulation is of small amplitude and can be used without special training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibration speed and amplitude
generated by the Flexi-Bar can be modulated by active vibration stimulation generated by the
user and can be performed in various positions safely and conveniently<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk muscular strength is essential to maintain to facilitate changes in stance and to

we can determine increases in muscular strength<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,

the control group, respectively.</p><p>The experimental and control groups used an ordinary pole for exercise. In addition, the
experimental group exercised with a Flexi-Bar (Togu, Germany). The Flexi-Bar vibrates 270
times/min and can be used for shoulder joint and whole-body exercise. Voluntary transmission
of vibration to the arm causes concurrent contraction of the shoulder and trunk muscles and
improves muscular strength, stability, and proprioceptive sense around the shoulder. The
Flexi-Bar is 153&#x02005;cm long, weighs 710 g, and is 9.5&#x02005;mm thick. Exercise intensity can be
modulated by changing the weight and thickness of the Flexi-Bar. The Flexi-Bar exercise
comprises eight programs, including Butterfly Front, Butterfly Up, Butterfly Down, Right
Left, Spine Alignment, Shoulder and Upper back, Abdominals, and Torso Musculature. The
Flexi-Bar exercise was performed for 30 minutes, thrice a week for 6 months.</p><p>Ultrasonic imaging (MySono U6, Samsung Medison, Korea) was used to measure the changes in
thickness of the trunk muscles. The B-scan mode was used for imaging. The transversus
abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and multifidus muscles were measured with the
subject horizontal. A balance measuring instruments (RM Ing&#x000e9;nierie, Rodez, France) were used
to measure balance ability. These comprised a platform that can sense the moving distance of
the center of pressure (COP), a computer analysis program, and a monitor. The Romberg test
was used to measure static balance. The COP moving distance was measured as follows: the
subject stood on the platform with legs spread about 30&#x000b0; apart and with their eyes fixed
ahead; they balanced for 1&#x02005;min, and maintained minimal movement. The subject was required to
keep their eyes open and fixed on a point on the monitor while maintaining a stance. The
subject was then required to maintain the stance with their eyes closed. The gross area of
stability limits was measured to determine dynamic balance. The subject was required to move
from the stance in eight directions shown on the monitor: front, back, left, right, and
diagonally, with a maximized COP.</p><p>The data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics
were calculated using the general characteristics of the participants. The paired t-test was
used to compare in-group data before and after the intervention. The independent t-test was
used to compare the results of changes in thickness of the trunk muscles, and balance before
and after the intervention between the groups. The significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the results of trunk muscle thickness and balance between the

vibration on trunk muscle thickness and balance in university students in their twenties.
After 6 months of exercise with the Flexi-Bar with vibration, the thickness of the
transversus abdominis clearly increased. Comparison of the values before and after 6 months
of exercise showed a significant increase in muscular thickness relative to the control
group. After 6 months of exercise, there was a greater increase in the multifidus thickness
compared to before the exercise. However, there were no differences in the internal oblique
and external oblique muscles over time, and there were no differences between the
experimental and control groups. Stevens et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the activity of the trunk muscles increased markedly
as the external weight on the limbs increased. In their study, they examined 14 male
subjects to determine pressure tolerance and spinal stability of the 4th and 5th lumbar
vertebrae. Stevens et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> used a
vibrating instrument, with a pressure tolerance of 1,670N of horizontal vibration measured
at low amplitude and a tolerance of 4,328N of vertical vibration measured at high amplitude.
Vibrations transferred by the Flexi-Bar pressed against the spine improved muscular
thickness<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, Chung et
al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported different results for
the effect of the Flexi-Bar exercise on the activation of trunk muscles. The Flexi-Bar
exercise showed greater external weight effect compared to the use of a non-vibrating bar,
with clear differences in the activation of the internal oblique and external oblique
muscles. The oblique muscles affect trunk flexion, rotation, and lateral flexion. The
one-hand use of the Flexi-Bar stimulated the oblique muscles, which was not observed in this
study. It is possible that stimulation of the diagonally oriented oblique muscles could not
be accomplished because the vibration was applied vertically and horizontally using both
hands in all stances.</p><p>Balance ability was determined using the Romberg test with eyes opened and closed, COP
moving distance with one-leg standing and gross area of the COP moving distance for
stability limits. In the Romberg test, a clear decrease in COP moving distance was shown,
and 6months of exercise resulted in greater improvement in one-leg standing compared to that
observed before exercise. In comparing results before and after 6 months of exercise, no
differences were shown between the experimental and control groups. The results of the
Romberg test differed for eyes open and closed as the proprioceptive sense with eyes closed
is mobilized more than that with eyes open. Proprioceptive sense conveys information on a
position, movement, and joint vibration to the central nervous system; therefore, vibration
conveyed from the Flexi-Bar to the foot could have improved proprioceptive sense. Mileva et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that Flexi-Bar exercise
with 5-Hz vibration from the hand to the arm muscles that continued to the trunk and legs,
and influenced the one-leg squatting position. Abercromby et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when vibration is transmitted from the trunk
with the subject standing on a whole body vibration platform, continuous stimulation in a
standing position depends on passive mechanisms that weaken the amplitude of the continuous
vibration level and adversely affect energy storage in the body. This also adversely affects
vestibular sense and sight without affecting balance, while vibration uses active mechanisms
to assist in balance<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Simultaneous contraction of lumbar muscles reportedly
improved stance control in one-leg standing<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This research showed that increased thickness of the multifidus
and transversus abdominis muscles improved one-leg standing. Stability of dynamic balance
can be determined by calculating the area of the range of body movements in the directions
shown by arrows on the monitor of the balance measuring instrument, but the change did not
correspond to time and group. This may be because the subjects were university students in
their twenties with no lower extremity musculoskeletal disorders, in whom it was difficult
to measure dynamic balance. Moreover, because the subjects moved in the direction of arrows
shown on the monitor, measurements depended on sight alone, rather than the combination of
sight and vestibular and proprioceptive senses<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The movement was not dependent on
normal vision in this research; sight is too sensitive to be affected by other sensory
systems, and measurements dependent on visual stimulation could not affect dynamic
balance<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A limitation of this
research is that the number of subjects was too small to normalize the results. In addition,
the Flexi-Bar exercise uses actively induced vibration, but the point at which a change of
amplitude could affect muscular thickness could not be determined since not all subjects
could achieve the same changes in amplitude. Furthermore, the muscular thickness measured by
ultrasonography was measured in the resting state, and not in the contracted state.

in muscular strength with greater sensitivity. Clinical research is needed for patients with
abdominal pain and trunk instability.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kavcic</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Grenier</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>McGill</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Determining the stabilizing role of individual torso
