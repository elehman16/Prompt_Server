Anti-viral treatment interventions were based on CMV DNAemia as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (&#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;copies/mL) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was prescribed for neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>&#x000a0;cells/L). Blood samples for viral testing and safety monitoring were shipped to a central laboratory by overnight carrier.

The complicated logistics of managing a trial requiring real-time changes in patient care based on laboratory results from a distance means that such studies are rarely, if ever done. Indeed the paucity of high-quality treatment and prevention studies in this setting has plagued the field for decades. We recently reported the findings from an investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized Phase III trial comparing valganciclovir prophylaxis to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-guided preemptive therapy for the prevention of late cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in post-allogeneic HCT patients surviving at least 80 days from transplant <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, which was specifically designed to allow for the expansion of the study drug label to include prophylactic use. The study demonstrated that complex clinical trials utilizing both private and academic-based care settings can be successfully carried to fruition and provided a model for the cooperation necessary for the successful completion of the trial. Here we present the specifics that enabled this long-term, double-blinded phase III clinical trial to be successfully conducted across 36 U.S. states with real-time treatment and dose adjustment of study medications based on laboratory monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Trial design</title><p id="p0015">The detailed design of the clinical trial is reported elsewhere <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Briefly, a multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of valganciclovir for the prevention of late CMV infection was conducted in CMV seropositive subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT between 2001 and 2008. Seven sites participated in this study with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) as the coordinating center. Over the course of the study, 184 subjects were randomized and formed the intent-to-treat population. Randomization to receive study drug (valganciclovir or placebo) occurred between day 80 and day 120 post HCT (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The active study period during which study drug was administered and real-time decisions were made occurred between randomization and day 270 post-transplant.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Communication between sites, primary providers and participants</title><p id="p0020">Maintaining communication between the coordinating site and primary physicians was critical to the success of this study and to ensuring timely interventions.

Blood was drawn at the subject's local medical facility and shipped overnight (Federal Express) using pre-paid packages and study-provided kits to the coordinating center for testing at the University of Washington clinical laboratories. The primary care provider for each patient was contacted by site personnel with laboratory results as they became available (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Monthly contact with the subject during the treatment phase was maintained by the study coordinator at the local sites and consisted of status checks of CMV infections, other infections, hospitalization, adverse events, medication history, study drug compliance and any requests for drug supply or laboratory supplies. Data, including clinical and laboratory records, were maintained in a secure online database.

Intravenous (IV) ganciclovir was given for initial treatment of CMV disease and in situations when no oral medication could be administered. In January 2004, the protocol was modified to allow the use of open label valganciclovir as an alternative to IV ganciclovir for the treatment of CMV reactivation to prevent possible treatment delays associated with the logistics of IV therapy. Patients were given a supply of valganciclovir and instructed by the study coordinator to discontinue study drug and start open-label treatment when CMV DNAemia exceeded the threshold. These patients were subsequently monitored by PCR and retreated if CMV tests resulted positive through day 270. Foscarnet 60&#x000a0;mg/kg IV twice daily induction for at least 1 week was given for patients with neutropenia, followed by 90&#x000a0;mg/kg maintenance daily until the PCR result was negative.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4.2"><label>2.4.2</label><title>G-CSF initiation for neutropenia</title><p id="p0040">Neutrophil counts were monitored while subjects received study drug through day 270.

Sample delivery was most affected by non-Monday holidays and extreme weather conditions.</p><p id="p0090">In the randomized trial <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, preemptive therapy was as successful as prophylaxis in prevention of CMV disease but each had its own challenges for management of patients. Preemptive therapy required diligent follow-up to ensure viral testing was performed, results were provided quickly, and treatment was provided quickly when indicated. Prophylaxis with valganciclovir, a medication associated with myelotoxicity and one that requires dose adjustment in the setting of renal insufficiency, required diligent monitoring of ANC and serum creatinine; quick dose adjustment and the provision of GCSF likely reduced the frequency and impact of severe drug-related neutropenia.</p><p id="p0095">Over 50% of subjects with CMV DNAemia greater than the threshold were treated within one day of receipt of results. Given that the doubling time of CMV is one to two days on average and that immunosuppression plays a role in the <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> replication dynamics <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, the ability to deliver care quickly is paramount, although the doubling time may be longer late after HCT due to partially reconstituted CMV-specific immunity.</p><p id="p0100">The protocol was amended in January 2004 to allow for the use of open label valganciclovir as preemptive therapy in place of IV ganciclovir given the difficulty in rapidly coordinating the administration of IV therapy in an outpatient remote setting. Although more patients received valganciclovir after the protocol change, time to receive the first dose of preemptive therapy was not shorter when patients had valganciclovir readily available at home. It may be that time to treatment was impacted mostly by delays in notification from busy local doctors, rather than arranging for IV administration. There were two outliers to starting therapy, one at 7 days and one at 28 days after receipt of positive PCR results. While the time to begin treatment was prolonged in these cases neither of these two subjects progressed to develop CMV disease. The 28 day time lapse was due to the concern of relapsed malignancy, and the 7 day time lapse was likely due to communication issues between the primary physician and the subject.</p><p id="p0105">Neutropenia is an expected adverse event of ganciclovir and valganciclovir; however, the exact incidence late after HCT is not known. The use of G-CSF has been observed to reverse neutropenia with a median time to reversal of 2 days in HIV-infected subjects <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The majority of patients in our study started G-CSF within 2 days of discovery of neutropenia. Although more patients received G-CSF once the protocol was modified to make administration standard for neutropenia in January 2004, the change did not lead to a more rapid start of the drug. Further, most patients discontinued study drug within 2 days of discovery of neutropenia. Start of G-CSF and discontinuation of study medication was delayed in some cases due to the challenges presented by management of the trial across multiple time zones. The reversal of severe neutropenia appeared to be effective, as no statistically significant differences in invasive bacterial and fungal infections were seen between the randomization groups <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0110">Study drug dose adjustment for renal function was implemented within a median of 1 day upon obtaining the result, but a number of subjects requiring a dose adjustment were not informed until 4 or 5 days after the results were available. This disappointing delay did not have an obvious explanation, but may have been due to differences in time zones and days of the week (Fridays). In any case, the delay in dosage change only resulted in neutropenia in one case. A recent survey of primary-care physicians reported failure to inform the subject of their test results in 7.1% of all visits <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our study was able to ensure documentation and communication with subjects equal to and arguably better than global community practice.</p><p id="p0115">This study successfully implemented real-time management of CMV preemptive treatment in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled setting away from comprehensive cancer centers. The ability to quickly communicate with subjects and providers across the United States was limited by the technology of the time. When this study was initiated, telephone and fax were the standard method used to communicate test results, with some email. Today, email, text messaging and smart phone applications can rapidly transmit results securely and remind subjects to take medications, simplifying the logistics needed to conduct clinical trials with subjects in remote locations <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. People are easier to reach than ever with less effort and expense on the part of coordinators, as many electronic forms of communication can be automated and are growing in acceptance. Even so, the monitoring of virologic and safety testing in this study required significant dedication from study personnel, local primary care providers and patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Designated personnel to perform vigilant and ongoing communication with subjects and providers are needed to minimize late sample delivery, particularly with regard to holidays and inclement weather, and allow therapeutic decisions to be made on a real-time basis.</p><p id="p0120">This study has strengths and limitations. This study represents the first double blinded trial to successfully implement real-time management of CMV preemptive treatment, and further demonstrates prospective documentation of sample collection over time covering a very large geographic and diverse area. One limitation is that reasons for delays in study drug adjustment were not prospectively collected on the study case report forms. Another limitation is the inability to differentiate performance between patients who were managed directly from site coordinators versus those who were treated through remote providers.</p><p id="p0125">Participation in long-term longitudinal interventional trials with real time management of study medication in remote settings provides subjects with access to expert medical professionals and the latest therapies. It also helps to generate data of the highest quality. This may be particularly relevant for studies of late complications after HCT, such as chronic GVHD as well as pulmonary and infectious complications <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, patients may experience an increased sense of hope and meaning as a result of contributing to studies offering better treatment for their disease <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The prospect of enabling subjects to participate in a multicenter study while being treated by their local physician represents new options in healthcare delivery. Given the paucity of data on turnaround times in oncology patients, this trial provides benchmark data for future interventions. Our results show that a randomized double-blinded multicenter trial with subjects geographically located miles from the coordinating center can be conducted effectively, safely and according to GCP standards.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Grant support</title><p id="p0130">This work was partially supported by grants from the <funding-source id="gs1">National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (K24 HL093294), <funding-source id="gs2">National Cancer Institute</funding-source> (CA18029), and <funding-source id="gs3">Hoffmann La Roche LTD</funding-source>.</p><p id="p0135">The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center reviewed this study.
