The statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the Penicillin for the Emergency Department Outpatient treatment of CELLulitis (PEDOCELL) trial is described here. The PEDOCELL trial is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, double-blinded, non-inferiority clinical trial comparing the efficacy of flucloxacillin (monotherapy) with combination flucloxacillin/phenoxymethylpenicillin (dual therapy) for the outpatient treatment of cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) setting. To prevent outcome reporting bias, selective reporting and data-driven results, the a priori-defined, detailed SAP is presented here.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Patients will be randomised to either orally administered flucloxacillin 500&#x000a0;mg four times daily and placebo or orally administered 500&#x000a0;mg of flucloxacillin four times daily and phenoxymethylpenicillin 500&#x000a0;mg four times daily. The trial consists of a 7-day intervention period and a 2-week follow-up period. Study measurements will be taken at four specific time points: at patient enrolment, day 2&#x02013;3 after enrolment and commencing treatment (early clinical response (ECR) visit), day 8&#x02013;10 after enrolment (end-of-treatment (EOT) visit) and day 14&#x02013;21 after enrolment (test-of-cure (TOC) visit). The primary outcome measure is investigator-determined clinical response measured at the TOC visit. The secondary outcomes are as follows: lesion size at ECR, clinical treatment failure at each follow-up visit, adherence and persistence of trial patients with orally administered antibiotic therapy at EOT, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and pharmacoeconomic assessments. The plan for the presentation and comparison of baseline characteristics and outcomes is described in this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial aims to establish the non-inferiority of orally administered flucloxacillin monotherapy with orally administered flucloxacillin/phenoxymethylpenicillin dual therapy for the ED-directed outpatient treatment of cellulitis. In doing so, this trial will bridge a knowledge gap in this understudied and common condition and will be relevant to clinicians across several different disciplines. The SAP for the PEDOCELL trial was developed a priori in order to minimise analysis bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT number: 2016-001528-69).

In this paper the SAP that has been finalised prior to any recruitment, and to which all data analyses in the main publication of the trial results will adhere, is described. The PEDOCELL trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02922686) and EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT number: 2016-001528-69). The SAP was written and submitted without knowledge of the outcome data.</p><p id="Par39">In 2013, the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) describing a similar intervention (flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin versus flucloxacillin and placebo) was published by members of this research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, in 2010 and again in 2013, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended a different primary outcome measure for trials of antibiotic treatment for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), which directly impacted on the proposed primary and secondary outcome measures to be utilized in the previous version of this study. In addition, the investigators developed several secondary outcome measures including validation of the Extremity Soft Tissue Infection (ESTI) score, measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EuroQol &#x02013; 5 dimensions &#x02013; 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L) instrument, a pharmacoeconomic analysis to assess cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the new treatment, and an adherence substudy using an electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS&#x000ae; cap). The investigators have also the created a credible Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), a scientific advisory group, the nomination of five site investigators and the recruitment of two full-time research nurses to join the project team. Given the scope and scale of these changes, it was decided that the submission of an entirely new application to the relevant authorities was required. An overview of the current study design is outlined below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial overview</title><p id="Par40">The PEDOCELL trial is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial which will be conducted in five hospitals in the Republic of Ireland (Beaumont Hospital, Connolly Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and Mercy University Hospital).

Additionally, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has recommended a non-inferiority margin of between 10 and 15% for RCTs of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, current RCT evidence indicates that the efficacy of the comparator intervention (i.e. dual therapy with flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin) is 83&#x02013;87% efficacious.

HRQoL for economic evaluation</title><p id="Par112">The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Consortium Project Team and the FDA have explicitly indicated that patient-reported outcome measurements, or how a patient &#x0201c;feels and functions,&#x0201d; are important, required by regulation, and should be measured at early and late time points. However, no RCT included in the Cochrane review of cellulitis treatment assessed HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The planned study aims to measure HRQoL using the EQ-5D-5L instrument and also to validate a novel disease-specific HRQoL instrument, the ESTI score, in order to address these knowledge gaps. Validation of the ESTI score may also inform future health care decisions about more costly interventions for the treatment of cellulitis. In the meantime, a large proportion of the economic cost of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (CA-MRSA) stems from losses in patient productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the economic impact of treating ABSSSI for patients presenting to EDs is unknown; by performing a pharmacoeconomic analysis we will provide useful insights regarding the economic impact of treating this relatively common ED condition.</p><p id="Par113">The EQ-5D-5L has been selected as the most appropriate measure of HRQoL. It is a standard measure of self-reported HRQoL which includes five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The ESTI score will also be measured and mapped against the ED-5D-5&#x000a0;L as a robustness check and this outcome will be used as an alternative way to measure QALYs. The EQ-5D-5L, the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and ESTI score will be used to obtain patient reports of HRQoL and then used in the estimation of QALYs. The (SF-12) instrument is routinely used as a sensitivity check for quality of life within trials.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>5. Pharmacoeconomic analysis of cost per QALY</title><p id="Par114">Although the cost of treating cellulitis may be relatively low, it is important to understand the full health outcomes associated with acute cellulitis in order to establish complete cost-effectiveness for resource allocation decisions. We will perform a within-trial economic evaluation of the cost per QALY gained from the use of orally administered flucloxacillin alone compared with using combination therapy of orally administered flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin over a 1-month time horizon from the perspective of the health care payer (direct costs). The QALY measure captures the impact of a treatment on a patient&#x02019;s length of life and also the impact on their HRQoL and is widely used in health economics as a summary measure of health outcome, which can inform health care resource allocation decisions.</p><p id="Par115">In a secondary analysis the perspective will be extended to consider costs related to the intervention falling on the patient and the government. Costs will be estimated from recorded resources used during the trial, and from health care utilisation and absenteeism/productivity (for the broader perspective) data collected from patients using questionnaires administered at all time points. The EQ-5D-5L, (SF-12) and ESTI score will be used to obtain patient reports of HRQoL and used in the estimation of QALYs. The health economics study aims to identify the within-study incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; i.e. the costs and benefits of the treatment compared to the control group). Cost per QALY will be the main outcome derived.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par116">An electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) will be used to collect all data. For a paper version of this CRF (paper CRF or pCRF; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1)</xref>. Briefly, in addition to the outcome measures specified above, demographics, including age, gender (male/female), ethnicity (White/Black/Asian/Other) and current smoker (yes/no), vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, level of alertness, and previous medical history (including history of cardiac disease, diabetes, vascular disease, venous insufficiency, any other diseases) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) will be collected.</p><p id="Par117">Data on health resource use costs and quality of life will also be collected (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The latter will be used to calculate QALYs for the pharmacoeconomic analysis. The CRFs will include a health resource use questionnaire that will be adapted from the standard Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) that is used in trials to collect information about extra resource utilization (e.g. general practitioner visits), medication use, work status and payment of health costs. Patients will receive this at each time point in the trial. Unit costs will be retrieved from Irish and United Kingdom (UK) reference costs. Medication costs will be taken from the Health Service Executive (HSE) Primary Care Reimbursement Service database. The HSE is the statutory provider responsible for all the public health and social services in hospitals and in the community in the Republic of Ireland. Life years gained will be extracted from the published literature. Costs will also include treatment costs. The costs to patients, in terms of time input and travel expenses over the course of the trial, will be estimated. These costs will reflect real-life expenditure post trial. There are still no reference costs available in Ireland (similar to the National Health Service unit costs and Personal Social Services Research Unit costs in the UK), so we will collect unit cost data for relevant resource items from local data sources and expert opinion, or from similar utilisation in the UK if none are available in Ireland. All costs will be up-rated to 2017 prices using the health component of the consumer price index in Ireland. Pounds will be converted to euros using the 2017 exchange rate from the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p id="Par118">All data being entered into the eCRF will be validated according to agreed criteria appropriate to the data type (i.e. upper and lower limits on numeric values and dates, drop-down lists of valid responses or radio-button selection for multiple option items, dependency-driven data items will only be collected where necessary and relevant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Analyses sets/populations/subgroups</title><p id="Par119">For the analysis of the primary outcome both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses will be performed. Initially, ITT analyses will be performed and will include all patients randomised to the trial regardless of whether they have taken the study drug or not. PP analysis will be defined as in a previous randomised controlled trial for uncomplicated skin abscesses conducted by Talan et al. in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It will include participants who either took&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;75% of the total doses of study drug or placebo during the first 5&#x000a0;days and had an in-person test-of-cure visit or were determined to have had clinical failure before the test-of-cure visit and received&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;75% of the doses provided during the first 48&#x000a0;h of the treatment period. In a non-inferiority trial setting it is suggested that a PP analysis may be more appropriate than ITT since it is more likely to reflect actual differences between the two treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, ITT analysis may be interpreted as being too liberal in a non-inferiority trial and may bias toward making the two treatments appear similar. As a result, both an ITT and PP analysis will be performed on the resulting data to assess non-inferiority. Non-inferiority will only be declared if both ITT and PP analysis support non-inferiority.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Handling of missing data values</title><p id="Par120">Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the study site(s) for prompt clarification and resolution.

The ESTI score is a disease-specific HRQoL instrument developed to quantify patients&#x02019; subjective experiences associated with having an ESTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, it has not been externally validated or used as an outcome measure for HRQoL assessment in a clinical trial evaluating different management strategies for ESTI. The objective of this substudy is to externally validate the ESTI score and use it as an RCT outcome measure. The feasibility and practicality of the ESTI score will be examined by looking at the response rate and the proportion of missing responses at all time points. Correlations between ESTI score responses and the relevant questions in the EQ-5D-5L and correspondence between overall scores obtained on the ESTI score and the EQ-5D-5L will be examined to assess the ability of the ESTI score to measure what is intended. The distribution of health states and the mean ESTI scores for all time points will be examined to see if the ESTI score differentiates between health states. One would expect the ESTI score to detect important changes in health and an improvement in the scores with time. This responsiveness or sensitivity to clinical change will be assessed by the mean change in score for a scale divided by the SD of the change. Values greater than or equal to 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 indicate small, moderate and large clinical changes, respectively. This standardised method will allow comparisons to be made between the ESTI score and the EQ-5D-5L. Additionally, to examine if the ESTI score detects important changes in health, discriminant validity will be used. Briefly, discriminant validity will involve determining if using dichotomous outcome measures (20% or greater reduction in cellulitis lesion, yes/no; clinical treatment failure, yes/no; clinical relapse, yes/no; compliance with therapy, yes/no; and adverse events; yes/no) as a method of splitting the sample to determine if the ESTI score can detect a difference between groups. Linear regression analyses will also be used to develop a mapping relationship between the ESTI score and the EQ-5D-5L. The purpose of the mapping is to predict health utilities in other data sets and hence the accuracy of the model&#x02019;s predictions will be assessed. Both the lowest and highest quartiles will be evaluated separately to see if errors are affected by the severity of the cellulitis</p></list-item><list-item><label>5.</label><p id="Par145">Pharmacoeconomic analysis</p><p id="Par146">HRQoL scores will be multiplied by the duration of time spent in each health state, in order to generate QALYs. The area under the curve (AUC) approach will be used for estimating QALYs, assuming a linear transition between each follow-up time point. The AUC will be 21&#x000a0;days with time point at each follow-up having a utility score. Differences in mean costs and QALYs between the two arms of the trial will be estimated, accounting for differences in patient characteristics and baseline costs and QALYs. If one strategy is not dominant (less costly and more effective), the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of the cost per QALY gained will be calculated and bootstrapped estimates (with replacement, 1000 estimates) of the sampling distribution of costs will be generated to explore the uncertainty around the ICER. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be used to describe the probability that the cost per QALY gained from the within-trial analysis is cost-effective for a range of levels of willingness to pay the decision-maker (their ceiling cost-effectiveness ratio). The net benefit will be estimated at a level of willingness to pay from &#x020ac;20,000 to &#x020ac;45,000 (National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics). The calculation of QALYs will be conducted, using a measure of quality of life.
