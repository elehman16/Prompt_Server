ESAs have been shown to be highly effective in ameliorating anaemia in this setting [<xref rid="GFU201C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, large randomized controlled trials in patients with CKD either non-dialysed or on dialysis have shown that attempts to normalize haemoglobin (Hb) with ESAs are associated with no benefit for cardiovascular events or mortality, and an increased risk of stroke, venous thromboembolism and possibly death [<xref rid="GFU201C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFU201C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondary analyses of these trials indicated that these risks may be particularly prevalent in patients who are relatively unresponsive to highdosages of ESAs [<xref rid="GFU201C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFU201C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a consequence, the prescription and dosage of ESAs have decreased, the number of blood transfusions has increased and&#x02014;since iron deficiency is one of the main causes of hyporesponsiveness to ESAs&#x02014;the use of iron therapy in patients with CKD, has increased significantly [<xref rid="GFU201C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="GFU201C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with anaemia and/or iron deficiency, intravenous (IV) iron therapy remains far less widely utilized than in the dialysis population [<xref rid="GFU201C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In patients receiving haemodialysis, IV iron has been shown to be significantly more effective than oral iron for replenishing depleted iron stores, improving Hb levels and reducing dosage requirements for ESAs [<xref rid="GFU201C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFU201C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, the evidence base supporting optimal iron management is notably inadequate, as demonstrated by both a recent meta-analysis of oral versus IV iron in this patient population which included only six studies [<xref rid="GFU201C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and a Cochrane review, which included 10 studies [<xref rid="GFU201C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] of relatively small size and short duration. Both these reports [<xref rid="GFU201C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="GFU201C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease [<xref rid="GFU201C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], stress the need for more robust clinical trials with longer follow-up in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.</p><p>The Ferinject&#x000ae; assessment in patients with Iron deficiency anaemia and Non-Dialysis-dependent Chronic Kidney Disease (FIND-CKD) study assessed the 12-month efficacy and safety of IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) compared with oral iron to delay and/or reduce use of ESAs or other anaemia management options in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving an ESA. Iron therapy based on different ferritin targets has not been previously studied, therefore, two different treatment strategies were assessed using a dosing schema of IV FCM that was adjusted to achieve and maintain ferritin target levels that were either higher (400&#x02013;600 &#x000b5;g/L) or lower (100&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;g/L).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="gfu201_s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="gfu201_s2a"><title>Trial design and oversight</title><p>FIND-CKD was a 56-week, open-label, multicentre, prospective, randomized and three-arm study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00994318).

An initial single dose was administered on Day 0: 1000 mg iron as FCM in the high-ferritin FCM group (500 mg iron on Days 0 and 7 in patients weighing &#x02264;66 kg) and 200 mg iron as FCM in the low-ferritin FCM group if ferritin was &#x0003c;100 &#x000b5;g/L. During Weeks 4&#x02013;48, FCM was administered every 4 weeks in the high-ferritin FCM group at a dose of 500 mg iron if ferritin was in the range 200 to &#x0003c;400 &#x000b5;g/L, and at a dose of 1000 mg iron if ferritin was &#x0003c;200 &#x000b5;g/L, and in the low-ferritin FCM group at a dose of 200 mg iron if ferritin was &#x0003c;100 &#x000b5;g/L. In both groups, dosing was withheld if TSAT was &#x02265;40%. FCM was provided as 10 mL vials containing 500 mg iron per vial or 2 mL vials containing 100 mg iron per vial. Oral iron therapy consisted of commercially available ferrous sulphate at a dose of 100 mg iron twice daily to Week 52. Ferrous sulphate was supplied by Vifor Pharma (Plastufer&#x000ae; 100 mg capsules, Haupt Pharma M&#x000fc;nster GmbH and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Germany GmbH). Returned unused oral iron capsules at each visit were counted to assess compliance.</p><p>During the first 8 weeks after randomization, patients were not to receive ESAs, blood transfusion or any anaemia therapy other than study drug unless there was an absolute requirement (e.g. severe or serious adverse reaction to study drug or otherwise unable to continue study drug, or rapid Hb drop requiring an ESA or transfusion, at the investigator's discretion). Subsequently, ESAs and other therapies were permitted according to local practice if the Hb was &#x0003c;10 g/dL. Use of ESAs was not permitted if the Hb level was &#x02265;10 g/dL.

Patients who did not meet the end point were censored at the time of study completion or discontinuation. The hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from Cox proportional hazards modelling were also calculated as a supportive analysis. Three primary comparisons were made using a hierarchical step-down procedure to preserve the overall <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level of 0.05, in the following order: (i) high-ferritin FCM versus oral iron, (ii) high-ferritin FCM versus low-ferritin FCM and (iii) low-ferritin FCM versus oral iron.</p><p>All other analyses were exploratory. For continuous secondary end points, either analysis of variance or analysis of covariance models were used, implementing repeated measures procedure where appropriate, and including treatment group, age, baseline Hb and/or baseline ferritin as covariates. For non-continuous end points (e.g. blood transfusion, requirement for dialysis), survival curves and logistic regressions were performed and odds ratios were used to compare treatment groups. The statistical analysis plan specified that analyses of haematological values and iron parameters (e.g. Hb, ferritin, TSAT), adverse events and serious adverse events were only for assessments up to the point at which another anaemia therapy was initiated and/or the randomized study medication was discontinued. No adjustment was made for testing multiple secondary outcomes.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.

The most common adverse events were peripheral oedema, hypertension, urinary tract infection and back pain in the FCM treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="GFU201TB3">3</xref>). In the oral iron group, diarrhoea, constipation, hypertension and peripheral oedema were the most commonly reported adverse events.

Two patients in the low-ferritin FCM group experienced a drug hypersensitivity reaction, one of which was graded mild and the other graded moderate in severity by the investigator. Both led to withdrawal of study drug but neither case required treatment nor hospitalization, and there were no adverse sequelae. The mean serum phosphate level decreased by 0.18 mmol/L at Week 4 from a baseline value of 1.22 (0.2) mmol/L in the high-ferritin FCM group, but returned to baseline by Month 12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ndt/gfu201/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Figure S4</ext-link>).

Twelve deaths occurred prior to initiation of other anaemia treatment, occurrence of the Hb trigger or discontinuation of study drug and 13 deaths occurred subsequently.

The average age of the patients who died was 74.6 years and the most frequently reported causes of death were cardiovascular events or respiratory infections.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="gfu201_s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This randomized trial met its primary end point and showed that in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency not receiving an ESA, IV FCM targeting a ferritin of 400&#x02013;600 &#x000b5;g/L is more effective than oral iron in delaying and/or reducing the requirement for an ESA, other anaemia management or the occurrence of two consecutive Hb levels &#x0003c;10 g/dL. There was no significant difference between the FCM treatment arms targeting a higher versus lower ferritin range. There was also no apparent difference between the low-ferritin FCM and oral iron groups, although no statistical analysis was performed to compare these two treatment arms, as per the hierarchical step-down procedure, which was pre-defined in the study protocol.</p><p>In the setting of this controlled trial, the use of blood transfusion was low and similar in all three treatment groups. Each group showed an increase in mean values for ferritin, TSAT and Hb from baseline to Month 12. Mean ferritin levels within the pre-specified target ranges were achieved and maintained in both of the FCM treatment arms. The mean increase in Hb prior to the initiation of other anaemia therapy in all three treatment groups was 0.9&#x02013;1.4 g/dL. However, patients in the high-ferritin FCM group had a faster haematological response and were more likely to have an increase in Hb &#x02265;1 g/dL.</p><p>Early iron dosing of 500&#x02013;1000 mg in the high-ferritin FCM group successfully achieved and maintained the ferritin target with relatively few subsequent injections. No more than 25% of patients in the high-ferritin FCM group required an injection at any study visit after Month 4, whereas patients in the oral iron group were required to take one capsule twice daily for 12 months.</p><p>Overall, 21.1% of patients in the oral iron group discontinued the study compared with 14.2 and 11.7% in the high-ferritin and low-ferritin FCM arms, respectively. In addition, 23 patients in the oral iron group discontinued study drug due to intolerance (7.5%), and of these patients 65% discontinued within the first 8 weeks of the study.</p><p>Although previous studies in laboratory experiments, animal models and patients have raised concerns about possible nephrotoxicity of IV iron agents [<xref rid="GFU201C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], no clinically relevant deterioration in renal function was observed in any of the treatment groups during this 12-month trial.</p><p>Potential other concerns that have been associated with IV iron therapy include hypersensitivity reactions, hypophosphataemia, oxidative stress (which may increase the risk of cardiovascular events) and exacerbation of infection. In the current study, two patients had a hypersensitivity reaction to IV iron therapy. The reactions were not severe and resolved spontaneously with no sequelae. There were no clinically significant hypophosphataemic episodes, although there was an early and transient decrease in the mean serum phosphate level in the high-ferritin FCM group. Markers of oxidative stress were not assessed in this study, but the incidence of cardiovascular events, deaths and infections was similar between treatment groups. We observed a numerically higher percentage of benign and malignant neoplasms in the high-ferritin FCM arm as compared with the two other arms. However, the absolute numbers were small and there was no increase in any specific type of neoplasm. In addition, this trial was not powered to assess a safety end point, therefore, we cannot make any firm conclusions about the long-term risk : benefit ratio. Furthermore, this study does provide safety data over a 56-week period, which is considerably longer than previous trials of IV iron in patients with CKD that have frequently only followed patients for up to 8 weeks [<xref rid="GFU201C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFU201C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The study has several limitations. There was no placebo arm in the study, thus precluding a comparison of efficacy and safety between the interventions and no treatment. Moreover, an open-label study design was used so that both the physicians and patients were aware of the treatment allocation. Avoiding this would have required a double-blind, double-dummy design and at the time the study was being designed it was not considered ethically appropriate to administer placebo IV iron injections, potentially every 4 weeks for a year. The generalizability of improvements in Hb and iron status in the oral iron group to the wider non-dialysis-dependent CKD population may be limited for several reasons. The patients were predominantly white, had a low-inflammatory status (facilitating the absorption and utilization of oral iron) and showed a degree of tolerance and compliance with oral iron treatment that is unlikely to be matched in everyday clinical practice. In addition, patients were excluded who had a history of intolerance to oral iron prior to study entry. A further significant limitation is that we did not include more patient-centred outcome measurements.</p><p>In conclusion, patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency may benefit from IV iron treatment targeting a higher ferritin level. Both IV and oral iron therapy were effective in increasing Hb, ferritin and TSAT levels in this setting; however, FCM therapy with a higher ferritin target was shown to be superior to oral iron in delaying and/or reducing the requirement for other anaemia management or occurrence of an Hb trigger during the 12-month study, as well as producing a faster haematological response with a greater proportion of patients achieving an Hb increase of &#x02265;1 g/dL. These results were achieved with relatively few FCM injections and despite selecting patients for inclusion in the study who might be expected to do well on oral iron therapy. High-ferritin FCM was well tolerated, with fewer treatment-related adverse events and study discontinuations versus oral iron and within the limitations of this trial, no renal toxicity and no increases in cardiovascular or infectious events were observed. These findings support current guidelines [<xref rid="GFU201C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which recommend a trial of iron therapy if an increase in Hb without ESA therapy is desired in patients with CKD, anaemia and iron deficiency. Furthermore, based on the findings in this study, targeting a higher ferritin level with IV FCM may contribute to improved anaemia management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="gfu201_s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ndt/gfu201/-/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org.</ext-link></p>
