Insulin resistance is a proinflammatory, hypercoagulable state predisposing patients to develop cardiovascular diseases associated with risk factors for atherosclerosis, including altered hemostasis, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The structural and functional abnormalities of vessels along with dyslipidemia and hypertension lead to ischemic heart diseases. Type II DM carries a 2-4-fold increase risk of fatal myocardial infarction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] hsCRP, an important contributor in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, has emerged as one of the most powerful independent predictor of cardiovascular disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Patients with type II DM show higher hsCRP concentrations than those without it, suggesting the contribution of inflammation in accelerated atherosclerosis seen in patients with type II DM.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Positive results in different clinical trials have strengthen the value and acceptance of hsCRP, which is recommended as a predictive laboratory marker for cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The current therapeutic approach to DM involves intensive blood glucose control, with the aim of reducing the risk of long-term vascular complications. Conclusive evidences are already there in favour of the long-term clinical benefits of maintenance of tight glycemic control in diabetes mellitus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The prevalence of diabetes, along with its accompanying long-term micro vascular and macro vascular complications suggests the use of insulin earlier in the treatment process to maintain tight glycemic control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] As &#x003b2; -cell function declines, many patients with type II diabetes require insulin therapy on long run. Insulin is the most potent drug available to achieve tight glycemic control; however, often it is not used early for patients to achieve the glycemic targets needed to prevent chronic complications.</p><p>Recent studies already proved that insulin has an anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effect. More recently, a study confirmed that insulin infusion reduces hsCRP concentrations by 40% in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Because hsCRP values are related to the magnitude of myocardial damage in patients with acute MI, insulin-induced reduction in hsCRP has promising clinical applications. A low-dose infusion of insulin reduced hsCRP concentrations and found to be cardio protective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Other than regular human insulin (RHI), aspart and lispro are two short-acting insulin analogues which are widely prescribed for type II diabetes mellitus by physicians. The pharmacokinetic properties and advantages of aspart and lispro insulin over RHI are known. But there are limited data on their possible cardioprotective role in type II DM. This clinical study was designed to explore and compare the effect of insulin analogues on cardiovascular risk in type II DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was conducted on 90 patients of type II DM attending the department of General Medicine, Prathima Institute of Medical Sciences, Karimnagar, Andhrapradesh, India. The study population included patients irrespective of sex, aged more than 30 years suffering from type II DM and not responding to oral hypoglycemic agents. The patients were free from other significant morbidity like infection, infestations, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases. Patients with hsCRP level &#x0003e;10 mg/L (non-specific elevation) were excluded from the study. Those patients already on statins, anti-platelet drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers, glitazones, ACE Inhibitors and gliclazide, were not included in this study. Patients hypersensitive to insulin, pregnant and lactating mothers were also excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study is a 12 week, randomized, open, parallel group comparative clinical study between RHI, aspart and lispro insulin in patients with type II DM conducted in a single centre. The study was approved by Institute Ethical Committee and procedures followed in this study are in accordance with the ethical standard laid down by ICMR's ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects (2006). A written informed consent was taken from all the patients participated in the study after explaining the patient's diagnosis, the nature and purpose of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment (RHI / aspart / lispro insulin). Randomization (Probability sampling: simple random sample) was done by using computer generated random list. After randomization, the patients were divided into three treatment groups. 30 patients were allocated in RHI group who received regular human insulin, 30 patients in aspart group who received aspart insulin and another 30 patients in lispro group who received lispro insulin twice daily for 12 weeks. The patients received pre-breakfast and pre-supper subcutaneous injection of insulin. Dose was individualized and regularly adjusted based on the results of blood glucose determinations. The patients received the drugs free of cost from our institute pharmacy.</p><p>At the first visit, after detailed history was taken on baseline symptomatology, clinical evaluation (including Metabolic syndrome diagnostic scoring, UKPDS 10-year CHD risk %) and laboratory investigations (blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid profile, serum potassium and hsCRP) were done. Every 4 weeks, blood glucose level was checked and at the end of 12 weeks clinical improvement was assessed in terms of change in glycemic control, lipid profile, hsCRP, serum potassium and UKPDS 10-years CHD risk (%).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Parameter studied</title><p>The changes in efficacy variables like blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic), glycemic control (fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin), lipid profile, serum potassium, hsCRP and UKPDS 10-year CHD risk scoring from baseline to day 84 were studied. As hsCRP is strongly predictive of future cardiovascular events, it was considered as primary outcome measure. hsCRP was measured quantitatively by solid phase Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using UBI MAGIWEL&#x02122; CRP-kit. 10-years risk for CHD is calculated by the software UKPDS Risk engine version 2.0 considering the parameters like age, sex, ethnicity, and duration of diabetes, smoking habit, presence of atrial fibrillation, systolic blood pressure, HbA<sub>1c</sub> , and lipid profile.

The prevalence of diabetes, along with its accompanying long-term micro vascular and macro vascular complications suggests the use of insulin earlier in the treatment process to maintain tight glycemic control. Earlier studies proving anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effect of insulin was the impetus behind this comparative study where we found that insulin analogues have a promising cardio protective role and they are superior to RHI.</p><p>Though one way ANOVA was statistically insignificant, individual group analysis by paired t test shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> reveals systolic blood pressure was better controlled with aspart whereas both insulin analogues controlled diastolic pressure better than RHI. The <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by Ahmad Aljada <italic>et al</italic>. have established that insulin increases the expression of NOS and NO generation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] So it is an interesting field to explore whether the effect of insulin analogues on NO generation is more than RHI and this may explain the effect of insulin analogues on diastolic blood pressure.</p><p>Control of both fasting and post-prandial blood glucose was best with aspart insulin. Glycosylated hemoglobin, a marker of long term glycemic control was also better controlled with aspart insulin. Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration predicts cardiovascular risk both in diabetic and non-diabetic population, and may help identify individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular disease for targeted interventions, including blood pressure or cholesterol reduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Thus, by decreasing HbA<sub>1c</sub> level significantly, aspart insulin has established its better cardio protective role when compared to RHI and lispro insulin.</p><p>The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are a high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] The comparative analysis shows that aspart insulin is distinctly better than RHI and lispro in reducing total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol level whereas lispro insulin showed better effect on reducing triglyceride level. So both the insulin analogues can improve diabetic dyslipidemia better than RHI and reduce cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Insulin increases cellular potassium uptake and lowers potassium levels in blood. In our study potassium lowering effect was significantly more with RHI in comparison to aspart and lispro insulin. So chances of hypokalemia are less with insulin analogues and it is a very important advantage over RHI.</p><p>For cardiovascular risk assessment we relied on two important parameters, hsCRP and UKPDS 10-years CHD risk (%). The UKPDS risk engine is the first coronary risk calculator to be developed from a cohort with type II diabetes. It showed good predictive ability and the risk engine has been externally validated using data from the CARDS study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] The robust association with future cardiovascular events has provided an analytic opportunity for hsCRP in clinical use. Based on multiple epidemiological and intervention studies, minor hsCRP elevation has been shown to be associated with future major cardiovascular risk (hsCRP: &#x0003c;1 mg/L = low risk; 1-3 mg/L = intermediate risk; 3-10 mg/L = high risk; &#x0003e;10 mg/L = non-specific elevation).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] 68% patients (61/90) of our study population were found to have intermediate risk whereas rest of the patients had low risk for cardiovascular diseases. The comparative analysis of the changes of hsCRP in the three groups showed that both insulin analogues were superior in CRP-lowering when compared to RHI. [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] Similarly, UKPDS 10-year CHD risk was found to decrease significantly more with lispro and aspart insulin as compared to RHI. Positive correlation between decrease in hsCRP and decrease in cardiovascular risk in all three groups have been represented through scattered diagram and the correlation coefficient has been found to be more with aspart and lispro group than with RHI. [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">c</xref>] Though 12-weeks is relatively short time to assess cardiovascular risk, these findings clearly establishes superior cardio protective role of short acting insulin analogues, aspart and lispro.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Change of hsCRP in study groups over 12 weeks</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-17-642-g004"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Correlation between decrease in hsCRP and decrease in cardiovascular risk in study groups (a) Aspart group (b) Lispro group (c) RHI group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-17-642-g005"/></fig><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies, insulin, at physiologic levels, inhibits the expression of Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), and Nuclear Factor kB (NF-kB), a proinflammatory transcription factor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] A study by Cecilia C. Low Wang has proved that insulin's ability to maintain VSMC (vascular smooth muscle cell) quiescence and reverse the dedifferentiating influence of PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) is mediated via the PI3K pathway, whereas insulin promotes VSMC migration via the MAPK pathway. Thus, with impaired PI 3-kinase signaling and intact MAPK signaling, as seen in insulin resistance, insulin may lose its ability to maintain VSMC quiescence and instead promote VSMC migration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] These <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are in support of anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties of insulin but there is lack of data regarding comparative efficacy of different insulin's. So this is an interesting field to explore to explain the superior cardio protective role of insulin analogues.</p><p>The major limitation of this study is its non-blinded design. The main aim of our study was to examine the potentiality of short acting insulin analogues as cardiovascular protective agent and to compare its efficacy with human RHI. So a multicentric, randomized, double-blind, large population clinical study is necessary to confirm its cardiovascular protective role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>RHI and two short acting insulin analogues, aspart and lispro can reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases but short acting insulin analogues (especially aspart insulin) have been found to have a promising cardio protective role due to their favorable effect on long term glycemic control, diabetic dyslipidemia, and inflammatory/pro-atherosclerotic biomarker. This is a preliminary clinical study in this domain and it renders support to future prospective clinical studies of insulin analogues to demonstrate net control of diabetic atherosclerosis and its
