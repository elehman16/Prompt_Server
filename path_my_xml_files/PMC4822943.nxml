Theoretically, this operation reduces the afterload of the heart and eliminates tension in the ventricular wall, which in turn optimizes hemodynamics and improves heart function. Therefore, pulmonary interstitial edema and the ELWI should be attenuated after the operation relative to preoperative values. However, an inflammatory reaction induced by CPB causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and increases the permeability of the lung vessels, which increases the ELWI [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-22-1085" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, ischemia reperfusion injury of the lung and micro-embolisms created during CPB can damage pulmonary capillary endothelial cells, which can increase the permeability of the pulmonary vasculature [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-22-1085" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], thereby further increasing the ELWI. The present study examined the variation in the ELWI after cardiac surgery with CPB. Within 4 h after the operation, the ELWI increased significantly, and it subsequently returned to the normal range at 8 h postoperatively. As mentioned previously, considering the relationship between the ELWI and the inflammatory reaction after CPB, we hypothesized that variation in the ELWI may to a certain extent reflect changes in the inflammatory reaction. Previous studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response reaches its peak within 4&#x02013;6 h after cardiac surgery with CPB [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-1085" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is consistent with the variation in lung water observed in the present study. The fact that the ELWI reached its peak within 4&#x02013;6 h and began to decline 8 h after the operation suggests that anti-inflammatory and appropriate fluid transfusion therapies are important within 4&#x02013;6 h after the operation to maintain patient stability and protect patients during the inflammatory reaction peak. According to the experience of our heart center, although &#x0201c;fast tracking&#x0201d; has become increasingly popular, extubation within 4&#x02013;6 h should be considered with caution, especially for patients who underwent CPB long ago, those who have experienced severe operative trauma, and those who are likely to have a strong inflammatory reaction. Before extubation, the risk of the inflammatory response peak should be fully understood, and a comprehensive evaluation should be performed, including measurement of the ELWI, arterial gas, and respiratory mechanics. For extubation performed within 4 h after the operation, intensivists should particularly focus on the patient&#x02019;s heart and lung functions, especially with respect to changes in ELWI and arterial blood gas, to address the corresponding problems in a timely manner.</p><p>This study demonstrated that the ELWI and PVPI were significantly increased within 4 h after aortic valve surgery. Moreover, ELWI and PVPI were significantly lower in the US group than in the RT group and were also significantly lower in the RT group than in the CS group. Beyond 8 h after the operation, ELWI and PVPI did not significantly differ between the RT and the US groups and remained significantly lower in those groups than in the CS group. At 12 h after the operation, ELWI and PVPI did not significantly differ among the 3 groups. Similarly, Cst decreased and Pplat increased within 4 h after the operation and gradually returned to normal levels 8 h after the operation. During this time period, Cst and Pplat were significantly better in the MIAVS group than in the CS group. These results suggest that the effects of the operation on the ELWI and respiratory mechanics in the MIAVS group were superior to those in the CS group, especially within 8 h after the operation. In our opinion, this finding may be in part due to protection of the integrity of the thorax during the MIAVS operation, allowing lung function to recover quickly. In contrast, the integrity of the thorax is broken during the CS operation, so lung function may take at least 12 h to recover. In addition, blood transfusion volume in the CS group was significantly higher. Considering the association between ELWI and fluid balance, the higher ELWI in the CS group might partly be attributed to higher blood transfusion volume.</p><p>In this study, ELWI and PVPI were significantly higher in the RT group than in the US group within 4 h after the operation. This effect was likely due to transient one-lung ventilation increasing the risk of hypoxic injury, crush injury of the right lung, and barotrauma of the left lung during the operation. In fact, hypoxic injury and crush injury are considered to be the main causes of increased pulmonary vascular permeability and extravascular lung water.</p><p>This study also found that MIAVS was not superior to the traditional median sternotomy approach with respect to CPB and the aortic blocking time, but the postoperative ventilation support time, length of ICU stay, postoperative hospitalization time, blood transfusion volume, and drainage volume were superior for MIAVS relative to traditional median sternotomy, which was consistent with the results of similar studies conducted previously [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-22-1085" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In addition, goal-directed therapy was applied in this study, with the aim of optimizing circulatory function and avoiding the effect of liquid capacity on extravascular lung water. The ELWI stabilized within 12 h after the operation, with stabilization occurring more quickly in the MIAVS group than in the CS group. This effect may have been occurred because the integrity of the chest was destroyed during the median sternotomy operation, or because of a higher blood transfusion volume in the CS group due to a higher drainage volume [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-22-1085" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Regardless of the cause of the anti-inflammatory reaction, the alleviation of lung injury and the reduction of the blood transfusion volume with the MIAVS operation were beneficial for the recovery of lung function.</p><p>There were certain limitations in this study. First, patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and calcification were excluded. However, these patients are likely to require reconstruction of a valve annulus and to have a relatively longer duration of CPB, so postoperative inflammation may be more severe in these patients and could have caused inconsistencies in the baseline values of the different groups. Second, to ensure the comparability of the 3 groups, the patients enrolled in the study had a relatively short history of valvular disease, less severe lesions, and LVEF &#x0003e;45%; therefore, no perioperative deaths occurred. As a result, for patients with severe pathological changes, a long history of valvular disease, or poor preoperative cardiac function, the variation trends of the ELWI and respiratory mechanics require further clinical study. Third, in this study, due to the short CPB time, ELWI returned to baseline within 24 h, and most patients were extubated within 8 h after the operation; therefore, extravascular lung water was recorded through 24 h after the operation, and respiratory mechanics were recorded through 8 h after the operation. For patients with a long CPB time or preoperative lung dysfunction, the variation trend of extravascular lung water and its effect on postoperative fluid therapy require further verification by multi-center clinical studies. Finally, because there were no complete data on specific proinflammatory cytokine levels, we could not confirm the inflammatory hypothesis, which is another limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ELWI and PVPI increased transiently after the cardiac surgery.
