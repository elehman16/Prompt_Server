Abdominoperineal excision with intersphincteric dissection has been proposed as a better alternative and is performed increasingly both nationally and internationally. However, no studies have been performed to support this. The aim of this study is to randomize patients between Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure and abdominoperineal excision with intersphincteric dissection and compare post-operative surgical morbidity and quality of life. The hypothesis is that intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision provides less pelvic and perineal morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>In this multicentre randomized controlled study, Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure will be compared with intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision in patients with rectal cancer unsuitable for an anterior resection. The patients are operated in different ways around the ano-rectum, otherwise the same procedure is performed with total mesorectal excision and all will receive a colostomy. The one-month postoperative control will focus on post-operative surgical complications, especially the perineal-pelvic, reoperations and other interventions. After one year, late complications such as pain in the perineal or pelvic area or disorders such as secretion or bleeding from the anorectal stump will be recorded and a follow-up of quality of life performed. Histological and oncological data will also be recorded, the latter up to 5&#x000a0;years post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The HAPIrect trial is the first randomized controlled trial comparing standard low Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure with intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision in patients with rectal cancer with the aim of categorizing the post-operative surgical morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">NCT01995396</ext-link>.

Patients with rectal cancer are often elderly, many have comorbidities and some have a weak sphincter function with difficulties in keeping their stools. Anastomotic leakage after LAR is considered of multifactorial origin. Patients with co-morbidities like cardiovascular and/or pulmonary diseases (with impaired tissue perfusion and oxygenation) and therefore high ASA-class may be more prone to leakage. To reduce the risk of a life-threatening complication such as anastomotic leakage with fecal peritonitis, and/or to avoid crippling problems with fecal incontinence after LAR, a Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure (HP) is sometimes performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, the proportion of rectal cancer patients, undergoing HP has increased from 10 to 15&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and even more (30&#x000a0;%) in rectal cancer patients with metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many believe that HP is a safe operation, easy and quick to perform and associated with a low major complication rate and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been argued that the advantage of leaving a short ano-rectal stump, is that the patient experiences less problems with secretion and bleeding from the remaining rectum.</p><p>In recent years, there has arisen a debate in which some argue that the complication rate after HP is high, especially after leaving a very short rectal stump. A high frequency of pelvic abscesses, 12&#x02013;33&#x000a0;%, are reported following a low HP, where the rectum is stapled off just above the pelvic floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Reasons for the high rate of pelvic complications in previous studies might be the selection of unfit patients with reduced vascular blood supply, even more pronounced after the low HP. The surgical technique, especially the transection of the rectum at the pelvic floor is probably also of importance. The broadest possible transverse stapler that fits into the pelvis in order to avoid tension in the stapler line (mostly 45 and 60&#x000a0;mm), has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The alternative to a low HP would be to perform an abdominoperineal excision (APE) to avoid leaving a suture line on the rectum stump left in the pelvis, in order to reduce the risk of a suture line insufficiency which migth lead to a pelvic abscess. However, the problem with APE is that perineal necrosis and wound infections are common, with perineal wound problems ranging between 15 and 38&#x000a0;%, the latter after neoadjuvant radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This can probably be reduced to a large extent, especially after radiotherapy,by removing the anus with an intersphincteric dissection (ID), ie the muscular pelvic floor and external sphincter are left in situ. This means that one can seal the perineum with healthy muscle tissue, which improves healing as opposed to the traditional APE with sutures in the fatty tissue. Moreover, fat tissue suturing is often problematic as APE creates a large wound that is difficult to close, leaving blood/fluid cavities, which further increase the risk of infection. Intersphincteric proctectomy has been used for inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn&#x02019;s disease and ulcerative colitis, and offers significantly less perineal defects than the traditional APE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whether an intersphincteric APE is better than HP in rectal cancer patients with regard to postoperative complications is unclear, although there are theoretical advantages. There are no published papers on the subject or on intersphincteric APE practised in rectal cancer patients, only a few abstracts that suggests low post-operative surgical complication rates after intersphincteric APE.</p><p>With regard to HP, there are no randomized studies or systematic reviews, only small case studies that have been analyzed retrospectively. In the few published studies of HP, the patients are often old with comorbidities, since HP is frequently the selected method for old or infirm patients. In the prevailing studies on HP, it has been compared with APE and/or anterior resection and data are not conclusive. The studies are heterogeneous and the study populations are not balanced. The patients that are preferably selected for HP, are very frail with high risk of post-operative complications and prolonged hospital stay. Therefore it is especially important to perform an operation that reduces the post-operative surgical complications as much as possible. A multicentre randomized study to identify the appropriate operative method for these old and frail patients with rectal cancer is warranted.</p><p>In this multicentre randomized study, we intend to compare the post-operative events after two surgical methods that can be used for rectal cancer in patients who are elderly, have other comorbidities or infirmities, and/or poor sphincter function, and thereby are not suited for a colo-anal/rectal anastomosis. The intention is to randomize patients between HP and APE with ID to investigate which method gives the lowest post-operative morbidity, and is associated with the best quality of life. The hypothesis is that an intersphincteric APE is superior to HP with regard to post-operative morbidity and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The HAPIrect trial is a multicentre, randomized study comparing Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure with intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision in patients with rectal cancer.</p><p>Patients with resectable rectal cancer are randomized to either (A) a traditional Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure or (B) abdominoperineal excision with ID of the anorectal stump.

According to the decision of the Regional Ethics Council in Uppsala (No: 2013/297), applications from the following research principals were accepted:</p><p>County Region of V&#x000e4;stmanland, County Region of V&#x000e4;rmland, County Region of G&#x000e4;vleborg, County Region of Uppsala, County Region of V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland, County Region of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland, County Region of S&#x000f6;rmland, County Region of V&#x000e4;sternorrland, Region Scania, County Region of &#x000d6;rebro and Stockholm County Region.</p><p>The trial will be conducted at six university hopitals and 12 county hospitals.</p><p>Experience in total mesorectal excision (TME) is demanded for surgeons taking part in the trial.

We will explain pros and cons about the two types of operations and that we don&#x02019;t know which one is the most appropriate and that we will make the randomisation during the operation. The patients are fully aware and have accepted this procedure if they are included in the study. This procedure was chosen to avoid bias in the selection of patients as regard the type of surgery. If you randomize before surgey then some surgeons could chose to not to include some patients because they want to perform one of the two types of surgery that they believe is easier, better or goes faster. This is the point, we don&#x02019;t know which of the two types of surgery that is most appropriate for the patient because there exists no data or comparative studies. That&#x02019;s why it is so important to randomisze during surgery to avoid this selection. Our Ethics committee in Uppsala have accepted this procedure.</p><p>The randomization procedure is performed in the operation theatre when the TME has been performed, the distal bowel tube has been clamped and a washout of the anorectum performed.</p><p>Randomization is performed per center by a central automated internet randomization module through the website &#x0201d;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.norrlandskirurgi.se/">www.norrlandskirurgi.se</ext-link>&#x0201d; and stratified for each centre.

Most of these complications are pelvic abscesses whereas after an APE the most frequent complication is a perineal infection. By performing an intersphincteric dissection, we believe that the perineal complication rate will be significantly lowered. We assume that the surgical complication rate can be reduced to 20&#x000a0;% with an intersphincteric APE. With a type I error of 0.05 (&#x003b1;) and a power of 0.8 (1 - &#x003b2; (0,2)), 140 patients in each group are needed. With a drop-out estimate of 20&#x000a0;%, the required sample size is 170 patients in each group. A research fellow will monitor the data of all included patients together with the consultants responsible for the study. A SPSS database will be used containing all collected parameters. Data analysis will be performed according to intention-to-treat protocol analysis, an additional per-protocol analysis will also be performed. The primary endo-point measure will be evaluated using chi-squared test. Continuous variables will be compared with a T-test or Mann-Whitney U where appropriate. Differences with a <italic>P-</italic>value &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All the statistical analysis will be conducted by using SPSS version 22 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>The HAPIrect trial is the first randomized controlled trial comparing standard low Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure with intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision for rectal cancer. Patients with rectal cancer are increasingly old and many have other diseases and some have a weak sphincter function with fecal incontinence. HP has been increasingly used in the old and frail to reduce the risk of a life-threatening complication such as an anastomotic leakage with fecal peritonitis, and/or to avoid crippling problems with fecal incontinence after an anterior resection. To leave a short ano-rectal stump has been considered to cause less problems with secretion and bleeding from the remaining rectum. Especially in patients with metastases there has been an increase in performing a HP with the intention of avoiding severe post-operative surgical complications so that post-operative chemotherapy can be started as soon as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During the last decade, there has been an ongoing discussion whether HP is a safe operation or not and high frequencies of pelvic abscesses have been reported (8). In the literature, only small observational studies that have been analyzed retrospectively can be found. Some authors found very high rates of pelvic abcsesses, especially after a low HP in up to 33&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] compared with only 3&#x000a0;% in another paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There have been suggestions that an intesphincteric abdominoperineal excision is a safer procedure. No data on the use of intersphinteric excision in rectal cancer have been published but at least in two European centres efforts have been made to start a randomized trial but due to different reasons they have not been able to proceed. The advantage of intersphincteric APE would theoretically be that you avoid leaving a suture line on the rectum that can leak and cause a pelvic abscess. By removing the ano-rectal stump with an intersphincteric dissection, the perineo-pelvic defect is small and can be closed primarily by the levator muscles,thus favouring the healing. A disadvantage is the prolonged duration of surgery and the risk of perforation of the ano-rectal stump. A multicentre randomized study is necessary in order to provide evidence to support the theoretical advantages for intersphincteric abdominoperineal excision. The primary intention is to compare post-operative surgical morbidity between HP and APE with intersphincteric dissection. As secondary outcomes, the study will focus on re-operation and re-intervention, post-operative length of hospital stay, re-admission frequency, histological parameters, local recurrence, survival, late local complications and quality of life. The hypothesis is that intersphincteric APE provides less pelvic and perineal morbidity.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is open for recruitment from February 2015.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APE, abdominoperineal excision; ASA, American society of anesthesiologists physical status classification system; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; Hb, hemoglobin; HP, Hartmann&#x02019;s procedure; ID, intersphincteric dissection; LAR, low anterior resection; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SCRCR, Swedish colorectal cancer registry; TME, total mesorectal excision; TNM, tumor, node metastasis staging system; WBC, white blood cell count; WHO, World Health Organization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>HAPIrect collaboration group</p><p>PiaLena Berg, Sk&#x000e5;nes University Hospital Malm&#x000f6;, Joakim Folkesson, Academic Hospital Uppsala, Urban Ersson, Magnus Olovsson Skaraborgs County Hospital Sk&#x000f6;vde, Torbj&#x000f6;rn Svartling, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/&#x000d6;stra G&#x000f6;teborg, Georg Dafnis, M&#x000e4;larsjukhuset Eskilstuna, Marie Uddenberg, Nyk&#x000f6;pings Hospital, Martina S&#x000f6;rensson, Central Hospital Karlstad, Staffan Haapaniemi, Vrinnevi Hospital, Norrk&#x000f6;ping, Per Loft&#x000e5;s, University Hospital Link&#x000f6;ping, Torbj&#x000f6;rn Sakari, County Hospital G&#x000e4;vle, Anna Martling, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Peter Matthiessen, University Hospital &#x000d6;rebro, Maria Wallden, County Hospital Sundsvall-H&#x000e4;rn&#x000f6;sand, Christoffer Odensten, Pia N&#x000e4;svall, Sunderby Hospital, Markku Haapam&#x000e4;ki, Norrlands University Hospital, Roger Gerjy, Danderyds Hospital, Helgi-&#x000d6;rn Johansson, Falu Hospital, Kenneth Smedh, Maziar Nikberg, Ingvar Sverrisson, Abbas Chabok, V&#x000e4;stmanlands Hospital V&#x000e4;ster&#x000e5;s.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Supported by a research grant from the County of V&#x000e4;stmanland, Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data will be deposited in a database at the Center For Clinical Research, located in V&#x000e4;ster&#x000e5;s and affiliated to Uppsala University, Sweden.
