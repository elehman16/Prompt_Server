Patients were randomly selected from private clinics. A patient met the inclusion criteria if he/she had at list one year essential hypertension. This was defined either by a history of antihypertensive medication treatment or a mean BP value of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, which was measured twice each time at four consecutive occasions. All patients consumed similar medications during the study.</p><p>Elderly patients who could not understand the questions were excluded from the study. The study population consisted of 150 patients. The samples were randomly divided in two groups (75 in case group and 75 in control group). For data collection, the author interviewed the outpatients who referred to private clinics. There was no difference between the two groups in age, sex, marital status, education, job, body mass index and smoking. The BP readings were similar in the two groups at the beginning of the study. The researcher was the educator and instructed the patients on how to measure BP at home. Each educational session was 30 to 40 minutes. During educational sessions, teaching methods such as group discussion, question and answer using pamphlets, CD and Power-Point were used based on the BASNEF model. The place of education was the meeting room of the private clinics. The educational content of each session involved the prevalence of hypertension, mortality rate from the hypertension, importance of the self-monitoring BP, how to measuring BP at home, how to provide a sphygmoma-nometer for patients, the role of family in helping the patients, lower cost of BP monitoring versus the higher costs of the treatment, and some recommendations for lowering the BP. All patients had signed the written consent form. This study was confirmed by the research council and ethical committee of the Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd.</p><p>The questionnaire was designed by the researchers, but the scoring method was based on the Likert scales. The questionnaire had three sections: demographic data (6 questions), medication data (11 questions), BASNEF model (57 questions) including 18 questions on attitude, 12 questions on social norms, 7 questions on BP, 8 questions on enabling factors and 12 questions on self-monitoring. Attitude questions consisted of two sections: 9 questions on belief and 9 questions on evaluation belief. Answers were based on 5 Likert scales (certainly agree = 4, agree = 3, no idea = 2, disagree = 1 and certainly disagree = 0) and the score range for every section was 0 to 36 and the total score of attitude was a multiple of scores for the two sections. The 12 questions related to social norms were also divided into two sections: 8 questions on normative beliefs and 4 questions on motivation for complying. The answers were based on 5 Likert scales and the total scores of social norms was a multiple of scores for the two sections. The range of score for social norms was 0 to 512. BP was measured with 7 questions and its score range was 0 to 28. Enabling factors were measured by 8 questions with 4 Likert scales answers and the score range was 0 to 24. Finally, 12 questions on self-monitoring were based on 5 Likert scales with minimum 0 and maximum 48 scores.</p><p>The case group performed a double BP measurement twice daily (in the morning and evening). In the control group, the measurements were made only in the beginning and at the end of the study. Furthermore, regular office measurements were made at the beginning and at the end of the study in both groups.</p><p>The patients kept a dairy on their BP values and returned it to the researcher after 2 months. Demographic data, data based on the BASNEF model and medication data were collected both at baseline and at the end of the study.</p><p>To ensure the clarity of questionnaires, pilot testing of the questionnaire was performed using the coherence and consistency upon 20 participants who were not included in the survey.</p><p>After that, the questionnaire was modified based on participants&#x02019; feedback. Content validity was established by 5 experts who were academic staff and health educators. So, content validity of the questionnaire was assessed through view points of an expert panel. The reliability of questionnaire was determined by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha, which was in the range of 0.66 to 0.87.</p><p>Comparison between two groups was done by Wilcoxon test. Pearson correlation analysis was used for determining the correlation between variables of BASNEF model. Regression analysis was used for determining power of the model in predicting BP self-monitoring. P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 150 patients entered the study.

Use of enabling factors improved some preventive behaviors in the case group as mentioned in another study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref> It seems that enabling factors have an important role in changing intention of mindful behavior.</p><p>In the present study, the subjective norms interference measured after the intervention in order to determine the role of subjective norm on the participants&#x02019; behavior in monitoring their BP. This is one of the most important strengths of this study. However, some health education studies measured social norms before intervention in order to determine the influence of the target group&#x02019;s subjective norms for designing educational action without evaluating the level of effectiveness after intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT31">31</xref></p><p>In the present study, the mean scores of constructs of BASNEF model increased in the case group after intervention, but it decreased or was the same in the control group. These results support the findings of many other studies conducted on these variables.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT34">34</xref> The present findings revealed a significant correlation between self-monitoring behavior and intention for BP control and enabling factors. These results support the results of Lee,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref> who showed a significant correlation between intention and behavior of self-management of BP. Rhodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT35">35</xref> demonstrated a strong significant correlation between intention and behavior. Down and Hausenblas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT36">36</xref> showed a strong correlation between intention and behavior in their study. In this study, there was a significant correlation between the attitude and intention and subjective norms. These correlations show the efficacy of BASNEF model in prevention and control of chronic disease. There was a significant correlation between all constructs of BASNEF model except attitude with enabling factors and self-monitoring, that was in line with the results of other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT37">37</xref></p><p>Besides the effectiveness of the BASNEF model in health education studies, other educational models such as PERECEDE or health belief model have important roles in increasing the knowledge, attitude and behavior of target groups related to health and disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT39">39</xref> Several researches mentioned the beneficiary of applying different models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT42">42</xref> In a study on type 2 diabetic patients, nutritional education based on health belief model could reduce fasting blood sugar significantly compared to a control group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT42">42</xref> Although nutrition education increased the score of knowledge among this group, choosing an appropriate educational model helped to increase the score of behavior and also changed the metabolic variables.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT42">42</xref></p><p>Using an educational model for increasing the behavior scores for self-monitoring blood pressure is a positive point in the present study that can improve the results of the educational intervention. Choosing a suitable educational model in different health educational studies should be considered in interpretation of the results. However, more time is needed to see the effect of educational intervention on the level of BP. So, just the change in behavior after the intervention and the measurement of the BP was considered and its probable change was not the aim of this short-term study, which could be considered as a limitation for the present research.</p><p>In the present study, women had better attitude and were more successful regarding the self-measurement of the blood pressure compared to men. This might be due to the higher level of sensitivity and health consciousness in women, as Cutler et al also indicated in their study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT43">43</xref> Higher educational level was associated with higher intention for controlling the BP and increasing enabling factors for self-monitoring of BP in the present study, which was in the same line with Vitezic et al results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT44">44</xref> Education on self-monitoring BP for educated patients is more successful in changing their behavior compared to not educated ones. Patients with higher education level also can use sphygmomanometers more precisely. Physicians and health care providers should advise the patients to check the accuracy of their home sphygmomanometers regularly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT45">45</xref> There were no significant association among other demographic variables and the constructs of the BASNEF model in the current study. However, socioeconomic status of the patients was an important demographic variable correlated with the self-monitoring BP in African American adolescents,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT46">46</xref> which should be considered in the health educational studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Increasing self-monitoring BP among hypertensive patients is largely recommended.</p><p>Considering the enabling factors as the most important factors of self-monitoring in hypertensive patients, securing the sphygmomanometer for patients (preferably free) is necessary. Planning educational programs based on self-monitoring of hypertension is necessary too.</p><p>Subjective norms can influence on self-monitoring behavior by means of enabling factors and self monitoring intension. Moreover, we believe that strategies to involve family members, relatives or friends who have influence on patients in intervention programs, specially confirmation of them by physician or other health care personnel can strongly effect self-monitoring of patients especially females.</p><p>BASNEF model is a powerful model in forecasting self-monitoring behavior and can be a base for educational intervention. Thus, for improving self-monitoring behavior and finally controlling the disease, using such educational programs used in this study is recommended and emphasized.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</bold></p><p>MHB, ZR, MAM, GhSh and AA designed the study, collected and analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
