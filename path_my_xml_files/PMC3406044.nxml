One explanation for the rise in energy intake during the last decade may be the increased consumption of calorically sweetened beverages or other energy-yielding liquids <xref rid="pone.0042110-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Malik1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There has been an undeniable temporal association between the growing consumption of sweetened beverages and the rise in obesity rates, particularly among adolescents and young adults <xref rid="pone.0042110-Flegal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Physiological mechanisms by which the body senses ingested energy are reported to be less precise for energy contained in liquid beverages as opposed to solid foods <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-DiMeglio1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the mechanisms underlying the differences in satiation and satiety responses comparing liquid and solid foods have not been clarified yet. There is some evidence that liquids are more satiating than solids <xref rid="pone.0042110-Kissileff1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Rolls1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Himaya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-AlmironRoig1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. For example, Mattes et al. observed that spoon-ingested soup loads (liquefied apple) led to reductions in hunger ratings comparable to those observed in response to the matching solid food (apples) <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Highest hunger rating were observed when the liquid food was drunk (apple beverage) <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Those results support the notion that soups have a higher satiety value than beverages, despite their fluid form.</p><p>Opposing those results are studies that demonstrate that solid foods are more satiating than liquids <xref rid="pone.0042110-DiMeglio1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-AlmironRoig1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Tournier1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is suggested that the higher satiety evoked by solid foods is &#x02013;at least in part- due to the longer oral exposure time caused by chewing <xref rid="pone.0042110-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Zijlstra1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, while another study suggests that the eating mode of consumption plays a role in the higher satiating value of solids <xref rid="pone.0042110-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Still other studies did not find differences in the satiation capacity of beverages and solid foods <xref rid="pone.0042110-AlmironRoig2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The comparison of these studies is often difficult due to the use of different or not comparable foods, i.e. foods that differ along other dimensions than texture evoke responses that cannot solely be ascribed to the food form.</p><p>Very few studies so far have included physiological parameters to examine the difference in satiety and satiating capacity of liquid and solid foods. Appetite related biomarkers involved in those differences may include ghrelin-, glucose- and insulin. Haber et al. found that with the rate of ingestion equalized, apple juice was significantly less satiating when compared to apple puree, while apple puree was less satiating than whole apples; both puree and juice condition were associated with disturbances in glucose homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0042110-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Zijlstra et al. found that products with similar palatability, macronutrient composition and energy density but different texture lead to significant differences in intake, with the liquid product being consumed more <xref rid="pone.0042110-Zijlstra1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In contrast to Haber et al., they found no differences in plasma-glucose concentrations <xref rid="pone.0042110-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>As Lemmens et al. <xref rid="pone.0042110-Lemmens1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> already summarized, possible intra-individual relations between VAS and physiological measurements remain unclear. Some studies show no relation between appetite ratings and ghrelin, glucose or insulin concentrations <xref rid="pone.0042110-Maffeis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Smeets1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, while others do find associations between appetite ratings and ghrelin or insulin concentration <xref rid="pone.0042110-Erdmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Studies assessing the relationship between appetite and gut-peptides would greatly benefit from the inclusion of the factor time in a within subject approach <xref rid="pone.0042110-Maffeis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Smeets1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Erdmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Adam1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Diepvens1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While energy requirements differ between subjects due to differences in body size, muscle mass, gender, etc., changes in appetite parameters do not necessarily have to; a subject feels satiated to a certain extent when his/her subject specific energy requirement is met to a certain extent. This illustrates, why possible relationships between appetite ratings and changes in glucose- and gut-hormone concentrations should be assessed intra-individually when investigating the relationship of appetite ratings and gut peptides.</p><p>Taken together, due to the use of a mixture of macronutrients or hardly comparable foods it has been difficult to discriminate between satiating effects of liquid and solid food-textures in the past. Furthermore, the lack of an intra-individual approach to assess the relationship between appetite ratings and physiological measurements made it difficult to explain differences in texture induced satiety.</p><p>Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate differences in appetite profile and in relevant physiological parameters and to study the within-subject relationships between both, comparing a liquefied and solid carbohydrate meal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and the Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University approved all procedures involving human subjects.

</xref>. The study was conducted in a within-subject, randomized, crossover design. Subjects came to the university twice. Visits were separated by one week. On the day before the trial and during the trial, they were not allowed to consume alcohol or to engage in heavy exercise. On the morning of the test day subjects consumed a predetermined amount of a fluid breakfast at home. After this, subjects were not allowed to eat or drink anything (except water) until arrival at the university at 12 PM. Upon arrival an intra-venous catheter (IV) was inserted for blood sampling. At 12.30, a baseline blood sample for the measurement of plasma insulin, glucose and active ghrelin concentrations was drawn. At 12.40 subjects received a subject-specific (based on individual energy requirements) lunch composed of carbohydrates in a solid or liquefied texture, which they had to consume within 20 min. After lunch, twelve blood samples were drawn for the measurement of plasma insulin, glucose and active ghrelin concentrations. At 4 PM, the catheter was removed and subjects were free to leave the laboratory.</p><fig id="pone-0042110-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0042110.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Timeline representing the study design.</title><p>VAS&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;visual analog scales on appetite, IV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Intravenous catheter placement, glu&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;glucose blood sample, ins&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;insulin blood sample, ghr&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;active ghrelin blood sample.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0042110.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Meals</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Breakfast</title><p>Subjects had to consume a prescribed breakfast at home, composed of a commercially available breakfast drink called &#x02018;Goedemorgen&#x02019; (Campina, The Netherlands).

During each test day, a baseline blood sample was drawn 10 min before the start of the lunch (at &#x02212;10 min). Subsequently, twelve more blood samples were drawn after the start of the lunch (at 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 60 min, 70 min, 85 min, 100 min, 115 min, 130 min, 160 min, and 190 min) for the measurement of plasma insulin, and glucose concentrations. A blood sample for active ghrelin was drawn (3 ml) five times (at &#x02212;10 min, 20 min, 50 min, 85 min, 160 min). Blood samples were collected in tubes containing EDTA (BD vacutainer with EDTA, 10 ml) to prevent clotting. Blood plasma was obtained by centrifugation (4&#x000b0;C, 3000 r.p.m., 20 min). All samples were frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis. Plasma glucose concentrations were analyzed enzymatically by using the hexokinase method (ABX Diagnostics, Montpellier, France); the coefficient of variation (CV) was 0,63&#x00025;.

Areas under the curve were calculated using the trapezoidal method. Differences over time and between conditions (liquefied and solid) were determined using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. A student's T-test was used to determine the differences between textures at all time points and for the AUC. Following the method previously described by Lemmens et al. <xref rid="pone.0042110-Lemmens1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> the magnitude of the within-subject relationship between changes in VAS scores and blood values were assessed. This method entails the calculation of regression slopes and the regression between VAS scores and blood values for each subject separately, for the corresponding measuring moments (fullness vs. glucose concentrations, fullness vs. insulin concentrations and desire to eat vs. active ghrelin concentrations). After that it is tested if the means of the regression slopes are significantly different from zero (Student's one-sample t-tests) and thus whether the relationships between VAS scores and blood parameter concentrations are statistically significant.

The current study addresses controversies in the existing literature by:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>giving the same foods in solid and liquefied form with the same amount of total water (750 ml to drink; or 500 ml homogenized &#x0002b;250 ml to drink);</p></list-item><list-item><p>utilizing a subject specific design in which subjects received an amount of food bases in their daily energy requirements.</p></list-item></list><p>Due to the study design, VAS were controlled for energy requirement and did reflect differences between conditions rather than between subjects. Moreover, when comparing the change in VAS appetite scores with changes in blood parameter concentrations, a statistical approach was used to analyze the possible within subject relationships of these dynamics, including the factor time.</p><p>The present study did not find any significant differences in peak-values, AUC or condition x time interactions for fullness and desire to eat. Although insulin reached a significantly lower value in the CL condition at 40 min after the start of the lunch, no significant differences were found for any of the blood parameters comparing AUC's and no condition x time interactions were found. Based on those results, the liquefied carbohydrate meal and the solid carbohydrate meal can be considered as equally satiating, supported by a lack of differences in appetite and relevant blood parameters.</p><p>However, despite that overall conclusion, 20 minutes after the start of the lunch, fullness ratings were higher in the liquefied condition compared to the solid condition. A possible explanation for this effect may be that homogenization can influence gastric emptying and thereby increase satiation and satiety ratings more than the fluid and solid components served separately <xref rid="pone.0042110-Himaya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Santangelo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. For example, Santangelo et al. evaluated the effects of the same meal in solid-liquid and in homogenized form on satiety and gastric emptying rate <xref rid="pone.0042110-Santangelo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. They found that a vegetable-rich meal was significantly more satiating in a homogenized form than in a solid-liquid state, probably due to a change in gastric emptying time when the food was consumed in the homogenized form <xref rid="pone.0042110-Himaya1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-AlmironRoig1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Santangelo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the current study, a separation of liquid and fluid components for gastric transit may have contributed the delayed peak in glucose and insulin concentrations and the higher insulin concentration in the solid condition compared to the liquefied condition, 40 minutes after the start of the lunch.</p><p>The within-subject analysis showed corresponding changes in VAS and insulin and ghrelin concentrations. Desire to eat scores and active ghrelin concentrations declined at the same time, and showed a significant relationship in both meal conditions.</p><p>Fullness scores and insulin concentrations increased in parallel and showed a significant relationship in both meal conditions, implying a role for insulin in fullness perception. In a meta-analysis, Flint et al. already showed that the postprandial insulin response is associated with a decrease in hunger and increases in satiety ratings <xref rid="pone.0042110-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In contrast to our study results, Zijlstra et al. found that a semi-solid product appeared to be more satiating than a liquid product. However, that finding was not substantiated by a difference in glucose, insulin or ghrelin concentrations <xref rid="pone.0042110-Zijlstra2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Similar to our results, Haber et al., found similar increases in plasma-glucose concentrations independent of condition and comparable increases in insulin concentrations after fast puree and apples <xref rid="pone.0042110-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Studies comparing solid or semi-solid foods often explain their differences in appetite scores by; 1) the need to chew fiber <xref rid="pone.0042110-Haber1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or 2) a longer oral exposure time <xref rid="pone.0042110-Zijlstra3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The difference with our study is thus the lack of fiber in peeled peaches and the lack of significant differences in oral processing time. The results of our appetite scores in response to the conditions are similar to those of Mattes et al. who found a similar reduction in hunger and increase in fullness in a liquefied meal <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Thirst was higher in the liquefied condition as shown by AUC and condition x time interaction. Previous research already showed that drinking water separately with the meal vs. water consumption in the food suppressed thirst more <xref rid="pone.0042110-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. When thirst is not quenched by water in the meal, this could be due to a different mouth feel, which leads to secondary thirst as described according to Fitzsimons <xref rid="pone.0042110-Fitzsimons1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Fitzsimons2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Although our analyses of regression slopes and R<sup>2</sup> values showed a relationship between VAS appetite scores and insulin and ghrelin concentrations, the mean explained variation was low (35&#x00025;). Therefore, we conclude that this relationship is not applicable as a biomarker to the individual level. However, the magnitude of this correlation is sufficient to discriminate intervention-related satiating effects at a group-level.</p><p>From a methodological point of view it would have been interesting to additionally use a peach juice as a liquid meal, similar to the use of apple juice in the paper of Mattes et al. <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mattes2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As described in the introduction, they observed the weakest satiety effect in the liquid condition (apple beverage). However, in a drinking condition not only the texture is different but also the mode of consumption, therefore it is difficult to disentangle the cause of observed differences in satiation capacity <xref rid="pone.0042110-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The lack of differences in the appetite profile between the liquefied and solid condition in the current study could also be macronutrient specific. Previous studies reported that solid protein evokes a stronger suppression of hunger and desire to eat compared to liquefied or liquid protein <xref rid="pone.0042110-Martens2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0042110-Mourao1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Based on the current results it can be concluded that liquefied and solid carbohydrate meals do not differ in their satiating effects, as evidenced by the lack of differences in appetite profile and relevant blood parameters. Postprandially, fullness and desire to eat were associated with respectively insulin and ghrelin concentrations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank our subjects for their participation in this study.
