Typically, CD has a chronic relapsing remitting course and CD patients are faced with a lifetime of recurrent exacerbations that are treated with medical and surgical interventions, although without definitive cure.</p><p>The major therapeutic goals are reduction of acute signs and symptoms, induction and maintenance of remission, and prevention of complications. Therapeutic recommendations depend on the disease location, disease severity, disease complications (fistulas, abscesses, strictures) and previous response to treatment. Various agents, such as sulfasalazine,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> antibiotics,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> glucocorticosteroids (GCS),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> thiopurines,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> methotrexate<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> are useful in the induction and/or maintenance of remission. Many of these, however, are only moderately efficacious and are associated with side effects.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> In addition, the newer biological agents have a relatively inconvenient parenteral route of administration and are costly.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These therapeutic challenges mean that over 50% of people with CD require surgery within 10&#x02005;years<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> because pharmacological agents can no longer control the disease or complications such as perforation and/or stenosis develop. Therefore, a need exists to develop new efficacious and safe agents for the management of CD.</p><p>It is generally believed that CD involves exaggerated T cell immune responses to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals, and that environmental factors trigger the onset or periodic reactivation of disease.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These circumstances result in the production of an excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Treatment with TNF antagonists such as infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab induces clinical response and clinical remissions<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;22</xref> suggesting that agents that reduce inflammatory cytokines may have therapeutic benefits in patients with CD.</p><p>Laquinimod (TV-5600, previously ABR-215062) is a novel synthetic compound with high oral bioavailability, which is being developed as an oral formulation for CD, multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease and lupus nephritis. Preclinical data in various experimental models of colitis and MS suggest that laquinimod has a direct inhibitory effect on antigen presenting cells and T cells, resulting in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We conducted a randomised trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of oral laquinimod in patients with CD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-cohort, dose-ranging study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of laquinimod in patients with moderate to severe CD. Study participants were recruited from 37 centres in Belgium, France, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Spain and the UK. Institutional review boards at each study site approved the protocol and all patients provided written informed consent. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice, according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline. The trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT00737932.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were men or women 18&#x02013;67&#x02005;years old with a documented diagnosis of CD for at least 3&#x02005;months prior to screening that was supported by endoscopy or radiology. Patients were classified as having moderate to severe CD defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 220&#x02013;450 and either had C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations &#x0003e;5&#x02005;mg/L or documented endoscopic evidence of mucosal ulcerations (presence of at least two ulcers &#x02265;10&#x02005;mm) within 4&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline. Key exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis; a positive stool culture for enteric pathogens or Clostridium difficile toxin; bowel surgery &#x02264;3&#x02005;months prior to screening, a planned elective surgery or hospitalisation during the course of the study; clinically significant short bowel syndrome; clinically significant obstructive symptoms; presence of an intra-abdominal abscess or a fistula with clinical or radiological evidence of an associated abscess; ileostomy; colostomy; and serum elevation of alanine transaminase; aspartate transaminase; &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase; alkaline phosphatase or direct bilirubin &#x02265;2 times the upper limit of normal at screening. Patients who required parenteral nutrition or those with a history of any malignancy in the year prior to screening (excluding basal cell carcinoma) or a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition were also excluded. Treatment-related exclusion criteria included initiation of oral corticosteroids within 4&#x02005;weeks or 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), azathioprine or methotrexate within 12&#x02005;weeks prior to screening; changes in the dose of 6MP, azathioprine or methotrexate within 6&#x02005;weeks; changes in the dose of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) or antibiotics administered for CD within 2&#x02005;weeks prior to screening; treatment with more than 20&#x02005;mg/day of prednisolone or budesonide more than 6&#x02005;mg/day for CD at baseline, or whose corticosteroid dosage regimen was not stable for at least 2&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline; treatment with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil or thalidomide within 2&#x02005;months prior to screening, treatment with natalizumab within 6&#x02005;months prior to screening, use of amiodarone within 2&#x02005;years, use of inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 within 2&#x02005;weeks prior to baseline visit (1&#x02005;month for fluoxetine), or use of any other investigational drugs within 3&#x02005;months prior to screening. Patients treated with TNF antagonists within 4&#x02005;weeks prior to screening were also excluded. The percentage of patients previously treated with TNF antagonists was limited to 60% of patients randomised for each cohort.</p><p>Concomitant medications allowed during the study included those used to systemically to treat CD (5-ASA compounds, antibiotics (except for those which inhibit CYP3A4), GCS and immunosuppressants). Other medications allowed included antidiarrhoeal drugs, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical preparations. The dose of the allowed medications was to be kept stable throughout the study; dose adjustment of these medications not allowed by the study protocol or the start of a new medication during the study was regarded as a treatment failure (TF).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>Laquinimod doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg daily were studied sequentially in four distinct escalating cohorts (n=45) in which patients were randomised to laquinimod or placebo in a 2:1 randomisation ratio using an interactive voice/web response system. Evaluation of laquinimod in successive cohorts was dependent upon: (1) randomisation of at least 45 patients for the preceding cohort, (2) closure of screening and randomisation for the preceding cohort and (3) the decision of a safety committee to proceed to the next dose level.</p><p>The study consisted of a 1&#x02013;2-week screening period, an 8-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. Scheduled inclinic visits were conducted at screening, baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12&#x02005;weeks postrandomisation. Treatment with laquinimod/placebo was discontinued at week 8 postrandomisation and a follow-up/study completion visit was conducted at week 12. Patients who discontinued study drug early (prior to week 8) were required to attend a follow-up termination visit within 4&#x02005;weeks (28&#x02005;days) of study drug discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study drug</title><p>All patients took capsules of oral laquinimod (each containing 0.5&#x02005;mg) or placebo which were identical in appearance. Participants, care providers and all study personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. Laquinimod plasma concentrations reach steady state following approximately 10&#x02013;12&#x02005;days of daily maintenance dosing.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A loading dose of twice the intended final dose was administered twice daily for the first 2&#x02005;days with a 12-h interval between the doses. The intent was to decrease the time to steady state plasma concentrations and potentially decrease time to response. Starting on Day 3 and thereafter, the dosing regimen consisted of the intended final dose administered once daily.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Adverse events (AEs; MedDRA terminology), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination and electrocardiogram were evaluated at every visit and during the follow-up period. Any extra-intestinal manifestation potentially related to CD (on the CD complications of the CDAI score or any other extra-intestinal manifestation) whether a new condition or a worsening of a pre-existing condition was recorded as an AE. Worsening of GI signs and symptoms of CD (as captured by the CDAI score) were recorded as an AE only if the outcome was more severe than normally expected in the usual course of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>Definitions of clinical remission and response were based on CDAI scores from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 visits. Patients were given comprehensive instructions for completing the daily CDAI diary score using paper forms. Diaries were completed during the entire period. Patients who prematurely discontinued treatment were also requested to complete diaries daily until a follow-up visit 28&#x02005;days after treatment discontinuation. TF occurred when either the patient was withdrawn from study because the investigator felt that the patient was not responding to the treatment or the patient underwent surgery for CD; and if the dosage of an allowed medication such as antibiotics or steroids was increased beyond what was allowed per protocol or the patient received rescue therapy with a biological or immunosuppressive drug during the treatment period. Assessment of GI inflammation also included the per cent change in serum CRP and faecal calprotectin concentrations from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This study was exploratory; therefore, no formal hypothesis testing was planned. A total of 45 patients per cohort (ratio 2:1 for laquinimod and placebo, respectively) was considered adequate to provide an initial estimate of treatment efficacy and dose response. The data for the patients in all of the placebo arms were pooled. The decision to pool placebo patients across cohorts was made prior to unblinding based on analysis of baseline characteristics of the blinded cohorts. Safety and tolerability were analysed for all study patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Baseline characteristics and safety assessments were summarised using descriptive statistics. Tolerability was assessed by the number and percentage of patients who failed to complete the study, and the number of patients who failed to complete the study due to AEs.</p><p>The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set used consisted of all randomised patients excluding observations following TF. This analysis set was chosen in order to minimise bias from including observations collected post-TF and bias from excluding early terminations from the analysis. Values obtained at the time of early termination were carried forward.</p><p>The preplanned exploratory efficacy analyses were primarily descriptive: the proportions of patients who were in clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150 and no TF); the proportions of patients who were responders 70 and responders 100 (responded to treatment with a reduction of CDAI score by &#x02265;70 and &#x02265;100 points, or were in remission, and no TF); mean CDAI change from baseline; mean per cent of change from baseline for CRP and faecal calprotectin concentrations. ORs were derived from baseline adjusted logistic regression analyses performed to assess treatment effect at week 8 on: (1) remission; (2) response 100; and (3) response 70. In these analyses, treatment dose was included in the model as a categorical variable, and CDAI score at baseline, prior use of anti-TNF drugs (Yes/No), treatment with oral GCS at baseline (Yes/No) and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs at baseline (Yes/No) were included as covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>A total of 180 patients randomised to four sequential cohorts were included in the mITT and safety analyses sets. Of these, 63 patients (35.0%) were randomised to receive placebo (across the four cohorts) and 117 patients (65.0%) were randomised to receive 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0&#x02005;mg laquinimod doses (n=29 or 30 patients per dose). The majority of patients in all treatment groups completed 8&#x02005;weeks of treatment. A higher incidence of early termination occurred in Cohort 4 in both laquinimod 2&#x02005;mg and placebo arms compared with the other cohorts, but early termination was numerically more common in the laquinimod 2&#x02005;mg arm (48.3%) than in the placebo arm (37.5%) within this cohort.

Additionally, although the sample sizes are small and thus should be interpreted cautiously, both the placebo and the laquinimod treated patients in the 3rd and 4th cohorts had higher rates of previously undergoing any type of surgical treatments and prior treatment with TNF antagonists than in the placebo and laquinimod treatment patients in Cohorts 1 and 2. There was also a lower occurrence of prior treatment with TNF antagonists within the preceding year in the laquinimod 0.5 and 1.0&#x02005;mg dose groups compared with the 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg

Headache was the most common AE observed and the overall rate of AEs in the laquinimod dose groups was similar to that observed in the pooled placebo group. The incidence of abdominal pain as an AE at 0.5 and 1&#x02005;mg/day, which has been previously reported for laquinimod at a dose of 0.6&#x02005;mg,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was comparable with that in the pooled placebo group and lower than in the 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg groups. For patients in the 0.5&#x02005;mg group, no elevation of liver enzymes was seen; elevations occurred for one placebo patient, three patients in the laquinimod 1.0&#x02005;mg dose and one patient in 2.0&#x02005;mg dose. Placebo and laquinimod treated patients in the 4th cohort discontinued therapy more frequently than patients in other cohorts, and discontinuation occurred more frequently in the 2.0&#x02005;mg arm compared with the placebo arm (48.3% vs 37.5%).</p><p>While the study was not powered to assess efficacy, exploratory analyses suggested that laquinimod at 0.5&#x02005;mg had a consistent therapeutic effect across all outcome measures. In all, 48% of patients in the laquinimod 0.5&#x02005;mg group were in remission at the end of 8&#x02005;weeks compared with 15.9% in the pooled placebo group. Similarly, 62% and 55% of patients in the 0.5&#x02005;mg dose group demonstrated CDAI 70 and 100 responses respectively, compared with 35% and 32% of patients on placebo. The benefit of laquinimod 0.5&#x02005;mg was already detectable by week 2 and remained consistent throughout the eight treatment weeks and the 4&#x02005;weeks of follow-up. Although the 1.0&#x02005;mg dose showed a trend towards a therapeutic effect for induction of clinical remission, the results were less robust than those observed with the 0.5&#x02005;mg dose. Laquinimod at doses of 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg showed no apparent benefit compared with the pooled placebo group for either remission or response.</p><p>Several aspects of the study need to be considered in evaluating the finding of potential therapeutic effect at 0.5&#x02005;mg/day laquinimod and a lack of effect for the higher doses of 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg/day. This trial was conducted with a sequential cohort design for the purposes of investigating the safety of laquinimod doses higher than doses previously studied for other indications at the time of this study's initiation. The higher doses in this study allowed a range of exposure to laquinimod while ensuring patient safety. Due to the inherent nature of the dose escalation design of the trial, the patient characteristics varied slightly across the cohorts. Patients who participated in the last two cohorts appear to have had a higher disease activity than the patients in the first two cohorts, as reflected by the higher proportions of patients with previous surgery and/or exposure to TNF antagonists. Second, remission and response are measured using the CDAI scale which has abdominal pain as one of main components. Patients receiving laquinimod doses of 1.5 and 2.0&#x02005;mg had twice as many reports of abdominal pain. A post hoc analysis evaluating the relationship between the CDAI item of abdominal pain and AE reports of abdominal pain did not find a difference in the distribution of scores between patients who did or did not report abdominal pain as an AE, but AE reporting of &#x02018;abdominal pain&#x02019; in CD trials is usually quite inconsistent. A third possible reason that the patients in the lower dose of laquinimod, 0.5&#x02005;mg dosing group, did better compared with placebo and the other dose groups is because there was a relatively higher percentage of patients in 0.5&#x02005;mg laquinimod cohort with inflammatory disease (76%) which may explain that laquinimod was more effective in this very group.</p><p>Indeed, in previous studies, laquinimod has been shown to have an immune regulatory effect, mediated by the NF&#x003ba;B pathway on dendritic cells, which leads to a diminished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-17) and chemokines<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In CD, GI inflammation is believed to be caused by an activated innate/macrophage immune response to NF&#x003ba;B activation involving increased cytokines and chemokines and other inflammatory molecules, and an acquired immune response involving T and B cells and a loss of tolerance to enteric commensal bacteria.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Thus, laquinimod's proposed mechanism of action may make it ideally suited to reduce the GI inflammation. Results in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis model of MS and in patients with MS, another chronic and destructive inflammatory disease, have been encouraging and suggest that laquinimod could act as an anti-inflammatory agent without impairing the organism's ability to mount a humoral response (personal communication, MDS Pharma Services France, 2007 Final Report).</p><p>Two objective measures of GI inflammation were used in the present study, serum CRP and faecal calprotectin. Because of the large intrapatient variability (mainly of calprotectin) observed in this study, it was difficult to determine laquinimod's effect on these measures. There was an entry requirement into the study of having a serum CRP &#x0003e;5&#x02005;mg/L or documented endoscopic evidence of mucosal ulcerations but there were no entry requirements at the level of faecal calprotectin concentrations. A post hoc analysis in the present study evaluating changes in faecal calprotectin levels of patients with faecal calprotectin concentrations &#x02265;250&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/g at baseline showed that there were reductions in faecal calprotectin levels at 8&#x02005;weeks regardless of laquinimod dose. A cut-off of 250&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g has been suggested to correspond with the presence of significant ulcerations.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These results suggest that laquinimod may have an inhibitory effect on GI inflammation which needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>Laquinimod is under development by Teva Pharmaceuticals for a variety of therapeutic indications including MS, Huntington's disease, lupus nephritis and CD. As the most consistent therapeutic effects were seen with the 0.5&#x02005;mg laquinimod dose, the phase III clinical development programme for CD will focus on assessing the efficacy of daily oral doses of 0.5&#x02005;mg, along with a lower dose, 0.25&#x02005;mg, on the induction and maintenance of clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe CD. Laquinimod may eventually offer an attractive oral therapeutic option for patients with moderate to severe CD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-307118-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1543" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients who participated in this study, the Safety Committee for their safety assessments during the study, Pippa Loupe, PhD, of Research and Development, Teva Pharmaceuticals (Overland Park KS USA) and Anita Chadha-Patel, PhD, of ACP Clinical Communications (Watford, UK) who assisted in the development of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold>
