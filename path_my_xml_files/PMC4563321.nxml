It is
usually caused by a neuromuscular control disorder rather than structural instability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The definition of lumbar segmental
instability is decreased stiffness of the spinal motion segments<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have indicated that lumbar instability is
associated with pain possibly<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; and it may
be due to a defect in spinal segment movement control, leading to compression of the neural
structure<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trunk muscular strength may protect the spine during daily activities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakness of the trunk muscles and poor muscular endurance are also
characteristics of LBP<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The severity of
trunk muscular weakness or fatigability may be examined using isokinetic or isometric
tests<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Numerous studies have
investigated the difference in trunk muscular strength and endurance between chronic LBP
patients and healthy subjects<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some reported subjects with LBP have
significantly less muscular strength and endurance than healthy subjects<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may be explained by LBP clients being unwilling to make maximal
effort during the muscular strength test due to pain or fear of injuries<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the trunk muscular activation and muscle fatigue of LBP
patients using electromyography (EMG) and compared the results with those of healthy adults.
The most frequent site showing pathological changes is the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae,
where the multifidus muscles are located<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The median frequency of EMG has been used as a fatigue index to
compare the back muscular fatigability of the left and right sides between 40% maximal
voluntary contraction (MVC) and 80% MVC, and the median frequency imbalance was
significantly larger in LBP than in healthy subjects<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding exercise training, numerous exercise types have been developed as exercise
therapy for clients with LBP, such as hip joint exercises, trunk muscular strengthening
exercises, and aquatic exercise<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar
segmental stabilization training is the most popular LBP treatment. It aims to train injured
and healthy supporting tissue, facilitate tissue repair and prevent structural weakness from
excessive loading<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise training
for LBP is not only concerned with positional correctness, but also deep muscle and
neuromuscular control training. Previous studies have demonstrated that exercise on an
unstable surface, such as exercises on a Swiss ball and sling exercise training (S.E.T),
increases muscular activation levels<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The activation levels of the internal and
external oblique muscles increased during bridge exercise with vibration training on an
unstable surface<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise on an
unstable surface challenges the motor control system, the increasing the speed and intensity
of lumber stabilizers, contraction and the activation ratio as well as improving muscle
activation synergy<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A S.E.T system provides an unstable training condition that increases exercise
difficulty<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postnatal women with
pelvic pain reported significantly reduced pain, improved physical function and better
quality of life after 20 weeks of S.E.T training<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Baseball players with LBP participated in 12 weeks of exercise
training, using ultrasound biofeedback training or S.E.T training. The ultrasound
biofeedback training comprised stretching and general trunk muscle strengthening under
ultrasound monitoring. The ultrasound biofeedback training helped subjects practice and
realize how the deep muscles work. The results showed S.E.T training could improve pain,
physical function and lumbar instability more significantly than ultrasound biofeedback
training<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, subjects who
suffer from LBP show improved trunk proprioception, physical function and trunk stability
after six weeks of S.E.T<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, most studies have measured the effects of interventions for
LBP using functional fitness or a subjective questionnaire. Few studies have measured the
effects of exercise intervention on muscular strength and endurance. In addition, due to the
possible influence of psychological factors, using the slope of the median frequency may be
a relatively objective way of measuring muscular endurance compared to using maintenance
time only. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 6 weeks S.E.T for
clients with LBP on pain, disability, muscular strength and muscular endurance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study recruited chronic LBP patients. They were randomly divided into a control group
and a training group. The pain area was located between the lower ribs and gluteus folds,
and the pain duration had persisted for at least three months. Subjects who were diagnosed
with spondylolisthesis or disc herniation were excluded. The investigators explained the
purposes and procedures of the assessment and obtained basic personal information and
informed consent before conducting the experiment. The participants provided their written
consent to participation and the study was approved by the Kaohsiung Medical University
Ethics Committees.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; subjective parameters (pain intensity and disability levels), and objective
parameters (muscular strength and endurance) were assessed. Participants in the training
group performed stabilization exercise using a S.E.T system for six weeks. Participants in
the control group did not perform any exercise intervention. After six weeks, participants,
subjective and objective parameters were measured again.</p><p>A 10-centimeter visual analog scale was used to measure pain intensity. Low scores
represented low pain intensity, and high scores represented high pain intensity.</p><p>The Chinese version of the Oswestry disability scale for LBP was used to measure the
disability level<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. This questionnaire
has 10 items assessing pain and disability. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher the
scores indicating greater disability. The maximum score for this questionnaire is 50 points,
and the raw scores are converted to percentages. According to Fairbank<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, 0&#x02013;20% represents mild disability, 21&#x02013;40% represents
moderate disability, 41&#x02013;60% represents severe disability, 61&#x02013;80% means most physical
functions are impaired by back pain, and it is classified as disabled, and 81&#x02013;100% means the
subject is bed-bound.</p><p>The muscular strength assessment was measured by a custom-designed muscular strength
dynamometer. Subjects were instructed to carry out the trunk extension and rotation to the
left and right in a sitting position. For each movement they aimed to exert maximal
voluntary isometric contraction for 5 seconds in three trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Muscular strength measurements. (a) back extension, (b) rotation to left and right</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-2591-g001"/></fig>). During the trunk flexion and extension test, the torque sensor was placed on the
left of the body with its height parallel to the iliac crest.</p><p>For the trunk extension test, a fixed bar was set on the spine at the height of the scapula
to fix the trunk, and an investigator applied a strength with force along the femoral bone.
The torque sensor was placed on the head to measure trunk rotation the fixed bar set at the
height of the sternal notch. Velcro was used to fix the pelvis during all tests.</p><p>Subjects rested for ten minutes after the maximal muscular strength test, and then carried
out the endurance test at about 52% MVIC test<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> in one trial. Subjects performed trunk extension and sustained the
contraction until they could not maintain the standard testing posture, their hand touched
the bed, or the posture was sustained for 240 seconds. The investigators recorded the time
the subject sustained the posture, and the change in the median frequency slope was used as
an index of fatigue. Each subject performed this test one time.</p><p>Participants in the training group attended an exercise course of three sessions a week
with each session comprising 30 minutes of training and 10 minutes of warm up.</p><p>In the training program, participants had to hold the end position for 8&#x02013;10 seconds in
12&#x02013;15 repetitions of each exercise. The exercise intensity was adjusted by the distance from
the point of sling suspension and the distance between the slings and the bed. The
repetitions and intensity of exercise were gradually increased. Investigators considered the
fitness levels differed between the participants, thus, the exercise prescriptions were
individually decided with different exercise maintenance times and repetitions in the
initial training session. Investigators instructed participants to perform a pelvic backward
tilt and keep their back straight during exercise to prevent injury through excessive
loading of the lumbar spine during exercise.</p><p>Exercise (1): participants were instructed to flex the elbow to 90 degrees and kneel on the
bed under the sling point. The forearms were put in straps and the body was extended.
Exercise (2): participants stood on the floor and under the sling point. The hands were put
in the straps and the body was extended. Participants lay supine on the bed with their
ankles under the sling point. Exercise (3): the straps were 30 centimeters apart from the
bed. Participants were instructed to carry out the bridge exercise. Exercise (4):
participants lay supine on the bed with the ankles under the sling point. The straps were 30
centimeters apart from the bed. Participants were instructed to carry out the bridge
exercise combined with knee flexion. Exercise (5): participants lay prone on the bed and the
ankles were under the sling point. Straps were set at the height of the participants&#x02019; upper
arm to make the body parallel to the bed during exercise. The participants supported their
body with their forearms and ankles. Exercise (6): participants lay prone on the bed and the
ankles were under the sling point. Straps were set as high as the participants&#x02019; upper arm to
make the body parallel to the bed during the exercise, and the participants supported their
body with their forearms and ankles combined with knee flexion. All the exercise programs
are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Exercise training programs</p><p>

baseline torque for 10 consecutive data to calibrate the error. The 10 consecutive data of
maximal torque were chosen as the 5 data before the maximal value and the 5 data after
maximal value. The value divided by the lever arm was used to obtain the force value.
Muscular strength was normalized to subjects&#x02019; body weight.</p><p>The trunk muscular endurance was measured during extension, and the effects of S.E.T on
trunk muscular endurance. Fatigue was assessed using the slope of each back muscle.</p><p>The sampling rate of the EMG system was 1,500&#x02005;Hz. Fast Fourier transform (512 point, window
processing) were used to convert the time-domain signal to the frequency domain and the
median frequency was calculated<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
calculated median frequency values were fitted using a first-order curve approximation to
calculate the slope of the median frequency. A positive slope indicates neuromuscular
fatigue did not build up; a negative slope indicates neuromuscular fatigue is present and a
more negative slope indicates a higher level of neuromuscular fatigue<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The median frequency slope calculation was performed
using Matlab (Version R2007b MathWorks Inc., Natwick MA, USA).</p><p>Wilcoxon&#x02019;s rank test was used to compare the differences in parameters between pre-and

findings are similar to those of previous studies<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chu reported the effects of S.E.T
on baseball players who suffered from LBP. That study recruited 12 LBP baseball players, and
carried out three stages of exercise training. In the first stage, ultrasound was used as a
biofeedback in the training of deep muscle contraction. The second stage was the trunk
muscular strengthening course, and the third stage was stabilization exercise training on
slings. Pain intensity was significantly reduced after S.E.T, but it was not apparent at
trunk muscular strengthening stage<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.
That is, the S.E.T was more effective at reducing pain than the trunk muscular strengthening
course for LBP patients. Chang et al. also investigated the effects of six weeks of S.E.T on
LBP patients<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. They found that the
disability level, functional fitness and trunk proprioception improved after six weeks of
training. The present study found the disability level reduced after training. The studies
of Chang and Chu et al. both demonstrate that six weeks of S.E.T is effective at reducing
the pain intensity and disability levels of LBP patients. However, these two studies did not
measure the pain intensity and disability level simultaneously<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, and they did
not utilize a control group.</p><p>In the present study, there was a significant improvement in muscular strength and
endurance after six weeks training, a result which is similar to those of previous studies.
Bronfort et al. compared muscular strength among three different types of exercise mode.
They found that trunk strengthening exercise combined with spinal manipulation and trunk
strengthening exercise combined with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs elicited greater
improvements than spinal manipulation combined with the trunk stretching exercise<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also found a significant improvement
in trunk muscular strength at the 11th week. According to a previous study<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, a significant increase in the activation
of the rectus abdominis was elicited by exercising on a Swiss ball indicating that exercise
on an unstable surface had increased the difficulty of exercise and the muscular activation.
Chok et al. measured the maintenance time of trunk extensor endurance as the training
outcome. In their study, sub-acute LBP patients were randomly assigned to a control group or
a experiment group. The experimental group attended exercise training for six weeks, but the
control group did not. Both groups received back care and hot packs for six weeks. After the
exercise training, the maintenance time of trunk extensor endurance was not a significantly
different between the two groups, despite the experimental group having better maintenance
time of trunk extensor endurance than the control group at weeks 3 and 6<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, Bronfort et al. found that
subjects in the trunk muscular strength exercise groups showed greater improvements in back
extensor endurance than the other two groups at week 11, but not at week 5<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The slope of the median frequency indicates neuromuscular fatigue and a positive slope
indicates the absence of neuromuscular fatigue; a negative slope indicates the presence of
neuromuscular fatigue, and a more negative slope indicates a higher level of neuromuscular
fatigue. The present study found that the slope of the median frequency of the multifidus
muscles was a more negative value at baseline than after training. This result means the
multifidus muscles had a lower level of neuromuscular fatigue in the endurance test after
training. In the study of Oddsson et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the LBP group carried out trunk extensor endurance tests at 40%
and 80% MVC in a standing position. Their results of that study show the slope of the median
frequency at 40% MVC ranged from &#x02212;0.03 to 0.26 (Hz/s), and the median value was 0.035
(Hz/s), indicating neuromuscular fatigue did not accumulate. In that study, subjects
performed 40% MVC, as in our study (about 52% MVC), but the testing position in that study
was standing, which differed from our study. To the best of our knowledge, most studies
which have measured trunk extensor endurance as an exercise outcome have used the
maintenance time rather than the slope of the median frequency. Few studies have used the
slope of median frequency to compare the difference between healthy subjects and the LBP
subjects. Our present study, used the slope of the median frequency, and found there was a
significantly more negative slope for the left multifidus at baseline in pre-training for
the training group, indicating a higher level of neuromuscular fatigue at the pre-training
measurement than at the post-training measurement. The training group had a border-line
significantly higher level of neuromuscular fatigue at the pre training measurement for the
right multifidus relative to the post-training measurement.</p><p>The sample size of this study was relatively small. Twelve patients participated in this
study, and there were randomly allocated to the training group and the control group, with
seven subjects in the training group and five subjects in the control group. A trail with
80% power and a level of significance of 5% (two tailed) was calculated to require
approximately 20 patients in the training group to detect significant differences between
pre- and post-training. Another limitation of this study was that the training lasted for
only 6 weeks. This may not have been long enough time to improve local muscular endurance.
In our results, the slope of the median frequency showed a significant improvement for the
left side multifidus but not for the other back muscles. Prolonged exercise training may
lead to greater improvements in muscular endurance of the other back muscles.</p><p>Further research should involve a greater number of participants. The exercise program
should be prolonged for chronic LBP patients to try to achieve greater improvement. The
slope of the median frequency for objectively measures neuromuscular fatigue and should be
considered as a parameter for assessing the training effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Ten Chan General Hospital and KMU Joint Research Project
