Although WHO recommends universal supplementation with iron or home fortification with iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders (MMPs) to children under 2 years, evidence for benefits of these interventions on childhood development (a key rationale for these interventions) and harms (especially infection) remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the impact of iron or MMPs supplementation compared with placebo on (a) children&#x02019;s development, (b) growth, (c) morbidity from infections and (d) haematological and iron indices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is a three-arm, blinded, double-dummy, parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial using stratified individual block randomisation. The trial will randomise 3300 children aged 8&#x02013;9 months equally to arm 1: iron syrup (12.5&#x02009;mg elemental iron), placebo MMPs; arm 2: MMPs (including 12.5&#x02009;mg elemental iron), placebo syrup; and arm 3: placebo syrup, placebo MNPs. Children will receive interventions for 3 months based on WHO recommendations and then be followed up for 9 months post intervention. The primary outcome is cognitive composite score measured by Bayley III. Secondary outcomes include motor and language composite score by Bayley III, behaviour rating using selected items from Wolke&#x02019;s rating scales and BSID-II behaviour ratings, temperament, growth, haemoglobin, anaemia and iron status, and infectious morbidity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, at the end of 3-month intervention and after 9 months postintervention follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Ethical Review Committee of icddr,b (Dhaka, Bangladesh) and the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee (Melbourne, Australia).

WHO recommends two different possible direct interventions for controlling anaemia in young children. First, WHO recommends that all children aged 6&#x02013;23 months, in settings where the prevalence of anaemia exceeds 40%, receive 3 months daily iron supplements.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Alternatively, where the prevalence of anaemia exceeds 20%, WHO recommends children 6&#x02013;23 months receive 90 days home fortification with iron-containing MMPs every 6&#x02009;months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> WHO does not recommend one approach over the other; their efficacy and safety have not been compared in a large head-to-head trial; earlier recommendations for MMPs proposed 2&#x000a0;months intervention every 6&#x02009;months.

We therefore expect that results from this trial will have generalisability to other low-and-middle-income countries where the prevalence of anaemia is high. This may include malaria-endemic countries; however, the proportion of anaemia attributable to ID in such settings is lower, and the iron&#x02013;infection interactions may be different. As such, iron trials in malaria-endemic countries should incorporate specific malaria prevention measures which our study does not require. Our study team is also proposing a similar study in Malawi where malaria is endemic, incorporating the requirements for malaria treatment or prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Children will be randomised only if they fulfil all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>aged 8 months (&#x000b1;14 days) at the time of randomisation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>not expected to leave the study location for &#x0003e;1&#x02009;week over the next 3 months or for &#x0003e;1&#x02009;month over the next 12 months;</p></list-item><list-item><p>has a legal guardian capable of providing informed consent.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Children meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Capillary Hb&#x000a0;&#x0003c;8.0&#x02009;g/dL at the time of screening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drinking water iron concentration&#x000a0;&#x0003e;1&#x02009;mg/L.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Diagnosed case of any clinical haemoglobinopathy (eg, beta-thalassaemia major, HbE-beta thalassaemia).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Current infective illness (ie, respiratory infection, diarrhoea) with fever; however, children may be rescreened again after recovery if otherwise eligible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Received iron supplements or iron-containing MMP in the previous month.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Known congenital anomaly, developmental disorder or severe developmental delay.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Child of multiple birth, for example, twins, triplets.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the three arms.

SFAs will screen children for eligibility, motivate the mothers/guardians for participation; collect socioeconomic data, household food security and willingness-to-pay (WTP)&#x000a0;information. At this visit, consent for participation in the study will be signed by Bayley testers. They will also collect baseline information on child&#x02019;s temperament, family care indicator questionnaire, administer Bayley scale of infant and toddler development (3rd edition), rate the child&#x02019;s behaviour by using Wolke&#x02019;s Behaviour Rating Scale, take anthropometric measurements and, finally, a study phlebotomist will collect 3&#x02009;mL of venous blood. The child will then receive the randomly allocated intervention. Testers will provide detailed instruction regarding medication to mothers or caregivers before they leave the test centre and they will give details of the enrolled child to the assigned VHW for prospective follow-up visits. The assigned VHW will then visit the child every week for the 3-month intervention period, and every month for the 9-month postintervention period. Morbidity data will be collected weekly and monthly during the intervention and postintervention period, respectively. VHWs will also record and notify any unscheduled hospital or clinic admission experienced by the participant. The number of doses missed by participants will be recorded, empty bottles and sachets will be collected and new doses for the following week dispensed at routine weekly visits. A total of 23 VHWs, 5 SFAs and 10 psychological testers are expected to be recruited and trained for this trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Other visits</title><sec id="s2i1"><title>Withdrawal visit</title><p>Children who stop study drug may continue with assessments if their guardian wishes.

It is a standard series of measurements primarily to assess cognitive, motor (fine and gross) and language (receptive and expressive) development of infants and toddlers aged 0&#x02013;3&#x000bd; years. Total number of credited items is converted into scaled scores based on child&#x02019;s age, which are then converted to composite scores of each subscale. These scores are used to determine the child&#x02019;s performance compared with norms taken from typically developing children of their age in developed countries. Bayley&#x000a0;II has been adapted and extensively used on Bangladeshi children.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref> Bayley&#x000a0;-III has now been adapted&#x000a0;and some components not familiar for the rural and urban children of this country have been changed according to the local context. It has been used in several studies in this population.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Each tester will receive month-long training for Bayley assessments after employment. Training will cover administration of the testing instruments across all age groups from 1 to 42 months. Refresher training will be provided every 3&#x02009;months to maintain the consistency and agreements between testers. New testers hired during the course of the study will undergo the same training process. Bayley testers will be certified and permitted to collect data only when their results agree&#x000a0;&#x0003e;90% with the gold standard, that is, the trainer. About 5%&#x02013;10% of the tests by each tester will be observed by the trainer for intertester reliability over the course of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2k2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="s2k2a"><title>Development</title><p>CogCS at the end of 9 months post intervention, motor and language composite scores by Bayley&#x000a0;III, behaviour rating on selected items from Wolke&#x02019;s rating scales and BSID&#x000a0;II behaviour ratings, temperament by using a modified version of Bates, quality of home stimulation by using family care indicators and food insecurity by household food insecurity access scale will be measured immediately after intervention and postintervention follow-up.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;48</xref> All the secondary outcomes will be assessed at 3&#x02009;(end of intervention) and 9&#x02009;months post intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2k2b"><title>Physical growth</title><p>This&#x000a0;will be measured as length, weight, head circumference at end of intervention and post-follow-up period. Length of the child will be measured to the nearest 0.1&#x02009;cm by using the Shorr stadiometer (Shorr Products), which has been previously validated and used on local population. Weights will be obtained using a battery-powered digital scale (Tanita HD-318). Length and weight will be used to develop indicators of stunting and wasting compared with age-sex specific WHO international reference growth standards.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Measurements will be taken in duplicate with the average taken unless substantial discrepancy occurs. Physical growth is a secondary outcome of interest, but it can be a confounding factor because malnutrition is correlated to development. We will therefore treat physical growth as both an outcome and a confounder in our analysis. Testers will be certified to take anthropometric measurements only when they achieve a high inter-rater reliability with the trainer, that is, the gold standard. About 5%&#x02013;10% measures will be checked by the quality assurance team for interobserver reliability throughout the study period.

Parent&#x02019;s perception of the benefits (or lack thereof) can also play an important role for uptake of the supplementation. WTP will be measured through the contingent valuation method to predict the maximum price at or below which the participants will definitely buy one unit of the medicine at the end of intervention. Data for future health economic analyses will be collected along with unplanned clinic presentation and hospital admission.</p></sec><sec id="s2k2g"><title>Blood samples</title><p>Three&#x000a0;millilitres of venous blood will be collected.

By construct, the Bayley III CogCS ranges between 55 and 150 (standardised mean 100; SD 15), whereby a higher Bayley III CogCS indicates a better cognitive performance. Our systematic review estimated a difference of 1.65 points (n=1093 across six trials; random-effects 95%&#x02009;CI (&#x02212;0.63&#x000a0;to 3.94)) on Bayley MDI (the cognitive scale reported on previous versions of the Bayley scales) in favour of daily iron supplementation compared with control in children aged 4&#x02013;23 months. Among the six studies included in this systematic review, the highest quality (Cochrane risk of bias tool) study (in Indonesia) evaluating effects on development in a community setting found a two-point difference of universal iron supplementation (n=136) compared with placebo (n=143) after 6 months intervention (mean Bayley MDI: iron 101 vs placebo 99, p=0.76).<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> A more recent (but non-blinded) trial in Pakistan found a significant 2.5-point difference of MMPs (n=658) compared with control (n=699) at 12 months of age (mean Bayley III CogCS: MMPs 95.9 vs placebo 93.4, p=0.007).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The sample size required to detect a two-point difference is 883 per arm to reach 80% power using a two-sided 2.5% level of significance for each comparison (Bonferroni correction), assuming a 15-point SD. Accounting for about 20% missing data in Bayley III CogCS at 3 months post&#x000a0;baseline, based on a randomised trial in Bangladesh which reported a 26% loss between birth and 6&#x02009;months<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, the total sample size is 3300. This is currently the largest trial evaluating effects of iron compared with placebo on cognitive development ever to be conducted and will provide evidence for the overall, average effect of these interventions when applied universally to a population with a high prevalence of anaemia, as presently recommended by WHO.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><p>All randomised infants will be included in the analysis set according to the arm to which the infant was randomly allocated. Baseline characteristics will be examined across the arms to assess the randomisation. Continuous data will be summarised using mean and SD or median and 25th&#x02013;75th percentile if data are found to be skewed (eg, ferritin). Categorical data will be presented as count and percentage. The primary outcome, Bayley&#x000a0;III CogCS scores at baseline, 3&#x02009;months and 12&#x02009;months post&#x000a0;baseline, will be analysed using a constrained longitudinal data analysis method.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The model will incorporate time point as a categorical variable and assume a common baseline mean across the three arms. Furthermore, it will adjust for the stratification factors used in the randomisation (gender, union) as main factors and model the variance&#x02013;covariance among the repeated measurements as unstructured. The estimate and 95%&#x02009;CI of the mean difference in change from baseline to each postbaseline time point between two arms will be obtained from this model. This model will yield unbiased results when the outcome data are missing at random. In addition, sensitivity analyses consisting of an adjusted analysis accounting for key prognostic baseline variables (eg, socioeconomic status) will be conducted. Secondary continuous outcomes (eg, Bayley III domain scores, anthropometry, z-scores (growth), Behaviour Rating Scale) will be analysed similarly as the primary outcome. Appropriate transformations may be applied to the variables before fitting the model if considered skewed. Secondary binary outcomes (eg, growth stunting, wasting and underweight) will be analysed using generalised estimating equations with a logarithmic link function and unstructured correlation. A Poisson regression, or in case of overdispersion negative binomial regression, will be used to analyse the rate of infections (eg, fever) for the duration of the intervention period, the follow-up period and 12-month study period. The number and percentage of infants with at least one infection, at least one AE and at least one unplanned hospital or healthcare facility attendance will be tabulated by arm for the duration of the intervention period, the follow-up period and 12-month study period. A per-protocol analysis of efficacy outcomes, based on adherence, and as as-treated analysis of safety outcomes, in case of misrandomisation, will also be conducted. Exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed irrespective of the primary study findings by (a) baseline anaemia status (yes vs no anaemia), (b) baseline ID status (yes vs no iron deficient), (c) baseline ID anaemia status (yes vs no iron-deficient anaemia), (d) baseline home stimulation (above vs below median level as measured by family care indicators), (e) wealth status (above or below median), (f) growth (presence or absence of stunting), (g) infant&#x02019;s sex (male vs female) and (h) food security status, by adding subgroup as a main effect and its interaction with treatment arm to the model to evaluate whether&#x000a0;the treatment effect differs across subgroup categories. We postulate that infants with anaemia, ID, IDA or above median home stimulation will have a larger treatment effect compared with those whom are non-anaemic, non-iron deficient, non-iron-deficient anaemic or below median home stimulation, respectively.</p><p>In addition, depending on the findings of the study, we will undertake subsequent health economics analysis of the data. For this purpose, we will collect and present all direct and indirect costs for the implementation of the project. The contingent valuation methods will be used to estimate weekly WTP and multiple regression analysis will be used to predict WTP by socioeconomic characters, past illness and type of medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Data management</title><p>Data from questionnaires will be entered directly into electronic tablets in the field, along with Global Positioning System location data.

We will also communicate results to policymakers through policy&#x000a0;briefs and reports, for example, WHO, Unicef and major nutrition bodies (eg, GAIN).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e310" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018325.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e311" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018325.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>MIH and SJH contributed equally,</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>JH, B-AB and S-RP contributed equally.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SP and BB conceived of the idea for the trial.
