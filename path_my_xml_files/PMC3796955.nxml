However, in many other experiments, subjects &#x0201c;trickle in&#x0201d; to be randomized to treatment conditions, usually via complete randomization. To take advantage of the rich background data that researchers often have (but underutilize) in these experiments, we develop methods that use continuous covariates to assign treatments sequentially. We build on biased coin and minimization procedures for discrete covariates and demonstrate that our methods outperform complete randomization, producing better covariate balance in simulated data. We then describe how we selected and deployed a sequential blocking method in a clinical trial and demonstrate the advantages of our having done so. Further, we show how that method would have performed in two larger sequential political trials. Finally, we compare causal effect estimates from differences in means, augmented inverse propensity weighted estimators, and randomization test inversion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>Autumn 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1 Introduction to Sequential Randomization</title><p>In typical political experiments, researchers randomize a set of households, precincts, or individuals to treatments all at once, and characteristics of all units are known at the time of randomization. However, in a <italic>sequential experiment</italic>, assignment occurs when units enter the study at different, often unpredictable times. Assignment in such experiments is usually done by complete randomization. In political psychology laboratory experiments, for example, subjects usually elect when to participate, and neither their participation nor its order is known to researchers <italic>a priori</italic>. Patients in clinical trials similarly enter studies asynchronously, as their diagnoses are made. In experiments in politics, medicine, public health, education, and elsewhere, new units can be discovered in the midst of ongoing trials.</p><p>These common, important research situations differ from nonsequential experiments in which researchers know all participating units and conduct a single randomization. In nonsequential experiments, background data (available for all units simultaneously) can be used to block the experiment, creating homogeneous groups within which treatments can be assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B21">Moore 2012</xref>). Blocking can improve balance, reduce estimation error, and increase the precision of causal estimates in sequential and nonsequential experiments. However, at a given moment during a sequential experiment, the researcher only has information on the units that have already arrived and the unit that has just appeared to be assigned&#x02014;the <italic>current</italic> unit&#x02014;but not future units. Since the sequential experiment has less information about the eventual full sample to use in assigning treatments than does the otherwise equivalent nonsequential experiment, different methods are required to exploit this information.</p><p>Sequential randomized experiments encompass a variety of designs,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN1"><sup>1</sup></xref> including those where assignment probabilities are fixed throughout the trial, change based on the number of units already in the treatment groups, change based on the covariate profiles of previous units and the current unit, and change as a function of previous units&#x02019; outcomes. These are <italic>non-adaptive</italic>, <italic>treatment-adaptive covariate-adaptive</italic>, and <italic>response-adaptive</italic> randomizations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B6">Chow and Chang 2007</xref>). Both covariate- and response-adaptive designs vary assignment probabilities based on knowledge about previous units. On the other hand, treatment-adaptive designs may ignore the researcher&#x02019;s detailed data on individual subjects.</p><p>We focus on covariate-adaptive designs. In many cases, outcomes are not realized until long after assignment, so previous outcome data are unavailable when subsequent assignments are made. Experiments interested in whether patients survive five years or information effects persist through the end of a campaign provide examples. Even when prior unit outcome information is not available during randomization, covariate data may still be powerful.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>We describe covariate-adaptive blocking for sequential randomizations, showing how researchers can incorporate rich background data, even in sequential trials where assignment takes place shortly after a subject arrives. We use simulation to explore advantages of new approaches over complete randomization in a variety of data contexts. To develop foundations for why new approaches are warranted, the next section introduces the canonical biased coin and minimization approaches to blocked sequential randomization using discrete covariates with a few levels each. We describe experiments with two and several treatment conditions to illustrate limitations of common approaches. In particular, researchers often want to incorporate more, finer covariates than is practical in canonical designs.</p><p>Section 3 proposes ways to integrate discrete and continuous covariate information into sequential randomizations, and enumerates some decisions experimentalists must make. Section 4 applies the methods to four types of continuous simulated data: uncorrelated and correlated multivariate normal (MVN) data, MVN data with extreme outliers, and extremely bimodal data. In each case, sequentially blocked experiments exhibit more balance and precision than completely randomized experiments. Section 5 tests several methods using simulated data that anticipated a then-upcoming clinical trial which we conducted. Based on the results, we selected and deployed one method in the actual trial. We show how well the chosen method performed when we implemented it. Next, we apply this method to two much larger political studies, again showing improvements. We then compare causal effect estimates from differences in means, augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimators, and randomization test inversion.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2"><title>2 Using Covariate Data in Sequential Randomization</title><p>To most meaningfully block a sequential experiment, researchers must collect background data prior to randomization.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Since subjects may be assigned to conditions very shortly after initiating contact with an experimenter, these data should be collected quickly and incorporated into randomization in an automated way. Productive data collection from recent political experiments includes a &#x0201c;short background questionnaire&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B5">Chong and Druckman 2007</xref>), rich background data from an online panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B20">Malhotra and Kuo 2008</xref>), and a subset of the information from a pre-assignment web survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B13">Horiuchi, Imai, and Taniguchi 2007</xref>).</p><p>Sequential randomization methods have various goals, including creating similar covariate distributions in the treatment groups, creating equal group sizes, and avoiding assignments that researchers can predict. We focus on the first of these. Promoting balance across treatment group covariate distributions benefits from richer covariate information than simply the number of units already assigned to each group. For discussion of benefits from covariate-balancing blocking in general, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B21">Moore (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B16">King et al. (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B14">Imai, King, and Nall (2009)</xref>. On the other hand, permuted block randomizations, for example, seek to balance treatment group sizes and have endured recent criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B35">Schulz and Grimes 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B36"> 2002b</xref>).</p><p>Modern covariate-adaptive randomizations begin with &#x0201c;biased coin&#x0201d; designs, which set the current unit&#x02019;s treatment assignment probability using its entire covariate profile at once. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B9">Efron (1971)</xref> describes the sample-size-balancing properties of biased coin designs and discusses their ability to overcome biases like time trends in clinical trials.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN4"><sup>4</sup></xref> An alternative, &#x0201c;minimization,&#x0201d; considers covariates one at a time and can limit marginal imbalance across an arbitrarily large set of covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B26">Pocock and Simon 1975</xref>). However, both biased coins and minimization require discrete, replicated levels of the prognostic factors and focus on the number of units assigned to particular treatments. We develop the intuition of the Efron and Pocock&#x02013;Simon approaches before exploring some related concerns. We propose alternatives for addressing these concerns in Section 3.</p><sec id="SEC2.1"><title>2.1 Balancing Condition Sizes Using Discrete Covariates</title><p>The biased coin and minimization approaches utilize discrete covariates with few levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B9">Efron 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B26">Pocock and Simon 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B38">Whitehead 1997</xref>).

The new Democratic male should have a higher probability of being assigned to the control, but minimization does not tell us this.</p><p>To promote balance in the interaction, the two binary covariates could be combined into a single four-category covariate (&#x0201c;Republican Male,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Democratic Male,&#x0201d; etc.). Then, a biased coin procedure will protect against assigning the Democratic male to treatment with all those identical to him. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B40">Zelen (1974)</xref> suggests using permuted blocks within strata. However, these solutions create new problems. Even with only a few covariates with a few levels each, the number of possible profiles, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i25.jpg"/></inline-formula>, gets large quickly. Sequential randomization encounters a dimensionality curse similar to that in nonsequential experiments. If a new unit&#x02019;s profile has not yet appeared in an experiment, the biased coin ignores his covariate information.</p><p>Despite these drawbacks, researchers may require that a few discrete covariates be more certain to be balanced. Our software described below allows experimentalists to block on some discrete covariates exactly. Our implementation incorporates the minimization procedure described above, taking into consideration the full ranking of treatment group sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B26">Pocock and Simon 1975</xref>). When only discrete covariates are exact blocked, we assign units after the first to treatment <italic>t</italic> with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i26.jpg"/></inline-formula>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN5"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>Older approaches require either categorical covariates or coarsening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="mpt007-B1">Atkinson 2003</xref>). Drastically coarsening covariates to a few levels may ignore relevant information and limit an experimental design unnecessarily. On the other hand, mapping continuous covariates onto many categories reintroduces the dimensionality problem described above. Using rich information to foster covariate balance is a key motivation for collecting pre-treatment data. Thus, where continuous predictors affect outcomes, we encourage researchers to augment any needed exact blocking with methods for continuous data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="SEC3"><title>3 Sequential Blocking with Continuous Covariates</title><p>The standard approaches sequentially block a few discrete covariates by counting the number of identical units assigned to each condition. The current unit is most likely to be assigned to the condition with the fewest identical units. With a continuous covariate, identical units will not exist. Thus, to avoid losing information through coarsening while still defining a feasible procedure, we propose methods for sequential randomization that exploit relationships between the current unit&#x02019;s covariate profile and those of all previously assigned units. To do so, we must decide how to measure similarity between two units, aggregate pairwise similarity to compare the current unit to each treatment condition, and set a probability of assignment to each condition using the aggregate similarities.</p><p>A design may or may not prioritize <italic>exact blocking</italic> variables. A design that prioritizes certain discrete (or coarsened) variables seeks first to balance those, then to balance other covariates. Our software implementation allows the user to specify exact blocking covariates and omit or include any continuous covariates. Without prioritized exact covariates (or within strata defined by an exact covariate subprofile, such as the columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="mpt007-T2">Table 2</xref>&#x02019;s lower panel), we define the similarity between units using the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between units <italic>q</italic> and <italic>r</italic> with covariate vectors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i27.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i28.jpg"/></inline-formula>: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i29.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>For the aggregation, we implement the mean, median, and trimmed mean of the pairwise MDs between the current unit and the units in each treatment condition. Alternatives include a mean or median weighted by sample size. Index the units with treatment condition <italic>t</italic> using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i30.jpg"/></inline-formula>, and define for each condition <italic>t</italic> an average MD between the current unit <italic>q</italic> and the units already assigned <italic>t</italic>. Using the mean as an example, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i31.jpg"/></inline-formula>. If the average MD from the current unit is 2 in the control condition and 5 in the treatment condition, then the control condition looks more like the current unit than does the treatment condition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mpt007-FN6"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>We investigate several ways to use the pairwise MDs to set the probability of assigning the current unit to each condition. The first set of techniques ignores the covariate and condition-count information and assigns the conditions with fixed, perhaps unequal, probabilities. The second set of strategies, which we call <monospace>ktimes</monospace> methods, calculates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i33.jpg"/></inline-formula> for all <italic>t</italic>, then sorts the treatment conditions by these averages. Since this score represents dissimilarity, we bias the randomization toward conditions with high scores, reversing the rankings relative to the scores in Section 2. Next, for values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i34.jpg"/></inline-formula> we assign the condition with the highest average MD a probability <italic>k</italic> times larger than the other <italic>T</italic> &#x02013; 1 assignment probabilities. For example, using <italic>k</italic> = 2 in a two-condition experiment assigns the more dissimilar condition with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i35.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the more similar condition with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i36.jpg"/></inline-formula>. Using <italic>k</italic> = 4 in a three-condition experiment assigns the most dissimilar condition with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i37.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the other two conditions with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i38.jpg"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>A third approach uses the distributions of the MDs most directly. Instead of fixing an assignment probability for each condition or each condition rank (as in the first two mappings), here the assignment probabilities change with the average MD values and the number of units in each condition. Like the <monospace>ktimes</monospace> approaches, our first method ensures assignment bias toward conditions with larger average MDs; it assigns the current unit to treatment <italic>t</italic> with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i39.jpg"/></inline-formula>. We also consider two methods that use the MD, but are not certain to bias assignment toward conditions with larger MDs. The first assigns conditions proportionally to the sum of the MDs between that condition and the current unit; condition <italic>t</italic> is assigned probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i40.jpg"/></inline-formula>, normalized by the total <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="mpt007i41.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

Sequential blocking improves covariate balance and the precision of causal estimates in trickle-in experiments across a variety of simulated and real data. We build upon canonical methods for few-category discrete covariates, extending them to incorporate many continuous covariates.</p><p>Our three empirical applications contextualize some customary principles of experimental design. First, better balance is easier to obtain with more units. With forty hypothetical units in the PTSD experiment, the <italic>p</italic>-values for our chosen method ranged from about 0.4 to 1; with about 400 units in the voter ID subsample, they range from 0.93 to 1; with about 1400 units in the policy information experiment, they range from 0.99 to 1. Second, individual-level randomizations should produce better individual-level balance than group randomizations, as we see in the voter ID application. Third, a design that focuses on a rich set of background covariates can improve experiments in a variety of contexts.</p><p>We think pilot studies can play important roles in sequential randomizations. In particular, the covariate means and covariance matrix from a pilot could be used to approximate the center and spread of the full trial for units arriving early.
