Results of review studies on the effectiveness of IV paracetamol have indicated that it could relief or prevent postoperative pain and improve satisfaction score. It could decrease opioid use and opioid-related nausea and vomiting during and after operation. The advantages of acetaminophen are its fewer adverse events which are more significant when it is used IV possibly due to the lack of the first-pass effect.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Sinatra <italic>et al</italic>. have investigated the effectiveness of single dose of 1 g IV acetaminophen for postoperative management of major orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Gregoire <italic>et al</italic>. have evaluated the efficacy of IV paracetamol with a 2-g starting dose and a 5 g dose during the first 24 h.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The dose which is used in this trial was similar to that administrated in the study of Sinatra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Results of another study showed that paracetamol could be used mainly for surgeries with mild to moderate postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have investigated the effect of periopretive/preemptive administration of magnesium sulfate on postoperative pain of different surgeries.

It is suggested that evaluation of different long-term complications specially those related to postoperative pain would be more helpful for providing more effective postoperative pain control protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this trial indicated that ketamine has more superior effect for during recovery and postoperative pain controlling and analgesic use than paracetamol and magnesium sulfate. Patients were more satisfied in ketamine group, and the duration of recovery was shorter. It could also delay the time for the first analgesic request. It is recommended to design more trials for evaluation of different doses of ketamine as well as its long-term postoperative consequences and adverse effects for achieving more conclusive results in this field.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vadivelu</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Schermer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kodumudi</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaye</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Urman</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preventive analgesia for postoperative pain control: A broader concept</article-title><source>Local Reg Anesth</source><year>2014</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>17</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24872720</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Goudas</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute pain</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1999</year><volume>353</volume><fpage>2051</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10376632</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apfelbaum</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mehta</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative pain experience: Results from a national survey suggest postoperative pain continues to be undermanaged</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2003</year><volume>97</volume><fpage>534</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12873949</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kehlet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anaesthesia, surgery, and challenges in postoperative recovery</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2003</year><volume>362</volume><fpage>1921</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14667752</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holte</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kehlet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative ileus: A preventable event</article-title><source>Br J Surg</source><year>2000</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>1480</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11091234</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gandhi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Heitz</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Viscusi</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Challenges in acute pain management</article-title><source>Anesthesiol Clin</source><year>2011</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>291</fpage><lpage>309</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21620344</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management.
