The study community includes diabetic patients referring to a community charity institution in Sari. Sample size has been chosen 114 in both case and control groups. Oof 114 individuals in case group, 37 persons were excluded (12 due to giving wrong telephone number, 10 due to being reluctant to continue intervention, 5 as a result of their line getting closed and 10 for lack of referring to fill in posttest questionnaire), which reached to 77 in case group on the whole and out of 114 persons in control group, 37 were excluded of the study; 27 due to not referring to complete posttest questionnaire, 10 because of giving wrong telephone number which reached to 74 in control group on the whole. Sampling was the simple random method. In this way, samples were chosen randomly using patients file number and were divided into 2 case and control groups equally.</p><p>Data collection was based on a questionnaire. This questionnaire is of diabetic patients&#x02019; self-care type. It includes two sections: Patients&#x02019; demographic information and their performance in three areas as sports, caring foot and medicine (insulin and tablet).</p><p>To measure its validity, the questionnaire was completed by 15 diabetic patients and after 7 days, it was filled in by the same patients. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used in performance and attitude to measure reliability using ICC statistical value. ICC for attitude was 0.973 and for performance, it was 0.81 indicating the mentioned questionnaires reliability. Furthermore, data collection was carried out in 2013. Before intervention, the necessary explanations about the method were given to the selected samples and their consent was taken for intervention. The questionnaire was filled in by the case and control groups separately as a pretest. First, a training plan was held for the intervention group, and they were handed pamphlets about diabetes-intervention lasted 4 weeks. Intervention group received 3 reminding messages every 48 h (exercise, taking care of foot and medicine) through cell phone (by manually). Besides, medicine reminding messages (oral tablet and insulin) were sent to them daily. At the end of every week, telephone-based follow-up was done and the patients were asked about their satisfaction from intervention approach and also the tips sent to them through SMS and in case of being reluctant to continue intervention, they were put aside. Six weeks after the intervention, posttest questionnaire was distributed among case and control groups. Data analysis was performed by descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test and using SPSS version 16 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL).</p><p>Ethical issues (including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study findings indicate that 49% of samples were women and age mean was 44.26 &#x000b1; 11.2.

Regarding the research findings, using SMS has been effective on boosting diabetic patients&#x02019; self-care so that diabetic patients performance on taking care of foot, exercise, taking medicine and their attitude before and after intervention has been significant different.</p><p>This study results are in congruent with other similar research results. In Zolfaghari <italic>et al.</italic> comparative study on mobile message and telephone-based follow-up in diabetic (type 2) patients in both groups, median HbA1c has changed meaningfully.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Also in the study by Ollivier <italic>et al.</italic>, SMS has been a very useful reminder and there was a significant difference between the two groups to recovery from malaria and adapting after returning to malaria indigenous region.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the research by Anh&#x000f8;j and M&#x000f8;ldrup on asthmatic patients through cell phone and SMS, at the end, they were all satisfied from controlling their disease using SMS.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The study by Gerber <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the primary feasibility and acceptability of a message text as an approach to develop healthy behaviors to maintain weight has been very influential.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Therefore, this study result proposing various studies reports verifies that reminding messages for diabetic patients self-care can play a positive role on patients&#x02019; self-care behaviors.</p><p>In the research by Fatehi <italic>et al.</italic> that the true answers mean in intervention group has improved meaningfully and the mean change was significant before and after intervention[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] matched with this study results.

Based on the study results, there was a meaningful difference in studied individuals exercise performance scores mean before and after intervention. This increase implies training and applied methods effect on patients&#x02019; performance alteration. In mean and standard deviation of taking care of foot performance in case group, a meaningful difference was found before and after intervention.</p><p>According to the above mentioned findings, this study regarding diabetic people's performance change has been successful relatively. Mean difference of taking oral tablet performance had a meaningful difference in case group before and after intervention. This finding is congruent with that of the other studies such as the ones done by Nouhi, Zolfaghari, Kim, Wan Berg, Fathi and Baradaran <italic>et al.</italic> In these studies on case group performance before and after training, a meaningful statistical difference was observed in case group.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Also using SMS and high speed internet services caused an increase in taking diabetic medicine, 30-min physical exercise and persevering in diabetic patients&#x02019; care.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] SMS is an effective tool to transfer information to diabetic people who have a cell phone. Sending educational text message through cell phone has a positive effect on patients&#x02019; knowledge.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Of the limitation the present study was the large number of participants leaving the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The study results indicated that a regular and planned training program can result in promoting performance improvement in diabetic patients&#x02019; self-care. Although using virtual trainings, especially SMS is not so wide spread in health care educational programs, regarding growing increase of communication and digital gadgets and people easily accessing them, to utilize virtual educational methods is recommended as an appropriate approach for various health and self-care and follow-up training programs for diverse groups in society, particularly
