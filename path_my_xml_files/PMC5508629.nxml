There is evidence that podiatry can prevent falls in community-dwelling populations. The feasibility of implementing a podiatry intervention and trial in the care home population is unknown. To inform a potential future definitive trial, we performed a pilot randomised controlled trial to assess: (i) the feasibility of a trial of a podiatry intervention to reduce care home falls, and (ii) the potential direction and magnitude of the effect of the intervention in terms of number of falls in care home residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Informed by Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions, we conducted a single blind, pilot randomised controlled trial in six care homes in the East of Scotland. Participants were randomised to either: (i) a three month podiatry intervention comprising core podiatry care, foot and ankle exercises, orthoses and footwear provision or (ii) usual care. Falls-related outcomes (number of falls, time to first fall) and feasibility-related outcomes (recruitment, retention, adherence, data collection rates) were collected. Secondary outcomes included: generic health status, balance, mobility, falls efficacy, and ankle joint strength.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">474 care home residents were screened. 43 (9.1%) participants were recruited: 23 to the intervention, 20 to control. Nine (21%) participants were lost to follow-up due to declining health or death. It was feasible to deliver the trial elements in the care home setting. 35% of participants completed the exercise programme. 48% reported using the orthoses &#x02018;all or most of the time&#x02019;. Completion rates of the outcome measures were between 93% and 100%. No adverse events were reported. At the nine month follow-up period, the intervention group per-person fall rate was 0.77 falls vs. 0.83 falls in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">A podiatry intervention to reduce falls can be delivered to care home residents within a pilot randomised controlled trial of the intervention. Although not powered to determine effectiveness, these preliminary data provide justification for a larger trial, incorporating a full process evaluation, to determine whether this intervention can significantly reduce falls in this high-risk population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02178527">NCT02178527</ext-link>; Date of registration: 17 June 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12877-017-0541-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Older people</kwd><kwd>Falls</kwd><kwd>Podiatry</kwd><kwd>Care homes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000589</institution-id><institution>Chief Scientist Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZH/4/701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wylie</surname><given-names>Gavin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">Half of all care home residents fall every year, often several times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are at an increased risk of falls compared to community dwelling older people because they are more frail, and frequently have multiple long-term health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], for which they are taking multiple medications known to impair balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Across community and care home dwelling older people, falls are one of the most common causes of hip fracture, unplanned hospitalisation and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the disproportionately high number of falls in care homes, a Cochrane systematic review found the evidence supporting effectiveness of interventions to reduce falls in care homes to be equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One recent feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) has shown that a risk assessment intervention to reduce care home falls is implementable under trial conditions, but it has not yet been tested in a full scale RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Falls result from complex interplay between environmental hazards and physiological risk factors such as impaired muscle strength, balance and gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Chronic disease that leads to impairments in sensory, neurological, cognitive and musculoskeletal functioning also increases the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. More recently, foot problems, which are common in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], have been shown to be a contributing factor to falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Foot and ankle risk factors for falls are: reduced ankle joint range of motion, hallux valgus deformity (bunion), decreased toe plantarflexor strength, increased shoe heel height, inadequate shoe fixation (absence of strap or lace or other retaining medium) and reduced shoe-sole contact area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, recent reviews suggest that foot and ankle exercises (particularly toe exercises), and footwear interventions (shoes or foot orthoses) may improve falls-risk related outcomes such as static and dynamic balance ability, ankle flexibility and lateral stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Given the demonstrable link between feet, footwear and falls, an inexpensive and simple to implement multifaceted podiatry intervention has been developed and studied within an Australian community dwelling cohort of older people in a large RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This work demonstrated that the intervention group experienced 36% fewer falls compared to those in the control group, and significantly reduced the incidence of falls compared to usual care (incidence rate ratio 0.64, 95%; CI 0.45 to 0.91). More recently, a cohort-RCT using a similar podiatry intervention conducted with a United Kingdom (UK) community dwelling population demonstrated a reduction in the incidence rate of falls in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05) and a reduction in the proportion of multiple fallers (27.6% vs 34.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The podiatry intervention holds promise as a falls-reduction strategy. However, the results of falls trials conducted in community dwelling older people cannot be directly applied to those living in care home settings who are more frail, prone to sudden declines in health, and more cognitively and functionally impaired than those living in their own homes. Therefore, exploring the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention in the care home setting &#x02013; the population most at risk of falls &#x02013; is warranted.</p><p id="Par19">Challenges in delivering interventions and conducting trials in care homes include recruitment, engaging care home staff, and ensuring that the intervention is feasible and deliverable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given these uncertainties, we conducted a two-stage study that was informed by the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on complex intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (the PIRFECT study &#x02013; Podiatry Intervention to Reduce Falls in Elderly Care Trial). In the first stage we remodelled the existing multifaceted podiatry intervention that was designed for community-dwelling older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to ensure that it was feasible and acceptable in the care home setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We also refined recruitment processes and determined appropriate outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The second stage of the study, which is reported here, was a pilot RCT of the remodelled multifaceted podiatry intervention.</p><p id="Par20">We aimed to establish the feasibility of a future phase III multicentre RCT designed to establish the clinical effectiveness of the remodelled multifaceted podiatry intervention. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine the recruitment and retention rate, adherence, the quality of the outcome data, and to estimate the potential effect size of the intervention on the number of falls. We anticipated that this approach would inform decision-making regarding progression to a large-scale definitive phase III RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par21">The study was a two arm, parallel group pilot randomised controlled trial with outcome assessments at baseline (T1), and subsequent blinded outcome assessment at the end of the intervention (T2) and at 3&#x000a0;months (T3) and 6&#x000a0;months (T4) after the end of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par22">Six care homes in the East of Scotland. Four care homes were privately owned, one was operated by a charitable trust, and one was state-run by the local authority. The capacity of each care home ranged from 24 to 55 residents. Each of the privately owned care homes always had at least one registered nurse on duty, with the remaining staff being care assistants. The state-run and charitable trust care homes employed no registered nurse (although had regular visits from UK National Health Service nurses), and were staffed entirely by care assistants. Our initial approach to care homes was through a number of routes: directly to the care home, through regulators (the Scottish Care Inspectorate), and via UK National Health Service (NHS) falls service co-ordinators. We met with care home managers who expressed interest to explain in full what was involved in participating in the study. Those who wanted to take part then provided written permission to conduct the study within their homes. The care homes that were recruited were representative of normal UK care home provision and typical of care homes that would be invited to take part in a future multicentre RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p id="Par23">The East of Scotland Research Ethics Service granted ethical approval for the study (reference 12/ES/0088). Care home staff identified and initially approached residents who met the initial inclusion criteria on behalf of the research team. A member of the research team then approached interested residents, to provide further information and answer any questions. A researcher then screened the potential participant using the inclusion/exclusion criteria before obtaining written informed consent.</p><p id="Par24">Participants were eligible for recruitment if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (i) &#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years old and permanently living in a care home for older people; (ii) one or more falls in the previous year (in order to target those most at risk of a fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]); (iii) a foot problem within the scope of practice of a UK trained podiatrist (defined by the UK Health and Care Professions Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). Residents were excluded if they were: (i) terminally unwell or too frail to be included; (ii) only able to mobilise with the use of wheelchair; (iii) temporary residents; (iv) unable to provide informed consent; (v) lower limb amputees.</p><p id="Par25">We used the mini-mental-state exam (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to guide our assessment of capacity to consent. We used a severe score (0&#x02013;9) on the MMSE as an indicative threshold for inability to provide informed consent. However, the final decision to recruit, irrespective of MMSE score, was through assessment by the research podiatrist, based on the ability of the prospective participant to explain back to the research podiatrist what was required by their participation in the study. Where there was ambiguity, a decision on whether or not a potential participant should enter the study was based on agreement between two researchers (GW and ZY).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="Par26">After recruitment, but prior to randomisation, baseline assessments were completed by one of 2 research podiatrists (GW or ZY). Participants were then randomly assigned to the usual care control group or the intervention group. Randomisation was conducted via a concealed, web-based randomisation service provided by UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) registered Tayside Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Dundee. Minimisation was employed to ensure balance between the two groups on the following falls-related risk factors: age, gender, presence of polypharmacy (&#x0003e;4 concurrent medications) and the presence of psychotropic medication. Follow up measures were conducted by a rater who was a physiotherapist of 20&#x000a0;years experience (SM), trained in the conduct of all measures and who was unaware of participant allocation. Given the nature of the intervention it was not possible to blind participants and care home staff to group allocation, however blinding of the rater was maintained by ensuring that access to research records indicating group allocation was restricted and by asking participants not to reveal their group allocation to the rater at the outset of each follow up visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par27">Feasibility outcome data and falls-related outcome data were collected. Feasibility data were collected on recruitment, retention, adherence, and missing data. The primary falls outcome measure was the number of falls in the 9-month trial period. A fall was defined as &#x02018;<italic>an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]&#x02019;. Falls recall by care home residents themselves is unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], therefore data on the number of falls were collected via the accident reporting systems in place within the care homes. All homes kept accident records that recorded both the number of falls and the circumstances surrounding them (where possible), which allowed us to count only falls meeting our definition. We also calculated the time to first fall to assess whether those in the intervention group increased their risk of falls as a result of the intervention.

Feedback received from care home residents and staff, as well as experience gained by the research podiatrist informed the remodelling of the intervention and its delivery. Briefly, the process was as follows. Staff and residents participated in a 3-month acceptability-testing phase of the initial intervention, and feasibility test of the recruitment strategy. At the conclusion of testing, semi-structured interviews were conducted to assess the acceptability and perceptions of the intervention. Based on these findings, the intervention and its delivery were refined so as to be acceptable and feasible in the care home setting. Furthermore, the research podiatrist worked closely with the care home staff to develop suitable training in order to facilitate delivery of the intervention.

The devices were customised for each resident in two ways: firstly, by moulding the devices with a heat gun in order to match the contours of the foot, and secondly by affixing 6&#x000a0;mm thick Poron&#x02122; cushioning material (Rogers Corporation, Connecticut) under the forefoot area of the orthotic in order to redistribute pressure away from areas of high pressure (i.e. where plantar lesions such as hyperkeratosis were identified by research podiatrist (GW or ZY) on the plantar aspect of the foot.

We aimed to recruit 40 care home residents to the pilot trial, since it was felt that this would be sufficient to facilitate a later sample size calculation, whilst allowing for participant attrition.

Between January 2014 and June 2014, we screened 474 potential participants from six care homes. The main reason for non-recruitment was inability to provide informed consent. Forty-seven residents (9.9%) met the inclusion criteria, agreed to participate and provided informed consent. Four residents dropped out prior to randomisation, thus 43 residents were randomised, representing 9.1% of the screened population. With the exception of gender, previous stroke, and eye problems, the intervention and control groups were well matched on the majority of baseline demographic characteristics (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Due to delays in the provision of personalised intervention equipment (orthoses and footwear), the mean number of days in the trial was longer in the intervention group: 257.9 (SD 57.8) compared to the control group: 208.1 (SD 86.5).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow of participants through study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12877_2017_541_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Completion of the secondary outcomes was as follows: Podiatry Objective Clinical Score (100%), Berg Balance Scale (100%), Timed Up and Go Test (93.4%), Barthel Index (100%), EQ-5D (95.3%), Nursing Home Falls Self-Efficacy Scale (100%) and ankle strength (98.7%), 100% completion was achieved for the Barthel Index. This was because we employed proxy completion of the Barthel Index by care home staff, which would be regarded as normal practice for this measure. Similarly, full completion was achieved for the Podiatry Objective Clinical Score because this relied upon clinician report following examination of the feet. Completion rate of the EQ5D was 95.3%. The issue preventing full completion was a number of residents having difficulty in understanding how to complete the visual analogue subscale of the EQ5D. Timed Up and Go Test had a completion rate of 93.4%. Dynamometry to measure ankle strength had a completion rate of 98.7%. We obtained data on every item within the Berg Balance Scale, and the Nursing Home Falls Self-Efficacy scale &#x02013; if residents were unable to complete a particular section they simply received the minimum score possible for that particular manoeuvre or domain, as per the guidance for these measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Adverse events and blinding</title><p id="Par52">No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

We have shown that conducting an RCT of a podiatry intervention to reduce falls in care homes is feasible with regard to recruitment, retention, and intervention delivery. Since this was a pilot trial with a small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the effectiveness of the intervention cannot be determined from our results. However the data reported here support testing the intervention in a definitive full scale multicentre trial to test effectiveness.</p><p id="Par55">There were some notable differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The majority of the participants were female, however this is representative of the general care home population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, there were differences in baseline characteristics in the domains of eye, problems and history of stroke. This is most likely due to our small sample, and in a large trial, we would not anticipate such differences. A small proportion of the screened population of residents (9.9%) were eligible to participate in this study because inclusion was restricted to those who were able to provide informed consent. It is well recognised that recruitment problems are compounded in care home research by multi-morbidity and cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and this was the experience of recruitment in the present study. However, despite the low recruitment rate, we exceeded our recruitment target, but needed to screen 474 care home residents to achieve this figure (target&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32; actually recruited&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43). Therefore we have shown that recruitment problems are not insurmountable. It is important to note that the proportion of screened residents who were eligible is essentially a point prevalence figure that met our criteria. It is possible that in a larger study conducted with a much longer recruitment window, a much higher proportion of the population would have met the criteria, and been recruited to the study. Our experience has taught us a number of factors related to care home staff that may have assisted recruitment. First, we relied upon the knowledge of staff to identify residents who they felt would be able to provide informed consent. Second, we reinforced the study as valuable and of importance to their residents. Third, we were sensitive to the care home culture, its organisation, and the level of disruption that the study may have caused.</p><p id="Par56">There was a difference in retention rates between the two arms of the trial, with the control group demonstrating higher attrition. Death, declining health, and no desire to continue with the trial, were the main reasons for this attrition in the control group, and in a small sample such as ours, this difference is not unexpected, particularly given the challenges of retention in studies involving older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our retention rate is lower than pilot trials of falls interventions directed at community dwelling older people (92%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and community dwelling older people with dementia (91%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] Moreover, our retention rate was lower than pilot trials in care homes not specifically directed at falls, for example mobility training interventions (97%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and incontinence interventions (91%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, it should be remembered that the follow up period in our study was considerably longer (6&#x000a0;months) than these studies. Our retention rate was similar to the rate reported in a recent feasibility RCT of a falls intervention in care homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and those reported in a number of other full scale care trials of care home falls interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This is both encouraging and contrary to messages about challenging retention in care home studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Engaging care home staff to assist with recruitment is an approach we would endorse. Furthermore, to enhance recruitment for a full trial, we would consider alternative design approaches such as cluster randomisation; this approach was not taken in this pilot RCT because the larger sample size requirement and the inherent cost and workload implications of a clustering would have been more costly than a pilot RCT would merit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Our data suggested an effect size that appeared to favour the intervention, but only directly after intervention delivery (T2); this effect disappeared (Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0) at 6-month follow up (T4). These data suggest that if indeed there is any protective effect of the intervention, it reduces rapidly. For any sustained effect of the intervention, care home residents may need to persist with the intervention components on a regular basis. We do not know if, and to what extent, residents continued with the intervention after the end of the protocoled 3-month intervention period, although the reduction in effect size over time suggests that they may not. Our study suggested a trend towards longer falls free survival time in the intervention group compared to the control group, however this measure is not intended to be indicative of any potential benefit of the intervention, rather it was included as a safety measure to ensure that those receiving the intervention were not placed at a higher risk of experiencing a fall as a result of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although there are doubts about the validity of applying multiple imputation to missing data in small sample sizes, we felt it was appropriate to do so in this case because: 1) it is not acceptable to ignore missing values and the reason they arose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; 2) whether imputation is used or not, our statistical analysis needs to be treated with caution, 3) We considered this was the best way to get as accurate an estimate of potential effect as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">With regard to the secondary outcomes, the differences between the groups were varied, and in some cases contradictory. Despite apparent improvements in balance (Berg balance scale), performance in functional ability (Timed Up and Go Test) worsened both between and within the groups. A possible explanation for this could be declining overall health of our sample. However, the results in the secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution since we conducted a large number of tests in a small sample. Therefore, as would be expected there was a high degree of variability. Furthermore, in our analyses we did not adjust for multiple testing and the probability that these findings were due to chance cannot be excluded. There were no other important differences between the groups on secondary outcomes and in a future definitive RCT, we would recommend a reduction in the number of secondary outcome measures. This would reduce the burden on participants, and focus interest on outcomes that are most meaningful for residents of care homes, i.e. falls-free mobility and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Monitoring adherence to the exercise component of the intervention was a challenge. We recorded 35% of participants completing the exercise programme in full. As a result of low rates of diary completion it is difficult to determine to what extent participants adhered to the intervention. We would use the term, &#x02018;<italic>documented adherence&#x02019;</italic>, since the results (falls reduction at T2, and increased ankle joint muscle strength) would suggest that residents were completing the exercises more than they were actually documenting. This raises important issues about how adherence to interventions such as this is measured. To monitor adherence, PIRFECT relied upon self-report methods. This approach is fast, inexpensive and easy to implement. Conversely, this approach has poor reliability and validity because of response biases such as acquiescence, social factors such as perceived consequences, and psychological factors such as memory, cognitive ability, and health beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Accurately measuring adherence in exercise interventions is a problem that remains to be solved, although real-time data collection using hand-held mobile devices may hold promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, the use of accelerometers may be considered in measuring adherence to exercises, however, their use is limited in large clinical groups because they are costly, and require the participant to consistently wear the device, and are not sensitive enough to assess individual limb exercise. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The present study must be viewed in the context of its limitations. First, given the study&#x02019;s low power and relatively short follow up time, the statistical analysis should be treated with caution. Secondly, because of the nature of this multifaceted intervention, it was impossible to blind participants to their group allocation, nor was it possible identify the contribution of each intervention component to reducing falls in the intervention group. Fourth, within care homes, residents who are unable to provide informed consent are the rule rather than the exception, and the fact that inclusion was restricted only to those who could provide informed consent limits the external validity of this study. However, in comparison with other care home falls studies, the mean MMSE score of our sample was 21.2 (classified as mild cognitive impairment), which is only slightly higher than a previous care home falls RCT by McMurdo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] whose sample had a mean MMSE of 19, and lower than Jensen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] whose sample had a mean score of 24. It should be remembered that whilst useful as an indicator of cognitive ability, the Mini Mental State Examination score may mislabel residents who can consent as lacking capacity, and residents unable to consent as having capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, recruitment for a subsequent larger study will require ethical approval that allows for the inclusion of residents without capacity to consent, and it is important to consider how this may be achieved in a future definitive trial. Our study was carried out in Scotland where current laws do not allow for consent by proxy for those lacking capacity. However, in a future multicentre trial, as well as recruiting in Scotland, we would intend to recruit in sites in England, where consent by proxy is permissible in law. Lastly, whilst we undertook some process evaluation work during the development of the intervention, our approach did not adhere to published frameworks. The importance of process evaluations has long been recognised, and there is now published guidance on the practical steps for its conduct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Therefore, we will incorporate a formal full process evaluation using this practical guidance in a future trial.</p><p id="Par61">Intervention cost and cost effectiveness is an important consideration. Cost effectiveness could not be determined from a small pilot study, however we can make some remarks about the potential overall cost of the intervention. Purchase of the footwear and orthoses components of the intervention are likely to be the most expensive aspects. However, whoever bears this cost will be dependent upon the health service delivery context in which intervention is delivered. The cost of footwear could conceivably be borne by the resident in some cases. In terms of administering the intervention, apart from initial training from a podiatrist, the exercises are embedded into the normal care home routines and are delivered by care home staff, thus incurring minimal extra cost for health services. The footwear and orthoses aspects of the intervention can be delivered in two visits, with one visit for assessment, and one visit for fitting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par62">Delivering and testing a podiatry intervention to reduce care home falls is feasible, despite the numerous challenges that care home research poses. The intervention and trial was also deliverable in care homes of differing sizes and models of ownership (state-owned, privately-owned). This pilot study not only provides essential information to enable the design and implementation of a full-scale RCT of the intervention, but is also likely to inform other future studies using complex intervention development frameworks with the care home population. The intervention itself is low-cost, easy to implement and uses skills that are standard to podiatrists internationally. Overall, our data support progression to a full multi-centre RCT that incorporates a full process evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par69">
