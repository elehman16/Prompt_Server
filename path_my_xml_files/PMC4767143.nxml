The standard swallowing training includes the most basic and traditional methods, involving compensation strategies such as postural adjustment or diet modification, strengthening weak oropharyngeal musculature through oral exercise, following oropharyngeal swallowing maneuvers to augment impaired anatomy, heightening sensory input through thermal-tactile stimulation, and developing a feeding-swallowing training program.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Each exercise works from a different aspect to significantly improve swallowing function.</p><p>Acupuncture is an effective, simple, inexpensive, and primary medical intervention. It has been widely used as a primary medical intervention in China and elsewhere in East Asia for many years, and continues to be a standard complementary therapy after stroke in that region. Needles are inserted into acupoints to achieve a &#x0201c;de qi&#x0201d; reaction, where the patient perceives an ache or heaviness in the area surrounding the needle. Although it has gained increased attention, arguments still remain about its effectiveness. While large numbers of articles have shown the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating dysphagia after stroke, some conclusions are unreliable owing to their poor design.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bibr15-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> For example, a review by Cochrane from 2008<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> concluded not enough evidence was available to show a therapeutic effect of acupuncture for dysphagia after acute stroke; high quality and large-scale randomized controlled trials were necessary.</p><p>Thus, we designed a randomized controlled trial of Combined Swallowing Training and Acupuncture Methods, aiming to find its effect on dysphagia after acute stroke. We hypothesized that effects of acupuncture following standard swallowing training would be synergistic as compared with standard swallowing training.

The TCM theory believes the core of disease onset is the disruption of &#x0201c;qi&#x0201d;, specifically &#x0201c;vital energies&#x0201d; of the body. Stroke patients were divided into three syndrome patterns based on TCM:<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> phlegm turbidity syndrome; blood stasis syndrome due to qi stagnation; and the liver&#x02013;kidney yin deficiency syndrome. The phlegm turbidity syndrome is a pathological change characterized by impaired diffusion and the down bearing of lung qi owing to phlegm-dampness obstruction. The blood stasis syndrome owing to qi stagnation is a pathological change in which a long-standing or severe qi stagnation impedes blood flow; this condition is characterized by the coexistence of qi stagnation and blood stasis. The liver&#x02013;kidney yin deficiency syndrome is a pathological change in which insufficient yin (liver and kidney fluid) fails to nourish the related body constituents and organs, giving rise to deficiency-fire symptoms.

The main acupoints were used in all patients (Figures 2, 3, and 4, available online). The originally prescribed acupuncture treatment points were made according to the disease state. Points were added or subtracted based on patient presentation. Empirical acupuncture treatment, involving the use of multiple needles in various locations, was also used to complement the original treatment paradigm.</p><p>Patients laid supine on a massage table or sat in a comfortable chair with their arms and legs exposed. The skin on the acupuncture points was prepared with 70% ethyl alcohol. One-time-use disposable sterile steel needles(0.20&#x02013;0.25 &#x000d7; 25&#x02013;75 mm) were inserted into acupuncture points. The depth of insertion at each point was between 10&#x02013;30 mm, except for points on Z-20 and GV20, which were between 5&#x02013;10 mm. After insertion, acupuncture needles were manually manipulated to obtain the de qi sensation. The de qi sensation is defined as the acupuncturist feeling the muscle twitch response and the patient feeling an ache or heaviness in the area surrounding the needle. The needles remained in place for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of treatment, needles were manually manipulated again before removal. An average of 16.2 needles (range 12&#x02013;23) were used during each acupuncture session for each patient. Acupuncture was performed after swallowing training for 24 sessions, which comprised of sessions six times a week for a period of four weeks.</p><p>All patients were given general medication, supportive mental health treatment (i.e. psychotherapy and health education), and standard swallowing training.

In Stage 2, if the swallowing was normal in Stage 1, 60 mL of water in a beaker was given to the patient. SSA scores ranged from 17 to 46, with a higher score indicating a decreased swallowing ability.</p><p>The DOSS rating scale<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> is a relatively simple seven-point scale developed to systematically rate dysphagia severity based on the VFSS. It helped make recommendations for patient diet level, independence level, and type of nutrition. In the VFSS, 200 mg barium was added into 286 mL water to make radiopaque material (60%); rice flour was added to make a thin liquid, thick liquid, and a solid food. Patients sequentially consumed the above liquids starting at 2 mL, subsequently increasing to 5 mL, and then 10 mL. Fluoroscopy was used to image swallowing in lateral and anteroposterior projections. All patients were assessed with the DOSS, with Level 7 representing normal swallowing and Level 1 representing severe dysphagia.</p><p>The Modified Barthel Index (MBI)<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> was used to provide a measurement of daily patient activities. It yielded scores up to 100, with the highest score indicating complete independence in self-care; a lower score indicated a worse level of daily patient activities.</p><p>The Swallowing-Related Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire was used to measure patient QOL. This self-reported questionnaire consisted of 44 items; a higher score indicated a higher QOL.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Primary outcome measures included the SSA and the DOSS.

However, significant differences in SSA scores were found at the second, third, and fourth week, indicating that the traditional Chinese acupuncture in combination with standard swallowing training could improve swallowing function recovery. This was most prominent after one week of treatment. After four weeks of treatment, significant improvement was observed in patients from the acupuncture group as compared with the control group regarding swallowing function, daily activities, and QOL. The MBI showed average pre- and post-score increases &#x0003e;10 points. The feeding section on this scale accounted only for feeding and swallowing, suggesting significantly increased independence in other areas. Zhang et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> found that acupuncture together with conventional rehabilitation might positively affect dysphagia after stroke. In the current study, acupuncture treatment was adopted in combination with swallowing training, which demonstrated a better outcome than swallowing training alone; this was consistent with results of Zhang et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Similarly, Zhou et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> found a more preferable therapeutic outcome, when combining acupuncture at the nape point with swallowing training as compared with different acupuncture sites.</p><p>According to TCM, three acupuncture points used at the same time (nape, scalp, and tongue) could &#x0201c;dredge the brain&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;activate the collaterals&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;enliven the mind&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;open the orifice&#x0201d;. As per dysphagia treatment, acupuncture not only stimulated the muscles related to swallowing activity; it also systematically up-tuned brain function through activation of the peripheral muscles. Some studies have suggested that acupuncture improved recovery of swallowing function. However, owing to their poor design, further studies are necessary. Subsequent studies should have a large sample size, and multiple study center locations to identify their reliability.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bibr26-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bibr27-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Thus far, acupuncture has been demonstrated to be a safe, effective, and inexpensive treatment without severely unfavorable outcomes; adverse effects that have been present could be subsequently improved.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bibr29-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the current study, only one patient complained of severe pain and two patients were observed to have localized edema; all had mild symptoms and improved rapidly in a few hours.</p><p>The central nervous system clearly showed flexibility and resilience.

Swallowing training can improve swallowing physiology and improve safety and tolerance, leading patients towards a less-restrictive diet.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Swallowing training has been regarded as an effective rehabilitation method and is widely used in clinical settings. Currently, swallowing training has been adopted as a basic rehabilitation method, with other therapeutic methods used as adjuvant treatments. Since every single treatment has its own limitations, growing evidence showed that a combination of acupuncture and swallowing training was a promising treatment option in neurorehabilitation, better than single intervention therapy for dysphagia.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bibr33-0269215515578698" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Our study found that the DOSS results correlated well with SSA scores. The VFSS assessment needed to be performed under radiation, and thus was not suitable for repeated tests within a short time period. SSA instead of a VFSS should be used if repeated assessment must be done in the short term to adjust therapy. The current study dynamically observed the recovery of swallowing function after stroke; it explored effective time, duration, and effective peak time, consequently helping to design rehabilitation strategy in clinical practices.</p><p>The current study had several limitations. A lack of an acupuncture control group might be the most significant flaw; establishment of a sham acupuncture control group would not meet requirements of the ethics committee. Low compliance did not allow us to set up a sham acupuncture control group. Although this study was not a double-blinded trial, the evaluator and statistical analyzers were blinded to reduce the bias and ensure the quality of this experiment. Most patients had spontaneous recovery of swallowing function; however, this group could not be excluded. In the current study, the small sample size and lack of multicenter involvement, along with short-term evaluation and follow-up, were factors impeding assessment of the long-term therapeutic effect and experiment consistency. Hence, there is room for improvement in future studies.</p><p>The current study was performed to explore a characteristic, standard, canonical, feasible, and easy-operated scheme to facilitate recovery of swallowing function in patients with dysphagia after stroke. We found that acupuncture in combination with swallowing training for patients with dysphagia after stroke was a therapeutic effect observed in the joint rehabilitation treatment.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215515578698" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical message</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215515578698"><list-item><p>The consecutive four-week treatment of acupuncture combined with standard swallowing training could effectively improve swallowing function, activities of daily living, and the quality of life in patients with dysphagia after stroke.
