stretching and stabilization exercises on muscle fatigue of the neck erector spine and
upper trapezius muscles. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were 26 healthy
university students (14 males and 12 females). Each subject was assigned randomly to each
of three study groups in order to prevent order effect. The three groups included in this
study were the no-exercise, stretching exercise, and neck stabilization exercise groups.
The median electromyographic frequency was used as a gauge of muscle fatigue. [Results]
Decreased muscle fatigue was demonstrated by an increase in the median electromyographic
frequency values in all the four muscle groups in the comparison between conditions 1 and
3. In particular, statistically significant differences were found between the two
conditions in the right upper trapezius muscle group. [Conclusion] These findings suggest
that the effect of stretching and stabilization exercises can reduce muscle fatigue in
mobile phone users.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mobile phone</kwd><kwd>Muscle fatigue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mobile phones are one of the most essential items in modern human life. Adult mobile phone
usage was found to be one of the most important means of communication in an international
study in 2007<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The rapid increase in the
frequency of use of mobile phones among adults can adversely affect various aspects of human
health, and numerous studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> have investigated
such adverse effects, particularly those focused on the neck and arms.</p><p>Kapandji<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that with a head
movement of 2.5&#x02005;cm, an additional weight of 0.4&#x02005;kg is imposed on the neck and upper body.
Greig et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that muscle
activity is maintained at a maximum of 5% according to video screen-displayed
electromyography (EMG) results from the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles.
Straker et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the neck
bends more when an individual is using a tablet with a relatively small screen than when the
individual is using a general desktop computer and that muscle activity during tablet use
increases in the shoulders and surrounding muscles. This is because video devices with small
screens require more bending of the neck (than devices with larger screens) when the
extensor digitorum muscles are activated to balance the neck during the lowered gaze,
increasing the load on the sternocleidomastoid muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accumulated long-term and severe fatigue can seriously affect human health<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such fatigue is an important component of
human health and can lead to musculoskeletal injuries and psychological issues. They may
become a major cause of neck pain, which is closely correlated to the degrees of fatigue and
tension. These injuries can lead to chronic neck pain, resulting in serious problems in job
performance unless proper treatment is provided.</p><p>Ylinen et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that stretching
exercises alleviate neck pain, thereby increasing the joint range of motion and contributing
to an increase in patient quality of life. However, Morgan and Proske<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that persistent muscle stretching can damage
muscle tissue, without much affecting joint range of motion. Furthermore, muscular strength
can be decreased immediately after stretching<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, without much increase in muscular strength<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies mainly focused on subjects with neck pain rather than on mobile phone
users. Thus, this study investigated the effects of stabilization exercises such as
stretching and neck exercises on the degree of muscle fatigue resulting from continuous use
of mobile phones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-six volunteers were enrolled in this study (14 males and 12 females).</p><p>All the subjects participated voluntarily and provided written informed consent.
Individuals with congenital (hereditary) handicaps, patients with surgical and neurological
histories, and patients with severe arm injuries were excluded. The subjects&#x02019; mean age was
20.1 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years; mean height, 165.5 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x02005;mm; and mean weight, 62.1 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x02005;kg. All test
protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Physical Therapy Faculty of Kangwon
National University.</p><p>The participants used their usual mobile phones in this study. They also used a TeleMyo
2400 direct transmission system for EMG (Noraxon Inc., AZ, USA) with a Noraxon Wi-Fi
transmitter to receive and collect surface EMG signals from the sternocleidomastoid and
upper trapezius muscles, which provide stability in the shoulder area during phone use<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this experiment, surface EMG of the cervical erector spinae and upper trapezius, in
which muscle activity increases during cell phone use, was performed during the
participants&#x02019; mobile phone use<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
electrode for measuring the activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscles was attached on a
spot 2&#x02005;cm from cervical vertebra 4 (C4)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the electrode for measuring the
activity of the upper trapezius muscles was attached on a spot slightly outside the midpoint
between cervical vertebra 7 (C7) and the protruding peaks of the shoulder bones<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. To prevent unnecessary noise during the
EMG measurement, the contact area selected was cleaned with alcohol before attaching the
surface electrode to the skin. The reference voluntary contraction (RVC) method was used to
quantify the EMG values. The EMG signals were collected while the subject was holding 1&#x02005;kg
of dumbbells in both hands, with the subject&#x02019;s hands spread out 90&#x000b0; apart on the wing bone
plane, with the subject maintaining the position for 15 seconds. The mean values during the
5 seconds were used as RVC values<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study involved repeated, randomized, crossover experiments with the participants in
each group and a comparison of the resulting values. The experiments conducted were divided
into three different conditions and conducted on different days. On day 1, the participants
used a mobile phone without any intervention to minimize the effects of fatigue from the
previous experiment (condition 1). On day 2, the participants did some stretching exercises
before using a mobile phone and the measurements were taken while the participants were
using their phones (condition 2). On day 3, the participants performed stabilization
exercises before phone use (condition 3). These experiments were conducted in random order
to avoid order effects.</p><p>To equalize all the participants&#x02019; starting positions before the measurement, the
participants were told to sit comfortably with their hip and knee joints bent at 90&#x000b0; and
their feet flat on the floor. Furthermore, they were told to raise their mobile phones up to
the level of their clavicle, with their elbow bent to avoid excessive bending of the waist.
Once phone use began, they were told to focus on their mobile phone use and ignore their
neck and waist positions.</p><p>The experimental conditions were as follows: Under condition 1 (the reference group), EMG
was performed for 10 minutes while the participants were using the phone without any
intervention. Under condition 2 (which included stretching exercises), the participants
engaged in a stretching exercise program that was modified from the training method used by
Lee and Yoo<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants performed
passive stretching exercises in five motions for 10 seconds, each with an upright and fixed
posture, as follows: bending forward with the neck pulled forward while standing upright,
leaning backward, bending left and right, and turning the neck. Each session was implemented
in two sets. Breaks were provided for 10 seconds between the sessions and 5 minutes between
the sets. After the stretching exercises, the participants had a 1-minute break before EMG
was performed for 10 minutes while they were using a mobile phone.</p><p>Under condition 3 (which included stabilization exercises), the participants engaged in a
stabilization exercise program that was modified from the training method used by Hur<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises enhance the muscular
strength of the long neck and long head muscles (cardiac muscles), and involve the following
five motions: isometric contraction exercises for 10 seconds without moving the neck before
returning back to the starting position, neck bending exercises in the supine position, neck
stretching and greater pectoral muscle stretching exercises in the supine position, upper
back muscle-enhancing exercises while lying face down, placing both thumbs underneath the
chin while sitting, and leaning against the wall in a standing upright position with the
chin pulled in. Five sessions were implemented for 10 seconds each for two sets in total,
and breaks were allowed for 10 seconds between the sessions and 5 minutes between the sets.
After the stabilization exercises, the participants had a 1-minute break before EMG was
performed for 10 minutes while they were using their mobile phones.</p><p>Descriptive data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD values. Testing of all variables using the
one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that they were all normally distributed. A
repeated one-way analysis of variance determined the significance of temperature differences
between the upright sitting position and sitting with the legs crossed. Scheffe&#x02019;s test was
conducted as a post hoc test to determine the significance of differences. Statistical
analysis was performed by using SPSS 21.0, and a significance level of p=0.05 was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The three conditions were defined as follows: the day the participants used a mobile phone

decreased fatigue between conditions 1 and 3 was demonstrated by the increase in the median
frequency values in all the four muscle groups included in the comparison. In particular,
statistically significant differences were found between conditions 1 and 3 in the right
upper trapezius muscle group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Stretching and stabilization exercises are simple and economic programs that anybody can
try. However, researchers disagree about their effectiveness, and few studies have compared
and analyzed how such exercises when performed prior to using a mobile phone can affect neck
and shoulder fatigue.</p><p>Thus, this study compared and analyzed the effects of stretching and stabilization
exercises before mobile phone use on neck and shoulder muscle fatigue, and further
investigated the methods for preventing fatigue induced by mobile phone use. Muscle activity
and median EMG frequency values were used to measure fatigue. Previous studies mentioned
three methods for measuring median frequency values as follows: the isometric contraction
method, the &#x0201c;comparison of reference activity&#x0201d; method, and joint analysis of EMG amplitude
and spectrum<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study used the
&#x0201c;comparison of reference activity&#x0201d; method to obtain the median frequency values.</p><p>As a result, fatigue decreased in all the four muscle groups when the participants used
their mobile phones without any intervention (condition 1). Furthermore, when the
participants performed stabilization exercises before phone use (condition 3), fatigue
decreased in all the four muscle groups. In particular, statistically significant
differences were found at the right upper trapezius muscle group between conditions 1 and 3
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The reasons for these results are as follows: stretching exercises increase the
inner pressure of the muscles through mild muscle contraction. The rhythmic contraction or
mild pressure of the muscles accelerates intravenous blood flow and increases blood
circulation, which can improve blood flow and remove fatigue-causing substances<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neck stabilization exercises had positive
effects on the deep neck muscles and increased muscular strength and endurance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study has the following limitations: First, the results cannot be generalized to all
age groups, as the participants were limited to adult males and females in their twenties.
Second, the number of participants was too small to apply the results to the general
population. Third, this study investigated only the short-term effects (i.e., one-time
stretching and stabilization exercises), excluding the long-term effects, of stretching and
stabilization exercises. Lastly, all the study participants were right-handed. However, the
correlation between the dominant hand and decreased muscle fatigue was not investigated. In
the future, diverse age groups and a greater number of participants, as well as the
inclusion of adult males and females in their twenties, need to be considered. Furthermore,
detailed studies are needed to compare the variations in changes in muscle fatigue that
occur over a longer intervention period and to investigate the correlation between the use
of the dominant hand and decreased muscle fatigue. As the potential effects of stretching
and stabilization exercises on muscle fatigue and other conditions are great, efforts are
needed in the future to secure an identical external environment and a sufficient number of
target subjects by using more quantitative and controlled methods that integrate with other
factors.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kenichi</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Examining the adverse effects of mobile phone use among
