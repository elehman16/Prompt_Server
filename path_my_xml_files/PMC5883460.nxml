If the bacteria remain in the cavity preparation, recurrent caries might occur.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Even, despite good seal, bacteria might be able to replicate. Bacterial growth under the restoration leads to an increase in tooth sensitivity, a decrease in its strength, recurrent caries,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and inflammation and necrosis of the pulp.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The use of disinfectant solutions such as chlorhexidine (CHX) is an alternative method to reduce or eliminate bacteria from cavity preparations.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have described the relationship between dentin collagen hybrid bond layer degradation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after their release by etch-and-rinse (pH &#x02264; 4.5)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and self-etch adhesives[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that can reduce the bond strength over time.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It results in the creation of secondary caries and marginal discoloration, and ultimately in restoration failure.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>MMP activation is mediated by binding of Zn ion to N-terminal branches. However, in two cases and by some inhibitors of the activation, function has been impaired, which might be attributed to the following reasons: (1) other enzymes and ions compete with Zn ion and hence deactivation occurs and (2) by increasing the amount of Zn ion, the other binding sites that are less likely to be activated are occupied by zinc, and by deforming the space, MMP activity is inhibited.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Hitherto, the inhibitory effects of CHX, zinc, galardin, and others on MMPs activity have been studied. In addition, CHX can inhibit the activation of dentin MMPs even at low concentrations.</p><p>Osorio <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated the effect of zinc on MMPs and deduced that zinc oxide nanoparticle, in combination with the etch-and-rinse adhesives such as single bond (SB), has the best inhibitory effect on the MMP activity, with no deleterious effect on the microtensile bond strength. Leitune <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] indicated that short applications of CHX at low concentrations prevent hybrid layer degradation and positively affect bond strength over time.</p><p>Alaghemand <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] evaluated the inhibitory effect of CHX and zinc nanoparticles on the degradation of collagen scaffolds, and in this study, we investigated the effect of CHX and zinc nanoparticles on the microshear bond strength of a fifth-generation adhesive after etching. Anti-MMP benefits of ethanol-wet-bonding were also assessed and confirmed by Sadek <italic>et al</italic>. in comparison with the use of CHX that is a nonspecific anti-MMP agent.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The null hypotheses examined were (1) the effect of CHX and zinc nanoparticles separately and simultaneously on the microshear bond strength to dentin after acid etching with a fifth-generation adhesive is different between the test groups and is different from the control group as well. (2) adhesive failure after application of CHX and zinc nanoparticles individually and simultaneously to etched dentin is different between the test groups and is different from the control group as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Tooth preparation</title><p>Forty extracted human molar teeth with no caries and no visible anatomical defects were selected.

Therefore, the first and second null hypotheses were rejected.</p><p>The comparison of groups in two subgroups with and without thermocycling showed neither significant differences between the experimental groups themselves nor between these groups and the control group, which can be explained by the effect of CHX as a broad-spectrum disinfecting agent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] When CHX is applied on the prepared tooth surface after acid etching, it is not washed off, and the adhesives are applied, and then, the procedure is continued. It has the potential to bind to both organic and inorganic components of the dentin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] CHX binds to hydroxyapatite (inorganic component) of dentin, which is believed to be mediated by the formation of a phosphate salt that leads to an increase in the surface energy of dentin, thus enhancing the dentin wetting ability of primers. The interaction of CHX with the organic component of dentin is believed to be mediated by binding to Type I collagen.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The binding of CHX to the dentin matrix component is probably the best way for CHX to inhibit collagen bond proteases[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] such as MMPs 2, 8, and 9.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] CHX is an effective synthetic MMP inhibitor even in low concentrations (0.02%&#x02013;0.0001%).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] At low concentrations, the inhibitory effect of CHX on MMPs is thought to be related to a cation-chelating mechanism, wherein the sequestration of metal ion, such as zinc, would hamper the activation of the catalytic domains within MMPs.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Notwithstanding the MMP inhibitory effect of CHX seems to be dose-dependent,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and at high concentrations, it may likely inactivate MMPs by enzyme denaturation rather than by chelation of cation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] <italic>In vitro</italic>[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] studies have shown that CHX has a beneficial effect on the preservation of dentin-resin bonds. The use of CHX (0.12%) mouthwash to rub on the preparation might seem to be the most immediate way to treat self-etch dentin bonds. Since CHX (0.12%) (Peridex, 3M, USA) has a routine use in dental offices and for dentistry patients, we decided to use this CHX concentration applying it before bonding in etch-and-rinse adhesives.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>According to this study, amounts of bond strength in CHX group (Group C) (with and without thermocycling) were less than control group (Group A) but did not have statistically significant differences. This is showing that using of CHX (0.12%) after acid etching in SB 2 adhesive has no effect on bond strength. This is hit off Soaresc's study.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The zinc ion has also an inhibitory effect on the MMP activation, in a manner similar to CHX. By increasing the amount of Zn ion, binding sites are occupied by zinc, resulting in the spatial deformation and finally inhibiting MMP activity. A determining factor in the efficacy of nanoparticles in improving microshear bond strength is their dispersion quality in the matrices. A proper distribution of ZnO element is observed in the Map-EDX [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>], which is an indicator of relatively homogeneous distribution of the NZO in the adhesive.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The Map-energy dispersive X-ray of cured adhesive containing 10 wt% of nano zinc oxide, which indicates a relatively homogeneous distribution of nano zinc oxide in the adhesive</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJD-12-105-g005"/></fig><p>Osorio <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] evaluated the collagen degradation and bond strengths using SB adhesive containing NZO (etch-and-rinse) versus Clearfil self-etching primer (self-etch adhesive) for 24 h and 1 and 4 weeks, concluding that Zn-doping of SB resin inhibited and stabilized collagen degradation at the hybrid layer (up to 4 weeks) and did not affect 24-h bond strength, but increased bond stability of SB after 3 months. In the Osorio's study, dentin beam was immersed for 8 h in a zinc-containing resin bonding agent. In this study, we applied NZO-containing bonding agent according to the manufacturer's instructions to simulate the clinical steps.</p><p>ZnO is an amphoteric oxide although it normally exhibits basic properties. It is nearly insoluble in water and alcohol but is soluble in and degraded by acids. Small size particles of ZnO were selected to induce the highest interfibrillar infiltration. The high solubility of ZnO when combined with acid could also account for the effective release of zinc ions at the resin-dentin interface.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In this study, bond strength in group with ZnO especially with thermocycling was a little better than group with CHX that was showing using of ZnO had no effect on bond strength. Nevertheless because ZnO was added to SB 2 adhesive, Group B (with ZnO) had clinically working steps less than CHX group that this is better.</p><p>Thermocycling is one broadly used artificial aging methodology, and in this study, we evaluated the effect of aging on the long-term performance of the bond; half of the samples were thermocycled and the other half was not. The results indicated no significant differences between the above circumstances.</p><p>Some studies have shown that during thermocycling, the specimens are subjected to thermal changes and also additional exposure to water.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Thermal stresses generate mechanical stresses by differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and can result in bond failure at the tooth&#x02013;restoration interface. The main cause for the reduction in bond strength is believed to be the possible effect of hydrolysis at bonding interfaces.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Consistent with a study by Titley <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] our study indicated that the shear bond strength of SB was not significantly affected by thermocycling. The positive effect of CHX and NZO separately and simultaneously on the microshear bond strength did not result in a decrease in bond strength after thermocycling. In the evaluation of failure, cohesive failure was dominant in all the groups. The cohesive failures of bonding agents are often associated with high bond strength values, indicating effective bonding.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] These findings are in line with the fact that thermocycling has no deleterious effect on the bond strength.</p><p>Various studies[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have suggested that acid etching is one way of activation of MMPs. Mazzoni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in a study with conflicting results stated that high acidity of phosphoric acid might lead to denaturation of the MMPs. Perhaps, that is why the use of CHX and NZO before and after thermocycling had no effect on the microshear bond strength. It is advised to investigate CHX with more concentration and NZO simultaneously in a fifth-generation adhesive for more evaluation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
