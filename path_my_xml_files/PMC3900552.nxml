However, this effect may diminish during prolonged use. We compared the effects of prolonged and intermittent stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor on gastric emptying and glycemia. Ten healthy men received intravenous saline (placebo) or GLP-1 (0.8 pmol/kg &#x022c5; min), as a continuous 24-h infusion (&#x0201c;prolonged&#x0201d;), two 4.5-h infusions separated by 20 h (&#x0201c;intermittent&#x0201d;), and a 4.5-h infusion (&#x0201c;acute&#x0201d;) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Gastric emptying of a radiolabeled mashed potato meal was measured using scintigraphy. Acute GLP-1 markedly slowed gastric emptying. The magnitude of the slowing was attenuated with prolonged but maintained with intermittent infusions. GLP-1 potently diminished postprandial glycemia during acute and intermittent regimens. These observations suggest that short-acting GLP-1 agonists may be superior to long-acting agonists when aiming specifically to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute administration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) to healthy humans, and patients with type 2 diabetes, lowers blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin, suppressing glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric emptying (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). GLP-1 agonists have been incorporated into standard algorithms to treat hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, and while the objective of these treatment regimens is to reduce glycemia safely (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the importance of specifically targeting postprandial glycemia is increasingly being recognized (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).

In this study, the delay in gastric emptying of a liquid meal was reported to be diminished after administration of intravenous GLP-1 for 270 min compared with 30 min (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), but methodological limitations included the use of a suboptimal dye dilution technique to quantify gastric emptying and the provision of a second meal only 4 h after the first, with potential for incomplete emptying of the first meal or ongoing nutrient stimulation of the small intestine to influence the disposition of the second meal. Furthermore, this previous study did not evaluate the effect of intermittent GLP-1 receptor stimulation, which is of substantial clinical relevance.</p><p>We undertook the current study to determine accurately whether tachyphylaxis to the effect of GLP-1 on gastric emptying occurs rapidly and affects postprandial glycemia.

It remains to be determined whether effects on gastric emptying would be further attenuated with receptor stimulation beyond 24 h.</p><p>It remains uncertain why there is tachyphylaxis to the effect of GLP-1 to slow gastric emptying and not to the islet cell effects, but there is limited evidence to suggest a role for vagal pathways (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It should be recognized that the test meal had a substantial carbohydrate and calorie content and that potentially the magnitude of attenuation of the slowing of gastric emptying by exogenous GLP-1 may be influenced by meal composition (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Other potential limitations are that we chose to study healthy volunteers in order to minimize potential confounding by marked hyperglycemia (which is itself known to slow gastric emptying) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), autonomic neuropathy (which may influence the effects of GLP-1 on the proximal stomach) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and the potential for abnormally slow gastric emptying at baseline (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The latter variable may be particularly important, as the capacity for GLP-1 to slow gastric emptying is dependent on the underlying rate of emptying (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Aside from these factors, it is anticipated that patients with type 2 diabetes would respond similarly to healthy subjects, but this is not assured (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The clinical relevance of our study will require confirmatory studies comparing GLP-1 agonists in type 2 patients that have problematic postprandial glycemic excursions, particularly in those with normal, or rapid, gastric emptying. While long-acting agonists may have greater potency to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> in unselected patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the use of an isotope breath test to measure gastric emptying has the potential to determine whether short-acting agonists may be more appropriate for a particular patient (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Such an approach would, however, need to evaluate postprandial effects against any potential worsening of preprandial glycemia (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, there is a marked attenuation of the magnitude of slowing of gastric emptying with prolonged compared with intermittent stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor in health, supporting the concept of rapid tachyphylaxis. Moreover, the reduction in postprandial glycemia induced by GLP-1 is dependent on the magnitude of slowing of emptying. These data suggest that the choice of GLP-1 agonist for a given patient should be based on the relative importance of targeting postprandial glycemia for an individual patient.</p></sec>
