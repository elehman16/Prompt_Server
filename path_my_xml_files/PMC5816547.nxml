Evidence suggests that feedback fails to increase accuracy of professional perceptions about clinical performance, which likely reduces audit and feedback effectiveness. This study investigates health professionals&#x02019; perceptions about their clinical performance and the influence of feedback on their intentions to change practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">We conducted an online laboratory experiment guided by Control Theory with 72 intensive care professionals from 21&#x000a0;units. For each of four new pain management indicators, we collected professionals&#x02019; perceptions about their clinical performance; peer performance; targets; and improvement intentions before and after receiving first-time feedback. An electronic audit and feedback dashboard provided ICU&#x02019;s own performance, median and top 10% peer performance, and improvement recommendations. The experiment took place approximately 1&#x000a0;month before units enrolled into a cluster-randomised trial assessing the impact of adding a toolbox with suggested actions and materials to improve intensive care pain management. During the experiment, the toolbox was inaccessible; all participants accessed the same version of the dashboard.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">We analysed 288 observations. In 53.8%, intensive care professionals overestimated their clinical performance; but in only 13.5%, they underestimated it. On average, performance was overestimated by 22.9% (on a 0&#x02013;100% scale). Professionals similarly overestimated peer performance, and set targets 20.3% higher than the top performance benchmarks. In 68.4% of cases, intentions to improve practice were consistent with actual gaps in performance, even before professionals had received feedback; which increased to 79.9% after receiving feedback (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.53 to 3.78). However, in 56.3% of cases, professionals still wanted to improve care aspects at which they were already top performers. Alternatively, in 8.3% of cases, they lacked improvement intentions because they did not consider indicators important; did not trust the data; or deemed benchmarks unrealistic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">Audit and feedback helps health professionals to work on aspects for which improvement is recommended. Given the abundance of professionals&#x02019; prior good improvement intentions, the limited effects typically found by audit and feedback studies are likely predominantly caused by barriers to translation of intentions into actual change in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>

A Cochrane review of 140 A&#x00026;F studies concluded that feedback is effective, but with only a median 4.3% absolute improvement (interquartile range 0.5 to 16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The reasons behind this limited and variable effect are only partially understood, and further research into the underlying mechanisms through which A&#x00026;F brings about change is needed to increase its effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">A&#x00026;F is thought to work because it improves the accuracy with which health professionals self-assess their performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. If they make a negative assessment of their clinical performance by comparing their performance to a target, professionals will develop intentions to improve practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, those informed by A&#x00026;F may be better able to focus their time and resources available for quality improvement more efficiently on those care aspects that need it most. However, previous studies have shown that feedback messages are rejected when recipients do not trust the data, disagree with benchmarks, consider improvement unfeasible, or do not consider the clinical topic an important aspect of care quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. An empirical study showed that health professionals ignored between a third and half of the improvement recommendations when confronted with feedback on multiple quality indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This may indicate that health professionals already have certain perceptions about their clinical performance before receiving feedback, and that many times, feedback fails to change those perceptions. In turn, this potentially prevents professionals from developing intentions to improve their practice even if improvement is recommended, or, leads to retaining intentions to improve while there may not be room for improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We refer to this problem as the information&#x02013;intention gap. Intentions are essential for initiating behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A lack of correspondence between health professionals&#x02019; intended improvement targets and recommended improvement targets may therefore play an important role in explaining the limited effects of A&#x00026;F interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">We designed a theory-based experiment to investigate health professionals&#x02019; perceptions about their clinical performance and the influence of feedback on their intentions to change clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical framework</title><p id="Par16">Our theoretical framework which we based on Control Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is published in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It assumes that health professionals continuously self-assess their clinical performance by comparing their performance to a target. If they make a negative assessment (i.e. perceived clinical performance &#x0003c; target), the theory predicts that health professionals will develop intentions to take improvement actions and continue these actions until their performance matches or exceeds the target. However, if they observe a discrepancy that is too great, or lack the skills or knowledge on how to improve, recipients may disregard the discrepancy or lower their target to make it more achievable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A&#x00026;F may influence professionals&#x02019; improvement intentions by changing their underlying perceptions about their own performance and the appropriateness of targets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par17">The study was a laboratory experiment conducted with individual health professionals working in Dutch intensive care units. It was part of a larger study involving a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in which teams received periodic feedback on four newly developed pain management indicators through an online interactive dashboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The cRCT aimed to assess the impact of adding a toolbox with suggested actions and materials to improve intensive care pain management (registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> with reference NCT02922101). The laboratory experiment used an adapted version of the dashboard to elicit the individual professionals&#x02019; clinical performance perceptions and improvement intentions before and after receiving first-time feedback (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It took place approximately 1&#x000a0;month before enrolling into the cRCT. During the experiment, the toolbox was inaccessible; all participants accessed the same version of the dashboard. Users logging into the dashboard for the first time automatically started the experiment. The study protocol has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is summarised below.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study flow. Measured and delivered variables for each of four indicators and outcome measures. We collected 288 observations (4 indicators &#x000d7; 72 ICU professionals). *We considered an intention to be at odds with Control Theory if participants had no intention despite a negative self-assessment (i.e. perceived performance &#x0003c; target) or they had improvement intention despite a positive self-assessment (i.e. perceived ICU performance &#x02265; target)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2018_727_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par18">We invited all 83 intensive care professionals who were members of the local quality improvement teams from all 21 ICUs participating in the trial. Personalised invitation emails were sent with up to two reminders. Teams usually consisted of three to five members and included intensivists, nurses, and managers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention description</title><p id="Par19">The dashboard provides feedback on four pain management indicators (screenshot available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The indicator set was recently developed in close collaboration with ICU professionals using an extensive rating and consensus procedure. For each indicator, the dashboard lists the performance score achieved by the ICU (e.g. percentage of patients per shift whose pain is measured), the median score of all participating ICUs, the average score achieved by the top 10% best performing ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and a performance assessment represented by a &#x02018;traffic light&#x02019; coloured icon; all calculated over the most recent 3&#x000a0;months. Green icons (good performance) are assigned to performance scores above or slightly under the top 10% peer performance. If not green, yellow icons (room for improvement) are assigned to scores above or slightly under the median peer performance; red icons (improvement recommended) are assigned otherwise (for the precise thresholds for assigning icons we refer to the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). From the dashboard overview, users can drill down to see detailed performance information, using trend charts displaying their own and peer past performance over time, performance scores grouped by most relevant patient subgroups (e.g. only surgical patients; only patients during night shifts), and lists of individual patient numbers with an indication whether or not the indicator was violated during a shift. Additional static information about the indicators are available to users, namely, their operationalisation, goal, relation to quality, definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, type (process or outcome), and unit of observation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par20">Data collection took place in two steps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the first step, the description of the four indicators and their static information were presented, but measured performance information was withheld. Participants were asked to estimate for each indicator their own ICU&#x02019;s performance score (perceived clinical performance; range 0&#x02013;100%) and the average score across Dutch ICUs (perceived peer performance; range 0&#x02013;100%); fill out the minimum performance score they would consider &#x02018;good&#x02019; performance (target; range 0&#x02013;100%); and whether or not they would perform actions to improve upon the selected indicator (intention to improve practice; range yes/no). If the underlying Control Theory hypothesis was violated (e.g. negative self-assessment but no intention to improve), participants were asked to explain their choice using a predefined list of reasons or in free text (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The provided predefined reasons were developed guided by theoretical behaviour change frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In the second step, participants were additionally exposed to all detailed performance information for the indicators including their own current performance score; own past performance scores; and the median and top 10% peer performance scores. Like in step 1, participants were asked&#x02014;but this time based on the information at hand&#x02014;what their performance target was (range; 0&#x02013;100%) and if they intended to improve practice (range yes/no). If improvement intentions did not correspond with the improvement recommendation presented in the dashboard (e.g. room for improvement but no intention to improve), participants were again asked to explain their choice using the same list of predefined reasons as in step 1, extended with three reasons relating to feedback rejection (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) or free text.</p><p id="Par22">Finally, if there were discrepancies between improvement intentions in the first and second step (e.g. initially participants did not develop intention to improve on a specific indicator, but after receiving feedback they did), participants were asked what feedback elements drove them to change (measured performance score were higher/lower than expected; benchmarks were higher/lower than expected; there was a green/yellow/red icon; other [free text]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par23">The primary outcome was the proportion of improvement intentions set by participants that corresponded with the improvement recommendations. We considered an improvement intention to correspond with the recommendation when a participant reported an intention to improve upon an indicator with room for improvement (i.e. red or yellow icon), or had no intention to improve an indicator without room for improvement (i.e. green icon). Secondary outcomes were the difference between perceived clinical performance (before receiving feedback) and measured performance; difference between performance targets set by participants (before receiving feedback) and the external targets determined by the feedback; change in performance targets after receiving feedback; and reasons for not intending to improve on indicators despite a negative self-assessment (i.e. perceived clinical performance &#x0003c; target) and vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par24">Descriptive statistics were calculated as appropriate for all variables of interest. We compared performance scores and targets chosen by participants (i.e. perceived clinical performance; perceived peer performance; target) to those that resulted from the audit (i.e. actual clinical performance; median peer performance; external target [top 10% peer performance]), and calculated Pearson&#x02019;s correlations. We used <italic>t</italic> tests to test whether the differences were significant. To assess the influence of feedback on the correspondence of participants&#x02019; improvement intentions with the improvement recommendations we used mixed-effects logistic regression analysis, using a binary &#x02018;feedback received&#x02019; covariate. We added a random intercept for &#x02018;participating professional&#x02019; to adjust for correlations between repeated observations within participants, added random intercepts for &#x02018;ICU&#x02019;, and &#x02018;quality indicator&#x02019; to adjust for clustering effects within ICUs and around quality indicators. We additionally assessed whether clinical performance perceptions and improvement intentions differed between professional roles (i.e. nurses, intensivists, managers, or others) for each quality indicator (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p id="Par25">Seventy-two individual professionals (response rate, 87%) from all 21 intensive care units accepted our invitation and participated in the laboratory experiment.

Professionals also overestimated peer performance and set their targets much higher than the external targets used in this study. In 81.6% of cases, professionals&#x02019; improvement intentions could be predicted by Control Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] based on the performance self-assessments professionals had made by comparing their perceived performance score to their target. Already 68.4% of those intentions corresponded with the improvement recommendations even before they had received feedback on their clinical performance; which further increased to 79.9% after receiving feedback. The feedback made it more than twice as likely that professionals&#x02019; intentions followed the improvement recommendations. Our findings therefore seem to confirm that feedback increases the accuracy with which health professionals self-assess their performance; which is the principal hypothesised mechanism through which A&#x00026;F is thought to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">The intensive care professionals attributed changes in their intentions particularly to the performance score they received, not to the median or top 10% peer performance benchmarks. This suggests that professionals did adopt new insights about their own performance, but less so about appropriate performance targets. Although professionals in this study did slightly downward adjust their targets based on the feedback they received, they still set them higher than the top 10% peer performance. As a result participants had the intention to improve half of the cases in which they were already top performers. Although improvement could still be achievable, setting reasonable targets should help professionals to prioritise their improvement activities. Study periods in A&#x00026;F trials are often limited, and health professionals typically have to choose between multiple care aspects to focus on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many hypotheses exist about how performance comparators may trigger more reactions to the feedback, such as using achievable benchmarks instead of medians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At the moment, there is conflicting evidence about this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and our results demonstrate that intensive care professionals often aim for something higher regardless of which comparator is delivered.</p><p id="Par36">In 8.3% of cases, intensive care professionals had no intention to improve upon quality indicators for which the feedback recommended improvement. In comparison, in a similar experiment in cardiac rehabilitation, professionals ignored one third of the cases for which the feedback recommended improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The difference might relate to the cognitive load for health professionals which was smaller in the current study in terms of the number and variety of targeted behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and other differences in design and content of the feedback. In our study, professionals rejected feedback because they considered some quality indicators as not an important aspect of intensive care, did not trust the measured own performance score, or considered the benchmarks unrealistic.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par37">The principal strength of our study is the extensive use of Control Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] as a basis for our study design. Although there is growing recognition that theory should play a central role in the design and evaluation of A&#x00026;F interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], explicit use of theory remains scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We tested the hypothesis that A&#x00026;F increases the correspondence between health professionals&#x02019; intentions and improvement recommendations; this hypothesis is typically assumed to be true in A&#x00026;F studies but has not, to the best of our knowledge, been evaluated empirically. Which threshold is used to determine such recommendations is a design choice to be made by A&#x00026;F designers; in this study, we used top 10% peer performance. Using a different target would lead to a different correspondence between intentions and recommendations. However, it would unlikely affect the relationship we found between providing the feedback and professionals changing their intentions.</p><p id="Par38">The generalisability of our findings with respect to health professionals&#x02019; improvement intentions may be limited due to the clinical topic and setting, namely pain management in ICUs. ICU professionals traditionally work in a data-rich environment and are early adopters of A&#x00026;F systems. This could have resulted in our participants being more experienced and set higher targets than health professionals from other domains. At the same time the extent to which indicators are under ICU professionals&#x02019; control may differ between professionals. For example, performing pain measurements is typically a nursing task, while intervening to achieve acceptable pain scores falls under the responsibility of intensivists. Therefore, participants might have estimated their ICU&#x02019;s performance more accurately and set more informed targets if we would have asked them to respond as a team. The fact that we found no significant differences in performance estimations or improvement intentions between professional roles for any of the indicators might reflect the strong team mentality and shared responsibilities in ICU patient care. As this might be different in other settings, it is however a pertinent point to consider whether feedback actually reaches the health professionals whose behaviour is targeted for change and whether the recommendations arising from the feedback make it clear who is responsible for taking action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">We developed the dashboard carefully considering the latest evidence, theory, and design suggestions and involved intensive care professionals in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This likely contributed to the fact that in 91.7% of cases, feedback convinced participants to change practice. The indicator set was developed in close collaboration with experts and pilot tested to ensure that the indicators are consistent with professionals&#x02019; goals and priorities and under their control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It seems however inevitable that some professionals have concerns about the importance of certain indicators. Lack of trust in data quality, often identified as a barrier to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], might in this study have particularly related to the perception that the targeted behaviour is performed in practice (e.g. patients&#x02019; pain is measured each shift) but not recorded electronically. We undertook various data quality assurance efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and provided patient-level data and subgroup analyses to increase transparency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More intensive measures might be required to ensure professionals recognise the importance of indicators and trust in the data, e.g. through verbal feedback and when feedback is discussed by teams rather than individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition we delivered multiple performance comparators to prevent benchmarks being perceived as unrealistically high; namely median, top 10% peer performance, and own past performance. Delivering multiple comparators is at odds with recent suggestions for A&#x00026;F design because it could create ambiguity in what should be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our findings however show that multiple comparators worked well despite possible ambiguities. To reduce ambiguity, we delivered traffic light colour-coded benchmark comparisons.</p><p id="Par40">We conducted our study with intensive care professionals in a laboratory setting shortly before enrolment in a cRCT in which they received feedback on the four new pain management indicators for the first time. By aligning the experiment with the cRCT, we were able to deliver professionals&#x02019; real clinical performance data and obtain a high response rate of nearly 90%, while using the same dashboard and data collection methods. Laboratory experiments in the field of A&#x00026;F are scarce but enable a great opportunity to gain detailed insights into professionals&#x02019; decision making that allows us to advance implementation science while reducing research waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Unanswered questions and future research</title><p id="Par41">Given the great presence of health professionals&#x02019; intentions to improve the care they provide, the limited effectiveness often found in A&#x00026;F studies is likely the result of barriers to translating intentions into actual change in clinical practice. Future research should focus on overcoming those barriers, and less so on convincing professionals to improve practice. The cRCT following the current study will (1) reveal whether teams target less indicators for improvement in practice, e.g. due to prioritisation or resource limitations, and (2) determine the effectiveness of augmenting the dashboard with an action implementation toolbox to address the gap between intentions and actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">Health professionals often overestimate their clinical performance and rarely underestimate it. In addition, they are typically optimistic about the performance of peers and achievable targets. Nevertheless, their prior intentions to improve practice often already correspond to actual gaps in clinical performance. Feedback further increases this correspondence because it allows professionals to self-assess their performance more accurately. However, professionals still have a tendency to want to improve upon care aspects at which they are already top performers. In a tenth of cases, professionals lack improvement intentions because they do not consider some indicators an essential aspect of care quality, do not trust the data, or deem the benchmarks unrealistic. Given the abundance of health professionals&#x02019; good improvement intentions, it is likely that the limited effects typically found by audit and feedback studies are predominantly caused by barriers to translation of intentions into actual change in clinical practice. Interventions should focus on overcoming those barriers, and less so on convincing professionals to improve practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>

The analyses show that this is however not the case; which might be explained by the shared responsibility for patient care and close collaboration in quality teams in intensive care units in comparison to general wards.
