In this study, we also evaluated the duration of examination and the acceptability of the instrument according to the patient and the physiotherapist.

Patients were recruited within the acute, post-acute, and long-term-care gerontology unit of University Hospital of Nice (Nice, France). The study was approved by the South Mediterranean V Ethical Review Board (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud M&#x000e9;dit&#x000e9;rrann&#x000e9;e V), as well as by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM). Patients who agreed to participate gave their written informed consent.</p><p>Included patients were 65 years or older and had received a physiotherapy prescription from the physiotherapists of Department of Geriatrics mentioning the need for a passive joint assessment. Patients who agreed to participate had to be covered by social insurance. Exclusion criteria were: patients suffering from a pathology for which heating of joints was contraindicated; patients wearing a pacemaker, a metallic prosthesis, or osteosynthesis equipment located less than 10 cm from the captor; patients incapable of maintaining a straight wrist position and/or a neutral shoulder position; and patients having a joint deviation in flexion, extension, pronation or supination of less than 20&#x000b0;.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and randomization</title><p>Patients were pre-recruited during weekly physiotherapy sessions at the Department of Geriatrics. Due to organizational constraints, a maximum of six patients per week were included. An explanation of the study and an associated pamphlet were given to the patients by the physician responsible for the study, with a 7-day retraction delay. The inclusion visit began with signing of consent and was led by the physician after those 7 days.</p><p>At the end of the inclusion visit, an inclusion form was completed by the physician. This form included the first and last name of the patient and the confirmation of all inclusion and non-inclusion criteria. Then, this form was forwarded to a clinical research assistant of the Clinical Research and Innovation Department (DRCI), who randomly assigned the patients. The randomization was centralized at the methodological center and done in a 1:1 ratio. The generation of the allocation sequence was made with number permutation tables in block sizes of six. Consequently, among six patients, three were allocated to room A and three were allocated to room B, and so on. All patients were examined successively in both rooms. Furthermore, in room A, the running order on both instruments (MP-BV and inclinimeter) was also randomized. Physiotherapists were also randomly assigned to room A or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cia-10-491">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials used for the measures</title><p>The MotionPod is a patented hardware solution for motion sensing that features a state-of-the-art miniaturized motion-sensing microelectromechanical system. It contains three-axis accelerometers, three-axis magnetometers, and three-axis gyroscopes in a compelling form factor the size of a standard wristwatch (33&#x000d7;21&#x000d7;15 mm [1.3&#x000d7;0.8&#x000d7;0.6&#x02033;]) and weighs 14 g (0.5 oz). The battery was a 150 mAh Li-ion polymer technology battery with a battery life of 6 hours and a charging duration of 2&#x02013;3 hours (500 charging cycles). The device is worn by a patient by way of a bracelet attached to the mechanical interface. The sampling rate for accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers was adjustable between 25 and 200 Hz with 12-bit resolution. The information from the MotionPod was transferred via radio waves to the MotionPod controller, which was linked to a computer with a USB cable. The wireless band ranged from 10 m (30 feet) to 30 m (100 feet), depending on the environment, with a frequency band of 2.4 Ghz. The measurement range was a full 360&#x000b0;. The fusion of data from accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes was done with an application programming interface developed by Movea. Then, data were delivered by the BioVal software to the practitioner as yaw, pitch, roll, quaternion, or rotation matrix. The resolution was 0.5&#x000b0; for static accuracy and 1&#x000b0; for dynamic accuracy.</p><p>The inclinometer used as reference was the Baseline<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Bubble inclinometer (Fabrication Enterprises, Withe Plains, NY, USA), the dimensions of which were 101.6&#x000d7;5.08&#x000d7;101.6 mm (4&#x000d7;0.2&#x000d7;4&#x02033;) for 90.72 g (0.2 lbs). For the measure, the inclinometer was placed near the elbow. The physiotherapist turned the dial until the scale read 0, then took the elbow through its range of motion. Finally, the range was read directly from the dial.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimentation process</title><p>Experimentation was performed in the Physiotherapy Unit of the Gerontology Department over one half-day per week. A training session on both instruments used in this study was held by physiotherapists before the study began so that all four investigators had the same level of knowledge regarding the use of the MP-BV. No physiotherapist had had any experience with any inertial sensor before the training sessions.</p><p>Measurements were made on the elbow joint, as it allows good validity and intertester reproducibility.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Physiotherapists successively measured flexion, pronation, and supination. In room A, experimentation included measurement with the MP-BV as well as with the inclinometer. The screen displaying the result was hidden from the physiotherapist so as not to influence the inclinometer measurement. In room B, the experiment included a measurement with the MP-BV, in order to assess intertester reliability. Considering that inclinometer was the instrument of reference, only one measure was taken. For MP-BV two measures were taken for each patient to assess intertester reliability, which were performed by different physiotherapists for each measure.</p><p>When the passive elbow flexion was measured, the arm was placed vertically and the forearm was placed in supination in the same straight line as that formed by the arm. The inclinometer was placed on the longitudinal axis of the mobile segment, on the dorsal surface, and on the middle of the forearm. For this measurement, we used two MotionPod devices; the first one, fixed on the wrist, measured the joint angle, and the second one, on the arm, was used as reference positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-10-491">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Regarding pronosupination, the arm was placed vertically; the forearm was placed horizontally with the palm of the hand up, the thumb upward, and the longitudinal axis of the third metacarpus in the same axis as the forearm. The inclinometer was positioned on the dorsal face of the wrist and the MotionPod the motion pod was positioned on the external face of the wrist.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables studied</title><sec><title>Measurement reliability</title><p>Passive elbow ROM measurements expressed in degrees and obtained with the MP-BV were compared to those obtained with an inclinometer for all three of the movements (flexion, pronation, and supination). We excluded elbow extension because the articular deviation of this joint is inferior to 10&#x000b0;, which is inferior to the variability accepted between the two techniques. A 10&#x000b0; scope of error is acceptable for goniometric measurements.<xref rid="b29-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Consequently, we considered as reliable a measure with the MP-BV with a difference of less than 10&#x000b0; of the measure obtained with the inclinometer. The percentage of reliable measure was calculated in this way for each movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Intertester reproducibility</title><p>Intertester reproducibility was assessed through two series of passive ROM measurements conducted with the MP-BV by two researchers. For each of the three movements, intertester reproducibility of MP-BV measurement was evaluated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).<xref rid="b30-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Reproducibility was also evaluated through the rates of concordant measures with both techniques (less than 10&#x000b0; difference between the measures) for each movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Duration of examination</title><p>The durations of examination (in seconds) obtained with both instruments were compared. Duration was defined as the time at which the patient was ready for examination until the time at which the data were recorded in the patient&#x02019;s file.</p></sec><sec><title>Acceptability</title><p>The patient rated the comfort of the measurement process for both instruments using a ten-point visual analog scale (VAS). Meanwhile, each physiotherapist rated his acceptance of the instruments using a 10-point VAS, as well as the ease of use and of data exporting of both instruments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>It was decided a priori that MP-BV would be considered a reliable measurement technique if the three joint angles from at least 90% of patients had less than 10&#x000b0; error when compared to the inclinometer. Considering the assumption that 95% of patients would have a valid measure, it was necessary to include 73 patients so that the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) would be above 90%. To account for potential measurement failures, the decision was made to include 84 patients.</p><p>First, a descriptive analysis was made by the biostatistician from the DRCI of Nice University Hospital. Results were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for quantitative variables and percentage for qualitative variables. The percentage of patients with a valid global assessment was calculated and presented with the corresponding 95% CI as well as percentages of reliable measurements for each movement (flexion, pronation, supination). An ICC value &#x0003c;0.40 was considered poor, 0.40&#x02013;0.50 moderate, 0.50&#x02013;0.70 good, and 0.70&#x02013;1.0 excellent.<xref rid="b31-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Examination duration was compared between the two techniques using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for paired data.

Finally, for acceptability analyses, VAS scores (recorded in room A) were compared using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for paired data. All the tests were two-sided and the significance level was set to 5%.

In our study, we chose the inclinometer as a reference instrument due to its validity, but also because of its higher intertester reproducibility compared to a classical goniometer on the elbow joint.<xref rid="b34-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Moreover, the inclinometer is a fast and easy-to-use instrument with which physiotherapists from the Nice University Hospital are familiar. Finally, an important physiological valgus could hamper common goniometer implementation on the elbow joint. Chapleau et al<xref rid="b29-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> highlighted in their study the need for using radiological measurement in clinical protocols. However, radiological measurement was difficult to apply in our study.</p><p>Remarkably, this study analyzed 77 patients, which represents a significant number of patients compared to similar studies which have validated reference instruments.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Within the context of the study, a double-blind experiment for measurements was not achievable.</p><p>We experienced some difficulties in measurement that could explain the differences between the two instruments&#x02019; outcomes. Elbow flexion measurement is usually done by placing the shoulder in a neutral position, and the choice of using two inertial sensors was made to avoid subject compensation while performing this measure (shoulder protraction). Unlike the inclinometer, the MP-BV was attached to the skin; however, skin elasticity decreases with age,<xref rid="b35-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-cia-10-491" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and, as a result, there was a low adjustment of the sensor in regard to the underlying bony landmark, creating a measurement difference higher than 10&#x000b0;. This particularity could also explain measurement differences when pronation and supination movements were performed.</p><p>Contrary to what was expected, the importance of a rigorous marked of reference point proved to be extremely important. Indeed, the positioning of the sensor on the joint by both physiotherapists was not exactly the same and may have been responsible for the different outcomes. Moreover, a clamping system was not provided with the MotionPod, and it was necessary to use a skin guard to protect the elderly patients&#x02019; skin, which is often fragile, increasing tracking difficulties.</p><p>Regarding examination duration, it is important to note that this not only included examination duration, but also the setting-up of the skin guard, thus increasing the total measuring time with the MP-BV compared to the inclinometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With the continuing development of new technologies, we shall witness more and more new instruments that will require assessment using similar protocols to those used for medications. Based on this study, the MP-BV seems less reliable and to give less reproducible measures than one of the reference instruments used to assess elbow ROM in the elderly. Taking into account its limitations as well as its ease of both use and data exportation, it could be interesting to compare MP-BV measurements to radiographic measurements in a younger population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Eric Fontas for his methodological support and Mathilde Demory for reviewing the English.
