We test this hypothesis comparing initial monotherapy with dual therapy in the management of essential hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a prospective, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled trial in patients with essential hypertension. Around 50% of patients studied will be newly diagnosed and the others will be known hypertensives who previously received only monotherapy. The trial is divided into three phases as follows: Phase 1 (Week 0&#x02013;Week 16): Randomised, parallel-group, masked assignation to either combination or monotherapy. Phase 2 (Week 17&#x02013;Week 32): Open-label combination therapy. Phase 3 (Week 33&#x02013;Week 52): Open-label combination therapy plus open-label add-on (if BP is above 140/90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg). Hierarchical primary end points are: a comparison of home BP (home systolic blood pressure (HSBP)) averaged over the duration of phase 1 and 2 in the combination versus monotherapy arms. If combination is superior in this analysis, then the averaged mean HSBP between initial monotherapy and initial combination therapy at the end of phase 2 will be compared. Secondary end points include: BP control at 1&#x02005;year; the role of age, baseline renin, sodium status, plasma volume, haemodynamic compensation and peripheral resistance on BP control; validation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence/British Hypertension Society joint guideline algorithm; safety and tolerability of combination therapy; and the impact of combination versus monotherapy on left ventricular mass and aortic pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 536 (268 in each group) will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>PATHWAY 1 was approved by UK ethics (REC Reference 09/H0308/132).

In these studies, participants randomised to the less effective of two treatments early in the study &#x02018;never caught up&#x02019; with the BP lowering achieved in the other group, despite eventually receiving more drug therapy. Furthermore, a study of dual therapy versus monotherapy with aliskiren and amlodipine showed that participants started on initial dual therapy appeared always to have better BP control than the monotherapy group.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>A plausible explanation of the &#x02018;never catch up&#x02019; phenomenon is that one drug given alone initiates activation of homeostatic mechanisms, which minimises efficacy. Thus a diuretic or calcium antagonist given alone would lead to a rise in renin levels, effectively antagonising the effect of the initial drug. Given such a mechanism, one would expect that a drug that blocked the effects of a rise in renin would produce complementary effects. Support for this concept comes from a study where measurements of thoracic fluid volume supported the occult volume expansion hypothesis as a mediator of antihypertensive drug resistance. This study guided increasing the diuretic dose and adjustment of antihypertensive treatment by using thoracic bioimpedance measurements, which was found to be an effective strategy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Historically, initial treatment of hypertension with combination therapy has been discouraged because of concern about excessive reduction in BP, increased side effects and the difficulty of attributing adverse events to one drug. However, the US Joint National Committee guideline 8 (JNC8) guidelines have listed that a two-drug initial treatment is an acceptable strategy in patients who are 20&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg above systolic target BP or 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg above diastolic BP target or whose systolic BP is &#x0003e;160&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or diastolic &#x0003e;100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These and previous guidelines that advocated similar strategies have not resulted in reports of problems with this approach. The European guidelines also include low-dose combination therapy as an initial treatment option.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Despite the currently available evidence, in reality, initial combination therapy is not commonly used and formal prospective studies are required to catalyse change. A further study demonstrating improved BP control with initial combination therapy would provide further evidence that using widely available, inexpensive combinations is appropriate. Our trial here, PATHWAY 1, funded by the British Heart Foundation, aims to provide such evidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>British Hypertension Society Research Network of investigators recruiting participants from both primary care and secondary care.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Overall trial design</title><p>The study is a prospective, multicentre, active-controlled, three-phase trial in UK patients with essential hypertension.

We believe this is one of the first trials to use home BP as the primary outcome measure, offering similar advantages to ambulatory monitoring (multiple measurements in the absence of white-coat stimuli) without the disadvantage of patient resistance to repeated use. Patients will be instructed to take BP readings on the past four consecutive days before each clinic visit (baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 38, 44 and 52). Patients will be asked to measure their BP as close as possible to 8:00 and 20:00, and to take readings in triplicate, after 10&#x02005;min seated rest. The second and third readings are recorded on a pro forma provided to each patient. The 12 readings thus obtained for analysis confer near-maximal precision. All readings will also be captured automatically by the monitor. Study medication should be taken after morning BP readings are completed.</p><p>Clinic BP measurements are taken at each study visit, on the patient's Microlife monitor, and patients will have their BP and pulse rate recorded in triplicate after 10&#x02005;min seated rest. The first reading will be discarded and the mean clinic readings will be the average of the last 2 readings.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Additional procedures</title><p>A 12-lead ECG is captured at the start and end of the study. Haemodynamic measures (cardiac output, peripheral resistance and bioimpedance) and pulse wave analysis are captured at baseline and at weeks 8, 16, 32 and 52 in centres that have the appropriate Cardiodynamics equipment. Plasma renin is measured at baseline and a full biochemical series is taken at regular intervals for safety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Compliance, efficacy and tolerability</title><p>Compliance with study medication will be assessed at the end of the placebo run-in and at each scheduled clinic visit postrandomisation. Assessment is by counting capsules/tablets returned at each visit. To be evaluable as a compliant participant &#x02265;80% compliance with therapy is required.</p><p>Patients may be withdrawn from the study if the investigator feels it would be in the patient's best interest, if the patient demonstrates intolerance to study drug, if plasma potassium levels are sustained at &#x0003c;3.0&#x02005;mmol/L or &#x0003e;5.9&#x02005;mmol/L, if BP is uncontrolled (&#x0003e;200/120&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) or if the patient develops symptomatic hypotension with systolic BP &#x0003c;110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg. Investigators may advance patients with uncontrolled BP to the next study visit where dose titration will occur. There is no option for down titration of combination therapy during phase 2.

Study staff will pursue and obtain information adequate to confirm whether the event meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event. An event will be deemed serious if it results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect or is another medically important event. Adverse events will be classified according to seriousness, severity (mild, moderate or severe), causal relationship (certain, probably, possible, unlikely, unrelated) and expectedness. Suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (SUSARs) are not considered likely in this trial as there have been many years of experience with each of the trial drugs. All potential SUSARs are subject to expedited reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Data analysis and statistical methods</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size of 268 in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg HSBP, assuming a common SD of 12&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg using a two group t test with &#x003b1;=0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Study participants are randomised 1:1 to either initial combination or initial monotherapy using an Interactive Voice Recognition System located at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics at Glasgow University. The aim is to achieve a 50:50 balance between never treated and previously treated patients. Therefore, recruitment to one of these groups (never treated, or previously treated) may be stopped temporarily, or permanently, if the chief investigator and data management centre consider it necessary in order to achieve a final recruitment that does not exceed a 60:40 proportion of either group. Randomisation will continue until 600 participants have been recruited (to allow for dropouts) or until 536 evaluable participants have completed the study.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Database lock</title><p>Since the study is double-blind, all investigators remain blinded until database lock.

An analysis will be performed first to compare the mean HSBP readings in phase 1 and 2 between combination therapy and monotherapy. If averaged combination therapy is superior to monotherapy, a second primary analysis will compare the mean HSBP at the end of phase 2 (namely visit 8 at week 32) between initial combination and monotherapy. The analyses will adjust for baseline covariates (demographics, baseline HSBP and never vs previously treated). Last reading carried forward will be used in the intention to treat analysis in those participants who fail to complete the full study for whatever reason.</p><p>Secondary analyses will compare: change in HSBP at 8, 16 (end of phase 1) and 52&#x02005;weeks (end of phase 3); change in clinic SBP at these times and end of phase 2; responder rates at the end of phase 1, 2 and 3 (defined as HSBP &#x0003c;135/&#x0003c;85, and/or clinic &#x0003c;140/&#x0003c;90, and/or fall in SBP &#x02265;10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg); withdrawals due to adverse events; the number of drugs being prescribed at the end of phase 3; a Kaplan-Meier analysis for events, namely either addition of third drug or withdrawal due to an adverse event; haemodynamic variables and pulse wave analysis&#x02014;these will be analysed in the same way as BP, with and without correction for BP. The extent to which plasma renin and haemodynamic variables explain variation in response between and within treatment groups will be investigated for both primary and secondary outcomes.</p><p>A full statistical analysis plan is available from the chief investigator MJB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethical and other approvals</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee of the NHS National Research Ethics Service (number 091/H0308/1132), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (EudraCT number: 2008-007749-29).

PATHWAY-2 will recruit patients with more severe hypertension than either PATHWAY-1 or PATHWAY-3, which is a comparison of a potassium retaining plus a thiazide diuretic with either alone, for their effects on BP and glucose tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s9"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current practice in hypertension management uses a stepped care approach with initial monotherapy that is added on to, according to the results of subsequent blood pressure measurement. The concern is that lowering blood pressure by one drug triggers adaptive responses in the patient that, if triggered in the early stages of hypertension management, will impair further attempts to achieve target blood pressure. This study tests whether initial combination therapy with two drugs that are complementary in action is superior to the current stepped-care approach; we are using widely available, generic drugs at optimal doses. The primary end point uses home BP monitoring which will give a more accurate representation of the patients&#x02019; true BP compared to using clinic readings alone. In phase one, half the patients go through a crossover trial-within-a trial; so we will have excellent prospective data to evaluate whether angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or diuretic is more effective, respectively, in the younger and older patients and whether baseline renin is more or less predictive than age. We also have haemodynamic indices, including peripheral resistance, cardiac output, thoracic impedance and arterial function, in order to determine whether increases in any parameter underpin the postulated compensatory responses to monotherapy. These measurements will also help to establish whether&#x02014;for instance&#x02014;peripheral resistance is higher in patients responding better to ARB than diuretic, and whether thoracic impedance (a measure of body fluid) a better predictor of response to diuretic. The relatively long duration of the study also allows for assessment of those patients who are deemed to have resistant hypertension in phase 3.</p><p>Confirmation that patients starting with monotherapy &#x02018;never catch up&#x02019; with patients starting on combination therapy would have a major impact on hypertension treatment practice; possibly more than any previous study in hypertension.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>TMM, BW, IF, MJB: Trial Executives for the British Hypertension Society's PATHWAY programme of trials.</p></fn><fn><p>TMM, BW, MC, PS, DJW, ISM, IF, MJB: Steering Committee for the British Hypertension Society's PATHWAY programme of trials.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TMM, MJB, BW, MC, JKC, GM, PS, DJW, IF and ISM designed the trial.
