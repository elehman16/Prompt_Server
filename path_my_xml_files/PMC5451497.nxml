There is also reluctance to treat post-traumatic symptoms in case the therapeutic procedure of reprocessing the trauma exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Recent evidence demonstrates that it is safe to use reprocessing strategies in this population. However, most published studies have been based on treating post-traumatic symptoms in isolation from psychotic symptoms. The aims of the current case series were to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of integrating cognitive-behavioural approaches for post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms into a single protocol. Nine participants reporting distressing psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms were recruited from a specialist psychological therapies service for psychosis. Clients were assessed at five time points (baseline, pre, mid, end of therapy, and at 6+ months of follow-up) by an independent assessor on measures of current symptoms of psychosis, post-traumatic stress, emotional problems, and well-being. Therapy was formulation based and individualised, depending on presenting symptoms and trauma type. It consisted of five broad, flexible phases, and included imaginal reprocessing strategies (reliving and/or rescripting). The intervention was well received, with positive post-therapy feedback and satisfaction ratings. Unusually for this population, no-one dropped out of therapy. Post therapy, all but one (88% of participants) achieved a reliable improvement compared to pre-therapy on at least one outcome measure: post-traumatic symptoms (63%), voices (25%), delusions (50%), depression (50%), anxiety (36%), and well-being (40%). Follow-up assessments were completed by 78% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) of whom 86% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) maintained at least one reliable improvement. Rates of improvements following therapy (average of 44% across measures post therapy; 32% at follow-up) were over twice those found during the waiting list period (19%). No participant indicated a reliable worsening of any symptoms during or after therapy. The study shows that an integrative therapy incorporating reprocessing strategies was an acceptable and feasible intervention for this small sample, with promising effectiveness. A randomised controlled trial is warranted to test the efficacy of the intervention for this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>psychosis</kwd><kwd>trauma</kwd><kwd>post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis</kwd><kwd>psychological intervention</kwd><kwd>reprocessing</kwd><kwd>imaginal exposure</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="85"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="12766"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are very high rates of trauma in individuals presenting with psychotic symptoms. In their review of more than 40 studies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), Grubaugh et al. found rates of 49&#x02013;100% (depending on population and methods of assessment), with 75&#x02013;98% of those exposed to trauma reporting multiple traumas. Post-traumatic stress symptoms are reported in approximately 33% of people with psychosis, and 12.5% of patients with a psychotic disorder meet criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Post-traumatic symptoms are frequently intertwined with psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), with an overlap between symptoms such as hallucinations and trauma sequelae such as dissociation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recent theoretical models have identified underlying factors through which trauma is related to the development and maintenance of positive symptoms (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), with specific mechanisms linking different types of adversity with hallucinations and with delusions (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is suggested that there is a direct link between the re-experiencing and arousal symptoms of PTSD, such as intrusions (&#x0201c;flashbacks&#x0201d;), and both the occurrence and content of hallucinations (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Dissociative processes and disrupted contextual integration at the time of the trauma leave an individual vulnerable to experiencing anomalous experiences. If the trauma-memory-related intrusion is, for example, of the abuser, in combination with high levels of arousal, this may be experienced as an auditory hallucination of the voice of the abuser in individuals with an information processing style prone to weakened contextual integration (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Further, interpersonal traumas lead to maladaptive schema and appraisals of self and others, predisposing to paranoia and delusional beliefs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Maladaptive schema about self and others are also closely related to the concept of metacognitive capacity (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), i.e., an integrated representation of the self and others, which is suggested to be a foundation for resilience (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Both individuals with psychosis and with PTSD show poor metacognitive mastery, which is further associated with greater distress and hyperarousal in PTSD patients (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), suggesting that a limited understanding of mental states, especially others&#x02019; emotions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), may be another possible shared mechanism between psychotic and post-traumatic stress symptoms.</p><p>The presence of PTSD symptoms results in worse outcomes and long-term distress for many clients with trauma histories, including a poorer response to antipsychotic medication and more severe psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), higher rates of emotional disorders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide; and increased and longer-term use of services (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, a failure to treat trauma sequelae is costly to both service users and the National Health Service (NHS). Despite this, in clinical practice, PTSD symptoms are usually overlooked in such clients (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Service users (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) have long campaigned to have professionals recognise the central role of trauma in people&#x02019;s lives, and that the impact of trauma is not treated by antipsychotic medication alone. However, despite these calls, the psychological effects of trauma in those with psychotic symptoms are often not treated in mainstream services. Encouragingly, however, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) have, for the first time, recommended that people presenting with a first episode of psychosis in early interventions for psychosis (EIP) services should be assessed for a history of trauma and PTSD, and that NICE guidelines for PTSD (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) should be followed in those showing signs of PTSD.</p><p>Although cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended for both psychosis [CBT for psychosis: CBTp (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and for PTSD (trauma-focused CBT, tf-CBT) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)], evidence is lacking on specific, integrated tf-CBT for psychosis (tf-CBTp). CBTp does not focus directly on trauma sequelae, and therapists are often reluctant to treat PTSD symptoms due to concerns that the experiential reprocessing of trauma may exacerbate psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Consequently, this leads to people with psychotic symptoms failing to access trauma-based therapies, and/or therapists choosing modes of therapy for the trauma that exclude imaginal reprocessing techniques, which may mean that the treatment is not optimally effective. Similarly, these concerns have excluded people with psychosis (both current of a history of psychosis) from all prominent PTSD trials (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Encouragingly however, three recent reviews (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), including a Cochrane review (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), have found that there is some good quality, albeit limited, evidence to suggest that trauma-focused psychological therapies can be safe and efficacious in individuals with psychosis. Until recently, most of the studies of trauma-focused therapy in psychosis consisted of case studies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), open trials (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), pilot studies (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), and small-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Overall, the results are promising in terms of reduction in post-traumatic symptoms. Nevertheless, some of these studies have been in clients with &#x0201c;severe mental illness (SMI)&#x0201d; with mixed diagnosis samples, where the majority did not have psychotic disorders (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), or samples who did not necessarily present with current psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). More recently, there have been two larger-scale RCTs of trauma-focused therapy in psychosis samples. The largest was carried out in the Netherlands, and found large effect sizes for both exposure (0.78) and EMDR (0.65) on PTSD symptoms, with 57% in the exposure treatment group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;53) and 60% in the EMDR treatment group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55) achieving a loss of PTSD diagnosis compared to 6% of the waiting list group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, treatment effects were maintained 6 months later for both treatment groups. This promising outcome contrasts with the findings from a recent RCT in the UK (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which, despite showing that tf-CBT was safe and feasible, found no differences between the therapy and treatment-as-usual (TAU) groups on PTSD outcomes. One possible explanation for these discrepancies in results is that the latter trial, unlike the Dutch study, did not include a direct memory reprocessing element in the therapy protocol but focused instead on cognitive restructuring alone.</p><p>It is, therefore, an exciting time for the development of interventions for post-traumatic stress in people presenting with psychotic symptoms. However, there is a still a lack of consensus as to the best and safest approach (e.g., cognitive restructuring versus more directive imaginal reprocessing methods such as EMDR, exposure, or re-scripting) for this vulnerable client group. In addition, there has been mixed implementation across the studies on the use of a stabilisation or preparatory phase prior to beginning the trauma-focused components of the intervention. The debate over the safety and tolerability of exposure-based PTSD therapies is not limited to those with psychotic symptoms. Therapists have long had reservations about exposure-based therapies in terms of their potential to destabilise clients (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and indeed some studies have found that even during beneficial exposure-based interventions clients can experience initial worsening of PTSD symptoms, physical symptoms of anxiety, and emotional exhaustion (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Thus, whilst exposure-based treatment for PTSD is effective, it can also be distressing and difficult for clients to undertake. Nevertheless, a recent review suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support a phase-based treatment approach to complex PTSD, i.e., specifically in relation to a stabilisation phase, and that its inclusion may in itself act as a delay or barrier to intervention targeting the trauma (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Importantly, in the Dutch trial, which did not include a stabilisation phase, there were no occurrences of severe adverse events and PTSD symptom exacerbation induced by the intervention at the end of treatment or at follow-up, or of psychotic symptom exacerbation or increased suicidality (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Nevertheless, as psychotic symptom exacerbation was only measured after the first two exposure sessions (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and current psychotic symptoms were only present in 55% of their sample, additional research is needed to build on this evidence base to gain clarity regarding the safety and efficacy of implementing exposure-based interventions within this population.</p><p>In addition, most of the studies to date have treated post-traumatic symptoms in isolation from psychotic symptoms. This may be reflective of the fact that RCTs, whilst clearly the gold standard in informing evidenced-based practice, are often required to have strict exclusion criteria, pre-defined primary outcomes, and a focus on one underlying mechanism. It is perhaps unsurprising then that despite promising outcomes in terms of PTSD symptoms, there are inconsistent results in terms of whether (and which) psychotic symptoms improve following therapy (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In clinical practice, this may pose an issue for clients whose primary goal is to address their psychotic symptoms (e.g., to reduce compliance with commanding voices) even though post-traumatic symptoms may be fuelling these, or clients who initially present and seek help for a &#x0201c;psychotic&#x0201d; explanation of their difficulties (i.e., the persecutor is following me and trying to kill me) as opposed to a &#x0201c;trauma&#x0201d; explanation (i.e., I am experiencing flashbacks of the persecutor assaulting me). This perhaps highlights the need for &#x0201c;practice-based evidence&#x0201d; integrating treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms, and which can be tailored to the individual needs and goals of the client, in addition to the evidence base from RCTs.</p><p>The aims of the current study were to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of integrating current cognitive-behavioural approaches for post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms into a single protocol, within a routine clinical service. The therapy protocol included exposure-based reprocessing strategies since, particularly in view of recent trials (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), this is likely to be a crucial mode of action in the treatment of PTSD. The protocol also includes a stabilisation phase because (1) although emotional arousal is key in exposure therapy, high levels of affect arousal in the absence of effective coping strategies may trigger information processing difficulties and psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and (2) clinically we have found the stabilisation phase helpful in fostering an initial sense of hope and control over symptoms, and in enhancing engagement and increasing trust in the therapist. The study reports the outcomes of nine consecutive clients, obtained as part of the service&#x02019;s routine assessments at baseline, pre-therapy, mid-therapy, post-therapy, and at a minimum of 6-month follow-up. The study aimed to explore changes on a range of meaningful clinical outcomes, namely measures of post-traumatic stress, psychosis symptoms, affective problems, and emotional well-being, following receipt of tf-CBTp.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Service Setting</title><p>These data were collected at the Psychological Interventions Clinic for outpatients with Psychosis (PICuP), based in South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust.

The integrated tf-CBTp therapy protocol is outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, with five phases. Therapy was conducted in a flexible style with an emphasis on engagement and building a good therapeutic relationship. Although we have manualised our approach in this study, to maintain a consistent approach, in practice therapy is pragmatic in that it is adapted to the individual and their changing needs, with clinicians able to shift between stages of therapy according to clinical need. Similarly, therapy speed and progression are tailored to the individual to ensure that any changes in psychotic experiences are addressed as they arise.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Integrated trauma and psychosis intervention protocol</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyt-08-00092-g001"/></fig><p>Therapists consisted of two senior clinical psychologists [first (Nadine Keen) and second (Elaine C.

Hunter had extensive experience of delivering CBT interventions for both PTSD and for psychosis, and developed the current protocol integrating therapeutic procedures for post-traumatic and psychotic symptoms. Cases were discussed in fortnightly peer supervision groups, and MS received extra weekly individual supervision.</p><sec id="S2-7-1"><title>Phase 1: Assessment, Engagement, and Goal-Setting</title><p>A thorough assessment and the establishment of clients&#x02019; goals are key in determining how best to offer help. A combination of questionnaires and clinical interview is essential to maximise data gathering. Although questionnaires can feel impersonal, they are often helpful at the outset as they can feel less intrusive and normalising for clients who may be shame prone, and so clients may disclose information that otherwise they might be reluctant to say directly to their clinician. From the outset, all symptoms are framed as understandable reactions to overwhelming traumatic events and the therapist provides psychoeducation to facilitate this. To facilitate trust, engagement, and a sense of safety, a non-colluding, non-confrontational therapeutic style is required, using the client&#x02019;s own terminology (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Strategies such as the symbolic panic button and having periods free from trauma/symptom discussion, to help the client work within their therapeutic &#x0201c;window of tolerance,&#x0201d; are further used as a means of sharing power and giving the client some control over the process of therapy (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). It is important to be mindful of the potential for exacerbation of affect, post-traumatic or psychotic symptoms (e.g., voices commenting, paranoia, dissociation, and flashbacks), so the pace may need to be slow with frequent checking out and reassurance. This needs to be carefully balanced with not colluding with any understandable avoidance of traumatic or affect-laden topics.</p></sec><sec id="S2-8"><title>Phase 2: Stabilisation and Coping Strategy Enhancement</title><p>Risks of psychosis exacerbations are minimised by the inclusion of a stabilisation, coping, and affect management phase that also targets psychotic symptoms prior to trauma-focused work. Although there is debate about the inclusion of this phase (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), we find it helpful in fostering an initial sense of hope and control over symptoms, and in enhancing engagement and increasing trust in the therapist. Developing control is also helpful for the subsequent, shared formulation phase, as gaining control over some symptoms can provide evidence to support a trauma-based understanding of their experiences [e.g., &#x0201c;if grounding strategies stop the &#x02018;attacks&#x02019; (i.e. somatic flashbacks) then perhaps these might be flashbacks rather than the abuser attacking me again&#x0201d;], and hence provides the rationale for trauma-focused interventions. Strategies employed during this phase will depend on the client&#x02019;s specific presentation, needs, and goals but may include: managing and reducing risk; anxiety management (e.g., controlled breathing and special place imagery); grounding strategies; coping with voices, paranoia and other anomalous experiences; sleep hygiene and CBT strategies for depression.</p></sec><sec id="S2-9"><title>Phase 3: Shared tf-CBTp Formulation</title><p>By this time, the therapist may have already shared simple cognitive-behavioural maintenance vicious cycles for mood, anxiety, post-traumatic, and/or psychotic symptoms, but the aim in this study is to develop a shared formulation (template in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) helping the client to make links between their past traumatic event(s) and their current post-traumatic and psychotic symptoms. This enables possible reformulation of the client&#x02019;s current difficulties as understandable responses to trauma and provides further rationale for the trauma-focused interventions. We found that changes in symptom attribution in themselves can lead to a reduction in distress. For example, P1 said he was relieved and preferred to believe the alternative explanation that his nightmares were likely caused by &#x0201c;unprocessed memories&#x0201d; of his traumatic experiences, as opposed to his original belief that they were the Devil reminding him that he was guilty of the murder of his friend. Timelines and formulation letters can also be helpful here to facilitate the contextualisation of clients&#x02019; experiences/memories and to help make links between particular events and experiences.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Integrated model of trauma and psychosis [adapted from models in Ref.

All participants completed therapy, and no adverse outcomes in terms of reliable worsening of symptoms, relapse, or hospital admissions occurred as a result of the intervention. Satisfaction ratings were very high, and all but one client (88%) achieved a reliable improvement on at least one symptom measure post therapy.</p><p>Visual examination of the group means showed a trend for improved scores across all symptoms, both at the end of therapy and at the 6+&#x02009;months of follow-up. In terms of individual change scores, it is very encouraging that a substantial majority showed improvements on each of the symptom measures, with approximately one-third of the participants indicating reliable changes on each of the measures at each time point. Rates of improvements following therapy were twice those found during the waiting list period, for those outcomes where waiting list data were available (i.e., all measures except PDS (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>)). The greatest improvement noted was on post-traumatic symptoms, in which all clients showed improved scores, with 63% indicating a reliable change. These promising findings provide some support for the view that the inclusion of direct memory reprocessing strategies is necessary to address post-traumatic symptoms.</p><p>Whilst these results are encouraging, it is important to note that the mean PDS score was still in the moderate-to-severe range post therapy and at follow-up (as compared to being in the severe range pre therapy). Nevertheless, it is worth bearing in mind that this was a very complex sample with the majority (78%) presenting with multiple complex traumas (e.g., participant 2 experienced long-term imprisonment with physical and sexual torture, and participant 3 was living in conflict zone (civil war and genocide) during which her parents were killed. She was then held captive, gang raped, and witnessed the murder of grandfather). Over half (56%) had experienced childhood trauma, and a third (33%) were refugees (who in addition to their index trauma had additionally experienced the trauma of living in conflict zones and having to relocate to the UK). The majority of the clients had ongoing social needs, multiple diagnoses, and high levels of baseline depression and anxiety (78 and 89% scoring in the severe or extremely severe range for depression and anxiety, respectively). Given these profiles, it is perhaps understandable that many clients had some residual post-traumatic symptoms post therapy (albeit much reduced).</p><p>In terms of impact on voices, the majority of participants indicated improved scores but only a minority improved reliably post therapy (25%) or at follow-up (29%). It is worth noting that in this sample, individuals&#x02019; voices were very severe, with over half (56%) experiencing distressing command hallucinations associated with risky compliance behaviours. Greater improvements were seen for delusions, with approximately half indicating reliable improvement post therapy (50%) or at follow-up (43%). This change may be explained by the fact that the therapy protocol included re-formulating distressing delusional beliefs (e.g., the Devil is suffocating me at night) as understandable reactions to traumatic experiences (e.g., feeling suffocated is a flashback to my abuser who reminds me of the Devil), hence potentially providing alternative, less distressing explanations for clients&#x02019; delusional beliefs (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). These results are consistent with the findings from the Dutch trial, where changes were found for paranoid thoughts but not hallucinations (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), although fewer of their patients presented with voices than paranoia at baseline, which may have skewed their results. Impact on affect and emotional well-being was also encouraging, and most people indicated improved scores on measures of depression, anxiety, and well-being with 50, 36, and 40% indicating reliable changes on these, respectively, many of whom maintained their scores, or at least showed some improvement at follow-up (40, 40, and 20%, respectively).</p><p>It should be noted that the intervention was long (median 41 sessions) and included a stabilisation phase, unlike in the Dutch trial (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Clinically, it was felt that the stabilisation phase was necessary to build coping strategies, foster a sense of control, and trust in the therapist, and to provide a rationale for the trauma-focused phase of the therapy. Indeed, client feedback was positive with regard to this (e.g., &#x0201c;I understood why it kept coming back and by learning to control the visions I felt more empowered to tackle it head on&#x0201d; [P7]). This supports previous findings within the PTSD literature that therapeutic alliance during the first phase of treatment predicts successful reduction of PTSD symptoms during exposure therapy in the second phase (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Furthermore, for the majority of the clients, there were ongoing social issues (e.g., immigration, housing, and ongoing domestic violence) that needed to be addressed prior to some clients feeling able to commence the trauma-focused phase of the treatment. As therapists were often the only mental health professionals involved in the client&#x02019;s care, it frequently became therapists&#x02019; responsibility to address these issues, and, therefore, the length of therapy should be interpreted in this context. Further, given that the NICE guidelines recommend (even when treated in isolation) at least 12 sessions for PTSD, with more for complex PTSD or multiple traumas (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and at least 16 for psychosis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and for severe depression (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>), in addition to the recent finding that 25 sessions is the optimal dose for CBT for psychosis (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), 41 sessions is perhaps understandable for this very complex client group. However, whether the stabilisation phase is necessary remains an empirical question that needs to be tested. Consideration will need to be taken with regard to different service contexts, and how some may be better equipped than others to provide holistic care (i.e., in some community teams, e.g., care coordinators may be able to provide stabilisation strategies alongside a therapist doing the trauma-focused work).</p><p>Overall, these findings support the emerging evidence base in this area (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and suggest that an integrated approach, targeting both psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms, can have a positive impact not only on positive symptoms of psychosis and post-traumatic symptoms but also on depression, anxiety, and emotional well-being for some clients. The results should be interpreted within the context of a number of strengths and limitations.</p><sec id="S4-1"><title>Strengths</title><p>The study has good ecological validity in that the sample was representative of the heterogeneity and complexity of individuals presenting with distressing post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms in the clinic, unlike RCTs that have been criticized on the basis of strict inclusion criteria, and which include individuals without current psychotic symptoms.</p><p>The intervention was well received by participants. A number of key factors were likely involved in keeping people engaged in therapy. First, we recruited only individuals who expressed willingness in addressing their trauma sequelae. Many individuals are highly avoidant of discussing their trauma, and ascertaining readiness for therapy is crucial. Second, the therapy adhered to the central tenets and values of CBTp (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>): much emphasis was given to engagement and a good therapeutic relationship; therapy was collaborative, with active participation from the client who is seen as an expert in his or her experiences, and had a normalizing philosophy; it was geared towards achieving the person&#x02019;s personal valued goal(s) and based on an individualized, shared formulation, which provided a rationale for trauma-focused interventions; emotional processes were fully integrated within the formulation of psychotic and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and addressed in therapy, not just as the sequelae, but in terms of their role in the formation, trigger, and maintenance of symptoms; paramount importance was given to maintaining the person&#x02019;s self-esteem, empowering and providing hope, and promoting recovery-oriented values (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Third, we felt the stabilisation stage was helpful in preparing the client for the exposure work ahead, providing hope, trust and optimism, and minimising the risk of exacerbations of psychotic symptoms. Fourth, trauma exposure was conducted within the client&#x02019;s therapeutic &#x0201c;window of tolerance,&#x0201d; in that the client was in control of the amount and duration of direct PTSD exposure they could manage within the therapy sessions. This is likely to have been a key factor in minimising dropouts in the therapy process. Finally, the flexible and pragmatic nature of the protocol meant that the intervention was tailored to the needs and goals of the individual, and targeted psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms in an integrated, rather than isolated, fashion. Other groups, such as Lysaker and Dimaggio, have also recommended the use of integrated approaches for people with psychosis, rather than developing new schools of treatment, which promote guided discovery to foster an increased awareness of mental phenomena and making sense of what is happening in one&#x02019;s own mind and the minds of others (i.e., targeting metacognitive capacity, a potential common mechanism in post-traumatic and psychotic symptoms), to move meaningfully towards recovery (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>).</p><p>The use of independent assessors, rather than outcomes being elicited by the therapists themselves, is a further strength, although a number of participants only agreed to complete the PDS with their therapists. The availability of data from five assessment points, including during a waiting list period, meant that this could serve as a control for each participant, and allowed 6+&#x02009;months of follow-up for 78% of participants.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study design was limited by the small number of participants, although a sample size of nine is acceptable for a case series. Nevertheless, we were unable to report group statistics, or to investigate potential differences between those who showed improvements on specific outcomes and those who did not. Unfortunately, there were no data available for the PDS during the waiting list period. This means that it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the impact of the intervention on post-traumatic symptoms. There were also missing data for some clients on certain measures or at particular time points. Due to service changes, two different measures were used for different clients to assess depression (BDI-II and DASS) and anxiety (BDI and DASS). The PDS has been shown to have a tendency to over-diagnose PTSD (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Schizophrenia (CAPS-S) (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) would have been a more robust, albeit more time-consuming measure. Moreover, as this is a new therapy protocol, which was being developed and elaborated over time, there were no adherence or competence ratings obtained for the therapy delivered. Also, given this was a pragmatic study in which the protocol employed a range of techniques designed to be tailored to the clients&#x02019; needs and goals, the key mechanism of change remains unclear. A further limitation was that all therapists were experienced in the delivery of this work and had assured protected time for the delivery of the therapy and attendance at supervision, free from competing demands of multidisciplinary team work. It would be important to ascertain whether it would be feasible to implement this in an NHS setting with therapists with a range of experiences, and in a range of settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has important implications for the psychological treatment of post-traumatic stress symptoms in people presenting with psychotic symptoms. First, it builds on emerging evidence that treating post-traumatic symptoms through the use of imaginal reprocessing strategies is safe, acceptable, and feasible in this population. It also supports van den Berg et al.&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) assertion that there does not appear to be any justification for excluding people with current psychotic symptoms from trauma-focused interventions. Furthermore, it suggests that an integrated approach, targeting both psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms, can have a positive impact not only on positive symptoms of psychosis and post-traumatic symptoms but also on depression, anxiety, and well-being. An RCT is now warranted to test the efficacy of the intervention for this population. It will be important for future studies to also report on functional gains such as change in employment status or number of health care visits, as well as outcomes such as quality of life and social functioning.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Ethical approval for the use of outcome data from the PICuP Clinic was obtained by the London-Dulwich Research Ethics Committee (Reference 15/LO/1831), and all participants gave written informed consent for their clinical data to be used in research studies.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>NK: made substantial contributions to the design of the work; participated in the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the data; delivered the therapy for several participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) in the study; took the lead for drafting and revising the manuscript; gave final approval of the version to be published; agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring the questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work.
