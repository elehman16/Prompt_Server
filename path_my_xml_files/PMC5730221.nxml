Yet, there are few interventions that target depressive symptoms and HIV risk for people who use drugs (PWUD). This study was a randomized controlled trial of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and HIV prevention intervention to reduce depressive symptoms, injection risk behaviors and increase condom use in a sample of urban people who used heroin or cocaine in the prior 6 months. A total of 315 individuals aged 18&#x02013;55, who self-reported at least one HIV drug and sex risk behavior and scored &#x02265;16 and &#x0003c;40 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale were randomized using a two-block design, stratified by sex to ensure equivalent numbers, to a 10 session intervention arm (n = 162) or a single session control arm (n = 153). The outcomes of interest were decreases in CES-D score and injection risk behaviors and increases in condom use. The sample was majority African American (85%) and unemployed (94%). Nearly half (47%) reported injection in the prior 6 months and only 19% were taking medication for depression. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months. Retention at 12 months was 94%. Intervention arm was associated with statistically significantly lower CES-D score at 12 month compared to control. No differences were observed between arms in injection risk. At 6 month, intervention was associated with greater odds of condom use with non-main partner. These findings suggest the potential role of the integrated intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, but weak impact on HIV risk. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the title &#x0201c;Neighborhoods, Networks, Depression, and HIV Risk&#x0201d; number NCT01380613.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA022961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Latkin</surname><given-names>Carl A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse R01 DA022961.

There remains a lack of integrated interventions that target depressive symptoms and HIV risk behaviors.

CBT emphasizes the modification of maladaptive perceptions, behaviors and emotions that lead to and reinforce depressive symptoms. A number of trials have been conducted to test the efficacy of integrated CBT-substance use interventions and have demonstrated improvements in depression, coping and reduced substance use [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

We hypothesized that compared to a control arm, Workshop would result in reduced depressive symptoms, reduced injection risk behaviors and reduced sexual risk (e.g. increased condom use) at 6 and 12 month follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a two condition randomized controlled trial conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, ranked amongst the top cities for HIV prevalence and unrecognized infection compared to 20 other metropolitan areas [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Workshop was informed by a pilot CBT intervention that was found to be acceptable by people who inject drugs (PWID) in Baltimore [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and two efficacious peer-influence HIV prevention interventions [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Consistent with the principals of CBT, the Workshop aimed to train individuals in techniques to: a) identify negative cognitions and social and environmental stressors, b) restructure cognitions, social interactions and environments to improve mood, c) plan non-drug/alcohol based activities that improved mood, and d) reduce sexual and drug-related risk behaviors. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187180.s001">S1 Table</xref> for an outline of session content). HIV risk reduction skills included practice of condom use and skills for reducing HIV and hepatitis C risk associated with injection drug use and sharing drugs (e.g. crack pipes). Attendance of intervention sessions was good, with the majority (76%) attending 80% of the sessions. Participants received $25 for each session they attended.

There was only missing data on the baseline variable &#x0201c;told by a mental health provider that you had depression&#x0201d; and this variable was not included in the final multivariate model. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were fitted for the CES-D score, injection-risk behaviors and 100% condom use with main and non-main partner outcomes. These modeled the mean outcome over the three time points and the correlation between measurements within each participant. All models included randomization arm, time point, arm-by-time-point interaction and controlled for baseline homelessness and having seen a mental health provider. An unstructured correlation structure was assumed with robust variance estimators. The model of condom use with main partner was conducted with a sub-sample of participants who reported having a main partner (n = 260).</p><p>All protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board on March 2009.

We report that the Workshop had a statistically significant impact on reducing depressive symptoms compared to the control arm at 12 month follow-up. The Workshop utilized vivid metaphors and visual aids which may have enhanced processing and recall of the intervention materials and hence had a sustained impact on depressive symptoms. These results are consistent with other CBT-based interventions that have been tailored to the abilities and needs of impoverished and marginalized populations [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We observed a time-effect such that both groups had statistically lower CES-D scores at the follow-up periods compared to baseline. However, at T3 the Workshop continued to have reduced depressive symptoms. This &#x0201c;sleeper effect&#x0201d; has been observed in other studies and suggests the sustainability of CBT skills [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a significant portion of the Workshop focused on skills for increasing social interactions with supportive individuals, the effects may have required more time for effects to be observed. The lack of difference between arms at T2 may be due to low statistical power. Alternatively the effect of the control condition, which reviewed mental health resources, may have prompted individuals to seek out support or mental health services. As the study staff, including the interviewers, were highly trained and had excellent rapport with participants, the study visits themselves may have had a therapeutic impact.</p><p>Another aim of the Workshop was to reduce injection-related risk behaviors but no differences between the arms were observed. One possible explanation for this may also be low power to detect small differences as only half of the sample reported injection at baseline. It is also likely that there was an insufficient dose of Workshop content focused on injection risk to have an effect compared to the control condition (who also received individual counseling at the baseline commensurate with standard HIV pre and post-test counseling). Future interventions should better integrate or increase dose of risk reduction into sessions.</p><p>The third focus of the Workshop was to reduce sexual risk behaviors. The Workshop had marginal effects on 100% condom use with main partners compared to the control but we did not observe differences in the time*arm interaction. There may have been insufficient dose of Workshop content focused on increasing condom use specifically with main partners. Changing sexual risk behaviors in main partnerships is hampered by issues of trust and power dynamics compared to other sexual contacts and effective intervention models tend to involve both partners to achieve behavior change. As there is inconsistent evidence on whether depression is associated with sexual risk behavior [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it is also possible that decreasing depressive symptoms would not have an effect on condom use as much as individual risk reduction counseling, which both conditions received. However, it is notable that at 12 months, over half of the study participants continued to report unprotected vaginal and/or anal sex with their main partners suggesting the need to continue to focus on these dyadic risk behaviors. With regard to non-main sexual partners, we observed a statistically significant effect at T2 however this was not sustained at the 12 month period. We have observed similar results in condom use with non-main partners in a prior HIV prevention intervention[<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is also possible that sexual partners are a significant source of social support and as the Workshop focused on bolstering social support, participants may have spent more time with their partners and hence had the opportunity for unprotected sex.</p><p>There are a number of limitations of this study that should be noted. First, the lack of equal attention control diminishes our ability to conclude that behavioral changes were specific to the intervention content versus attention alone. We observed a statistically significant time effect for all outcomes which suggests that holding a single session that provides resources for addressing depression may be sufficient for short term improvements in CES-D and HIV risk behaviors. However, as a greater proportion of the participants in the intervention arm were homeless and had seen a mental health professional in the prior 6 months, this suggests that 10 sessions focused on skills building and practice may be a minimum amount to achieve a sustained decrease in depressive symptoms in marginalized populations. The difference in number of sessions also resulted in an imbalance of net monetary incentives. Notably, retention did not vary by arm which suggests that the incentives contributed to the excellent group attendance rates but may not have bolstered effects of the intervention.</p><p>Second, this was a convenience sample of older, predominately black people who use drugs, which included both injection and non-injection users. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to people who use drugs in different geographic locations or younger populations. Third, this study relied on self-reported measures of injection drug and sexual risk behaviors. While we utilized ACASI to minimize bias, risk behaviors at follow-up may have been under-reported. Fourth, the two conditions were not balanced at baseline in terms of homelessness and seeing a mental health professional, which may have attenuated the Workshop effects. Finally, our study cannot determine whether or not drug use contributed to depression or whether depression preceded the drug use [<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>These limitations notwithstanding, the results of this trial suggest that the Workshop is an approach to reducing depressive symptoms and may affect injection drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Participants in this study were trained to use CBT skills without the psycho-educational methods of written self-assessments and workbook activities[<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and therefore is more accessible to populations with low literacy. The intervention was implemented by facilitators who were not mental health professionals. This may enable wider dissemination and implementation to community-based agencies and substance abuse treatment centers who cannot afford psychologists or licensed social workers. This study adds to other evidence-based programs that aim to target depression co-occurring with other health outcomes such as substance use[<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and improving medical adherence[<xref rid="pone.0187180.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Such integrated approaches acknowledge the co-morbidities among substance users that ought to be addressed simultaneously given their often mutually reinforcing nature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187180.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Description of Workshop sessions.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187180.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187180.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187180.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187180.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Workshop protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187180.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187180.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lansky</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Finlayson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Holtzman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wejnert</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mitsch</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
