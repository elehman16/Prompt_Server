IRB approval was granted at Hannover Medical School, Germany on May 22, 2009. For allocation of participants, a 1:1 ratio randomization was performed using opaque envelopes for the concealment of allocation. Reporting: according to CONSORT 2010. Eligible patients were females aged 18 or over and 65 or younger with cellulite with documented cellulite 1&#x000b0;-4&#x000b0; according to the N&#x000fc;rnberger score. Exclusion criteria were suspected or evident pregnancy, no cellulite, no informed consent or age under 18 years or above 65 years. Patients were recruited by advertisements in local regional newspapers and via the Internet. Analysis: Intention-to-treat. Outcome parameters: a) Photonumeric severity scale, b) N&#x000fc;rnberger Score, c) circumference measurements, d) capillary blood flow, e) tissue oxygen saturation, f) postcapillary venous blood flow. Intervention group: Six sessions of extracorporeal focused shock wave for six sessions (2000 impulses, 0,25 mJ/m2 every 1-2 weeks) at both gluteal and thigh regions plus a specific gluteal strength exercise training. Control group: Six sessions of sham extracorporeal focused shock wave for six sessions (2000 impulses, 0,01 mJ/m2 every 1-2 weeks) at both gluteal and thigh regions plus a specific gluteal strength exercise training. Follow-up: 12 weeks.

Hannover Medical School is a University Hospital with 7040 employees, among them 1221 physicians and 2839 medical students. In 2009, 1444 clinical beds achieved 54628 stationary cases with a 90% bed occupancy rate. This trial is a single center randomised-controlled trial.</p><p>Hannover had on June 30, 2009 a population of 519212 people with 272541 females accounting for 51.8%. 77,378 people were aged below 18 (14,7%), 128,855 60 years or older (24.5%). Uncontrolled prevalence report estimate up to 85% of females suffering from cellulite of various degrees. This elaboration provides some further information whether the settings and locations used in this study are relevant for another given avid reader in terms of external validity, since the results obtained here do not necessarily correlate to a different environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><sec><title>(CONSORT Item 4a)</title><p>Eligible patients were females aged 18 or over and 65 or younger with cellulite who met the eligibility criteria with documented cellulite 1&#x000b0;-4&#x000b0; according to the N&#x000fc;rnberger score. Exclusion criteria were suspected or evident pregnancy, no cellulite, no informed consent or age under 18 years or above 65 years. Patients were recruited by advertisements in local regional newspapers and via the Internet. Some patients from the United States used the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov">http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> reference to approach and seek for participation. Given the broad inclusion criteria in terms of age (18-65 years) and degree of cellulite (N&#x000fc;nberger score 1&#x000b0;-4&#x000b0;) we thought to improve external validity, which is generalisability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, in terms of gender, female participants are the minority of randomized-controlled trials per se. An analysis of published RCTs from 1994 to 2006 revealed that patients were excluded for age in 72% and for female gender in 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which limits external validity of a given RCT.

Acoustic wave are sound wave characterised by high pressure in comparison to ambient pressure. The generation of sound waves used for medical application are generated extracorporeal, thus extracorporeal acoustic wave therapy or shock wave therapy. As acoustic waves propagate according to the laws of acusto-optics, any change in the acoustic properties might cause an impedance jump at the border of tissues. Energy will thus be released in the target tissue, such as lymphangion contraction and improved permeability of cellular membranes in terms of acoustic wave therapy.</p><p>In order to increase the motivation of the participating females we added a daily home-based gluteal strength exercise program. Twice a day (in the morning and the evening) two different exercises were performed with 15 repetitions for each leg (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a/b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a/b</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>First exercise (15 repetitions per leg twice a day over 12 weeks)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6874-10-29-2"/></fig><p>The daily workup was noted in a exercise log to improve participants' compliance.</p><p>This elaboration was that detailed in order to provide the reader with sufficient detail to replicate the intervention in a similar fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and to meet the CONSORT recommendations for reporting of randomised trials of non-pharmacologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><sec><title>(CONSORT Item 6a)</title><p>The <bold>primary endpoint </bold>with respect to efficacy of the combined extracorporeal shock wave therapy and gluteal strength exercises vs. sham extracorporeal shock wave therapy and the same gluteal strength exercise program was the change on digital photographs.</p><p>Given the recent publication of a photonumeric severity score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] providing reliable, comprehensive, and reproducible severities from 0 to 15 we added this tool in 2009 during the recruiting phase in contrast to the initially proposed N&#x000fc;rnberger and M&#x000fc;ller score documented in the ClinicalTrials.gov file.
