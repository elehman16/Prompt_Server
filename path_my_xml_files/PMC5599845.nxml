current therapy on the waist circumference and visceral fat length in obese women.
[Subjects and Methods] In this study, we selected 30 patients whose body mass index was
over 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive interferential
current therapy three times a week for four weeks (n=15) and transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation three times a week for four weeks (n=15). Waist circumference was
measured in&#x02005;cm using a tape measure with the participant in an upright posture, and the
length of visceral fat was measured using a high-resolution, B-mode ultrasound machine.
[Results] There was a statistically significant difference between the group of waist
circumference and visceral fat length. The change of waist circumference and visceral fat
length was larger the experimental group than the control group. [Conclusion] These
results can be used as a basis for reducing the risk factors that increase mortality due
to diseases and can prevent cardiovascular and other adult diseases caused by obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>ICT</kwd><kwd>Visceral fat length</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity, which is increasing day by day in modern people, causes psychological and social
depression and increases the risk of adult diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis,
diabetes, and hyperlipidemia<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it
has been reported that the distribution of fat tissue in the body is more important than the
degree of obesity in many metabolic and ischemic cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is closely
linked to cardiovascular diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, high
blood pressure, and it is reported that a high body mass index (BMI) increases hypertension,
type II diabetes, and coronary artery disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abdominal obesity, rather than systemic or metabolic obesity, is a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease and should be reduced with diet, exercise, and
medication. Recent studies have shown that excess body fat is more closely related than
overweight to obesity-related metabolic disease complications, and abdominal fat, especially
visceral fat, has been acknowledged to be metabolically more significant than body fat<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there are some differences depending on its cause, methods for managing obesity
can roughly be classified as dietary therapy, exercise therapy, drug therapy, and electric
stimulation therapy<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are many
differences in the most effective ways to reduce obesity, and there are many ways to manage
obesity. With regard to electric stimulation therapy, interferential current therapy (ICT)
is used to effectively stimulate deep tissues while minimizing skin resistance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low-frequency therapy has a disadvantage in
that the stimulation time is relatively long due to the use of a frequency of less than
1,000&#x02005;Hz, which is not effective in reducing skin resistance and excessively stimulates the
sensory nerve, thereby causing pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. On
the other hand, ICT uses a base medium frequency that is between 3,000&#x02005;Hz and 6,000&#x02005;Hz. This
type of wave therapy generally combines two similar currents, such as 4,000&#x02005;Hz and 4,100&#x02005;Hz,
to induce an interfering current in the range of 1&#x02005;Hz&#x02013;100&#x02005;Hz at the desired treatment site.
There are several factors that affect the ICT effect: main frequency, beat frequency, beat
duration, electrode type, and position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>ICT has been used in clinical practice to reduce pain and is particularly effective in the
treatment of back pain, skeletal pain, temporomandibular joint pain, and fracture. This type
of therapy has been shown to increase blood circulation, subcutaneous tissue metabolism
activation, and lymphatic and venous return, and is effective in relaxing muscular
tension/muscle stimulation and in the treatment of psoriasis, edema reduction, and improved
lipolytic effect in the frequency region. However, the exact mechanism has not yet been
clarified<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, the indiscriminate use of some devices or drugs can partially remove or reduce
fat, but the results of these treatments have been rarely studied. There have been many
studies on the reduction of subcutaneous fat mass, but the research on the reduction of
visceral fat volume is insufficient. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
effects of ICT on the waist circumference and visceral fat length in obese women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with obese women who were hospitalized and were not taking
medication for diabetes, endocrine disease, renal dysfunction, oral contraception,
hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. The BMI of selected study participants was measured via the
bioimpedance analysis method, using direct measurement with eight electrodes and an InBody
3.0 machine (InBody Biospace, Seoul, Korea). The patients, whose feet were bare and who were
dressed in the lightest possible attire, were placed on the machine; both hands and both
thumbs were then placed on the electrode.</p><p>In this study, we selected 30 patients whose BMI was over 25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and whose
Beck Depression Inventory score was over 16. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive
interferential current therapy three times a week for four weeks (n=15) and transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation three times a week for four weeks (n=15). All the subjects
understood the purpose of this study. And this study&#x02019;s subjects provided their written
informed consent prior to their participation according as the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>An interfering current therapy device (Nemectron GmbH, Germany) was used as follows: cuffs
were wrapped around the participant&#x02019;s abdomen during 45-minute sessions, three times a week,
(a total of 12 times for 4 weeks). The program configuration was applied for 5 minutes at
the interferential wave frequency of 3&#x02005;Hz, then 30 minutes at 50&#x02005;Hz, and 10 minutes at
10&#x02005;Hz. TENS was applied to the abdomen using a low-frequency electrical stimulator (STT-100,
Stratek, Korea). The stimulation parameters of the triangle wave were applied at 100&#x02005;Hz
three times a week, once for 45 minutes (for 4 weeks). All treatment interventions were
performed within the tolerance level of the patient, and the treatment was performed by a
physical therapist who had at least 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience.</p><p>Waist circumference was measured in&#x02005;cm using a tape measure with the participant in an
upright posture, and the length of visceral fat was measured using a high-resolution, B-mode
ultrasound machine (HDI 5000, ATL, Phillips). The visceral fat length was measured at 1&#x02005;cm
above the navel with a 3.5&#x02005;MHz probe with the subject lying in a comfortable position. The
visceral fat length was defined as the length from the inner surface of the abdominal wall
to the anterior wall of the aorta. Pre-tests were completed before the experiment, and
post-tests were performed 4 weeks after the experiment.</p><p>The values of result were stated in mean &#x000b1; SD. PASW 18.0 for window was used for
statistical analysis in this study. To analyze the difference between before and after
interventions, paired t-test was used. Furthermore, independent t-test was used again to
compare the differences between two groups. The level of significance was &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The length of the waist circumference was statistically significant in all groups in the

methods of obesity management are required<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
interfering current therapy on abdominal visceral fat length and waist circumference.</p><p>Obesity, a nutritional disorder in which there is an excess accumulation of fat tissue in
the body, is caused by an increase in fat cells and abnormal differentiation due to energy
imbalances<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adipocytes that cause
obesity function only as an energy reservoir, and it has recently been learned that various
protein hormones are secreted from endocrine organs and play an important role in regulating
the body&#x02019;s energy metabolism, including that of glucose and fat<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, although adipose tissue is an essential factor in
the physiological process of the human body, an excessive accumulation of fat is a major
cause of cardiovascular and other diseases in adults. At present, Korea is experiencing the
same situation as Western countries: Social health costs are increasing, and the state of
public health is decreasing, due to an upsurge in various chronic diseases caused by
obesity, a problem that is worsening<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The distribution of central body fat, due to an increase in abdominal obesity, has been
shown to be a potential factor in high morbidity and mortality rates. The lack of physical
activity and excessive energy intake is increasing the risk of developing obesity due to
diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. In general, the
risk of complications from obesity increases with the obesity level<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, while the amount of excess fat should be
considered, fat distribution in the body is also important: Fats in the abdominal viscera
are more significant health threats than fat in other areas. Therefore, the reduction of
abdominal fat due to weight loss may be a way to reduce the risk of obesity<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is now well known that increased abdominal fat tissue is a more important determinant of
metabolic and cardiovascular disease than diabetes. Since Koreans are smaller than European
people, the standard of abdominal obesity is more than 94&#x02005;cm for men and 80&#x02005;cm for women.
However, there have been an insufficient number of valid studies to determine whether
abdominal obesity is appropriate for the waist circumference<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, clinical treatment for obesity includes drug therapy, lipolysis, IMS,
electrotherapy (mid-frequency and low-frequency), and cognitive behavioral therapy. Physical
therapy for obesity management has long been applied via water therapy, electrotherapy, and
stimulation therapy. However, as the application of exercise programs due to busy daily
lives becomes difficult, obesity management using electrotherapy has begun to attract
attention<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. ICT for obesity management
is a non-invasive method, and the higher the frequency, the less capacitance resistance
(i.e., the current can easily pass through the skin). Based on the above description,
interferential wave therapy can stimulate internal tissues effectively, with less irritation
to the skin compared to low-frequency currents<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of this study consisted of fewer subjects and shorter treatment
intervention periods (4 weeks). It would be difficult to generalize the results of the study
because they represent evaluations of waist circumference and length of abdominal visceral
fat only. Because the duration of the treatment intervention was only 4 weeks, we were
unable to determine the long-term effects of therapeutic intervention.</p><p>The results of this study showed that interventional current therapy applied to the abdomen
could reduce the waist circumference and visceral fat length. These results can be used as a
basis for reducing the risk factors that increase mortality due to diseases and can prevent
cardiovascular and other adult diseases caused by obesity. The results of this study can be
used as basic data with which to develop treatment equipment that can reduce abdominal
visceral fat more precisely and comprehensively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Korea National University of Transportation 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Rahmouni</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Obesity-associated hypertension: recent progress in
