When conventional therapy is found inadequate to attain periodontal health in chronic periodontitis, local antimicrobial agents have been used as an adjunct with scaling and root planning (SRP) which has reproduced encouraging results. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the new sustained released local drug Chlosite clinically and microbiologically in smokers and non-smokers.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The patients were grouped into experimental group A treated with SRP plus Chlosite (SRP + CHL), experimental group B treated with Chlosite alone (CHL), and control group C treated only with SRP alone. A total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) participated in this study. The clinical parameters, Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Bleeding index (BI), and Relative attachment level (RAL), were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>On comparison of smokers and non-smokers, in SRP group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In SRP + CHL group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to BI and GI and smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to PI. There was no significant gain in RAL of both smokers and non-smokers. In CHL group, both smokers and non-smokers showed a nonsignificant reduction in BI, GI, and RAL, but smokers showed a significant reduction in PI as compared with non-smokers. All the groups showed reduction in the microbial count of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> which were found to be statistically not significant when it was compared between non-smokers and smokers.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Interpretation and Conclusion:</title><p>In this study, all treatment groups were found to be efficacious in the treatment of periodontal disease as demonstrated by improvement in PI, GI, BI, and RAL. Combination of SRP and Chlosite resulted in added benefits compared with the two treatment groups.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chlosite</kwd><kwd>chronic periodontitis</kwd><kwd>microbial count</kwd><kwd>xanthan gel</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Traditionally, periodontal disease therapy has been directed to altering the periodontal environment to one that is less conducive to the retention of bacterial plaque in the vicinity of gingival tissues. With the increasing awareness of the bacterial etiology of periodontal diseases,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] and in particular the hypothesis that specific bacteria are involved,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] a more direct approach, using antibacterial agents has become an integral part of the therapeutic armamentarium. Recently, a new sustained local drug delivery chlorhexidine (CHX) with xanthan gel, Chlosite (1.5% of CHX in 0.5 ml of xanthan gel) has been introduced. Therefore, it was deemed important to evaluate the efficacy of this drug clinically and microbiologically in the treatment of chronic periodontitis smoker and non-smoker patients. The objective of the study is to determine the effect of chlosite as a monotherapy, chlosite compared with scaling and root planning (SRP), chlosite with SRP (combination therapy), and to determine the efficacy of chlosite on periodontopathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) with periodontal pockets measuring 5 to 7 mm in different quadrants of mouth were selected, between 20 to 50 years from Outpatient Department of Periodontics College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India. The Ethical committee of College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India, approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>The study included patients diagnosed as suffering from chronic generalized periodontitis. Patient selected had periodontal pocket measuring 5-7 mm in depth in different quadrants of the mouth and signs of bone loss on clinical and radiographic examination were observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, teeth with furcation involvement, and patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to CHX were excluded from the study. These patients did not receive any periodontal therapy for past 6 months and were free of any systemic diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The selected sites were randomly divided into 3 groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Site selected for study 26 (Mesial)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-221-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of sites involved in treatment modalities of different groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-15-221-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Prior to SRP, each selected site was subjected to assessment of the following clinical parameter: Plaque index (PI) (Silness and Loe),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Gingival index (GI) (Loe and Silness),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Bleeding index (BI) (Ainamo and Bay),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Relative attachment level (RAL) using UNC-15 periodontal probe, subgingival microbiological plaque samples.

The gel was administered in experimental site A (SRP plus Chlosite) and experimental site B (Chlosite only) on &#x02018;0&#x02019; day. The periodontal pocket was washed with distilled water and then dried with paper points before subgingival administration of Chlosite.

Chlosite undergoes a progressive process of imbibition, and gets physically removed from the application site within 10 to 30 days, making a follow-up visit for removal of the material unnecessary. After the treatment, patients were instructed to avoid eating hard, crunchy or sticky foods for one week, and postpone brushing for 12 hours period, as well as touching the treated areas.

Attempts to prolong the subgingival application of CHX by incorporation of an antiseptic in a gel have not resulted in improved treatment outcomes,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] However, with the use of chlosite, effective subgingival concentration of CHX can be maintained for several days. The physical properties of xanthan render it an optimum substrate for the formation of a stable gel that is easily extruded from a syringe needle; therefore, xanthan appears to be the best biocompatible vehicle for clinical application.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>In non-smokers, the mean reduction in PI from &#x02018;0&#x02019; to 90<sup>th</sup> day was 83.3 and 84.6% for SRP and SRP + CHL, respectively.
