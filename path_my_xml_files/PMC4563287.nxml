reaching training in chronic stroke patients and to investigate subsequent changes in
trunk control, dynamic balance, and gait. [Subject] Twenty-three chronic stroke patients
were randomly divided into two groups, with 10 patients in the forward bending of the
trunk and reaching group and 13 patients in the control group. [Methods] Both groups
underwent 30 minutes of rehabilitation therapy, five days a week, for four weeks. The
forward bending of the trunk and reaching group additionally performed forward bending of
the trunk and reaching training five times a week for four weeks, which involved four sets
of pressing buttons 35 times, for a total of 140 button presses per session. The subjects
were tested before and after training using the Trunk Impairment Scale, Berg Balance
Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, Six-Minute Walking Test, and 10-Meter Walking Test. Trunk
control, dynamic balance, and walking ability were compared between the two groups.
[Result] The results of the study showed that the results of the Trunk Impairment Scale,
Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go Test, Six-Minute Walking Test improved significantly
in the FBR group, while there were no significant differences in the control group.
[Conclusion] This study results suggest that forward bending of the trunk and reaching
training can be an effective exercise method for chronic stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Postural control</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Trunk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke generally leads to greater postural instability, a shift of balance to the
non-paralyzed side, an asymmetrical posture, and muscle weakening compared with healthy
individuals<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is usually a result
of neurological damage to the sensory and motor processes of the postural control system,
which leads to a decline in the awareness of physical balance required to maintain a precise
orientation of the trunk<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such postural
control deficits following stroke impair walking ability and interfere with a functionally
independent lifestyle; furthermore, they cause a high risk of falling, because of
impairments in voluntarily shifting the center of mass during the performance of activities
of daily living and everyday tasks<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neurological damage to sensory and motor processes has a negative effect on activities of
daily living. In order to minimize this, stroke patients receive diverse rehabilitation
therapies to improve their ability to lead a functionally independent lifestyle<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the loss of balance control
in stroke patients resulting from loss of trunk control leads to declining motor function in
the upper and lower limbs on the paralyzed side, leading to secondary impairments, such as
in walking<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, thereby requiring recuperative training to increase trunk control
and improve balance and walking ability.</p><p>The movement of bending the trunk forwards while keeping the arms extended has been used in
clinical rehabilitation as postural control training for tasks, and clinical therapists have
attempted to develop &#x02018;reach for taget&#x02019; activities to help stroke patients adapt their
posture after paralysis. This can promote postural movements in stroke patients according to
the position of the target to be reached and the distance and direction, and so it is
assumed to improve the ability to solve daily postural difficulties<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke patients, performing external tasks, such as
reaching for a target while considering direction and distance, promotes sensory and motor
performance, and by finding ways to adapt to changes in posture, these exercises can improve
posture and prevent falling<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several researchers have studied the effect of target distance (near vs. far in the
sagittal plane) when performing the action of bending forwards and extending the arms in
postural activities<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional movements,
such as moving the torso while extending the arms, require movements of the trunk<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, so they can help to develop the trunk
muscles in hemiparesis patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, while actions that require extending the
arms to touch external targets in different directions and distances have been found to
improve sensory processes and adaptation to postural changes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The aims of this study were to implement training in chronic stroke patients involving
extending the arm in a seated or standing position while varying the direction and distance
of the target in relation to the frontal and sagittal planes and to investigate the effects
of this training on trunk control, dynamic balance, and walking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in this study were 23 patients who were diagnosed with hemiparesis resulting

The study was performed in
accordance with International Ethical Guidelines and Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by a local institutional review board. The selection criteria were as follows: more
than six months since stroke, so as to minimize the effects of natural recovery; ability to
follow and understand the researcher&#x02019;s instructions and sufficient cognitive ability as
demonstrated by a score of over 24 points on the Mini-mental State Examination-Korean
(MMSE-K); ability to walk at least 10 m, irrespective of the use of assistive tools; and
sufficient eyesight to perform the exercises. The exclusion criteria were lower motor neuron
disease and orthopedic disease.</p><p>The subjects were divided randomly into a forward bending of the trunk and reaching (FBR)
group and a control group. Pre-testing was conducted before training and post-testing was
conducted after training. The FBR group and control group both underwent the same ordinary
rehabilitation therapy of five 30-minute sessions a week for four weeks, while the FBR group
additionally underwent FBR training, which involved four sets of pressing a button 35 times
for a total of 140 presses per session, five sessions a week, for four weeks.</p><p>For the FBR training group, we adapted the movements from the experiment of Chern et al.
with modifications. Using SuperLap 2.04 (Cedrus, San Pedro, CA, USA), the patients performed
random button pressing training by watching a laptop screen and pressing six buttons (3
directions &#x000d7; 2 distances) on a table set at knee-height. The laptop was placed on top of the
table at an adjustable height, so that the exercise could be performed while watching the
laptop screen. After setting the height of the table to the subject&#x02019;s knee height, the
distances to the buttons were set at 10% and 30% of the subject&#x02019;s height, and the directions
were set at straight ahead and 45&#x000b0; to either side of the midline. The buttons were connected
to the laptop running SuperLap program, and each button was fixed to the table at one of the
six locations (2 distances &#x000d7; 3 directions).</p><p>The laptop screen depicted six circles on a white background, with the positions of the
circles corresponding to those of the buttons on the table. When a button turned red, the
subject was to press the corresponding button on the table and then stand upright. Each time
circle turned red, which occurred in random order, the subject was to press the
corresponding button on the table and then stand upright. The training program was conducted
for four weeks, five sessions a week, with each session consisting of four sets of 35 button
presses, for a total of 140 button presses per day. The experiment was conducted for a total
of six weeks, with both groups undergoing assessment three days before and after
training.</p><p>In order to assess the stroke patients&#x02019; trunk impairments, we used the Trunk Impairment
Scale (TIS), which has proven reliability and validity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is composed of 17 items, and is a tool used to assess static and
dynamic control and coordination of the trunk in a seated position, in which posture can be
assessed for trunk movement disorders. Static balance consists of three items and has a max
score of 7 points, dynamic stability consists of ten items and has a max score of 10 points,
and coordination consists of four items and has a max score of 6 points; the max total score
is 23 points. Higher scores signify better trunk control.</p><p>To assess the patients&#x02019; balance, we used the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which has high
intra-rater and inter-rater reliability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The assessment items consist of three domains, sitting, standing,
and postural change. With a minimum of 0 points and a maximum of 4 points for each of the 14
items, the max total score is 56. A higher score signifies better balance. The Timed Up and
Go (TUG) test is an instrument with proven intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and can
quickly measure functional mobility, movement capability, and balance. It involves measuring
the time to get up from a chair with armrests, walk forward 3 m, turn around, walk back to
the chair and then sit back down in the chair<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study performed the Six-Minute Walking Test to evaluate the level of movements and
endurance whilst walking. In the Six-Minute Walking Test, subjects repeat walking 30&#x02005;m in a
straight line to cover the greatest distance possible in six minutes. Walking speed and rest
time were left for the individual to control in keeping with their own ability. In order to
eliminate confounding errors from motivational stimulation during walking, the only words
spoken were the remaining time and a phrase allowed by the guidelines: &#x0201c;Keep going&#x0201d;<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This test was reported to have high
reliability<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We performed the 10-Meter Walking Test to measure walking speed<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects walked a total of 13&#x02005;m at the speed that
they felt was most stable and comfortable, and the time required to traverse the middle 10&#x02005;m
was measured, excluding the 1.5&#x02005;m at the start and end-points.</p><p>To analyze the collected data, this study used SPSS ver. 12.0 for all data processing. For
the subjects&#x02019; general characteristics, we used descriptive statistics. In order to
investigate intergroup differences, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test, and in order to
compare pre-AFE training and post-training results in both groups, we performed a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. The statistical significance level for all data was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the TIS, the FBR group showed a significant improvement after training (p&#x0003c;0.05),

maintaining stability and in motor functions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, rehabilitation therapy is
required for improving balance and postural control in patients with hemiparesis following a
stroke. In this study, we divided stroke hemiparesis patients into a group performing
ordinary physiotherapy and FBR training five times a week for four weeks and a group
performing only ordinary physiotherapy, to investigate the effects of FBR training on trunk
control, dynamic balance, and walking.</p><p>The movement of reaching out an arm towards a target varying in distance and direction
during the performance of everyday tasks requires adaptation of postural changes through the
action of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems in order to maintain a stable dynamic
posture<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Voluntary movement of
the upper limb when sitting or standing provides stability to the center of the trunk<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the results of this study, the group that underwent FBR training showed a
significant increase of 3.9 points in the TIS, from 11.70&#x000b1;3.77 points before training to
15.60&#x000b1;4.01 points after training, meaning that trunk control improved significantly. The
control group that only underwent ordinary physiotherapy did not show a significant
increase, and when the before-after change was compared between the two groups, the FBR
training group showed a significantly greater change. Regarding dynamic balance, the FBR
training group showed a significant increase in the BBS from 37.30&#x000b1;6.53 points before
training to 44.40&#x000b1;6.26 points after training, while it showed a significant decrease in the
TUG test, from 34.29&#x000b1;22.05 point before training to 30.0&#x000b1;17.95 points after training. The
control group showed no significant difference for either test. The difference in
before-after change between the training and control groups was significant only for the
BBS. This shows that the FBR training also improved dynamic balance significantly.</p><p>Activation and strengthening of the trunk muscles is required for functional recovery of
impaired trunk control in stroke patients<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional movements, such as extending the arm, have been shown
in previous studies to improve trunk movements and muscle strength in hemiparesis patients
because they require movement of the trunk<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Among assessments of trunk control, the TIS consists of items evaluating coordination when
emphasizing lateral rotation of the pectoral girdle and the pelvis, and the separate upper
and lower limb movements that follow from this<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The training in this study, bending the trunk forwards and reaching
out the arm straight ahead, 45&#x000b0; to the right or 45&#x000b0; to the left, to press a button in a
horizontal plane, involved lateral movements of the trunk through rotation of the pelvis and
pectoral girdle and simultaneous separate movements of the upper and lower limbs, such as
reaching out with the upper limb and squatting with the lower limbs. This is similar to the
items in the TIS examining at coordination, and the significant improvement that the FBR
training group showed in the TIS before and after training is thought to indicate
improvement in trunk control resulting from improved movement and strength of the trunk
muscles.</p><p>The movement of extending the arm while using the whole trunk is similar to the movement of
extending the arm forwards from a squat position<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is a position that requires dynamic balance, like postures
commonly required in everyday life, such as using the toilet, sitting on a chair, walking
down stairs, and picking up an object from the top of a shelf<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study by Yao<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, stroke patients with large movements in center of pressure
trajectory were reported to have higher BBS scores, and in a study by Chern et al., BBS
scores were also reported to be higher for stroke patients performing dynamic movements that
used the whole trunk, such as arm extension, compared with maintaining a static posture.
With similar training movements to those used in this study, there was no significant
increase in BBS in the control group before and after training, but in the FBR group showed
a significant increase in BBS and a significantly greater before-after change compared with
the control group, demonstrating that dynamic balance improved. There was no significant
decrease in the TUG test in the control group before and after training, but there was a
significant decrease in the FBR training group. This is similar to the results of a study by
Karatas et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which dynamic
balance improved with improved strength of the trunk flexion muscles. In the training for
this study, when bending forwards and extending the arm, movement of the trunk flexion
muscles was required, and in the TUG test<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, abdominal and trunk rotation muscles were required to walk 3 m,
turn around, return to the original position, and sit down. In the training for the current
study, bending forward and extending the arm for each of the 140 presses required flexion
and rotation of the trunk. The significant decrease of the FBR training group in the TUG
test, which assesses dynamic balance, demonstrates an improvement in dynamic balance.</p><p>In the walking tests, the FBR training group showed a significant improvement in the
Six-Minute Walk Test from 134.30&#x02005;m before training to 152.30&#x02005;m after training, but the
control group did not show any significant difference. In 10-Meter Walk Test, neither the
FBR training group nor the control group showed a significant difference, but the time
required to walk 10&#x02005;m decreased in the FBR training group. The Six-Minute Walk Test reflects
endurance in walking and is used to assess patients with limited walking ability due to
stroke, including that resulting from muscular weakness, stiffness, and impaired control and
balance in the lower limb<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The movement of extending the arm forwards from a
squatting position, like in this study, requires simultaneous movement of the trunk and
lower limbs, so it can increase trunk movements and lower limb muscle strength in stroke
patients, making symmetrical movements of the body easier<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hausdorff et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that asymmetrical movements when walking can increase
energy consumption and that increases in symmetrical movements in stroke patients reduce the
effort required to walk, so these movements can improve walking ability. In relation to
this, after training, patients showed a significant increase in endurance during walking,
and walking speed also increased, although this increase was not significant.</p><p>Because this study was conducted on only a limited group of hemiparesis patients, it has
limitations in terms of generalization to all hemiparesis patients. The small number of
patients and the lack of sufficient control for other movements in the subjects&#x02019; daily lives
outside of training are also possible confounding factors of this study. In the future, more
research will be required to investigate the clinical improvement effects of FBR on trunk
control, dynamic balance, and walking.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Sahmyook University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ros&#x000e9;n</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Sunnerhagen</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kreuter</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Fear of falling, balance, and gait velocity in patients
