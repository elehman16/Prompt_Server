A recent report by the World Health Organization revealed that 50% of patients with chronic disease do not take their medication as prescribed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Literature review revealed that 41.2&#x02013;49.5% persons with schizophrenia were nonadherent to their prescribed treatment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It is estimated that medication nonadherence for unipolar and bipolar disorders ranges from 10% to 60% with median 40%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Chakraborty <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] had found that 88% of the patients on antidepressant missed the medication within 25% of days of 3 months period in an Indian setting. The consequences of nonadherence can be devastating in persons with mental illnesses. The risk of relapse increases three to five-fold on stopping antipsychotic medication.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The gap of treatment for 1-month or less is found to be associated with 2.8 times risk of admission to hospital in a year, and the gap of more than a month increases the risk by nearly 4 times.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Failure in adherence to prescribed medication regimen can lead to disease complications, reduced functional abilities and lowered quality of life.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Furthermore, the risk of suicide is found to be 3.75 times higher in persons with schizophrenia who are nonadherent than in those who are adherent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Treatment adherence can be improved with various measures. Velligan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that Cognitive Adaptation Training such as signs, checklists, alarms, and the organization of belongings to cue improve the medication adherence. Counseling about drug treatment improves the treatment adherence with a significant reduction in clinical symptoms of major depression.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Considering the above, need for testing the efficacy of evidenced-based strategies dealing with the issues related treatment adherence in Indian setting was felt. The current pilot study was conducted with the aim to find out the effectiveness of specific interventions to improve the treatment adherence of person with mental illness.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>

Initially issues of treatment adherence were identified and encouraged the positive consequences in the treatment process, which was similar to enhancing motivation. Psycho-education, explanation of individualistic behavior tailoring or memory cues, demonstration of preparing and use of pill boxes along with distribution of information booklet were included in specific intervention. Memory cues are the prompts that help in recalling the medication taking, e.g., keeping an alarm on mobile, keeping medicines on dining table, marking in the calendar, taking medication after some particular daily activities such as daily prayer, meals, etc. Entire interventions were provided to the patients and their family members in two sessions, in the same day. The specific intervention module was validated by experts from mental health services.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both descriptive and inferential analyses of collected data were done using SPSS 16.0 version.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Description of socio-demographic and clinical variables of the person with mental illness</title><p>Descriptive statistics for socio-demographic variables showed that, mean age of the persons with mental illness was 39.2 years.

Majority of the participants in the current study were found to be married which is similar with the findings of the study conducted by Ran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The mental health care setting conducts community extension clinic twice in every month at the further end of the district, so majority of the participants were from within 50 km distance from the study setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Treatment adherence</title><p>Treatment adherence as measured by the MARS showed increased mean value from 7.2 (standard deviation [SD] 2.11) to 8.3 (SD 1.56) after specific intervention indicating improvement in adherence. Similarly, as rated by the family members, the mean score of Treatment Adherence Checklist increased from 14.77 (SD 2.69) to 16.07 (SD 1.46) after specific intervention. These results are comparable with the result of a study by Montes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Effectiveness of specific interventions on treatment adherence</title><p>The result of the current study in improvement of treatment adherence according to patients, as well as their family members, is similar with other studies. A study by Farooq <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention involving a family member in improvement of treatment adherence showed similar result where participants in the treatment group had better adherence (67.3%) than control group (45.5%), <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02. In another randomized control trial by Agara and Onibi[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found significant improvement (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0009) in treatment compliance, followed by psycho-education in the experimental group. A study by Ran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed significant higher treatment compliance in the group receiving family psycho-education along with drug treatment in comparison to the group receiving only drug treatment and patients in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>A study conducted by Swanson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] had found that patients who received Motivational Interview along with Standard Treatment showed significant higher proportion of attending outpatient appointments than the who were on only Standard Treatment (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 8.87, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0). This result is congruent with the current study where motivational component were included in the specific interventions.</p><p>One of the components used in the intervention of the present study was a demonstration of preparation and use of pill box, which is also evidence-based. A systematic review[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reveals improved adherence and clinical symptoms, followed by unit-of-packaging of medications prescribed for various communicable and noncommunicable diseases. A randomized control trial[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed significant increased medication adherence (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in patients and family members receiving a pill box along with education and pamphlet in comparison to patients receiving only education and distribution of pamphlet.</p><p>The current study had found no association between the treatment adherence with socio-demographic and clinical variables of the patients. This result is similar with a randomized control trial by Maddock[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] where the result showed no demographic variables to be the predictor of medication adherence. Another study by Montes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] had found no significant difference in gender, living status, duration of illness between patients with optimal and sub-optimal medication adherence with exception to with age and employment status.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The current study has few limitations such as weak research design, small sample size and had no control over the type of medication prescribed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Treatment adherence in persons with mental illness is possible to improve with simple interventions like psycho-education, explanation of medication information along with explaining some memory cues.
