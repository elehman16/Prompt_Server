<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>Emergency departments (EDs) are currently a main provider of treatment for minor injuries, and annual attendances are expected to increase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Emergency nurse practitioners (ENPs) are senior nurses with additional training to autonomously assess, diagnose and treat patients with selected urgent conditions, particularly minor illness and injury. ENPs are being increasingly employed in minor injuries care, and are considered as an important part of future service delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Recently extended scope physiotherapists (ESPs) have also been developed to undertake similar extended roles, including minor injuries care, but this opportunity has not been widely adopted or evaluated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>The UK College of Emergency Medicine estimates that 25% of all patients attending EDs could be managed by ENPs. It also recognises the need to utilise extensions in roles due to the increased patient demand and reduced availability of doctors that has followed recent changes in out-of-hours care provision, junior doctor training programmes (particularly reduced working hours) and national throughput standards. The use of nurses and AHPs in extended roles will therefore make a significant contribution to future minor injuries care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> No research studies were found evaluating the clinical outcomes of minor injuries management provided by ENPs and ESPs in comparison with the routine care provided by doctors.</p><p>There is a clear need to obtain robust data on the clinical and cost effectiveness of new professional roles,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> thereby facilitating evidence-based commissioning and skill mix development. When evaluating the effectiveness of new professional groups it is important to ascertain if they are at least equivalent to existing care. For this reason, trial of equivalence methodology was employed. The research aimed to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of three different healthcare professionals who independently manage minor injuries within UK EDs. This account describes the clinical effectiveness data: cost effectiveness is considered in a companion paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>This was a randomised, pragmatic trial of equivalence carried out in the inner city ED of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The aim was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of the treatment of soft tissue injury by three groups of emergency care professionals; ENPs, ESPs and doctors. The primary hypothesis was: the clinical outcome of adult patients presenting to the ED with a soft tissue injury is not the same between different healthcare practitioners. The primary alternative hypothesis was: the clinical outcome of adult patients presenting to the ED with a soft tissue injury is the same regardless of which healthcare practitioner treats them.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Trial participants were adults (older than 16&#x02005;years) presenting to the ED with a peripheral soft tissue injury who were eligible for management by all the three professional groups. Soft tissue injury was defined as a traumatic peripheral musculoskeletal injury less than 72&#x02005;h old with no associated bone fracture, ongoing prior injury or systemic disease/disorder. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: dislocated joints; recent surgery; unable to give informed consent (eg, dementia), open wounds; major deformities; opiate analgesia required; concurrent chest/rib injury; neurovascular deficits and associated fracture. The exact number of people with sport and general soft tissue injuries attending EDs is not known, but it is estimated to account for 10&#x02013;15% of all attendances.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> As approximately 16 million patients attend UK EDs on an annual basis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> this represents almost 2.5 million patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>Patients were recruited consecutively during fixed time periods in the participating ED. Recruitment took place between October 2006 and December 2007 on Mondays, Tuesdays and occasionally Thursdays between 08:30 and 17:00. These days were chosen because they were the only times when the ESP service was running in the ED. Shortly after arrival in the ED patients were provided with a written information sheet and invited to participate. Those agreeing were assessed by a researcher who obtained written consent and baseline data. Patients were then randomised using independently prepared and consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes. Block randomisation was used, with a block size of 12, allocating patients 1:1:1 into the three treatment arms: doctor (of any grade), ENP or ESP. Randomisation, patient recruitment and baseline assessments were completed away from the treatment area and did not influence the day-to-day running of the ED.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The allocated healthcare professional assessed and treated the patient according to their usual practice in the ED setting. All professionals were independently managing patients from arrival through to discharge. This is consistent with the ENP role in the NHS but the ESP role is currently developing in this capacity. The efficacy of the reference treatment in this trial (doctors of all grades managing acute soft tissue injuries) has not previously been established. Once the consultation had concluded the treating practitioner completed a brief exit questionnaire to collect treatment and process measures. The researcher was blinded to the treatment allocation and had no role in any intervention. No attempt was made to blind either the patient or treating healthcare professional thus capturing any influences this interaction may have in the real-life clinical setting. There were no changes to the clinical processes or environment during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Participants were contacted 14&#x02005;days after their ED attendance and interviewed by telephone. If no contact was possible at day 14 then the researcher attempted to contact the patient on subsequent days. If no contact was made within 5&#x02005;days no further attempts were made. Participants were re-interviewed by telephone after a further 6&#x02005;weeks had elapsed (8&#x02005;weeks after their original ED attendance).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was functional recovery.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50 R51 R52 R53 R54 R55 R56">50&#x02013;56</xref> and preference-based health utility scores using the Short Form-6D (SF-6D).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>

The number of days for which the patient was unable to work was also recorded, along with self-reported recovery.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58 R59 R60">58&#x02013;60</xref> The trial used 90% power and the sample size required in each group was 70. Allowing for a dropout rate of 30%, and to ensure that the minimum sample size was comfortably achieved, a target of 300 patients was established (100 to be treated by each professional group). Baseline characteristics were summarised by the randomisation group, with summary measures presented as mean and SD for continuous normally distributed variables, medians and IQRs for non-normally distributed variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Analysis of variance was used to analyse the primary outcome where the sample distributions were normally distributed, with a non-parametric bootstrapping technique where non-normally distributed. For the secondary outcomes, descriptive statistics were reported and Pearson's and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test used were appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided with CIs presented as appropriate. Data were analysed using SSPS V.15 and STATA V.9 software. The main analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis and a perprotocol analysis was also undertaken.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61 R62 R63 R64 R65 R66 R67 R68 R69 R70">61&#x02013;70</xref> A multiple imputation technique was used to manage the missing data with IBM SSPS 19 software and eight separate imputations were performed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 372 patients provided consent and were randomised into the trial. The number of patients who were approached but declined to participate in the trial is unknown. A CONSORT diagram is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001092F1">figure 1</xref>, and the baseline characteristics of the recruited patients are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001092TB1">table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the three treatment groups in relation to injury, age, occupation and initial pain levels. However, the number of each type of injury was too small to allow statistical analysis of between-group differences. The distribution of injury type in patients was similar between the professional groups with the exception of knee, ankle and finger injuries. There were more ankle injuries in the doctor group (n=42) compared to the ESP (n=22) and ENP groups (n=23) and the ESP group had more knee and finger injuries. Patient follow-up rates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001092F2">figure 2</xref>: at 8&#x02005;weeks these exceeded 85%, except for the doctor group where 72.3% follow-up was

We have demonstrated that all clinical outcomes were equivalent to routine care, with the exception of functional recovery at 2&#x02005;weeks where some uncertainty persists. A substantial number of patients attended their GP for further medical attention and work certification after leaving the ED, particularly those who had seen an ENP; however, the cause of this variation is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>This study provides valuable clinical effectiveness data comparing different professional groups, which can be used as the basis for decisions relating to workforce and service organisation. Follow-up rates can be poor in ED-based research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> and although we endeavoured to achieve rates in excess of 90% this was not realised, particularly in the doctor group. The cause of the lower follow-up in the doctor group is unclear and may be due to chance variation. It is possible that patients treated by doctors were more or less recovered or satisfied with their care, and therefore less likely to participate in follow-up. The number of patients who were approached but declined to enter the trial is unknown as it proved impossible to accurately collect this information in the pressured clinical environment of the study setting.</p><p>We were able to capture detail of the first 8&#x02005;weeks following injury, but have no data on longer-term recovery. It is encouraging that by 8&#x02005;weeks 86.6% of patients were &#x02018;a lot better&#x02019; or &#x02018;completely better&#x02019;, but there may still be important longer-term issues that we have overlooked. The research was undertaken at a single centre and therefore unlikely to be representative of all UK ED patients; further multicentre work is required. Since the number of practitioners was small, particularly in the ESP group, it is not clear to what extent the findings can be generalised to all ENPs and ESPs working in the ED, and confirmation of these findings in additional settings would be valuable. We confined the research to acute peripheral musculoskeletal soft tissue injury, and are therefore unable to comment on the effectiveness of ENPs and ESPs when managing other conditions, including fractures. Finally, the primary outcome measures have been validated, but not in the population recruited to this study. The DASH and LEFS were chosen because they provided the best &#x02018;fit&#x02019; at the time, but future research is needed to develop outcome measures in this area.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparison to other studies</title><p>There is only one comparable study: a non inferiority trial comparing ESPs to routine care provided by ENPs and doctors together.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> This study recruited a slightly broader patient population (including fractures and spinal injuries) and concluded that there was weak evidence that the ESP group may be inferior to routine care in the time taken to return to normal activities (p=0.071). The ESP was equivalent or superior to routine care in patient satisfaction and there were no significant differences in return to work, pain or health scores at 6&#x02005;months postinjury, although the ESP did obtain a worse health assessment questionnaire response at 3&#x02005;months postinjury (p=0.048). It is not clear why the results of this study are different to ours, but it is most likely to be related to the patient population and outcome measures, as well as potential variation in the clinicians involved.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study implications</title><p>This study validates the role of the ENP, which is becoming increasingly established as an integral component of minor injuries care, and also demonstrates that the ESP could be considered for inclusion in the usual skill mix managing this patient group. It also provides important information regarding the current routine provision of care by doctors, demonstrating that this professional group continues to represent the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019;. As all groups were found to be clinically equivalent it is other factors such as cost, workforce sustainability, service provision and skill mix that become important. This research has not set out to establish the optimum still mix required, but will assist in strategic decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Future research</title><p>While the clinical effectiveness of the different healthcare professionals has been examined and compared, the factors that influence our results remain unclear. It is difficult to identify which components of the complex interaction between professionals and patients are responsible for any particular effect. It is possible that different professionals are obtaining equivalent outcomes for different reasons, or even that all three healthcare professionals are equally ineffective with equivalence attributable solely to the effects of natural soft tissue healing; however, the use of an untreated control group would not be ethically acceptable. It would be valuable to repeat this research in other settings and with broader inclusion criteria, and to explore why the frequency of subsequent GP consultation varies between practitioners despite the fact that clinical outcomes are the same. Finally, cost effectiveness is an important consideration, and is described in a companion paper.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Over the past decade the transformation of emergency care and the development of new roles within the NHS have been profound. This research indicates that both nurses and physiotherapists with extended skills can successfully manage patients with uncomplicated soft tissue injury, achieving clinical outcomes that are equivalent to routine care by a doctor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e162" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001092.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e163" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001092.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Carey McClellan (CM) initiated the project with input to design and development from Fiona Cramp (FC), Jane Powell (JP) and Jonathan Benger (JB).
