Longitudinal interview study in breast cancer patients during and after adjuvant tamoxifen use. Menopausal status was defined by last menstrual period and serum oestradiol and FSH levels. Gynaecology outpatient clinic, Tertiary Referral Hospital, January 1995 to September 1999. Breast cancer patients &#x0003c;56 years of age, participating in a randomised trial comparing adjuvant high-dose (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;45) and standard-dose (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;53) chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy and tamoxifen. Relative incidence and correlation of subjective and psychosexual symptoms during and after tamoxifen. During tamoxifen the most frequent complaints were hot flushes (85&#x00025;), disturbed sleep (55&#x00025;), vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia (47&#x00025;), decreased sexual desire (44&#x00025;) and musculo-skeletal symptoms (43&#x00025;). Disturbed sleep correlated with hot flushes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005) and concentration problems (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Decreased sexual interest correlated with vaginal dryness (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005) and/or dyspareunia (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005). In the high-dose group more patients became postmenopausal (95&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 33&#x00025;) and more patients reported symptoms than in the standard-dose group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). After discontinuation of tamoxifen, symptoms decreased significantly. However, hot flushes, disturbed sleep and vaginal dryness persisted more often in patients who remained postmenopausal after high-dose chemotherapy (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Overall, during tamoxifen patients reported many symptoms. More patients become postmenopausal after high-dose chemotherapy, and they remain often symptomatic after tamoxifen.</p><p><italic>British Journal of Cancer</italic> (2002) <bold>86</bold>, 1546&#x02013;1550.

In addition, tamoxifen is prescribed for the prevention of breast cancer in high risk women in the United States since the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) showed a breast cancer risk reduction in healthy women over the age of 35 years at high risk for breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), although two European studies could not confirm these results (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Powles <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Veronesi <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Being a drug with both agonistic and antagonistic properties, tamoxifen can have oestrogen as well as anti-oestrogen effects on different sites and tissues, depending on the ambient oestradiol concentration. Side effects of tamoxifen have been studied mainly in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">No authors listed, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Love, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Love <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Ragaz, 1997</xref>), while only a few studies included also women under 50 years of age. Although an important component of quality of life, few studies have paid attention to the impact of tamoxifen on sexual functioning (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Ganz <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Day <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Moreover, in younger women, induction of menopause as a result of high-dose chemotherapy might have a negative impact on quality of life and sexual functioning. The present study was performed to assess the impact of tamoxifen on breast cancer patients under 56 years of age following adjuvant standard- or high-dose chemotherapy. We collected prospective information on subjective side effects and sexual functioning during and after tamoxifen use and related symptoms to type of chemotherapy and menopausal status as defined by last menstrual period and serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Between January 1995 and September 1995 all breast cancer patients &#x0003c;56 years of age with four or more tumour positive axillary lymph nodes treated at the Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands, and participating in the Dutch randomised study comparing standard-dose and high-dose chemotherapy, were referred to the Gynaecology Outpatient Clinic. After surgery, patients had been randomly assigned to receive either five cycles of standard-dose 5-fluorouracil (500&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), epirubicin (90&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and cyclophosphamide (500&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) (FEC) or four cycles of FEC plus one cycle of high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 6&#x02009;g m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, thiotepa 480&#x02009;mg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and carboplatin 1.6&#x02009;g m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), followed by peripheral blood progenitor stem-cell rescue. In both treatment arms chemotherapy was followed by locoregional radiotherapy and 2 years of daily 40&#x02009;mg tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">de Vries <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>).

Symptoms during and after tamoxifen were compared, to evaluate the effect of tamoxifen on the symptoms. Patients were excluded for analysis if tumour relapse occurred. At each visit a structured interview on the basis of two self-reported questionnaires was performed by the same gynaecologist (MM). The interviewer is an experienced clinician and sexuologist, trained in taking interviews. Interview items were derived from, at that time available, reports on side effects of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">No authors listed, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Love, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Love <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Powles <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). The first part of the interview contained items of physical, mood-related and psychological symptoms associated with tamoxifen as well as symptoms associated with menopause (Appendix 1). Depressive symptoms were defined as reporting three or more of the following: feeling miserable and sad, lack of enjoyment, loss of interest, loss of vitality, loss of initiative, life not worth living. The second part of the interview contained the major components of sexual functioning: sexual interest (desire and ability to enjoy sex), activity (frequency, ability to perform sexual activity), and pleasure or discomfort (pain, vaginal dryness) (Appendix 2) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">McCoy and Davidson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib29">Wilmoth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Greendale <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib26">Thirlaway <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>).

Hot flushes were experienced by 86&#x00025; of the patients during tamoxifen, not related to treatment arm (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Fifty-four patients (55&#x00025;) suffered from disruption of sleep, i.e. awakening more than twice a night, which was not related to the type of chemotherapy received, but showed a strong relation with the occurrence of hot flushes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005). Fifty-three out of 83 patients (64&#x00025;) with hot flushes experienced disturbed sleep with night sweats, <italic>vs</italic> only one patient without hot flushes. Forty patients (41&#x00025;) reported difficulty concentrating during tamoxifen treatment, a symptom which was not related to chemotherapy regimen. However, disruption of sleep was associated with concentration problems (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Irritability was reported by 29&#x00025; of the women and was related to difficulty concentrating (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005) and to disruption of sleep (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).

Decreased sexual desire was reported by 44&#x00025; of the patients, which did not differ between patients in the standard-dose and high-dose arm, or between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Decreased libido was strongly related to a dry vagina (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005) and dyspareunia (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0005). These complaints led to decreased sexual activity in 28 out of 94 (30&#x00025;) (10 pre- and 18 postmenopausal) patients.

Ten patients were still using tamoxifen and six had withdrawn from the study. As a result 49 patients were disease-free during the interview after completion of tamoxifen treatment, 21 in the standard-dose arm and 28 in the high-dose arm, of whom 47 were sexually active.

All patients who had reported depressive symptoms during tamoxifen improved after tamoxifen was stopped.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we evaluated subjective side effects and psychosexual function, in relation to menopausal status, in breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen after standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy. Although this was not a placebo controlled trial, we are able to draw some conclusions on the impact of tamoxifen use by comparing data from interviews during and after tamoxifen use. As we only included disease-free patients, they may show an improvement in their well-being at the last interview, simply due to the passage of time. To make this time effect as small as possible, we held the last interview shortly (3&#x02013;6 months) after the discontinuation of tamoxifen.</p><p>Adjuvant therapy with daily 40&#x02009;mg tamoxifen after chemotherapy caused symptoms of which hot flushes and impaired sexual function were most prevalent. Hot flushes was the most frequently reported symptom, not only by postmenopausal but also by premenopausal patients. For comparison, postmenopausal breast cancer patients without adjuvant therapy report hot flushes in about 40&#x00025; of the cases (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Ragaz, 1997</xref>). In a recent study of 114 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, hot flushes were reported by 65&#x00025; of the patients, of which 59&#x00025; rated the symptoms as severe (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Carpenter <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). In our study hot flushes coincided with disturbed sleep and problems concentrating, which was not related to type of chemotherapy or menopausal status. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib27">van Dam <italic>et al</italic> (1998)</xref> evaluated cognitive function by psycho-neurological tests in patients who were randomly assigned to receive high-dose (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;34) or standard-dose chemotherapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;36) plus 2 years tamoxifen 40&#x02009;mg daily, and compared the results with those from 34 patients with stage I breast cancer treated with surgery but without systemic therapy. Patients enrolled in their study were at least 6 months post-chemotherapy. The risk of cognitive impairment with high-dose treated patients was 8.2 times higher than in breast cancer patients not receiving systemic therapy and 3.5 times higher than in standard-dose treated patients. The authors concluded that impaired cognitive functioning as defined by a battery of psycho-neurological tests, may be a dose-limiting factor in high-dose chemotherapy. In our study 41&#x00025; of the patients reported concentration problems during tamoxifen use, however equally distributed over standard-dose and high-dose treated patients. Notwithstanding, concentration problems were related to hot flushes and disturbed sleep and in both treatment groups these symptoms showed an improvement after stopping tamoxifen, suggesting that concentration problems in these patients may, at least in part, be due to tamoxifen. The higher cognitive impairment in the high-dose group in the study of van Dam might be explained by the chemotherapy induced menopause in these patients.</p><p>Depressive symptoms were mentioned by 12&#x00025; of the patients, more often after standard-dose (19&#x00025;) than high-dose chemotherapy (4&#x00025;). We hypothesise that this difference between the two treatment groups might be related to menopausal status of the patients and hence the agonistic/antagonistic effect of tamoxifen. As depression and mood-fluctuations may be related to oestrogen-deprivation, depressive symptoms in our study may be related to the anti-oestrogenic effect of tamoxifen in the predominantly premenopausal patients of the standard-dose group, while in the menopausal patients in the high-dose group, tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen agonist. In the placebo-controlled NSABP-prevention-trial, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Day <italic>et al</italic> (1999)</xref> reported that tamoxifen was not associated with depression in a cohort of healthy women who received 20&#x02009;mg tamoxifen daily for the prevention of breast cancer. The difference between their data and ours could be a result of the higher tamoxifen dose in our study, as dose reduction from 40 to 20&#x02009;mg daily in four depressed patients in our study, resulted in amelioration of their depressive symptoms.</p><p>Breast surgery and chemotherapy-induced menopause can interfere with self-esteem and sexual function of women (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Ganz <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Schover, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Meyerowitz <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). This raises the problem of how to measure the effect of tamoxifen on sexual function, considering several causative factors, while no baseline questionnaires are available. Consequently, not the actual level of sexual activity but the changes compared to the situation without tamoxifen treatment are of interest. In order to determine a change in sexual function we evaluated three factors determining sexual function: sexual desire, sexual activity, and pain or discomfort during intercourse. These aspects are also addressed in the recently developed Sexual Activity Questionnaire, which was designed to investigate the impact of long-term tamoxifen use on the sexual function of women in a prevention trial (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib26">Thirlaway <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Forty-four per cent of our patients reported a decreased interest in sexual activity during tamoxifen therapy, unrelated to the type of previous chemotherapy or menopausal status and this might also be an effect of breast cancer diagnosis and the other treatment modalities. However, after tamoxifen was stopped, patients in the high-dose arm reported sexual dysfunction more often (36&#x00025;) than patients in the standard-dose arm (16&#x00025;). In early stage breast cancer patients, changes in sexual function are more prevalent in women with ovarian failure due to adjuvant chemotherapy than in women with a premenopausal status (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Lindley <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Ganz <italic>et al</italic> (1998)</xref> observed impaired sexual function in women who became postmenopausal, compared to those who retained menstrual cycles, while no effect on sexual function was seen of tamoxifen when added to chemotherapy in the Ganz study, or in another recent study (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Berglund <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). On the contrary, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Kaplan (1992)</xref> suggested that the addition of tamoxifen to chemotherapy exacerbates its sexual side effects. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Ganz <italic>et al</italic> (1998)</xref> observed impaired sexual function in women who became postmenopausal, compared to those who retained menstrual cycles. In our study, 67&#x00025; of the patients with induced menopause reported impaired sexual function during tamoxifen, compared to 49&#x00025; premenopausal patients (data not shown), pointing to an additional effect of induced menopause over the effect of tamoxifen. All except one of these 33 &#x02018;new&#x02019; postmenopausal patients had received high-dose chemotherapy. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Meyerowitz <italic>et al</italic> (1999)</xref> reported that a negative impact from breast cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexuality was most likely in patients who experienced changes in hormonal status. We found a relationship between loss of sexual desire, vaginal dryness and painful intercourse, symptoms that are also frequently reported by healthy women during menopause (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">McCoy and Davidson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Greendale <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). In our study however, these symptoms were also reported by premenopausal patients during tamoxifen, suggesting a direct anti-oestrogenic effect of tamoxifen on the vaginal epithelium in these young women.</p><p>The relative impact as well as the cumulative impact of adjuvant tamoxifen and chemotherapy on patient well being is an important and neglected topic. Our data indicate that 40&#x02009;mg tamoxifen daily, following chemotherapy, interferes with psychosexual well-being, causing different side effects of which hot flushes and impaired sexual function are most frequent, both in pre- and postmenopausal women. We suggest that induced menopause due to adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy might explain why symptoms did not fully recover in all patients, after finishing tamoxifen treatment. Therefore, in this study of breast cancer patients younger than 56 years at diagnosis, symptoms are most probably especially due to a combined effect of tamoxifen and the hormonal change induced by high-dose chemotherapy. This is the first study in which side effects are shown to be clustered and it is also the first study about side effects of breast cancer treatment in clearly defined pre- and postmenopausal women, in which menopausal status was defined not only by the last menstrual period but also by serum levels of FSH and oestradiol. Tamoxifen predominantly acts as an anti-oestrogen in premenopausal women, with recovery of symptoms after its cessation. In postmenopausal women tamoxifen predominantly acts as an oestrogen, but is not sufficient to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women with chemotherapy induced menopause.</p><p>This knowledge allows the clinician to inform patients about the side effects, including the sexual sequelae, both of tamoxifen use and (high-dose) chemotherapy, and to bring up the subject during follow-up visits. Subjective and psychosexual well-being in breast cancer patients should be further investigated with the ultimate goal of acknowledging the impact of breast cancer therapy, and to develop interventions to minimise side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
