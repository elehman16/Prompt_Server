In 2009 in China, the incidence and death rate of oesophageal cancer was 22.14 per 100&#x02005;000 person-years and 16.77 per 100&#x02005;000 person-years, respectively, the highest in the world. Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) was introduced into clinical practice with the aim of reducing the morbidity rate. The mechanisms of MIO may lie in minimising the reaction to surgical injury and inflammation. There are some randomised trials regarding minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy, with 100&#x02013;850 subjects enrolled. To date, no large randomised controlled trial comparing minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy has been reported in China, where squamous cell carcinoma predominated over adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a 3&#x02005;year multicentre, prospective, randomised, open and parallel controlled trial, which aims to compare the effectiveness of minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy to open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy for resectable oesophageal cancer. Group A patients receive MIO which involves thoracoscopic oesophagectomy and laparoscopic gastric mobilisation with cervical anastomosis. Group B patients receive the open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy which involves a right thoracotomy and laparotomy with cervical anastomosis. Primary endpoints include respiratory complications within 30&#x02005;days after operation. The secondary endpoints include other postoperative complications, influences on pulmonary function, intraoperative data including blood loss, operative time, the number and location of lymph nodes dissected, and mortality in hospital, the length of hospital stay, total expenses in hospital, mortality within 30&#x02005;days, survival rate after 2&#x02005;years, postoperative pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Three hundred and twenty-four patients in each group will be needed and a total of 648 patients will finally be enrolled into the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of all participating institutions.

<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the Netherlands study,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a reduction of pulmonary infection rate was noted in the MIO group compared with the open oesophagectomy group, and the number of lymph nodes harvested were comparable in both groups, with manifest good oncologic effect in the MIO group. In the TIME (Traditional Invasive vs. Minimally invasive&#x000a0;Esophagectomy) trial, the majority of the patients underwent surgery in a three-stage procedure, the patients having adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Moreover the technical complications in this trial were the same in the two groups, following neoadjuvant therapy. However, multiple surgical procedures were used in the study, and the complication rate was higher than in previous reports.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref> In the French study,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Mariette <italic>et al</italic> found that the rate of pulmonary complication was significant lower in the MIO group than in the open oesophagectomy group. The Ivor-Lewis procedure was used in the MIRO trial (Open vs Laparoscopically-assisted Esophagectomy for Cancer: A Multicentric Phase III Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial); however, a benefit from using the Ivor-Lewis MIO in that study may not be generalised to the McKeown oesophagectomy.</p><p>There are several ongoing randomised trials regarding the comparison of minimally invasive versus open oesophagectomy, with enrolment of over 100&#x02013;850 subjects.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> The ROMIO (Randomized Oesophagectomy: Minimally Invasive or Open) trial is a three-arm trial which aims to compare the outcomes of total MIO versus hybrid MIO versus conventional open oesophagectomy (open thoracotomy and laparotomy).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The procedures used in the ROMIO study include the open oesophagectomy or the MIO Ivor-Lewis procedure.

Here, we aim to conduct a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open controlled trial in order to evaluate the effectiveness of MIO versus open oesophagectomy through a McKeown procedure for the surgical treatment of resectable oesophageal cancer. We hope the results of our study will provide a high level of clinical evidence to support the routine use of MIO.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a 3&#x02005;year multicentre, prospective, randomised, open and parallel controlled trial, which aims to compare the effectiveness of minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy to open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy for resectable oesophageal cancer.</p><p>Patients with resectable thoracic oesophageal carcinoma in cT1b-4aN0-2M0 are eligible for inclusion using chest CT, ultrasonography of the abdomen, head CT, and bone scan.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We do not include a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan as a preoperative workup because medical insurance does not cover the expense of PET/CT.

The position of the double-lumen tube is verified, and single-lung ventilation used. Four thoracoscopic ports are established. A 10&#x02005;mm port is placed at the seventh intercostal space, just along the anterior axillary line, for the camera. Another 10&#x02005;mm port is placed at the eighth or ninth intercostal space, posterior to the axillary line, for the dissection instrument (ultrasonic coagulating shears) and passage of the end-to-end circular stapler (EEA; Covidien or Johnson) or Hem-lock. A 5&#x02005;mm port is placed in the anterior axillary line, at the third or fourth intercostal space, and this is used to pass a fan-shaped retractor to retract the lung anteriorly and allow exposure of the oesophagus. A 5&#x02005;mm port is placed just below the subscapular tip to place the instruments for retraction and counter traction. The inferior pulmonary ligament is divided. The mediastinal pleura overlying the oesophagus is divided and opened to the level of the azygous vein to expose the thoracic oesophagus. The azygous vein is then dissected and divided with an endoscopic vascular stapler or Hem-lock. The thoracic oesophagus, alone with the peri-oesophageal tissue and mediastinal lymph nodes, is circumferentially mobilised from the diaphragm to the level of inlet of the thorax. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy is undertaken for every patient including the region of left recurrent and right subclavian, paratracheal, subcarinal, left and right bronchial, lower posterior mediastinum, para-aortic, and para-oesophageal lymph nodes. Following the procedure the chest is inspected closely, and haemostasis verified. A chest tube is routinely placed.</p></sec><sec id="s2g1b"><title>Laparoscopic phase</title><p>The patient is placed in a supine position. A pneumoperitoneum (12&#x02013;14&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O) is established by carbon dioxide injection through an umbilical port. A total of five abdominal ports (three 5&#x02005;mm and two 40&#x02005;mm) are used. After placement of the ports, the first step of the laparoscopic phase involves exploration of the abdomen to rule out advanced disease. The mobilisation of the stomach is initiated with division of the greater curvature using a Harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Ohio, USA). The short gastric vessels are divided with ultrasonic coagulating shears. The gastrocolic omentum is then divided, with care taken to preserve the right gastroepiploic artery. The posterior attachments of the stomach are then divided after retraction of the stomach anteriorly. The left gastric vessel is divided at its origin from the coeliac trunk with an endoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler or Hem-lock. Lymphatic tissues around the vessels are included in the resection. Subsequently, the right crus is visualised and dissected, followed by dissection and definition of the left crura of the diaphragm. The abdominal/distal oesophagus is dissected as far as possible toward the distal end. The gastric conduit is made extracorporeally. Pyloroplasty or gastric drainage procedure are not routinely performed in our study, and a feeding jejunostomy tube created is not created. Instead, we insert a duodenal nutrition tube before the anastomosis, as follows: using sterile gloves, a candy ball is enclosed, peeled and fixed to the front end of the feeding tube through the small laparotomy incision; the feeding tube is then pushed until the front end and the candy ball lie in the duodenum, and the rest of the feeding tube is placed into the gastral cavity and bound with the nasogastric tube; then, the nasogastric tube is pulled out from the nose and fixed; and the nasogastric tube is then reinserted into the gastric cavity. The abdomen is inspected to make sure that haemostasis is adequate and the incisions are closed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Cervical anastomosis</title><p>After the laparoscopic phase and the thoracoscopic phase, a 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;cm horizontal neck incision is made. The cervical oesophagus is exposed. Careful dissection is performed down until the thoracic dissection plane is encountered, generally quite easily since the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) dissection is continued well into the thoracic inlet. The oesophagogastric specimen is pulled out of the neck incision and the cervical oesophagus divided high. The specimen is removed from the field. An anastomosis is performed between the cervical oesophagus and the gastric tube using standard techniques (mechanical stapled or hand sewn anastomosis in an end-to-side fashion).</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>Open three-stage transthoracic oesophagectomy</title><p>As in the minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy, a three-stage procedure is followed in the open group. The first stage is started with a right posterolateral thoracotomy. The mediastinal pleura overlying the oesophagus is divided with an electrotome. The thoracic oesophagus, along with the peri-oesophageal tissue and mediastinal lymph nodes, are circumferentially mobilised from the diaphragm to the level of inlet of the thorax. The second stage is the mobilisation of the stomach which is initiated with the division of the greater curvature using ultrasonic coagulating shears. The short gastric vessels are divided with ultrasonic coagulating shears as well. The gastrocolic omentum is then divided, with care taken to preserve the right gastroepiploic artery. The posterior attachments of the stomach are then divided after retraction of the stomach anteriorly. The left gastric vessel is divided at its origin from the coeliac trunk with sutures. Lymphatic tissues around the vessels are included in the resection. Subsequently, the abdominal oesophagus is dissected as far as possible toward the distal end. Pyloroplasty is not routinely performed. The abdomen is inspected to make sure that haemostasis is adequate and the incisions are closed. For the last stage, the cervical incision is made and then the anastomosis is performed like for MIO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>The patients are placed in intensive care units or discharged to hospital wards directly from the operating theatre according to the guidelines of the participating centre. Assessment of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is undertaken on the first day postoperatively. Postoperative respiratory tract management includes chest physiotherapy and early ambulation. Patient-controlled analgesia is given to every patient to control postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>According to the literature, the incidence of respiratory complications after oesophagectomy for oesophageal carcinoma is 27&#x02013;31%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, we plan to decrease the incidence rate of respiratory complications from 30% to 20% with minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic oesophagectomy. This is based on a unilateral significance level of &#x003b1;=0.025 and a power of &#x003b2;=0.8. After adding 10% loss of the sample, 324 patients will be required for each group so a total of 648 patients will finally be enrolled into the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses are carried out using SPSS software for Windows, V.16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Continuous variables are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD and compared using Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Categorical variables will be reported as absolute numbers (frequency percentages) and analysed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Survival will be estimated by means of Kaplan-Meier curves, and survival compared using log-rank test. A two-tailed p&#x0003c;0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has become the main type of oesophageal cancer in western countries, oesophageal SCC is still the predominant histologic type in China. Therefore, both Ivor-Lewis and McKeown oesophagectomy are important in the surgical treatment of oesophageal SCC. The TIME and MIRO trials concluded that MIO is not only feasible, but perhaps superior to open oesophagectomy. However, there are no RCTs designed to compare the outcome of the MIO McKeown procedure and the open McKeown procedure for oesophageal SCC, apart from one study which aims to compare the outcomes of McKeown MIO with or without neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCT02188615) for squamous cell oesophageal cancer. Therefore, we are conducting this study, which aims to investigate the difference between the MIO McKeown procedure and the open McKeown procedure for oesophageal SCC.</p><p>Maas <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found that less surgical trauma could lead to better preserved acute-phase and stress responses and fewer clinical manifestations of respiratory infections in patients who underwent MIO compared to those who underwent open oesophagectomy. Our previous study showed that the overall morbidity rate was significantly decreased in the MIO McKeown group compared with the open McKeown group, and no significant differences were found in the number of harvested lymph nodes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For these reasons, we hypothesise that the MIO McKeown procedure may result in a significant decrease in major respiratory complications compared with the open McKeown procedure for oesophageal SCC, without comprising the oncologic clearance.</p><p>This is the largest multicentre, prospective, RCT designed to compare open McKeown oesophagectomy with MIO McKeown oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer in China. We hope the results of this study will add new evidence to support the use of MIO in the surgical treatment of oesophageal cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the funding of Capital health technology development priorities research project (No. 2014-1-4021).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MJ wrote the manuscript; HJ and MJ were involved in the study design, implementation, supervision and drafting; MJ, GS, MY, XQ, YZ, LN, SK, YK, LD, CK, LH, YT, HY, DM, XR, WZ, WW, SM, XQ, XS, and HJ were involved in the study design and inclusion of patients in the trial; HJ is the study coordinator, obtained the grant and is responsible for the present paper; all authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Institutional Ethics Committees of all participating institutions.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Center</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
