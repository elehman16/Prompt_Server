Tenofovir (TDF) is considered as the first line therapy for chronic hepatitis B. This study presents the results of TDF monotherapy in patients who failed previous nucleoside analogue treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study included 29 patients treated with TDF 245&#x000a0;mg once daily for 18&#x000a0;months after lamivudine monotherapy (LAM arm: <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) or sequential therapy with lamivudine and entecavir (LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV arm: <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14). The previous antiviral therapy was discontinued due to lack of efficacy. All patients had HBV DNA between 2.1 and 8.23 log<sub>10</sub>&#x000a0;IU/ml and 15 were HBeAg-positive, while 45&#x000a0;% of patients had increased ALT activity. Undetectable HBV DNA (&#x0003c;20&#x000a0;IU/ml) at months 3, 6, 12 and 18 was the primary endpoint in the study, while HBeAg/HBsAg loss/seroconversion and ALT normalisation were secondary endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Primary nonresponse to TDF was not observed. HBV DNA was undetectable in 80, 80, 80 and 93&#x000a0;% in LAM arm and 50, 71, 86 and 86&#x000a0;% in LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV arm patients, at 3, 6, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months of TDF therapy, respectively. One patient achieved anti-HBeAg seroconversion. 86.5&#x000a0;% of patients had normal ALT activity at the end of the study. The baseline HBV DNA load, HBeAg status and the length of the duration of TDF therapy appeared significantly associated with the response to the therapy. HBV DNA clearance occurred faster in HBeAg-negative patients than in those positive for HBeAg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>TDF is an effective antiviral medication in patients with previous exposure to LAM or LAM and ETV. Final proportion of patients who achieved undetectable HBV DNA and had normal ALT activity in both arms, was similar.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antiviral therapy</kwd><kwd>Chronic hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>Entecavir resistance</kwd><kwd>Lamivudine resistance</kwd><kwd>Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is considered a major health care problem because occult hepatitis can lead to liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis resulting in end stage liver disease. It has been documented that HBV infection is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For these reasons, many antiviral therapies have been developed to stop viral replication. Interferon was the first treatment with proven efficacy against HBV. The next lines of therapy were nucleos(t)ide analogues: lamivudine (LAM), adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir (ETV) and recently tenofovir (TDF). A new antiviral medication is being introduced into clinical studies and marketed every few years.</p><p>TDF is currently considered as the first-line therapy in chronic hepatitis B patients, regardless of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status. It is recommended for the treatment of na&#x000ef;ve patients but it can also be used in patients who remained HBV DNA-positive after previous antiviral therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The number of patients who did not respond to antiviral nucleos(t)ide therapy is growing around the world. It is very important to resolve this problem. The aim of our study is to present the results of TDF monotherapy as a rescue therapy in patients who failed previous nucleoside analogue treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>This is a retrospective review of 29 patients (21 males; 8 females) with confirmed HBV infection, without any other liver disease (HCV infection, Wilson disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune liver disease) or HIV infection.

The potential influence of HBeAg status, HBV DNA concentration, liver fibrosis, age and gender of patients, the type of previous therapy (LAM vs. LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV) and the presence of the polymerase sequence mutations on the increased ALT activity has been evaluated. For this group of patients, HBV DNA concentration (expressed as log<sub>10</sub> HBV DNA) appeared to be the only factor significantly associated with ALT activity status. A higher HBV DNA concentration was observed, the lower being the probability of normal ALT activity. The increase of HBV DNA concentration by 1 log<sub>10</sub> decreases the odds of normal ALT activity by about 40&#x000a0;% [OR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.59 (0.47 0.73)]. The other considered factors seem not to show significant association with increased ALT activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Polymerase sequence mutations during TDF monotherapy</title><p>The presence of polymerase sequence mutations at baseline did not influence virologic response during TDF monotherapy. They were detectable until month 6 of the treatment only in four patients (three in the LAM arm and one in the LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV arm) and remained the same at all check points.

Interferon was the first antiviral therapy used in Poland, financed from public funds through the therapeutic anti-HBV programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Lamivudine was introduced later as the first orally taken anti-HBV medication, and subsequently other medications became available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients participating in this study had a long history of HBV infection. All subjects in the study had received lamivudine, as for many years it was available as the main antiviral medication in therapeutic programs reimbursed by the Polish health care system.</p><p>Lamivudine seemed to have similar efficacy to interferon but had none of the side effects reported with interferon therapy. However, the efficacy of LAM was limited by the emergence of HBV mutations that were resistant to this therapy. LAM resistance increases progressively during treatment at rates of 14&#x02013;32&#x000a0;% annually, exceeding 70&#x000a0;% after 2&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For this reason, patients receiving LAM are tested for HBV DNA load and for the presence of these mutations. Lamivudine should be discontinued or the patient switched to other antiviral treatment if HBV DNA remains unchanged or a mutant variant appears. In our study, the proportion of patients positive for rLAM was greater than 75&#x000a0;% over the mean treatment period of 38&#x000a0;months; thus, the recommended approach to discontinue or switch the antiviral therapy was justified.</p><p>Entecavir was introduced into Polish therapeutic programs for HBV patients a few years after lamivudine. It could be used only in sequential therapy in patients who failed LAM. ETV was well tolerated but the efficacy profile was only slightly better than lamivudine and resistance mutations could still occur. Due to its high frequency of virologic breakthrough (43&#x000a0;% after 5&#x000a0;years of treatment), the role of ETV salvage therapy in LAM-refractory patients was limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The patients analysed in this study were treated according to the Polish anti-HBV therapeutic program regulations. All of them received LAM, then stopped it and were switched to ETV when virologic breakthrough or at least one resistance mutation was detected. Sequential LAM and ETV therapy resulted in a large number of patients with resistance mutations to these medications.</p><p>It is well known that long-lasting HBV infection is a slowly progressing process leading to severe liver disease. For this reason, patients with HBV DNA replication are considered candidates for antiviral therapy. The majority of patients analysed in this study had mild liver disease with normal or slightly abnormal ALT activity and mild liver fibrosis. All of them remained highly positive for HBV DNA and thus were at risk of liver disease progression; for this reason, they were considered candidates for further antiviral therapy.</p><p>TDF is a nucleotide analogue without cross-resistance with nucleoside analogues like lamivudine, telbivudine and entecavir. It is highly effective in the treatment of na&#x000ef;ve patients. Multicentre randomised phase III studies have shown that 7&#x000a0;years of the therapy resulted in undetectable HBV DNA (&#x0003c;400 copies/ml) in 77&#x000a0;% of HBeAg-negative and 60&#x000a0;% of HBeAg-positive patients. ALT normalisation was achieved in 84 and 74&#x000a0;% of these patients, respectively. Forty percent of subjects lost HBeAg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Baran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have reported the efficacy of TDF in 92 rLAM patients with high HBV DNA load (7.11 log<sub>10</sub>&#x000a0;IU/ml). Twenty-one patients received TDF monotherapy, while the remaining subjects were treated with a combination of LAM and TDF. At month 24 of therapy, a complete virologic response (HBV DNA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;IU/ml) was noted in 89 and 88&#x000a0;% of these patients, respectively. Similar results of TDF efficacy have been reported in the ongoing long-term study (EudraCT no: GS-US-174-0121) comparing TDF monotherapy with TDF and emtricitabine combination in patients with rLAM. At week 96 of therapy, HBV DNA was undetectable (&#x0003c;400 copies/ml) in 89&#x000a0;% of rLAM patients who had baseline HBV DNA load greater than 10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Sangheun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported 70&#x000a0;% rate of complete virological response (HBV DNA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;IU/ml) at month 12 of TDF monotherapy in rLAM patients with a mean baseline HBV DNA load of 3.6 log<sub>10</sub>&#x000a0;IU/ml.</p><p>Our study confirms the above clinical observations on the efficacy of TDF monotherapy in reducing HBV replication in patients who failed LAM treatment. Complete virologic response at month 18 of therapy was achieved in 93&#x000a0;% of patients who failed previous antiviral therapy with LAM and had a high viral load at the beginning of TDF therapy. The majority of these patients were positive for LAM resistance mutations.</p><p>Sequential LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV treatment has been used in some regions in the past; however, it has never been widely recommended. Thus, the number of patients who have received this type of therapy is small and the number of reports on the efficacy of TDF therapy following the sequential LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV regimen is limited. Van B&#x000f6;mmel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported one case and Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] three cases of patients treated with TDF after sequential LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV therapy. There are also reports describing the efficacy of TDF in patients with a suboptimal virologic response during 24&#x000a0;weeks of ETV therapy. Pan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] described the elimination of HBV DNA and ALT normalization in 100&#x000a0;% of patients resistant to ETV after 30&#x000a0;weeks of TDF treatment. These authors recommend an early switch to TDF, before virologic breakthrough or the emergence of resistance mutations occurs.</p><p>Nowadays, TDF is recommended in patients with multi-drug resistance to LAM and ETV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it is estimated that the proportion of patients with HBV DNA clearance (HBV DNA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;IU/ml) should reach around 65&#x000a0;% after 12&#x000a0;months of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The results described in this paper show that 86&#x000a0;% of patients reached the goal of the therapy at month 12. A CVR rate of 86&#x000a0;% at month 18 of TDF therapy is satisfactory and is not statistically different from the response in patients treated with LAM monotherapy.</p><p>Our results show high efficacy of TDF, regardless of previous antiviral therapy with LAM or LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV. However, there are several limitations to the study: it is retrospective, the number of patients is small, and the duration of observation is short. Despite these limitations, we confirmed the high efficacy of TDF monotherapy especially in patients with previous ineffective sequential LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV therapy. Likewise, history of prior exposure (LAM monotherapy vs. sequential LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV therapy) had no influence on treatment outcome with tenofovir.</p><p>On the other hand, the data collected in this study come from everyday clinical practice. The patients had documented HBV replication for many years and TDF was the first antiviral medication that changed their virologic status. Thus, we think that TDF monotherapy may be effectively used in patients who did not respond to previous LAM or LAM&#x000a0;&#x02192;&#x000a0;ETV therapy. We demonstrated high efficacy of TDF in reducing HBV DNA load, but only one (7&#x000a0;%) patient was cleared of HBeAg. Our result is close to the 11&#x000a0;% rate of HBeAg clearance observed in the ongoing GS-US-174-0121 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but much lower than that reported by Baran et al. (32&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The latter authors reported that HBeAg clearance occurred after at least 15&#x000a0;months of TDF therapy. The patients described in our paper were not treated for longer than 18&#x000a0;months, and the age at which they became infected with HBV did not predispose them to a higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion.</p><p>Finally, effective suppression of HBV DNA is usually followed by a reduction of inflammatory activity and normalisation of ALT. This has been observed in all reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our data show a marked increase in the percentage of patients with normal ALT activity in both groups of patients treated with TDF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TDF is an effective anti-HBV medication in patients with previous exposure to LAM or LAM and ETV. Our study showed that HBeAg status, baseline HBV DNA concentration and duration of TDF therapy are significantly associated with the response to therapy. TDF-induced HBV DNA clearance occurred faster in HBeAg-negative patients than in those positive for HBeAg. Furthermore, some HBeAg-positive patients did not achieve undetectable HBV DNA. Finally, the proportion of patients who achieved the primary and secondary endpoints at 18&#x000a0;month of therapy did not differ significantly in both arms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank GILEAD for supporting this publication, the MEDICAL NETWORK for editorial guidance.</p></ack><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with ethical requirements</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Dorota Kozielewicz has received a speaker honorarium from Roche and Janssen.
