Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of high-dose probiotic supplementation to women during late pregnancy and lactation on cytokine profile and secretory IgA (sIgA) in breast milk and thus to study if differences in breast milk composition can affect lactoferrin and sIgA levels in stool samples of newborns. The safety of maternal probiotic administration on neonatal growth pattern and gastrointestinal symptoms were also evaluated. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 66 women took either the probiotic (<italic>n</italic> = 33) or a placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 33) daily. Levels of interleukins (IL-6, IL-10 and IL-1&#x003b2;), transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1), and sIgA in breast milk; and the level of sIgA and lactoferrin in newborn stool samples were analyzed at birth and then again at one month of life. Antropometrical evaluation and analysis of gastrointestinal events in newborns was also performed. Results: Probiotic maternal consumption had a significant impact on IL6 mean values in colostrum and on IL10 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 mean values in mature breast milk. Fecal sIgA mean values were higher in newborns whose mothers took the probiotic product than in the control group. Probiotic maternal supplementation seems to decrease incidence of infantile colic and regurgitation in infants. Conclusion: High-dose multi-strain probiotic administration to women during pregnancy influences breast milk cytokines pattern and sIgA production in newborns, and seems to improve gastrointestinal functional symptoms in infants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric gastroenterology</kwd><kwd>probiotics/prebiotics</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>functional GI diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-08-00677"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Several papers have shown that probiotic supplementation to women during pregnancy and lactation can modulate the microbial milk composition and the level of different breast milk immunity and immunity-modulating molecules, with health benefits ranging from gastrointestinal symptoms to allergies, transferred to the children [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Our previously published studies demonstrated that the same high concentration multi-strain probiotic, when supplemented to mothers in the perinatal period, was associated with a modulation of the vaginal microbiota and vaginal cytokine secretion [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and with an increase in levels of breast milk bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in women with vaginal deliveries, regardless of the milk concentrations of functional components such as oligosaccharides and lactoferrin [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>An improved microbial milk composition might have important consequences for the health of the newborn [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We did not, however, find any correlation between the amount of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in maternal breast milk and levels in the feces of infants [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>We have speculated that cytokines and other immunoregulatory factors, modulated by probiotic supplementation, might have a key role in the establishment of the microbiota of human milk. </p><p>The primary outcomes of this study were to evaluate if maternal probiotics supplementation can modulate the cytokine profile and secretory IgA (sIgA) in breast milk and thus to study if differences in breast milk composition can affect lactoferrin and sIgA levels in newborn stool samples.</p><p>Our secondary outcome was to evaluate the safety of high-concentration administration of maternal probiotics for newborns, evaluating growth and the onset of the most frequent gastrointestinal symptoms in infants. It has been hypothesized that perinatal manipulation of gut microbiota by probiotics supplementation can result in a decrease of gastrointestinal functional symptoms [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that early life probiotic administration could prevent the onset of gastrointestinal functional symptoms in newborns [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The correct mechanism of action of probiotics in this field has not thus far been clarified, but it appears to be mediated by activity on colonic intrinsic sensory neurons with an improvement in gut motility, as well as positive effects on function and visceral pain [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, a study on rats allowed the identification of novel regulatory mechanisms and specific patterns of genic expression caused by exposure to the same high concentration multi-strain probiotic which may have clinical readouts in visceral pain [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, it is important to note that health benefits conferred by probiotics bacteria are strain-specific.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-08-00677"><title>2.

The beneficial effect of this probiotic preparation on the anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles of breast milk was not influenced by the mode of delivery but only by the probiotic administration to mothers.</p><p>During early infancy, TGF-&#x003b2;1 probably has a crucial effect on the development of the immature gastrointestinal tract by influencing IgA production and oral tolerance induction [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. On the basis of the known role of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the level of sIgA [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], that serves as a first line of defense in gut mucosal immunity [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is possible to hypothesize that the increase of TGF-&#x003b2;1 levels in breast milk, induced by this high dose probiotic preparation, may be responsible for the significantly higher sIgA levels found in stools of infants whose mothers took the probiotic product at T30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). </p><p>As the TGF-&#x003b2;1 breast milk levels at T0 are not different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f002">Figure 2</xref>D), the higher sIgA concentrations at T0 in the supplemented-group newborn stool samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) could be an early expression of the mucosal immune system in the developing fetus. Amniotic fluid contains levels of IgA, of fetal origin, supporting the hypothesis that newborns enter the world having first been bathed in an environment created by the mother, and in our experience, influenced by our probiotic supplementation [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the mean value of sIgA in breast milk is higher in treated mothers, although it did not quite reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>A recent paper demonstrates how cytokines exert differential effects on the muscarinic receptor on the intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle and explains the basis for altered gut motility and muscle contractility by intestinal inflammation. In this scenario, TGF-&#x003b2;1 seems to enhance contractility on intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle, suggesting anti-regurgitation effects [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In line with these results, our data shows that the newborns with a lower frequency of regurgitation had received milk with higher TGF-&#x003b2;1 concentrations, compared to the newborns with a higher frequency of regurgitation.</p><p>IL-10 plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of homeostasis and it has been well known for many years that elevated IL-10 levels suppress inflammation [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our data shows higher mean values of IL-10 in both colostrum and mature milk in probiotic-supplemented mothers compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). Other studies demonstrated the efficacy of certain bacteria strains, selected for their ability to increase cytokine IL-10 levels, in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of colic [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>We can speculate that the increased level of IL-10 in maternal breast milk, induced by our probiotic preparation, may have been responsible for the reduction of colic symptoms in the infants.</p><p>In the evaluation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, our data shows a significant temporal decrease of IL-6 in breast milk in probiotic-supplemented mothers, although the mean value in colostrum was significantly higher in probiotic-supplemented mothers compared to the control group. In the mature milk, IL-6 levels reached approximately the same values of the control group. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). </p><p>A previous pilot study showed that IL-6 concentration in breast milk in the first months of life could play a pivotal role in the accrual of fat and lean body mass [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to the authors, IL-6 concentration in breast milk had pervasive negative associations with infant growth and adiposity. Our data does not provide conclusive evidence of a correlation between IL-6 concentration in breast milk and infant BMI, although a downward trend, not statistically significant, can be observed at T30. Further studies with a longer follow-up are necessary to better clarify this hypothesis.</p><p>With respect to the IL-1&#x003b2; mean value, we found a slight reduction in value between colostrum and mature milk, with no statistically significant differences between probiotic supplemented mothers and the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f002">Figure 2</xref>A).</p><p>Finally, our results indicate that the administered probiotic microorganisms do not affect fecal lactoferrin concentration at the time points studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00677-f004">Figure 4</xref>). According to our previous evidence [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], lactoferrin fecal concentration is extremely high in infants and significantly increases from T0 to T30. This growth occurs while breast milk lactoferrin concentration decreases longitudinally [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Our results finally indicate that oral probiotics supplementation to mothers in the perinatal period may also have consequences on inconsolable crying and regurgitation in the first month of life, however this data cannot be considered conclusive because the sample size calculation power was not adequate to evaluate differences between groups. </p><p>In our previous study, we did not observe any significant differences in newborn gut microbiota composition between the placebo and the control groups, suggesting that maternal probiotic supplementation does not modify the amount of intestinal beneficial bacteria in the newborn. This also supports the hypothesis that colonization of the gut may not be essential for probiotic biological effects.</p><p>The beneficial effect of maternal probiotic supplementation on neonatal gastrointestinal discomfort appears to be dependent on differences in the cytokine profile in breast milk.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-08-00677"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Our study demonstrates that maternal supplementation with this specific high-concentration probiotic preparation modulates cytokines in the mammary gland and a sIgA synthesis in newborn gut mucosa. It has also been demonstrated that this maternal supplementation may decrease the onset of gastrointestinal functional symptoms.</p><p>A routine supplementation of high-dose probiotics during pregnancy and lactation cannot be recommended yet, however. Further research in this field is needed to confirm our results and to identify mothers who could have benefits from perinatal supplementation. It has been demonstrated, recently, that a mother with a FGID could predispose her children to FGID [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-08-00677" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Based on our results it would be interesting to verify if early supplementation of high-dose probiotics could be proposed for mothers suffering from FGID.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from NOPAIN ONLUS to cover publication costs.
