Inability to engage large number of participants is one of the major identifiable factors. The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of tobacco cessation interventions in the clinical and workplace settings.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In the present study, we recruited 100 participants in tobacco cessation clinic (TCC) group and workplace group (50 participants in each). Both the groups were regularly intervened and were followed up regularly at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Active interventions in the form of awareness lectures, focused group discussions, and if needed, pharmacotherapy (nicotine/non-nicotine replacement therapy) was carried out for all participants. The outcome was assessed as no change, harm reduction (&#x0003e;50% reduction), complete cessation, and drop out. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21.0.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>At the end of 1 month, there was higher tobacco cessation rate in the workplace group versus TCC group (<italic>n</italic> = 22, 44% vs <italic>n</italic> = 9, 18%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The tobacco cessation rate was maintained even after 6 months of intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 30, 60% vs <italic>n</italic> = 12, 24%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and dropout rate was also lower among the workplace group than the TCC group (<italic>n</italic> = 14, 28% vs <italic>n</italic> = 27, 54%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study findings suggest that the workplace setting has superior outcome in tobacco cessation and harm reduction than clinical setting.

A recently published study showed that only 26% participants improved at 3 months, 21% at 6 months, and 18% at 9 months.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Major barriers for long-term tobacco cessation include peer pressure, lack of psychosocial support, attitude towards tobacco cessation, younger age, lack of community awareness, lack of trained professionals, and poor follow-up in subsequent visits.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>To improve tobacco cessation outcome, it needs to go beyond the health sector to multiple settings such as workplace, educational, and tobacco control policies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition, these interventions should be cost-effective and wide reaching. Workplace and educational setting has shown two to three times increase in tobacco cessation rate.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These results are promising, but limited by uncontrolled study design, non-homogenous study population, and minimal interventions.

Walawalkar Rural Medical College.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 100 participants were included in study. Fifty employees working in the selected chemical industrial unit and willing to participate were enrolled in the workplace group. An equal number of age and sex-matched participants visiting TCC of Jagruti De-addiction Centre were recruited in the TCC group. The participants with a previous history of psychiatric illness or neurological illness were excluded from study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The study was conducted from 1<sup>st</sup> August 2015 to 31<sup>st</sup> January 2016. All the participants were enrolled in the month of August 2015. The aim and purpose of the study were explained to each participant, and those who are willing to participate were enrolled after signing the written informed consent form which was made available in the local language (Marathi). The first session included an introductory lecture and interviews of the participants to collect preintervention data about various sociodemographic and risk factor variables. The follow-up sessions were offered at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, and then at 3 months and 6 months for both the clinical and TCC groups. During these sessions, professional help in the form of health awareness sessions, focus group discussion, one-on-one counseling, and pharmacotherapy including nicotine (gum, lozenges) and non-nicotine (Bupropion and Varenicline) replacement was provided to the employees by a team of doctors and counselors. During follow-up, abstinence was evaluated by self-report and biochemically confirmed by negative result of a cotinine test performed on saliva (a cotinine level of &#x0003c;15 ng per milliliter)[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or urine sample (with a level of &#x0003c;2 ng per milliliter).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] All the pretest measures were repeated in after the test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size was based on change in the primary outcome variable (qualitative outcome i.e. complete tobacco cessation, more than 50% reduction, no change, and drop out). The PS, Power and Sample Size Calculation version 3.1.2 was used for sample size calculation. Prior studies indicate that the probability of complete tobacco cessation after 6 months of treatment in clinical setting is 0.20 and odds ratio for tobacco cessation in workplace settings is 3.65.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The sample size was calculated with a power of 80%, precision rate of 5%, correlation coefficient (&#x003c6;) of 0.5, and matched in 1:1 ratio.

(IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY). The categorical variables were expressed in percentage and analyzed by independent Chi-square test and Fisher exact test. The quantitative data were expressed in mean &#x000b1; SD (standard deviation), and compared using independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Outcome in each group was compared in terms of proportion.

We observed that the outcome of tobacco cessation improved in the workplace group than the clinical group. After 6 months of intervention, complete tobacco cessation rate was 2.5 times higher among the workplace group than the clinical group. In addition, the tobacco cessation rate was consistently maintained over period of 6 months, with a lower dropout rate in the workplace group than the clinical group. The literature on tobacco cessation suggests that most relapses occur within the first month of cessation, and that approximately 90% of the relapses occur within the first 6 months.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The reasons for this may be that the workplace group was more homogenous and cohesive and peer support in workplace group may be more effective than family support in the TCC group. Peer pressure has a vital role as a predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factor for tobacco use. Thus, peer support may have a vital role in tobacco cessation. Further studies are warranted to explore the role of peer pressure in tobacco cessation as most of the previous reviews and studies are inconclusive.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The primary finding, i.e., improved outcome in workplace setting than that in the clinical group, is in support with almost three-quarters of the previously conducted studies and meta-analysis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] There are few studies that showed contradictory findings, suggesting the non-effectiveness of workplace interventions.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, these studies were uncontrolled, having poor inclusion and exclusion criteria, and other methodological issues. In addition, the recently published Cochrane review showed that there is strong evidence for some interventions (Individual/group counseling, pharmacological treatment) which increases the tobacco cessation rate in the workplace. Self-help group and social support are less effective in tobacco cessation. Out of the 57 reviewed trials, only 5 trials examined outcome with pharmacotherpy, despite having high quality of evidence; most of the trials included one or more intervention at the workplace.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the present study, intensive, comprehensive, and multiple interventions were carried out at both the places, depending on indications in individual case, which may be the reason for higher success rate among the workplace group than the clinical group and previously conducted studies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] These findings supports previously conducted studies involving multiple interventions in the workplace seetings.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Another important finding in the present study was that the TCC group participants were highly tobacco dependent than workplace group participants and the age of initiation of tobacco use was also lower among the TCC group participants than the workplace group participants. The early age of initiation of tobacco consumption and higher tobacco dependence may also be responsible for high failure rate and dropout in the TCC group than the workplace group in addition to various individual predictors such as sociodemographic variables (socioeconomic status and residence), number of quit attempts, motivational variables, and nicotine-related variables.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Tobacco cessation barriers include poor knowledge, lack of advice and support, lack of motivation, as well as intrapersonal, social, cultural, and financial factors.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Most of these barriers may be reduced or eliminated by multiple interventions carried out in our study such as pre-awareness session, focus group discussion, one-on-one counseling, and pharmacotherapy resulting in low dropout rate and adherence to the tobacco cessation program. Literature on tobacco cessation in workplace settings is mostly from western countries. Only few studies have been attempted in the Indian context, the second largest tobacco consumer in the world, with variable success.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The present study not only represents the success of workplace setting, but also of multiple interventions, as well as an intensive and integrated approach. In addition, workplace-based tobacco cessation interventions are cost effective.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In the present study, there was no difference among the two groups for confounding factors such as sociodemographic variables and pharmacological intervention reflecting well-controlled and planned study design than previous studies. Still, the index study findings should be interpreted considering few limitations. The present study population represents a small sample size, open-label design, and only male employees from low socioeconomic status. Further large scale, multicentric, controlled studies are required to better understand the role of gender, peer pressure, and sociocultural factors in tobacco cessation outcome in the workplace settings among the Indian population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study shows that multiple, intensive tobacco cessation interventions are more effective in workplace setting than the clinical setting (TCC). Peer support and regular follow-up in the workplace setting may be responsible to increase the success rate. Our study findings suggest that there is a need of expansion of existing clinic-based tobacco cessation services to workplace tobacco cessation services.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support
