More recently, many studies found that vitamin D may play an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome risk factors <xref rid="pone.0110476-Holick1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The mechanisms in which vitamin D may protect against these diseases include activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, increase arterial intimae thickness, enhancement in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and inflammatory cytokines <xref rid="pone.0110476-Holick1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Many observational studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D&#x0003c;50 nmol/l or 20 ng/ml <xref rid="pone.0110476-Holick3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> is associated with cardiometabolic diseases <xref rid="pone.0110476-Hosseinpanah1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-ElMenyar1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A meta-analysis of prospective studies by Khan et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> evaluated association between vitamin D levels and metabolic outcomes in healthy adults, demonstrated a significant inverse association of vitamin D status with metabolic syndrome. However, findings from this review were not able to establish causality, which required robust evidence from clinical trials. Clinical trials on the other hand produced inconsistent results <xref rid="pone.0110476-Breslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These trials had marked study design variation in terms of samples size, study duration, participants&#x02019; characteristics, primary outcomes, intervention dosage and formulation. Furthermore, existing randomized controlled trials were generally short duration (less than one year), insufficient dosage or underpowered.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is established risk factors for osteoporosis, falls and fractures and all these may impair HRQOL. Vitamin D deficiency can occur to any individuals regardless of age or health condition. Yet, assessment of HRQOL in vitamin D deficiency was only performed in elderly population. These observational studies found vitamin D deficiency to be inversely associated with mental and physical HRQOL <xref rid="pone.0110476-Basaran1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, most studies were restricted to disease-specific populations such as the postmenopausal osteoporotic women <xref rid="pone.0110476-Basaran1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Motsinger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Michael1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Ohta1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, elderly with heart failure <xref rid="pone.0110476-Witham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and elderly on dialysis <xref rid="pone.0110476-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Nevertheless, one observational study was found to examine the association between vitamin D and HRQOL among healthy premenopausal women <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ecemis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and another assessed the association between vitamin D and HRQOL among elderly in community setting <xref rid="pone.0110476-Chao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both studies observed inverse association between vitamin D and HRQOL. To our best knowledge, so far there are no other clinical trials evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplements on HRQOL in a healthy population.</p><p>Therefore, we designed this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine whether vitamin D supplement can improve cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood pressure (BP), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) as well as HRQOL in urban pre-menopausal women who were vitamin D deficient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><p>The protocol for this trial is reported in full details in the published protocol <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ramly1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

All premenopausal women aged 30 years old and above, working in a public university in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;389</italic>) were screened for vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D&#x02264;20 ng/ml or &#x02264;50 nmol/l). Exclusion criteria included abnormal serum PTH level (reference range for healthy adult was 1.1&#x02013;7.3 pmol/l) and serum calcium (&#x0003e;2.7 nmol/l), known to have illnesses such as granuloma forming disorder, lymphoma, sarcoidosis or any types of cancer and taking daily vitamin D supplementation &#x0003e;1000 IU/day as well as pregnant women.

Recruitment and screening including baseline clinical and anthropometry measurements were obtained in Phase one. All selected participants who meet the inclusion criteria in Phase one was ultimately invited to participate in this trial and proceed to Phase two. Written informed consent was obtained from these selected participants at this phase. The randomization and intervention of the first cohort (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;110</italic>) commenced in October 2012 while the second cohort (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;82</italic>) commenced in January 2013 (Phase two) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110476-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Intervention consisted of 50,000 IU (0.5 gram) of cholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) powder or placebo (0.5 gram) taken orally by diluting the powder into warm water before consumption. The consumption frequency was once a week for 8 weeks (equivalent to 7142 IU/day) and then once a month for 10 months (equivalent to 1667 IU/day) <xref rid="pone.0110476-Holick3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The consumption of 50,000 IU of vitamin D per week or per month is considered to be safe as the tolerable upper intake level for vitamin D is 10,000 IU per day <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We provided treatment for participants in the placebo group for 4 months after the trial completed, as it was unethical to withhold treatment. To ensure compliance with the intervention, participants were required to consume the active supplements or placebo in front of researcher during every follow-up. For those who did not attend the appointment, the researcher visited them at their workplace to give them the active supplements or placebo personally.</p><p>The randomization sequence was created using GraphPad Software with a 1&#x02236;1 allocation by a staff (AC) with no involvement in the trial. The participant&#x02019;s names were matched with the random number sequence. The names of participants from intervention and placebo were printed and pasted on to the tubes filled with either vitamin D powder or placebo. The contents were not labelled on the bottles to maintain the allocation concealment. The tubes used were identical for both active intervention and placebo. Allocation sequence data was kept by AC in a secure place so that it could not be accessed or influenced by anyone, including the researchers. Outcomes measurements, randomization and allocation were fully concealed from the researchers, staffs involved in the trial and participants until the completion of data collection.</p><p>The primary outcome measures were serum 25(OH)D, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood insulin, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HRQOL using the SF-36 questionnaire.</p><p>Participants were recalled for clinical and anthropometry measurements at 6 months and 12 months. Serum calcium results at 6 months were checked for abnormality to detect any adverse reaction due to high dose of vitamin D supplementation. Participants were also advised to contact the researchers immediately if they suspected a reaction to supplements. Participants who were found to be pregnant at some point in the trial were also excluded in view of ethical consideration.</p><p>Methods for all measurements, questionnaires and laboratory analysis are reported in full details in the published protocol <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ramly1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to establish a measure for insulin resistance. It can be calculated from a simple linear equation based on pairing FBS and Fasting Blood Insulin to establish a measure for insulin resistance: HOMA-IR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;FBS(mmol/L)&#x000d7;Fasting Blood Insulin/22.5 <xref rid="pone.0110476-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Vitamin D concentration was analyzed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) vitamin D3 (25-OH) method on the Cobas E-411 analyzer. All tests and analyses were carried out by the Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory, University Malaya Medical Centre.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>A minimum of 88 subjects was required for each arm of the trial to demonstrate a significant difference at 80% power and a two-sided 5% significance. The calculations were based on the results by Zittermann et al. <xref rid="pone.0110476-Zittermann1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> which achieved a reduction in triglycerides of 0.19&#x000b1;0.54 mmol/L in vitamin D group while there is an increment of 0.03&#x000b1;0.50 in placebo group. Assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, 97 subjects would need to be recruited per arm. Sample size calculation was conducted using the OpenEpi Software version 2.3.1.</p><p>For baseline characteristics, descriptive statistics were used. Categorical data was described using count and percentages. All numerical data was checked for normality. Normally distributed variables were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation while abnormally distributed variables were presented as median &#x000b1; interquartile range. Statistical comparisons were performed with independent <italic>t-test</italic>, Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-square test as appropriate. P-value was preset at 0.05. Some of the cases were loss to follow-up, therefore linear mixed effects procedure was used to test the differences in primary outcomes from baseline to follow-up at 6 months and 12 months. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We also performed a linear mixed effects sensitivity analysis using complete cases. All statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, 2009, Chicago, Illinois).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>This trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of University Malaya Medical Centre (reference number 907.22).

Mean PTH concentration remained suppressed in the intervention group as the mean serum 25(OH)D increased, however the change in PTH was not statistically significant. In the placebo group, the mean PTH concentration increased from baseline to 6 months (mean difference: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.60 pmol/l) but declined slightly at 12 months (mean difference: &#x02212;0.58, 95% CI: &#x02212;1.12 to &#x02212;0.05 pmol/l).

However, more than 20% of them had metabolic syndrome. Their mean BMI was in the overweight category. This reflected that our participants were at risks for CVD in the future.

However, correction of vitamin D deficiency did not improve HOMA-IR, HDL, LDL or triglycerides. Nevertheless, among participants with metabolic syndrome, vitamin D supplementation improved HDL level, offering a promising non-pharmacologic intervention in the prevention of metabolic syndrome. We also found that vitamin D supplements improved the HRQOL among the participants particularly in vitality and mental component scores.</p><p>Our results also showed the dosage and frequency of Vitamin D supplementation was safe and effective. More than 80% of participants from the intervention group achieved serum 25(OH)D above 50 nmol/l compared to only 13% from placebo group.

Although all women in the intervention group received the same dosage of vitamin D, a small proportion did not achieve a sufficient level of circulating vitamin D. This could be due to heterogeneity among women such as obesity. On further exploration of data, 6 out of 7 of these women were obese (&#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This is probably because of a decreased in bioavailability of vitamin D that is sequestered in the fat of individuals with excess adipose tissue. Monthly dosage had advantage in terms of compliance. Von Hurst et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-vonHurst1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported that their participants found it difficult to comply with daily dosage of vitamin D.

In addition, vitamin D insufficiency also induced elevations in PTH, which could adversely affect glucose metabolism. As expected, PTH levels decreased within the intervention group. On the other hand, the PTH levels also decreased within the placebo group. This could possibly due to unintentional increased consumption of dietary calcium in the placebo group because of Hawthorne effect. This could be the reason for no significant differences in insulin resistance or glucose levels between groups.</p><p>They were many clinical trials trying to establish the role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0110476-Breslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Nagpal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-AlDaghri1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-AlDaghri2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Pittas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, the results had been inconsistent. Most of these trials failed to detect any improvement in the glucose levels and insulin resistance.

Major et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> reported that total cholesterol:HDL and LDL:HDL ratio in the treatment group were significantly decreased. Whereas, in study by Zitterman et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Zittermann1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> the serum triglycerides and LDL (p&#x0003c;0.001) were reduced after one year of treatment with 3320 IU of vitamin D daily among healthy overweight individuals with inadequate vitamin D levels. These inconsistent results could be due to variations in sample size, dosage and formulation of vitamin D supplement, characteristics of participants and duration of trials.</p><p>Our participants were generally healthy premenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency. Although 26% of them had history of CVD, majority had normal glucose and lipid values, which may be difficult to improve further with vitamin D supplement. However, individuals with higher baseline metabolic risks may benefit from vitamin D supplementation. Analysis on a subset of our participants with metabolic risks at baseline demonstrated an improvement in HDL among the intervention group. However, the null effect of vitamin D supplementation on other metabolic risk factors may be due to the small sample size of our participants with metabolic risks. Therefore, there might be inadequate power to detect the effectiveness of vitamin D on these components. Future studies should recruit women with vitamin D deficiency and at risks for metabolic syndrome or CVD.</p><p>The increase levels in some of the clinical indicators (systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol) within both intervention and placebo groups was probably due to the advancing age that affected the pathogenesis of these indicators <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Twelve months of treatment with vitamin D may not be sufficient to produce a significant reduction in the cardiometabolic risk factors as more time may be needed for the vitamin D to correct the metabolic risks back to normal.</p><p>The optimal dose for vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic risk could also influence our results. Expert opinions for daily vitamin D dosage ranged from 600 to 2000 IU for prevention of cardiovascular or metabolic risk <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Vacek1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Whiting1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The Institute of Medicine Report <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> concluded that due to lack of evidence, they could not make any recommendation for non-skeletal outcomes. The method of vitamin D supplementation in our study (50,000 IU weekly for 2 months and once a month after that) differed from the daily doses (400&#x02013;4000 IU) used in majority of other studies <xref rid="pone.0110476-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Pittas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Mitri1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. We used the recommendation by Holick <xref rid="pone.0110476-Holick3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> which stated that for an effective vitamin D deficiency treatment, higher dosage was needed at initial stage to correct the vitamin D deficient status. However, this recommendation only corrected the vitamin D deficiency. There is no current recommendation on the optimum dosage needed for improvement of cardiometabolic outcomes. There are few other studies using similar dosage <xref rid="pone.0110476-Talaei1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> or larger dose of vitamin D supplementation <xref rid="pone.0110476-Nagpal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Witham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0110476-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> but in shorter duration (less than 6 months). Although we did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic risks, we cannot exclude the possibility that higher dosage of supplementation for a longer duration might help in the prevention of cardiometabolic risks among individuals with existing co-morbidities or cardiometabolic events such as myocardial infarct or stroke. However, a review article has indicate that negative outcomes could be predicted due to failure to maintain circulating vitamin D over time as with monthly, quarterly or yearly bolus vitamin D dosing <xref rid="pone.0110476-Hollis1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It appears that for the optimal benefits of vitamin D supplementation, sufficient amount of vitamin D should be provided on a daily basis to ensure that stable circulating concentrations are maintained over time as vitamin D has short circulating half-life of vitamin D. These particular reasons might explain the varying results of clinical trials. Therefore, a large-scale prospective clinical trial is needed to examine large dosage of daily versus weekly and monthly vitamin D with the same primary outcome measures.</p><p>On the other hand, we found vitamin D supplements improved the HRQOL of participants particularly in vitality and mental component score. These improvements were statistically significant but clinically insignificant. However, it has some clinical relevance as vitality assessed energy and fatigue; and women with vitamin D deficiency usually feel tired, low energy and worn out. Vitamin D is a nuclear steroid hormone which thought to be involved in brain health and function as well as neuromuscular functions. Vitamin D receptors in the cell&#x02019;s nucleus regulate the expression of target genes when bound to 1,25(OH)D. These receptors are expressed in areas of the brain important to behavioural regulation <xref rid="pone.0110476-Kalueff1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. An observational study by Ecemis et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ecemis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> found physical component score, mental component score, physical functioning score and vitality score were impaired in vitamin D deficient and insufficient healthy premenopausal women. Other studies did relate vitamin D status with depression <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110476-Shaffer1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> and mental component score <xref rid="pone.0110476-Motsinger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Another observational study also concluded that women who were on daily vitamin D supplementation had higher mental HRQOL scores <xref rid="pone.0110476-Motsinger1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>At baseline, our study showed slightly higher scores in bodily pain components compared to the general population <xref rid="pone.0110476-Anand1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Although muscle and bone pain was a common symptom of vitamin D deficiency, we did not find any significant improvement for physical components score. This may be due to non-specific definition of pain was used in the SF-36 questionnaire which we administered. For example, Huang et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> used VR-36 (Veteran Rand 36 items) questionnaire as well as VAS (visual analog scale) to evaluate bodily pain and found that vitamin D supplementation was effective to alleviate pain and improve other components of HRQOL. Similarly, Sakalli et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Sakalli1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> used VAS and SF-36 questionnaire to detect the level of pain and they reported that single megadose of vitamin D was effective to increase QOL particularly physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, social functioning and also decrease non-specific musculoskeletal pain. On the contrary, another study that used a disease-specific tool (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire) did not find any improvement in physical function or HRQOL in older patients with heart failure <xref rid="pone.0110476-Witham1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>To date, very few studies examined the relationship of vitamin D and HRQOL among healthy premenopausal women without osteoporosis as the study population. So far, we only found study by Ecemis et al <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ecemis1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> on Vitamin D and HRQOL among the healthy premenopausal women. They reported significant association between vitamin D and HRQOL.</p><p>It is difficult to recommend sunlight exposure to improve vitamin D levels due to interpersonal variations in sunlight exposure as well as the risks of skin cancer due to excessive UV radiation. However, skin cancer is a rare disease in Asia as compared to Caucasians <xref rid="pone.0110476-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. A study by Nurbazlin et al. <xref rid="pone.0110476-Nurbazlin1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> has found that urban women in Malaysia had significantly lower sunlight exposure and vitamin D status compared to rural women. This study shown that sun index were the major factors influencing vitamin D status in Malaysian women. A trial study on the effect of nutrition education and sun exposure on vitamin D status among postmenopausal Malay women also found serum vitamin D level was increased through nutrition education and sunlight exposure <xref rid="pone.0110476-Istiany1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Therefore it is sensible to recommend additional sunlight exposure for Malaysian women especially those living in the urban. Besides that, the best way of preventing vitamin D deficiency is by food fortification. Food fortification has the dual advantage of being able to deliver nutrients to large segments of the population without requiring radical changes in food consumption patterns. A recent review study found vitamin D fortification using vegetable oil can be the efficacious way to increase intake of daily vitamin D in Southeast Asian countries <xref rid="pone.0110476-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In addition to fortification, supplementation can be the alternative solution with high and less frequent doses are advisable especially to high risk population such as elderly. Nevertheless, we need to learn more about the long term safety and efficacy of the high dosage, less frequent vitamin D supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations And Strength</title><p>Although all of our participants were vitamin D deficient, only small proportion of them was at risk for CVD as our study was conducted in a non-clinical setting. From the National Health and Morbidity Survey IV (NHMS IV) conducted in 2011, only 14.5% of women age more than 18 years old were diabetic while 31.6% were hypertensive <xref rid="pone.0110476-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Therefore, we had difficulty recruiting women with vitamin D deficiency as those with CVD risk. So, our study was not powered to detect the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic risks. We were also not able to examine the incidence of cardiovascular events due to the short duration. A larger sample size of high risk population for CVD with longer follow-up and higher intakes of vitamin D supplementation may be needed to establish whether steady normalization of vitamin D levels will translate to decrease in cardiovascular event incidence. An article by Heaney <xref rid="pone.0110476-Heaney1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> has indicated that inadequate intakes of vitamin D may produce more than one disease by more than one mechanisms and may require several years for the consequent morbidity to be sufficiently evident to be clinically recognizable as &#x0201c;disease&#x0201d;. Similarly more established evident are needed to prove that higher intakes of vitamin D are required for its prevention. For example, preventing the osteoporosis requires almost 4 times the amount of vitamin D needed to prevent rickets and this knowledge takes years to be established.</p><p>Nevertheless, our study has several strengths that worth mention. One of them is its high quality of randomisation where there was concealment of allocation, double-blinding among the participant and researchers and placebo controlled design. This reduced bias in term of selection and information bias as self-reported HRQOL was subjective. Larger but less frequent dosage of vitamin D may be advantageous from a compliance perspective compared to daily doses. There was also no problem with seasonal confounders as Malaysia is blessed with sufficient sunshine all year round necessary for cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. Both groups were comparable in outdoor physical activity, sunlight exposure activity and diet at baseline and there were no changes pre and post intervention. In addition, our participants&#x02019; retention rate was good with only 11% drop-out from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This trial showed that Vitamin D supplementation over one year to premenopausal vitamin D deficient women living in an urban tropical country had no meaningful effect on measured cardiometabolic risk factors, but it did improve some components of HRQOL. Our findings provided evidence for the larger dosage but lower frequency to be effective in improving serum vitamin D levels. Further long term trials of this intervention versus daily and weekly vitamin D dosing especially among the high risk individuals with existing co-morbidities are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s8"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110476.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>
