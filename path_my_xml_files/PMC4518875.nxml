The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a non-inferiority trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 40-h multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation compared with 100-h multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation on work participation for workers on sick leave due to subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A non-inferiority study design will be applied. The study population consists of workers who are on part-time or full-time sick leave due to subacute or chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. Two multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation programs following the bio-psychosocial approach will be evaluated in this study: 40-h vocational rehabilitation and 100-h vocational rehabilitation, both delivered over a maximum of 15 weeks. The 100-h vocational rehabilitation comprises five modules: work participation coordination, graded activity, cognitive behavioral therapy, group education, and relaxation. The 40-h vocational rehabilitation comprises work participation coordination and a well-reasoned choice from the other four modules. Four rehabilitation centers will participate in this study, each delivering both interventions. Patients will be randomized into one of the interventions, stratified for the duration of sick leave (&#x0003c;6 weeks or &#x02265;6 weeks) and type of sick leave (part-time or full-time). The primary outcome is work participation, measured by self-reported sick leave days, and will be assessed at baseline, mid-term, discharge, and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes are work ability, disability, quality of life, and physical functioning and will be assessed at baseline, discharge, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Cost outcomes are absenteeism, presenteeism, healthcare usage, and travelling costs. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal and employer perspectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results obtained from this study will be useful for vocational rehabilitation practice and will provide stakeholders with relevant insights into two versions of vocational rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Dutch Trial Register identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp">NTR4362</ext-link> (registered 17 March 2014).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>vocational rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>subacute musculoskeletal pain</kwd><kwd>chronic musculoskeletal pain</kwd><kwd>work participation</kwd><kwd>cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>non-inferiority</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>multicenter</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major health problem associated with decreased functioning and quality of life, sick leave, and increased direct and indirect medical costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of the costs (48 to 88 %) are attributed to indirect costs due to sick leave from work or productivity loss while at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Chronic musculoskeletal pain arises when acute musculoskeletal pain does not disappear within 6 weeks, which occurs in 10&#x02013;20 % of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After a duration of 6 weeks, it is considered subacute musculoskeletal pain (SMP), and if the pain is still present after 12 weeks, it is considered chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If there is no clear medical explanation, the chronic musculoskeletal pain is called &#x0201c;nonspecific.&#x0201d;</p><p>Vocational rehabilitation is a widely advocated intervention for sick-listed workers with subacute or chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Vocational rehabilitation is &#x0201c;a multiprofessional evidence-based approach that is provided in different settings, services, and activities to working-age individuals with health-related impairments, limitations, or restrictions with work functioning and whose primary aim is to optimize work participation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, work participation is conceptualized as the involvement in work roles or the lived experience of work. Work participation restriction refers to problems an individual may experience at work. Examples include number of hours lost from work (that is, absenteeism), underperforming job expectations, reduced desired employment (for example, part-time employment, short-term disability, long-term disability, premature retirement, or fewer working hours than desired), and reduced career growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, in this paper, work participation (restriction) is expressed as the number of sick leave days due to subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. Research shows that vocational rehabilitation improves return to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and thus facilitates work participation. However, the dose-effect relation of vocational rehabilitation on work participation is unclear. Several reviews on the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation on work participation for sick-listed workers with SMP and CMP show a wide range in treatment hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, a systematic review revealed a range of 6.4 to 196.8 hours in pain rehabilitation programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. So far, only one randomized controlled trial has compared the dose-effect relation of vocational rehabilitation (VR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Sick-listed workers with CMP were classified at baseline as good, medium, or poor based on their prognosis for return to work (that is, return to work defined by the authors as absence of sick pay or related benefits in a given month), and were thereafter randomized to extensive VR (approximately 120 treatment hours), light VR (approximately 20 to 30 treatment hours), or care as usual (referred back to general practitioner). After 14 months follow-up, the participants classified with poor prognosis benefited most from the extensive VR, resulting in higher return to work rates, whereas patients classified with medium prognosis benefited from both the light and extensive programs on improving return to work rates. In another paper, but using the same study construct and population as in the Haldorsen trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], results were obtained without the prognosis on return to work (that is, good, medium, or poor) and on a follow-up period of two years. After 2 years follow-up, the light VR resulted in the highest return to work rates compared with usual care, but significance was only found in men. Additionally, the authors found no significant difference on return to work rates between light and extensive VR or between extensive VR and usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>As resources in healthcare are scarce, it is necessary to provide stakeholders information on the cost-effectiveness of intervention programs. Economic evaluations (cost-effectiveness studies) provide information on the relative efficiency of two or more alternative interventions. The main aspects of any economic evaluation are to identify, measure, value, and compare the costs and consequences of alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A randomized controlled trial found that a participatory approach (approximately 40 treatment hours consisting of a workplace intervention and graded activity) for sick-listed patients with chronic back pain was cost-effective on work participation (that is, return to work) compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Similar interventions conducted in subacute low back pain patients also show promising results on cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, there are no studies known that compare the cost-effectiveness of two (or more) vocational rehabilitation programs. To provide relevant stakeholders (that is, patients, referrers, employers, vocational rehabilitation centers, healthcare insurers, and policy makers) with information about effective and cost-effective vocational rehabilitation, a comparison of two versions of vocational rehabilitation is needed.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority study to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 40-h vocational rehabilitation compared with 100-h vocational rehabilitation on work participation for patients with subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain and with sick leave from work.

These modules are described in detail in <xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>. Since the choice of 30 h of modules will be prioritized by the multidisciplinary screening team after the multidisciplinary screening at baseline, the content may differ among patients. The 40-h VR lasts a maximum of 40 h in 15 weeks. Each rehabilitation center will prioritize the number of sessions per participant per week, but the following framework will be a guideline for the rehabilitation centers: weeks 1-5 two sessions/week, weeks 6-10 one session/week, weeks 11-15 2-3 sessions in five weeks. The 40-h VR program will be extended in case of the following: a patient&#x02019;s percentage of working hours per week pertaining to contract hours at discharge compared with working hours per week pertaining to contract hours at baseline is extended by 25 to 50 %, and the multidisciplinary team expresses strong arguments that the patient is likely to benefit from the extension. However, this protocol deviation should occur in no more than 5 % of the cases. This percentage is arbitrarily chosen by the authors of this paper; if more than 5 % of the participants deviate from the study protocol, the robustness on non-inferiority (that is, research question 1) will decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>100-hour vocational rehabilitation</title><p>The 100-h vocational rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary bio-psychosocial group-based program and encompasses a set of modules: work participation coordination, graded activity, cognitive behavioral therapy, group education, and relaxation.

Sick leave will be measured using the absenteeism items of the iMTA (institute for Medical Technology Assessment) Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The questionnaire has a recall period of 4 weeks and measures sick leave on working days and on a generic basis (that is, the reason for sick leave is not asked). We have made slight adaptations to measure sick leave specifically (that is, related to subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain, or other reasons such as flu), and we have added an item to assess the working hours at this moment: &#x0201c;Are you working for the full number of hours you were contracted for?&#x0201d; This question has three possible answers: &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;no, I am partly at work,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no, I am on 100 % sick leave.&#x0201d; After the answer &#x0201c;no, I am partly at work&#x0201d; the participant is asked to fill in the number of hours he/she is working per week at that moment. The iPCQ is the result of combining two existing Dutch questionnaires (PRODISQ and SF-HLQ), and is recommended by the Dutch guideline for health economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The iPCQ has been translated by a professional language institution into a patient-friendly version using more simple language, thereby increasing the feasibility and validity of the questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Slight adaptations in the context and scope of health care practitioners were made to better match TiC-P to the target population (that is, from psychiatry to pain and work).

Step 3. Linear mixed models with multilevel analyses will be performed to assess non-inferiority between the two groups at the 12-month follow-up (that is, intervention period and 12-month follow-up) by means of 95 % confidence intervals (that is, the CI approach).

Costs consist of direct medical costs (that is, intervention costs, health care usage and travelling costs) and indirect costs (that is, productivity loss in paid work due to absenteeism and presenteeism). All costs will be summated for each individual patient. All summated costs will be indexed in euros for the reference year 2015. We will follow the friction cost method with a friction cost period of 160 days and an elasticity of 0.8 for the calculation of absenteeism costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], as recommended by the Dutch guideline for health economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

As absenteeism data will be used for the assessment of the effect ratio of the ICER, it will be excluded from the cost ratio part of the ICER. The ICER can be interpreted as the net costs (or savings) per extra unit of effect. In our study, the extra unit of effect equals a 1-day increase in work participation. To estimate uncertainty in the cost and effect data, nonparametric bootstraps will be used to simulate 5,000 ICERs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

Because of the difference in program hours between 40-h and 100-h VR, we expect 40-h VR to benefit by 8 extra working days available during the intervention period. We accounted for this in the power calculation by using minus 8 as the expected mean difference between 40-h and 100-h VR. In our power calculation, we assumed a normal distribution of the primary outcome work participation. If the data on the primary outcome does not follow a normal distribution, we will perform log transformations.

A separate block randomization table is generated for each of the four participating vocational rehabilitation centers.

After the multidisciplinary screening (at baseline), the multidisciplinary screening team and rehabilitation physician will fulfil all study criteria. If participants meet all criteria, they will be allocated to 40-h or 100-h VR. Treatment allocation will be performed by a member of the multidisciplinary screening team (MST) at each center and can be performed at the center or via telephone (this will differ among the centers). The MST member hands over two envelopes (left over) of that stratum, and the patient is asked to pick one of the envelopes, open the envelope and sign the note. In the case of telephone allocation, the MST member will ask the patient to sign informed consent and to return it via a reply envelope.

We hypothesize that there is non-inferiority on work participation after a 12-month follow-up period (including the intervention period and 12 months follow-up) between both programs, and we expect cost-effectiveness of 40-h VR in comparison with 100-h VR.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Context of this study</title><p>In the Netherlands, both employer and employee are responsible for the work participation process of the sick-listed employee during the first 2 years of sick leave. The employer and employee can be supported by a certified reintegration company and/or an occupational physician (OP). In the first 2 years of sickness, the employer is responsible for the costs of wage replacement, which is regulated by the Dutch Gatekeeper Improvement Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. As a result of this act, the employer has to reimburse the work participation coordination module (costs: approximately &#x020ac;1,200) for both interventions performed in this study. The other intervention modules are reimbursed by healthcare insurers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The first methodological consideration of this study is that we were not able to fulfil the recommended steps for the composition of a margin of non-inferiority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. This was because there is currently no historical data, such as meta-analysis, comparing the 100-h vocational rehabilitation with usual care. However, our non-inferiority margin is based on results from five randomized controlled trials evaluating multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation compared with control interventions (that is, usual care, such as occupational physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, <italic>etcetera</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These studies found 43 days as the mean difference ((41.9 + 53.7 + 42 + 60.5 + 17.5)/5) in days on sick leave after one year follow-up in favor of multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation. Consequently, we have decided that 30 is an acceptable margin of non-inferiority. One can argue that this limit is too wide, and that claiming non-inferiority could be achieved too simply, but for claiming non-inferiority, the upper bound of the one-sided 95 % confidence interval of the treatment effect difference (40-h VR &#x02013; 100-h VR) must be 30 or less. Furthermore, when the margin of non-inferiority of 30 is reached after 12 months follow-up, this is in fact 13 days (43&#x02013;30) better than if a patient had been referred to usual care (occupational physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, <italic>etcetera</italic>). A mean saving of 10 sick days per year is considered the smallest effect that would be clinically worthwhile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. We therefore consider 30 as a reasonable margin of non-inferiority. The second methodological consideration of this study is the slight differences between the participating rehabilitation centers. For instance, each center has its own logistic restrictions, such as a restriction in intervention facilities (that is, equipment, building); and centers have evolved their own methods over the years. This may lead to interpretation issues in analyzing the blended results of the four centers. However, we solved this problem by multilevel analyses and by performing both interventions at each center, that is, by randomizing at the participant level. Although performing both interventions at the center level may introduce contamination, we consider that the advantages of randomization at the participant level outweigh the disadvantages of contamination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>The first strength of this study is the assessment of the primary outcome work participation with self-reported questionnaires with a recall period of one month.

The second strength of this study is the analysis of the cost-effectiveness from both the societal and the employer&#x02019;s perspective. It is important to provide employers with information on the return on investment of both interventions, as this will help them to consider the right treatment. A third strength of this study is that we consider presenteeism in the cost-effectiveness evaluation. Although most cost-effectiveness studies do not assess presenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], it is meaningful to take into account since the costs related to it are enormous, as shown by L&#x000f6;tters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], who found that for workers who returned to work after musculoskeletal disorders, the median loss for an 8-h workday was 1.6 h, and this remained at 12-month follow-up. A final strength of this study is the participation of four rehabilitation centers, all working with the bio-psychosocial model as a blueprint. This will increase the generalizability of this study.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it is not possible to blind the patients and the multidisciplinary intervention and screening team. This may result in non-compliance to the treatment protocol, because patients may be aware of which intervention parts they do not receive (especially in the 40-h VR group), whereas other patients in the same group will receive all intervention modules (see <xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>). When this deviation occurs on a large scale in the 40-h VR group, this will harm conclusions about non-inferiority. Another limitation of this study is that we do not correct for compensation costs, that is, when colleagues take over the work of the less productive employee in their regular working hours. This may overestimate presenteeism costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>This study will provide essential knowledge about the dose-effect relation of vocational rehabilitation on work participation for workers on sick leave due to subacute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. The insights obtained from this study can be implemented in vocational rehabilitation practice, where centers would be able to judge which program (40-h or 100-h) fit their patient groups best. Moreover, if our hypothesis about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 40-h VR compared with 100-h VR is valid, this will be beneficial for patients, employers, and health care insurers. Patients will benefit from a decline in intervention hours, which will result in more time for work participation and leisure. Employers will benefit from a higher return on their investments, and health care insurers will benefit from higher volumes of patients who can participate in vocational rehabilitation within the same amount of time and money or the same number of patients with lower costs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant enrollment started in November 2014.

The authors will also conduct focus group interviews with the multidisciplinary intervention teams to explore their experiences with both programs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec35"><title>Appendix 1: Intervention modules</title><sec id="Sec36"><title>Work participation coordination</title><p>Work participation coordination is carried out by a work participation coordinator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and encompasses a workplace visit, case management, and two evaluation moments. The workplace visit includes an ergonomic workplace analysis and a consultation with employer and employee (patient), with the aim of developing a work participation plan. Case management consists of individual coaching sessions with the patient and unplanned ad hoc conversations with the patient during the program. The coaching style of the work participation coordinator is mainly based on solution-focused coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and on empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].
