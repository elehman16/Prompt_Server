CARDERA randomised 467 patients with early active RA to different disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) regimens, including high-dose tapering corticosteroids. TACIT randomised 205 established patients with active RA to combination DMARDs (cDMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; inhibitors (TNFis). Short-Form 36 (SF-36) measured HRQoL across eight domains, generating physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores. Linear regression evaluated 6-month intensive treatment impacts. Mean SF-36 scores, stratified by end point disease activity category, were compared with age/gender-matched population scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In CARDERA, intensive corticosteroid treatment gave significantly greater improvements in PCS but not MCS scores relative to placebo. In TACIT, all eight SF-36 domains had improvements from baseline exceeding minimal clinically important differences with cDMARDs and TNFis. Significantly greater improvements with TNFi relative to cDMARDs were reported in PCS only (p=0.034), after adjusting for covariates. Remission provided the best SF-36 profiles, but scores in physical functioning, role physical and general health in both trials remained below normative values. Patient global assessment of disease activity had a greater association with HRQoL than other disease activity score (DAS28) components.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intensive corticosteroid treatment in early RA improves physical but not mental health, relative to placebo. In established RA, cDMARDs and TNFi provide similar improvements in HRQoL. As remission optimises but fails to normalise HRQoL, a focus on treatment strategies targeting HRQoL is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration numbers</title><p>CARDERA was registered as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/search?q=ISRCTN32484878">ISRCTN 32484878</ext-link>.

Improvements in both treatment arms in both trials exceeded MID.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have undertaken secondary analyses of two completed randomised clinical trials in early and established RA. Our first aim was to evaluate the effect of intensive treatments&#x02014;high-dose corticosteroids versus placebo in early RA, and cDMARDs versus TNFis in established RA&#x02014;on SF-36 domains during the first 6&#x02005;months of treatment. With all active treatments, there were improvements in all eight SF-36 domains, which exceeded MCIDs (5&#x02005;units). However, in early RA, corticosteroids only provided improvements beyond placebo in physical but not mental SF-36 domains. Furthermore, in established RA, there were similar improvements with cDMARDs and TNFis. These results show that in these two trials intensive treatments resulted in limited additional benefits on HRQoL compared with less intensive treatments.</p><p>Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of remission and other DAS28-defined disease activity categories on SF-36 domains at trial end points. Patients in remission had better HRQoL profiles than patients in higher disease activity states. However, scores in PF, RP and GH in both trials remained below normative values, with large deficits observed in established RA patients enrolled to TACIT. The IMPROVED trial suggested that in patients with early inflammatory arthritis, attaining prompt remission normalises HRQoL.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Overall, these findings suggest that in patients with established RA and in some patients with early RA, attaining remission does not normalise HRQoL, but attaining early remission in patients with early inflammatory arthritis may be sufficient to achieve this goal.</p><p>Our third aim was to assess which DAS28 components had the strongest associations with HRQoL at trial end points. In CARDERA and TACIT, PtGA had the strongest association with PCS and MCS scores; associations with SJC and ESR levels were weaker. Although different types of patient-reported outcomes such as PtGA and SF-36 component summary scores may be expected to be inter-related, our finding that PtGA was most strongly associated with physical and mental HRQoL compared with other DAS28 components is of clinical importance. It suggests that in order to optimise HRQoL in RA, it might be helpful to place an increased focus on improving PtGA scores. In routine practice, the PtGA is not a key driver of rheumatologists' treatment decisions, with Dutch<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Canadian<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> studies of RA patients demonstrating that SJC and physician global assessment of disease activity to be central drivers of treatment escalation. As PtGA does not purely reflect how active a patient considers their disease to be&#x02014;a previous study by Studenic <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showed that 76% and 1.3% of the variability in PtGA was explained by pain and physical function, respectively&#x02014;treatment intensity decisions should not be based on PtGA alone. However, there is likely to be a role for more holistic approaches to managing RA patients that move beyond purely targeting remission, and consider treating other disease impacts such as pain, fatigue and mood, which are likely to improve PtGA scores.</p><p>The failure of TNFi to improve individual SF-36 domains beyond cDMARDs in TACIT was of interest. Although limited by a modest sample size, TACIT provided only little evidence that 6-months TNFi with DMARDs was superior to cDMARDs at improving HRQoL. Previous trials of TNFi with methotrexate versus methotrexate monotherapy in DMARD-IR patients show significant improvements in PCS and MCS scores with biologics, although the effects are greater on physical than mental health.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To our knowledge, only one other study has compared the effect of TNFi and cDMARDs on HRQoL. A secondary analysis of the BeST study showed 12-month EuroQol scores were similar with sequential DMARD monotherapy, step-up combination DMARDs, initial combination DMARDs with high-dose tapering prednisolone, and methotrexate with infliximab, although prompter improvements were seen in the latter two groups.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> TACIT and BeST suggest TNFis have only limited benefits on HRQoL compared with cDMARDs. There is insufficient evidence, however, to know if this is correct in all clinical situations; further large trials are needed to confirm the relative benefits of different intensive treatment regimens.</p><p>In CARDERA and TACIT SF-36, health profiles were superior in patients attaining remission, compared with those attaining LDA. This replicates previous work by Radner <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> who reported that in 356 RA patients with longstanding RA from Austria, remission gave superior SF-36 profiles to LDA. Interestingly, as in our analysis, Radner <italic>et al</italic> also found most SF-36 domains in RA patients in remission were below general population levels. Their findings therefore support our view that additional management strategies are needed to normalise HRQoL in addition to attaining remission.</p><p>Our study has several strengths. As a secondary analysis of two clinical trials, assessments were standardised. Its main findings were similar in early and established RA patients receiving different intensive treatments. Patients were recruited from many English centres, which followed consistent healthcare approaches. It also has several limitations. As a post-hoc analysis, it did not test a prespecified hypothesis. It was restricted to assessing treatment impacts in active RA, limiting its generalisability to all RA populations. It focused on 6-month and 12-month HRQoL changes; longer time frames could show greater benefits. It used a generic HRQoL assessment (SF-36); disease-specific measures like RAQoL<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> may better capture treatment effects. TACIT was a non-inferiority trial comparing cDMARDs with TNFi strategies; our analysis was underpowered to detect small improvements in SF-36.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Finally, short-term high-dose steroids are not widely used in current practice.</p><p>Our key finding that physical HRQoL remained impaired even when intensive treatment achieved remission could reflect several underlying drivers. Loss of lean muscle mass, which is linked with RA disability,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> may occur rapidly in active RA and will not be reversed with drug treatment. Joint damage, though less common in contemporary RA cohorts, has detrimental effects on physical function<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and cannot be reversed by drug treatment. Persistent pain may also impair physical health. Finally, clinical remission may be insensitive at detecting low-level synovitis and inflammation, which could affect physical HRQoL.</p><p>Patient surveys suggest current RA management does not fully address their needs and expectations.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The &#x02018;RAISE patient needs&#x02019; survey found few patient&#x02013;physician consultations discussed HRQoL.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The &#x02018;Good Days Fast&#x02019; and &#x02018;Getting to Your Destination Faster&#x02019; surveys found most patients rated &#x02018;having a good day&#x02019; as their preferred target for RA management; being free of fatigue and pain often characterised &#x02018;good days&#x02019;.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In these surveys, pain was a prevalent problem for patients with RA. Our findings suggest that attaining remission, though crucial to improving RA outcomes, is insufficient by itself to entirely normalise HRQoL in active RA, particularly in established disease. New ways are needed to identify and treat specifically impaired areas of HRQoL&#x02014;including pain and fatigue&#x02014;as an adjunct to treatments that reduce synovitis assessed by DAS28. Potential options include using psychological approaches, increasing exercise and improving pain management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ICS, DLS and FI conceived and designed the study.
