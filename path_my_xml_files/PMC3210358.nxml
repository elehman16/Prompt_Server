Approximately 10% of adults in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and Hong Kong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have diabetes. Diabetic complications cause premature death and disabilities with reduced productivity and high healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of endstage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Annually, 15,000 Japanese develop ESRD due to diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Hong Kong with 6.7 million southern Chinese, 4,268 patients received renal replacement therapy in 1999, that is 627 patients per million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Glycaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] control have been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow decline of renal function. In two landmark studies of type 2 diabetic nephropathy (Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Irbesartan Type II Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) reduced proteinuria, slowed decline of renal function and reduced incidence of ESRD. In the RENAAL subgroup analysis including 17% of its participants of Asian ethnicity, ARB reduced risk of renal outcomes by 35% in Asians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and 45% in Japanese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] compared with 16% in the whole cohort. Despite the high risk of East Asians for diabetic kidney disease, they often tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) poorly due to cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, there are ongoing concerns regarding the risk&#x02013;benefit ratio of dual therapy with ARB and ACEI in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>In this randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial named ORIENT (Olmesartan Reducing Incidence of Endstage Renal Disease in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial), we examined the renoprotective benefits of olmesartan medoxomil, an ARB, using the composite endpoint of time to the first occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), ESRD and death, mostly in the presence of ACEI therapy. The safety of olmesartan and its effect on renal function, proteinuria and cardiovascular outcome was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Participants</bold> The study design was in line with the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and conducted in good clinical practice by experts in nephrology and endocrinology. The study design has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We enrolled type 2 diabetic patients from Japan and Hong Kong with the following inclusion criteria: (1) age between 30 and 70&#x000a0;years; (2) urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) &#x0003e;33.9&#x000a0;mg/mmol (&#x0003e;300&#x000a0;mg/g) in the first morning urine sample; (3) serum creatinine (SCr) concentration of 88.40&#x02013;221.00&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l (1.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;mg/dl) in women and 106.08&#x02013;221.00&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l (1.2&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;mg/dl) in men. Major exclusion criteria included: (1) type 1 diabetes; (2) history of myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) within 3&#x000a0;months prior to consent; (3) percutaneous coronary intervention, carotid artery or peripheral artery revascularisation within 6&#x000a0;months; (4) stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within 1&#x000a0;year; (5) unstable angina pectoris or heart failure (HF) of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV; (6) rapidly progressive renal disease within 3&#x000a0;months prior to consent; (7) severe orthostatic hypotension; and (8) serum potassium level &#x02264;3.5&#x000a0;mmol/l or &#x02265;5.5&#x000a0;mmol/l.</p><p><bold>Study design, governance and implementation</bold> The trial commenced in 2003 and was approved by the institutional ethics committee concerned. All patients provided written informed consent. In Hong Kong, all patients were treated with ACEI. In 2006 when losartan was approved for use in type 2 diabetic nephropathy with hypertension by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, we re-obtained a written informed consent from each patient in Japan to continue to participate in the study. The study was governed by a steering committee, an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and an endpoint adjudication committee, all consisting of academics and clinicians independent of the sponsor. The steering committee provided guidance for the overall study design, conduct of the trial, data management and analysis. The endpoint adjudication committee evaluated and classified the primary and secondary outcomes under blinded conditions.The source data included case report forms, hospital records and laboratory data (e.g. biomarkers, electrocardiogram, images of computerised tomography [CT] scans and MRI). For each specialty (cardiology, neurology and nephrology), two or three experts independently classified all clinical endpoints.An IDMC comprising a nephrologist, a diabetologist and a statistician, independently monitored the trial for safety and ethical issues with access to assigned codes as indicated. The IDMC was able to discontinue the entire study if an unusually high number of participants developed unexpected severe adverse events or in the unlikely event that unblinding was indicated for clinical decision making. During the entire study period, none of the treatment codes have been unblinded. Daiichi Sankyo monitored the implementation of the trial, validated all source data and performed the analysis as guided by the steering committee. All members of the steering committee had full access to data and prepared the final manuscript. The protocol was approved by regulatory authorities and the ethics review committee at each participating institution.</p><p><bold>Interventions</bold> During the initial 6-week screening period, patients were treated with placebo and assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10&#x000a0;mg of olmesartan once-daily or placebo. If the target BP of &#x0003c;130/85&#x000a0;mmHg was not achieved 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation or at any time thereafter, the dose of olmesartan was increased to 20&#x000a0;mg daily (or placebo), with further titration to 40&#x000a0;mg (or placebo), if necessary, upon which additional antihypertensive agents could be used. These included diuretics, &#x003b2; blockers, calcium channel blockers and &#x003b1; blockers. Every reasonable attempt was made to up-titrate the test drug to the maximum dose, even if target BP was achieved. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics or ARB was prohibited, and addition of ACEI after enrolment was not allowed. Patients treated with ACEI at baseline must continue with the same dosage throughout the study.</p><p><bold>Study outcomes and definitions</bold> All patients visited the clinic at 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;weeks, and then returned every 12&#x000a0;weeks throughout the study duration. At each visit, BP was measured and clinical samples were collected for measurement of urinary protein/creatinine ratio and serum levels of creatinine and potassium. All randomised patients including those discontinued from the study for any reason other than death were followed up for ascertainment of primary and secondary endpoints until termination of study.The efficacy measure was the time to the first event of the primary composite outcome of doubling of SCr, ESRD (SCr &#x0003e;442.01&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l [5&#x000a0;mg/dl]), chronic dialysis, transplantation and all-cause death. SCr was measured at a central laboratory in Japan (SRL, Tokyo, Japan). The secondary composite outcome included: (1) a composite endpoint of first occurrence of any of the following events: cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke except for TIAs, non-fatal MI, hospitalisation for unstable angina, hospitalisation for HF, revascularisation of coronary, carotid or peripheral arteries, lower extremity amputation; (2) change in proteinuria; (3) rate of decline of SCr reciprocal (1/SCr).</p><p><bold>Randomisation and blinding</bold> After written informed consent was obtained and following the run-in period, eligible patients were randomised into olmesartan group or placebo group by the registration centre in Japan (EPS, Tokyo, Japan) through fax contact. The centre assigned each patient by the dynamic allocation method, depending on whether or not they were using ACEIs, further stratified by UACR and SCr. The proportion of patients included in each category was similar between the olmesartan and placebo groups.All persons involved in the study were unaware of the drug assignments, except for the person in charge of drug assignment who was not involved in the study. The IDMC examined the data in a blinded fashion, except for serious adverse events for which a causal relationship with the study drug cannot be ruled out.</p><p><bold>Sample-size estimation</bold> We assumed the primary endpoint in this study, defined as the composite renal event rate, to be 0.583&#x000a0;events/patient during an average 4-year follow-up period in the placebo group. The assumed event rate was calculated based on the results from Japanese patients in the RENAAL Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (event rate, 34/52&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.654 with an average follow-up period of 3.4&#x000a0;years). We assumed a 30% risk reduction with baseline ACEI treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the event rate of the placebo group with baseline ACEI treatment was estimated to be 0.583 with an average follow-up period of 4&#x000a0;years. On the other hand, the event rate of the olmesartan group with ACEI treatment was assumed to be 0.434, as we hypothesised an additional 35% risk reduction in the olmesartan group compared with the placebo group. Based on these assumptions, 172 patients were needed in each treatment group to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups using the logrank test with <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 (two-sided) and 1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80. Assuming that fewer than 15% of patients would be lost to follow-up, the number of patients was determined to be 200 per group.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold> All analyses of the outcomes were conducted under the intention-to-treat principle. The Cox regression model was applied to estimate the HR between treatment groups with 95% CI for the renal and cardiovascular composite event rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The covariates in the model selected based on review of blinded data were (1) UACR and SCr at baseline and regions (Japan/Hong Kong) for the renal composite event rate, and (2) baseline UACR and age for cardiovascular composite event rate.After unblinding, approximately twofold more patients assigned to the olmesartan group were found to have history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in the placebo group (60 in olmesartan group vs 33 in placebo group, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which was a strong prognostic factor for cardiovascular outcome. Thus, this variable was included as an additional covariate in the model of composite cardiovascular event rate. We also adjusted for BP differences between the two groups by including the mean arterial pressure during treatment as a time-dependent covariate in the Cox model for composite event rates. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative event rate by treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].<table-wrap

This was compared with a mean systolic BP of &#x0003e;140&#x000a0;mmHg during the entire study period of RENAAL. Although the end-of-study BP was similar between the olmesartan and placebo groups, there was a difference of 2.8&#x000a0;mmHg in systolic BP and 1.6&#x000a0;mmHg in diastolic BP during the treatment period, in favour of olmesartan. After 3.2&#x000a0;years, treatment with olmesartan reduced proteinuria and slowed decline of renal function after adjustment for BP differences. However, HR of composite renal outcome was 1.02 after adjustment for BP, suggesting that olmesartan did not provide additional beneficial effect on renal outcome. Although olmesartan did not reduce cardiovascular outcome adjusted by prespecified SCr and UACR, it reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes by 34% independent of ACEI treatment after further adjustment for BP and imbalanced distribution of history of CVD at baseline between the two groups in a post hoc analysis.</p><p><bold>Renal effects of olmesartan</bold> The participants of ORIENT had near optimal BP, serum cholesterol and glycaemic control compared with those enrolled in RENAAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> of patients in ORIENT and RENAAL were 7.1% (57.0&#x000a0;mmol/mol) and 8.5% (69.4&#x000a0;mmol/mol), respectively. Baseline total cholesterol and mean systolic BP were lower by 19.7&#x000a0;mg/dl (0.51&#x000a0;mmol/l) and 12&#x000a0;mmHg in ORIENT compared with RENAAL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite near optimal management of risk factors and use of ACEI in most patients, treatment with olmesartan further attenuated proteinuria and slowed decline of renal function estimated by 1/SCr compared with placebo. These beneficial renal effects of olmesartan were in agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Despite these favourable renal responses, olmesartan did not reduce the composite renal endpoint in the whole group. On subgroup analysis, the majority of renal endpoint occurred in patients with accelerated decline in renal function in whom treatment with olmesartan was similar to placebo. Taken together, these findings suggest that treatment with olmesartan did not confer additional renoprotection especially in patients with rapidly declining renal function, although its effects in patients with less severe renal impairment require further exploration.</p><p><bold>Cardiovascular effects of olmesartan</bold> In the primary analysis, we were unable to confirm the cardiovascular protective effects of olmesartan, which was a predefined secondary endpoint. Although olmesartan-treated patients had numerically fewer MACE (cardiovascular death plus non-fatal stroke and MI) than the placebo group (18 vs 21 cases), our study did not have sufficient power to conclude the effects of olmesartan on cardiovascular outcomes. The amputations that occurred in the olmesartan group were limited to toes.Clinical trials that examined cardiovascular protective effects of ARB alone or in combination with ACEI have yielded inconsistent results. In the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], combination of ACEI and ARB showed neutral effect compared with ACEI alone. In the VAL-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM)-added [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a combination of ACEI and ARB was superior to ACEI alone. However, all these studies enrolled only a small number of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy. In RENAAL, which included only type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], losartan alone reduced HF and marginally reduced MI rate. In IDNT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], irbesartan alone did not confer cardiovascular protection compared with placebo or amlodipine. Taken together, although our results may support possible cardiovascular benefits of combined therapy of ARB and ACEI in type 2 diabetic patients with overt proteinuria and moderate renal insufficiency, larger randomised clinical studies will be needed to confirm these findings.</p><p><bold>Safety of olmesartan in patients treated with ACEI</bold> Patients in ORIENT had frequent hospitalisations with similar rates between the two groups. Approximately 20% of patients had premature discontinuation due to adverse events with a higher rate of hyperkalaemia in the olmesartan than the placebo group (9.2% vs 5.3%). There were ten cardiovascular deaths (3.5%) in the olmesartan group and three (1.1%) in the placebo group, but none of these adverse events were related to hyperkalaemia. Considering the similar number of all-cause deaths (19 [6.7%] in olmesartan vs 20 [7.0%] in placebo) in both groups, the excess cardiovascular death in the olmesartan group was attributed to the twofold higher rate of past history of CVD in the olmesartan group. The rates of MACE were similar between the two groups, with a tendency of lower cardiovascular outcome rates in the olmesartan group. None of the enrolled patients required acute dialysis in the first 6&#x000a0;months of the study, and only one patient (0.4%) in each group developed acute renal failure during the study period.</p><p><bold>Limitations</bold> The study has several limitations. First, there was an imbalance of preexisting CVD between the olmesartan and placebo group. The patients with preexisting CVD should be allocated evenly in each group if we primarily analysed cardiovascular outcomes. Despite this imbalance in CVD, it has not affected our analysis on primary renal outcome. Second, cardiovascular outcome was a composite of several events including HF and peripheral arterial disease. Third, the study was underpowered to make a confident statement of safety for cardiovascular mortality as discussed above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy and renal insufficiency receiving concomitant antihypertensive agents including ACEI, treatment with olmesartan reduced proteinuria and BP but did not further improve renal outcomes.
