This test can show neurological and behavioral changes even in the presence of a normal Apgar score. NACS has 20 indicators, each indicator allocating to itself the score zero, one or two.

NACS has 20 indicators each of which can allocate to itself one of the scores zero, one or two. This index evaluates five general areas in infants including: (1) Adaptive capacity (2) passive tone (3) active tone (4) primary reflex and (5) general observation.

Based on the results from this study, the three studied groups were not significantly different in terms of the variables related to mother and infants. So the disturbing effect of the above factors is neutral in this study and the obtained results are most probably related to the anesthesia technique.</p><p>Significant difference in mean arterial pressure and heart rate during uterine incision and the average interval between induction of anesthesia and birth can be related to the nature of anesthesia which makes it impossible to create integration between groups in this regard. So, spinal and epidural anesthesia through blocking sympathetic system and activity of some heart reflexes lead to hypertension and bradycardia that this condition is more intense in case of spinal anesthesia than epidural. Also, in general anesthesia the induction of anesthesia in the mother is carried out after perp and derpwhich reduces the interval between induction of anesthesia and fetus expulsion to the least. After the spinal anesthesia following blocking, vapidity is quickly spread, but due to perp and derp in mother after spinal block the time interval between spinal anesthesia and fetus expulsion is more than general anesthesia. In epidural anesthesia compared with spinal anesthesia due to the rather slow spread of vapidity, the interval is increased even more.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] So the anesthesia technique and its physiologic nature can express the difference between these three groups regarding the mean arterial pressure and pulse rate at the time of uterine incision and time interval between induction of anesthesia and fetus expulsion. In a study by Hodgkinson, <italic>et al</italic>. in 1978 on 150 elective caesarian born infants, they concluded that using general anesthesia with thiopental sodium or ketamine comparing spinal anesthesia with Tetracaine, the ENNS score (early NB scale) were lower. Though having lower scores than ketamine, thiopental sodium administration showed no significant difference between them.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The differences in the results of this study and the study performed by Hodgkinson can be due to different test evaluations and type of drugs used in general and spinal anesthesia. In this study, NACS is used as a test which its validity and reliability has already been demonstrated.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Abboud, <italic>et al</italic>. in 1985 on 52 pregnant women, they showed that in babies born with caesarian using general anesthesia with the use of thiopental, Tubocurarineand Enflurane, the NACS score was lower than the epidural or spinal anesthesia with Tetracaine and Chloroprocaine. Also in epidural anesthesia, the NACS score was lower than the spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The differing results of this study and our study could be found in sample size and the type of drugs used in the research. In our study of succinylcholine, isoflurane and spinal lidocaine was used instead of tubocurarine, enfluran, tetracaine and chloroprocaine. Contradicting results in different studies is reported to be in relation with different anesthesia techniques or even different anesthetic drugs in one study.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Although it apparently seems that the amount of fetus exposure to different anesthetic drugs during cesarean in general anesthesia is more than epidural anesthesia, but the results of this study showed that maintaining physiologic conditions in mother and infant during cesarean, avoiding drastic changes in hemodynamic of acid-base, oxygenation and ventilation have a greater impact on the prevention of NB changes that may be created in newborns. If the above conditions are provided for mother and baby, it seems that the effect of anesthesia techniques or various drugs can have a minor impact on the NB condition of the baby.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the lack of possibility to measure the plasma level of drugs in the umbilical cord blood after passing the placenta-blood barrier and also the lack of enough acquaintance with exact method of evaluating newborns using NACS at the beginning of the study due to the extensive nature of the research which this problem was to a great extent obviated by providing more information to the nurse and explaining to her how to deal with problems. So, the general conclusion could be that regarding the results of this study, using each of the three anesthesia techniques including general, spinal and epidural anesthesia have similar effects on the neurologic and adaptability capacity of the elective cesarean infants. As a consequence, all three techniques could be used equally based on the necessary conditions and condition of the mother.</p><p>Moreover, regarding the results of this study, it is suggested to further researchers to investigate the NB condition of the babies when the mother is faced with problems or in the case of fetus risky conditions such acidosis or bradycardia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The author wishes to thank Mr. Akbar Hassanzadeh and Mrs. Taheri for their support and patience.</p></ack><fn-group><fn
