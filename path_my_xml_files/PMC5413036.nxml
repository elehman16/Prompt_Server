It is unknown if antenatal education in small classes is more beneficial for parenting stress and parenting alliance compared with other types of antenatal education. In the present randomised trial, we examined the effect of antenatal education in small classes versus auditorium-based lectures on perceived stress, parenting stress, and parenting alliance. A total of 1,766 pregnant women were randomised to receive: antenatal education in small classes three times in pregnancy and one time after delivery, each session lasted 2.5 hours, versus standard care consisting of two times two hours auditorium-based lectures. Previous analysis of the primary outcome showed no difference between intervention and control group. Here we conduct an exploratory analysis of three secondary outcomes. Effects of the interventions on parents&#x02019; global feelings of stress at 37 weeks gestation and nine weeks and six months postpartum and parenting stress nine weeks and six months postpartum were examined using linear regression analyses and mixed models with repeated measurements. The effect on parenting alliance six months postpartum was examined using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Antenatal education in small classes had a small beneficial main effect on global feelings of stress six months postpartum and a statistically significant interaction between time and group favoring antenatal education in small classes. The P values of intervention effects on parenting stress and parenting alliance were all larger than the threshold value (0.05).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The trial was funded by the Danish cancer Society, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.dk/">https://www.cancer.dk/</ext-link>.

The education uses a range of educational and supportive measures to help parents understand social, emotional, psychological, and physical needs during pregnancy, labour, and parenthood [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Changes of antenatal education over time</title><p>In most Western countries antenatal education is well-established, but the form and content have changed markedly over time. Both antenatal education in small classes with group discussions and lectures in large auditoriums have been used. These educations have been offered without evidence of an effect of specific types of antenatal education on relevant outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the past years, Danish antenatal education has gradually moved away from large-scale auditorium-based lectures to antenatal birth and parent preparation classes in small groups for all expectant parents. However, there is a lack of evidence from trials favouring antenatal education in small classes over auditorium-based lectures.</p><p>The main focus of most antenatal education has been on birth and breastfeeding; while information on parent-child attachment and psychosocial aspects that relate to couple- and parenthood has generally not been covered [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Danish Health Authority emphasises that several studies describe parents&#x02019; wishes to discuss aspects related to the social, emotional, and psychological aspects of parenthood, and how to interact with their newborn baby, in addition to gaining information about the delivery, and recommend that antenatal education comprises these aspects [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Antenatal education in small classes is more costly than auditorium-based lectures which may be an incentive for the hospitals to offer the auditorium-based approach.</p><p>In 2012, when the present trial was initiated, antenatal education was still offered as auditorium-based lectures in the Capital Region of Denmark. This Region was therefore an ideal setting to conduct a randomised trial of antenatal education in small classes versus auditorium-based lectures.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Antenatal education in small classes</title><p>In recent time, principles of adult learning have been given more weight in antenatal education and all health-promotion has been recommended to provide opportunities for people to learn skills in order to practice desired behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Further, it is highlighted that people learn more effectively in a group setting, where they have the opportunity to assume different roles, to observe others&#x02019; perspectives, to interact regularly, and to supplement one another [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Qualitative research on pregnant women&#x02019;s preferences in relation to antenatal education has suggested that women prefer antenatal education in small classes leaving possibilities for discussion, suggestions for practicing skills, and encouragement for participants to get to know and support one another [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Stress and parenting alliance</title><p>Becoming a parent is a challenging experience for most people. Parenting stress, defined as the aversive psychological reaction to the demands of being a parent [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and global feelings of stress, i.e., having difficulties coping with everyday life, is a common concern faced by many parents [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. How parents experience and adapt to the transition to parenthood and how it affects the couple relationship depends on the resources available to them [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Important resources for a positive transition and for parenting are social support [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], confidence in one&#x02019;s ability to cope with demands [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and parenting alliance [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Because of its influence on parenting and potentially detrimental effects on the wellbeing of children, parents, and the family as a whole, numerous studies have examined the correlates or consequences of parenting stress [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Yet studies on the prevention of parenting stress and global feelings of stress are scarce.</p><p>Certain parenting programmes have shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving the short-term psychosocial wellbeing of parents [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The majority of parenting programmes are delivered after the child has reached a minimum of three years as part of secondary, high-risk approaches to prevention [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been argued on theoretical grounds and from a public-health point of view that these programmes would be more effective if delivered as part of a population approach, i.e., delivered to all parents preventing problems before they arise and promoting child and parent health and wellbeing [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Many prospective parents look to antenatal education to gain information about labour, infant and postnatal care, and parenting skills [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Antenatal education may therefore offer a suitable and non-stigmatising setting for promoting parenting alliance, social support, and confidence in ability to cope with the demands of parenthood, thereby reducing parenting stress and promoting wellbeing.</p><p>Results from the few existing randomised trials on antenatal education lend support to the notion that structured antenatal education focusing on promoting social support, coping strategies, and parenting alliance could be an effective population-based approach to reducing parenting stress among newborn parents [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the trials are all based on a small number of participants. Due to the scarce evidence from randomised trials, there is a need to conduct high-quality, randomised trials with adequate sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0176819.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We, therefore, conducted a randomised trial to examine the effect of an antenatal education programme including psychosocial aspects of parenting in small classes versus standard education carried out as auditorium-based lectures on birth and breastfeeding&#x02013;the NEWBORN trial [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this article is to present the effects of the experimental intervention in the NEWBORN trial on the secondary outcomes: maternal global feelings of stress, parenting stress, and parenting alliance. The primary outcome of the trial; use of epidural analgesia&#x02013;as a proxy for coping during labour&#x02013;has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We found no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups regarding the primary outcome. In line with the statistical analysis plan published in the trial protocol, the results of the analyses of the secondary outcomes reported in this article should therefore be interpreted as explorative [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine the effect of the NEWBORN programme as inspiration for the planning and selection of outcomes in future trials.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>We used data from the randomised trial: NEWBORN&#x02013;preparation for birth and parenting. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT01672437). A detailed description of the trial is published in the design article [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the trial protocol which can be accessed here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interventionsforskning.dk/userfiles/files/nyfdt/projektprotokol-version-23_2.pdf">http://www.interventionsforskning.dk/userfiles/files/nyfdt/projektprotokol-version-23_2.pdf</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The NEWBORN trial took place at the largest birth site in Denmark, Hvidovre Hospital, situated in the Copenhagen Capital Region. More than 6,000 deliveries take place at Hvidovre Hospital every year and the catchment area comprises a diverse population regarding socio-demographic characteristics.</p><p>Women were enrolled in the trial from 10+0 to 20+0 weeks of gestation. Inclusion criteria were expectant women, &#x02265;18 years old at enrolment, singleton pregnancy, due to give birth at Hvidovre Hospital, having the ability to speak and understand Danish, and signing the informed consent form.</p><p>Pregnant women were recruited from August 2012 to May 2014. The women received a written invitation to participate in the trial prior to their first visit to the midwife along with an informed consent form. Invitations were followed up by a phone call from a project employee. Initially, only primiparous women were eligible for participation, but due to slow recruitment also multiparous women were included approximately six months into the recruitment period in order to ensure adequate statistical power [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Baseline data were collected using a web-based questionnaire prior to randomisation (approximately in gestation week 18). A project employee performed individual web-based randomisation according to a computer-generated allocation sequence of 1:1 with varying block sizes developed by The Copenhagen Trial Unit and concealed to the investigators. The allocation was stratified for parity (primiparous or multiparous) and vulnerability (yes or no as evaluated by their general practitioner at the first pregnancy consultation in gestation week 6&#x02013;10). Vulnerability was based on eight criteria set forward by the Danish health authorities, for example; former or current psychiatric disorder, adverse psycho-social background, or concerns about parenting skills. The general practitioner categorised the woman as vulnerable if she met one or more of these criteria. For non-vulnerable women the randomisation block sizes were 10 and 20, for vulnerable women block sizes were 4 and 6. These block sizes were used for primiparous as well as multiparous women and were unknown to the investigators. All citizens in Denmark have a unique personal identification (CPR) number and the randomisation programme was set up to confirm the existence of the CPR number.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Experimental intervention group</title><p>The experimental intervention was developed using a systematic framework for health promotion programme planners; Intervention Mapping [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This systematic framework aids effective decision making at each step in intervention planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p><p>Women in the intervention group received an antenatal education programme aimed at strengthening relationships and improving information and problem solving skills for expectant parents in order to ease birth and the transition to parenthood. The programme was designed based on the recommendations for antenatal care from the Danish Health Authority [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The programme included short verbal presentations from the group facilitator, individual exercises, short film presentations, and time for discussions and reflection. Parents were given homework in the form of minor exercises in preparation to each session. Educational subjects were: the transition to parenthood; couple communication; birth; breastfeeding; and taking care of a newborn. A patient-network website was created as a supplement to the sessions. The programme was focused on psychosocial aspects and parenting resources important to the birth process, parenting and mental health, that appear amenable to change, i.e.: social support, parenting alliance, cognitive coping, and parenting skills:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Social support: formal and informal, emotional, informational and instrumental. Groups of 6&#x02013;8 couples were offered three times 2.5 hour sessions during pregnancy (gestation week 25, 33, and 35) and one session five weeks after expected due date. The groups were composited to enable participants establish relations with other expectant parents in their local area. Sessions were led by a midwife and the postnatal session included a health visitor. A patient-network website enabled parents to gain further information, communicate with other parents and consult online with a midwife and a health visitor.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parenting alliance: the programme had a component supporting the couples in the transition to parenthood and couple communication.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cognitive coping: sources of self-efficacy were embedded into programme content and delivery, an environment enabling parents to discuss feelings and concerns was aimed for, enhancing their awareness of own resources, problem-solving strategies, and future challenges in parenting and emotional regulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Parenting skills: increasing information and exercises with feedback, e.g., on recognising signs and symptoms of thriving in the newborn, couple communication etc.</p></list-item></list><p>The approach aimed at strengthening relationships and improving information and problem solving skills for expectant parents in order to ease birth and the transition to parenthood.</p><p>To maximise the potential for population uptake classes were established at three local midwifery sites. A comprehensive guide and education material for course facilitators was developed, and facilitators, i.e., midwives and health visitors were trained at one-day workshops. The framework for the classes was based on an estimate of adequate time allocated to each subject, and what service providers deemed a sustainable service.</p><p>More details of the programme has been presented elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

We analysed changes of the mean scores over time between groups of PSS and SPSQ using a mixed model with repeated measurements for continuous outcome measures. Analyses were performed with the unstructured covariance structure. For PSS, the fixed effect included a linear and a quadratic time component and the corresponding interactions with group. The quadratic time component was added to the model to increase model fit. The interaction term between time and group was used to evaluate the changes in PSS over time and to compare these changes between intervention and control group. For SPSQ, the fixed effect included a linear time component and group, but no interaction term due to lack of a baseline measurement for this outcome. Due to item missingness in the SPSQ scale it was chosen prior to data analysis to use the average score for each individual instead of the total sum score. The overall proportions of reporting for each of the three outcomes are presented for all time points in the trial flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0176819.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The paper presents the analysis of secondary outcomes; hence we are unable to make any confirmatory claims concerning our findings.</p><p>We found no statistically significant effects of the NEWBORN programme on parenting stress measured nine weeks and six months after birth or parenting alliance measured six months after birth. For global feelings of stress, there was a statistically significant interaction between time and group favoring the intervention group. This difference between randomised groups appears to be driven by a statistically significant difference in perceived stress six months after birth and is limited to a modest difference between groups substantially lower than the predefined minimal relevant difference of 1 point [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Accordingly, this finding should be considered without clinical meaning.</p><p>To date only a few randomised trials on antenatal education have been conducted. Of them even fewer have examined the effect of antenatal education provided in small classes on stress or factors related to parenting alliance, and findings are inconsistent. An American trial by Schultz et al. found no effects of a couple-focused intervention consisting of an extra 24 weekly sessions compared with standard care on marital satisfaction among mothers and fathers six months and 5.5 years postnatally. Nor did they find any differences in relation to divorce or separation 5.5 years postnatally [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Results from another American trial by Feinberg et al. indicated significant effects of an eight session psycho-social prevention programme for couples, compared with a brochure on child care delivered to participants in the control condition, on co-parenting six months after delivery [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In a trial conducted in France and Spain, Ortiz Collado et al. found no effect of an antenatal psychosomatic programme designed to decrease depression among women at high risk of postnatal depression compared with standard care, consisting of eight large-group sessions on childbirth and pregnancy health, on dissatisfaction with the relationship 5&#x02013;12 weeks after delivery [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A trial by Daley-McCoy et al. conducted in UK found that women who participated in an extra 2 hour session about relationship functioning experienced significantly less deterioration in relationship quality and couple communication compared with women who did not participate in this extra session (both intervention group and control group received antenatal education in small classes) [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In an Australian trial by Petch et al. they found that high-risk women receiving a couple relationship- and coparenting-focused education programme delivered through a 6 hour workshop and two home-visits reported higher relationship satisfaction, and were less intrusive in their parenting than high-risk women receiving a mother-focused parenting programme primarily delivered as telephone consultations [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. None of these trials are directly comparable to our NEWBORN trial. Two of the trials were aimed at women at high risk of depression and relationship problems. In four out of the five trials the dose of the intervention, i.e., the amount of sessions offered was higher than in the NEWBORN trial. Finally, the content and delivery of the interventions as well as control conditions differed to the NEWBORN trial.</p><p>The NEWBORN programme was developed in line with recommendations set forward by the Danish Health Authority, i.e., all expectant parents should be offered antenatal birth and parent preparation classes in small groups with the opportunity to discuss feelings and concerns related to birth and parenthood [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The programme was developed using a systematic framework for health promotion program planners [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This systematic framework aids effective decision making at each step in intervention planning, implementation, and evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our knowledge, the NEWBORN trial is the largest randomised trial on small-class antenatal education to date. We minimised the risk of bias in all important domains [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although it was impossible to blind participants and investigators, we were able to blind all other aspects of the trial [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The analyses of the effect of the intervention were performed using imputed data taking into account the potential differential drop-out. This implies that we were able to conduct intention-to-treat analyses implying that the results are not biased by incomplete outcome data or selection bias.</p><p>We only have a follow-up period lasting till six months after due date. This leaves limitations regarding the assessment of participant-relevant outcomes, such as the child&#x02019;s thriving as it grows up, the number of families that experiences divorces and break-ups, and child&#x02019;s use of the health-care system in both the short and the long run. We assess these outcomes in the NEWBORN trial, but we range them in the outcome hierarchy as &#x02018;exploratory&#x02019;. This is done, as 1) we have very limited knowledge of the potential effect of antenatal education on these outcomes, and we have therefore not been able to perform power estimations, and 2) due to logistical and financial constraints. If additional funding can be obtained, data on all individuals can be sought in the national registers and long-term follow-up will be possible.</p><p>The trial recruited participants from a single hospital in Denmark, which may reduce the external validity of our findings. However, the intervention was delivered by 25 different midwifes and 8 different health-visitors in 3 different local sites, which in turn increases the generalisability. Furthermore, the trial had very wide eligibility criteria, leaving potential findings applicable to the entire Danish population. Although we used wide inclusion criteria, only a small proportion (11%) of the participants were multiparous.</p><p>The NEWBORN programme was delivered using a health promoting population-based approach. This approach has been suggested to have the advantage of reaching groups who may otherwise be difficult to reach. In the current trial, parents who participated had a higher education level compared to the general population of Copenhagen women in the same age group. This phenomenon is common in trials [<xref rid="pone.0176819.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. There was a high proportion of women with a university degree in our trial. The control group received standard care, i.e., auditorium-based lectures. This way of acquiring knowledge is common for women having attended university. Their ability to benefit from this type of information may have reduced outcome differences between the intervention group and the control group, while a more socially diverse group of participants in the trial might have increased the benefit of small class education. It is also possible that the lack of effect was due to a ceiling-effect as this particular group of women may already have a high level of communication skills and be used to working out differences and collaborating with their partners in a productive way, e.g., in relation to parenting alliance.</p><p>The educational discrepancies between the trial population and the background population may limit the generalisability of the trial results. It would be beneficial to conduct research focusing on the effect of the programme among subgroups, e.g., vulnerable women. Also, further in depth analyses taking implementation of the programme into consideration would contribute with more thorough knowledge of the impact of the programme.</p><p>The programme was developed with guidance from politicians and service providers to ensure that the programme would be feasible to implement in an everyday clinical practice setting if proven effective. It is possible that provision of a more comprehensive programme could lead to larger effects; however, in the current setting with limited healthcare resources, it is questionable if an expensive programme would be implemented.</p><p>We focused on conducting a trial using standard care as control condition. This is advantageous as the effect of the intervention is measured against the existing offer making decisions on change in provision of care more straightforward. Finally, the study population was recruited among a diverse population group and not limited to a high-risk population. This increases the likelihood of results be generalisable to a general population, but the low and socially skewed participation challenged this generalisability.</p><p>Results from the NEWBORN trial constitute a much-needed base for future trials and for decision-makers regarding the form and content of antenatal education.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Implications for future research</title><p>In this paper, as in most studies on the effects of antenatal education, we have focused only on the mother&#x02019;s transition into motherhood. Data from the partners were also gathered, and it would be relevant in future studies to explore the effect of the NEWBORN programme among the partners. This could bring valuable new insight to an area with limited knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176819.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176819.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176819.s002"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176819.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Bjarne Laursen (BL), senior researcher at the National Institute of Public Health, for his help with data management.
