During the induction of general anesthesia, one critical risk factor for aspiration is gastric insufflation during facemask ventilation (FMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although pulmonary aspiration is profoundly decreased in modern anesthesia in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the time of FMV for anesthesia induction is still the most vulnerable period for gastric regurgitation following a gastric insufflation. Thus, we have to try to apply a safer ventilation mode and appropriate inspiratory pressure to minimize the risk of gastric insufflation consistently.</p><p id="Par16">In adult patients, the risk of gastric insufflation and consequently the adverse complications are significantly reduced with pressure-controlled FMV compared with manual or volume-controlled FMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Using the traditional auscultation method, previous study determined the inspiratory pressure for preventing gastric insufflation during FMV to be 20&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In children, an inspiratory pressure less than 15&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O determined by the auscultation method can provide safe ventilation without gastric insufflation during pressure-controlled FMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Conventionally, stethoscopic auscultation has been used to evaluate the gastric insufflation during ventilation. Recently, two studies reported that ultrasonography could detect air in stomach more precisely compared with stethoscopic auscultation during facemask ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using real-time ultrasonography, air entry into stomach can be detected with acoustic shadows or comet-tail appearance that appears in the gastric antrum, which provides a qualitative examination of gastric insufflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that ultrasonographic measurement of antral cross-section area (CSA) was a quantitative approach to determine gastric insufflation during facemask ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

The present study was registered at Chinese Clinical <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trials.gov">Trials.gov</ext-link> (ChiCTR-IPR-16007960) and was performed in the Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, from 01 March 2016 to 01 July 2016. After obtaining written informed consent from all parents, 90 children, ASA physical status I or II, aged from 2 to 4&#x000a0;years, scheduled for high ligation of hernial sac or sheath under general anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.

Blocking, stratification, or other restrictions were not used when group assignments were created. Children were allocated using a 1:1 ratio. Sealed and coded opaque envelopes were used to ensure allocation concealment. All these above works were performed by an anesthesiologist who did not participate in the procedure of anesthesia. The anesthesiologist performing ultrasound assessment was blinded to group allocation and was the same as the one assessing the antral CSA during facemask ventilation.</p><p id="Par21">All children were premedicated with 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg midazolam orally 30&#x000a0;min before induction of anesthesia. We allowed parents to accompany their children until an intravenous catheter was inserted under local anesthesia using EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) cream (AstraZeneca, UK). A skilled nurse performed all the punctures avoiding repeated puncture. In the operation room, continuous pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, and non-invasive arterial pressure were measured. In this study, we defined the significant increase in antral CSA after FMV as gastric insufflation using an ultrasonography (SonoSite, Inc., Bothwell, WA) with a 2- to 5-MHz convex transducer. All children were lying in the supine position on the operation table. In brief, using the aorta and the superior mesenteric vein as internal landmarks, longitudinal (D1) and anteroposterior (D2) diameters of the gastric antrum in cross-section on a sagittal plane were measured (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

</p><p id="Par22">After 2&#x000a0;min of preoxygenation using a ventilator circuit (Primus; Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany), general anesthesia was conducted with fentanyl 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 3&#x000a0;mg/kg administrated over 45&#x000a0;s. Spontaneous breathing was maintained while the fentanyl and propofol was given. Immediately after fentanyl and propofol administration, rocuronium 0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg was given and an oropharyngeal airway was inserted and a well fitting facemask was fixed with two hands by an experienced anesthesiologist who was blinded to the results of perioperative ultrasonographic measurement of antral CSA. FMV was delivered for 120&#x000a0;s with a frequency of 20 breaths per min, and an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2, a flow of 100% oxygen 3&#x000a0;L/min. An applied inspiratory pressure was set according to the corresponding group. No positive end-expiratory pressure was applied. The trachea was intubated after the mask ventilation. After the trachea was intubated, real-time ultrasonographic measurement of antral CSA was performed again. In this current study, we defined the significant increase in antral CSA after FMV as gastric insufflation. GI+ was defined as gastric insufflation detected by ultrasonography, whereas GI- was defined as gastric insufflation not detected by ultrasonography.</p><p id="Par23">The following respiratory variables were recorded using an Anaesthesia monitor at time 30, 60, 90, and 120&#x000a0;s during FMV: pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>, %), the tidal volume (Vt, ml/kg), and the end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration in the expired air (EtCO<sub>2</sub>, mmHg).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par32">By using ultrasonography, the occurrence of gastric insufflation statistically increased with inspiratory pressure after facemask ventilation, with a threshold of 12&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O above which the occurrence of gastric insufflation became statistically significant. In this study, we found that an inspiratory pressure of 12&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O was sufficient to provide adequate ventilation with a lower occurrence of gastric insufflation during induction of general anesthesia in paralyzed Chinese children aged from 2 to 4&#x000a0;years old.</p><p id="Par33">One previous study showed that gastric insufflation occurs during FMV in children, and the inspiratory pressure threshold for gastric insufflation depends on age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was recommended not to use inspiratory pressure larger than 15&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O to prevent gastric insufflation in children. However, the gastric insufflation was evaluated by epigastric auscultation which did not provide a precise detection of gastric inflation volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent studies suggested that ultrasonographic measurement of the antral area can be used to assess the gastric content and volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Stethoscopic auscultation is less sensitive method compared with ultrasonography in detecting gastric insufflation during FMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Park et al. also indicated that ultrasonography was more sensitive in determining gastric insufflation than the epigastric auscultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">In the present study, gastric insufflation occurred in 64% of patients when the inspiratory pressure 16&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O was applied, which is consistent with the study conducted by Lagarde et al., indicating that gastric insufflation occurred in &#x0003e;58% of cases when the inspiratory pressure&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is different from the study for adult patient, where only 35% of adult patients during FMV with an inspiratory pressure 15&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O have gastric insufflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We think the difference could be partially attributed to the usage of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in the present study, because nondepolarizing muscle relaxants could decrease the resting tone in the upper esophageal sphincter muscle and impair the function of pharyngeal muscle in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, compared with adults, the esophageal sphincter muscle is not mature in children and the esophageal sphincter tone is lower than adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Our results showed that the occurence of gastric insufflation was lower in group P8 and P10. However, inspiratory pressure of 8 or 10&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O for the FMV is rarely used in clinical practice, because it will result in inadequate ventilation. Indeed, an inspiratory pressure of 8 or 10&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O was not sufficient to provide a Vt &#x0003e;7&#x000a0;ml/kg and the EtCO2 was significantly higher in group P8 and P10. However, SpO<sub>2</sub> was greater than 98% during FMV in all children. An inspiratory pressure of 12&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O provided less occurence of gastric insufflation than that for a pressure of 14 and 16&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O. An inspiratory pressure of 12&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O is sufficient to provide adequate ventilation.</p><p id="Par36">Ultrasonographic measurement of antral cross-section area (CSA) may provide interesting quantitative data in regard to the gastric insufflation during FMV. Our data also showed that the antral CSA after facemask ventilation statistically increased only in subgroups P14GI+ and P16GI+ for whom gastric insufflation was detected by ultrasonography. However, it had been suggested that increased CSA on ultrasonography may not directly mean that gastric insufflation occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In small children, the difficulties in fixing the probe in proper site, the pressure from the probe placement, and the changes in the gastric position following neuromuscular blockade may result in a bias of ultrasonography images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Large sample investigations may be needed to solve this problem.</p><p id="Par37">Although manual ventilation is commonly used during facemask ventilation for anesthesia induction in clinical practice, pressure-controlled FMV provides lower inspiratory pressure compared with manual ventilation at a similar tidal volume which results in reduced occurrence of gastric insufflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. von Goedecke et al. indicated that pressure-controlled FMV had a lower inspiratory peak flow rates and peak airway pressures compared with manual ventilation, which provided a safer facemask ventilation mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Seet et al. also reported that pressure-controlled FMV resulted in a lower peak airway pressures which may improve the patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Based on these previous studies, pressure-controlled FMV mode was selected in this present study. However, more recently, Park et al. compared the occurrence of gastric insufflation in paralysed children during pressure-controlled FMV and manual ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although the peak airway pressures in pressure-controlled FMV group was lower than that in manual ventilation group, the occurrence of gastric insufflation was only slightly lower during pressure-controlled FMV than during manual ventilation which has no statistically difference. The authors suggested that the small sample size may result in this meaningless and the occurrence of gastric insufflation may not be absolutely prevented even in pressure-controlled FMV with low peak airway pressures in paralyzed children.</p><p id="Par38">Adverse events such as aspiration and desaturation events were not found in the present study. Although antral CSA after facemask ventilation statistically increased in subgroups P14GI+ and P16GI+, aspiration events were not occurred in both groups. However, increased inspiratory pressure results in a higher occurrence of gastric insufflation which may increase the risk of aspiration. The lung ventilation was inadequate in group P8 and P10, but it did not result in desaturation events. This may be explained by the administration of 100% oxygen and by minute ventilation almost reaching normal values. In addition, insufficient sample size may be a cause of no statistical difference in adverse events.</p><p id="Par39">This present study had some limitations. Firstly, increased antral CSA on ultrasonography might not necessarily mean gas insufflation and increased risk of aspiration, because the pressure from the probe placement and the use of neuromuscular blockade might result in a bias of ultrasonography images. Secondly, ultrasonography could not be used to quantify antral CSA due to marked gastric insufflation with subsequent patient exclusion from the analysis. Thirdly, the respiratory parameters to determine the ventilator adequacy in this study should be more detailed. We did not monitor the respiratory parameters after intubation and further study may be needed. Lastly, we did not record adverse event such as cardiovascular hemodynamic instability during FMV and further investigation may be needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In summary, using real-time ultrasonography, we demonstrated that an inspiratory pressure of 12&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O is sufficient to provide adequate ventilation with a lower occurence of gastric insufflation during pressure-controlled FMV in 2- to 4- year-old paralyzed Chinese children. Increasing inspiratory pressure above this value will result in increased occurence of gastric insufflation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSA</term><def><p id="Par8">Cross-section area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMLA</term><def><p id="Par9">Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EtCO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par10">The end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration in the expired air</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMV</term><def><p id="Par11">Facemask ventilation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GI</term><def><p id="Par12">Gastric insufflation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SpO<sub>2</sub></term><def><p id="Par13">Pulse oximetry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Vt</term><def><p id="Par14">The tidal volume</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Zuokai Xie for his assistance with statistical analysis.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par41">This work was funded by program grant LY15H150007 (to Dr. Qian) from the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, Hangzhou, People&#x02019;s Republic of China, and by program grant 81501702 (to Dr. Qian) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Beijing, People&#x02019;s Republic of China.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par42">The datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>XQ and JL designed the study.
