Six-hundred-and-three patients from seven clinics in Yangpu district, Shanghai, China were recruited. Of them 115 individuals aged 50&#x02013;65-year fulfilled the inclusion criteria (NAFLD with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) and were randomly assigned into exercise (AEx n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29), diet (Diet n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28), exercise plus diet (AED n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29), or no-intervention (NI n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) groups. Progressive supervised AEx training (60&#x02013;75% VO2max intensity) was given 2-3 times/week in 30&#x02013;60&#x02009;min/sessions, and the diet intervention was provided as lunch with 38% carbohydrate and diet fibre of 12&#x02009;g/day for 8.6-month. HFC was assessed by <sup>1</sup>H MRS. We found that HFC was significantly reduced in the AEx (&#x02212;24.4%), diet (&#x02212;23.2%), and AED (&#x02212;47.9%) groups by contrast to the 20.9% increase in the NI group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001 for all) after intervention. However, only AED group significantly decreased HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x02212;4.4%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) compared with the NI group (&#x02212;0.6%). Aerobic exercise training combined with fibre-enriched diet can reduce HFC more effectively than either exercise or increased fibre-intake alone in pre-diabetic patients with NAFLD.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the developing world, and occurs in 17&#x02013;30% of the population in Western countries and 2&#x02013;4% worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In China the prevalence of NAFLD is 10&#x02013;30% and up to 75% among obese and type 2 diabetes (T2D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. At the same time, a recent large national survey estimated that 10% of Chinese adults may have diabetes and 50% may have prediabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. NAFLD and prediabetes often co-exist and may synergistically increase the risk of both T2D and cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Finding effective ways to improve glycaemic control and hepatic steatosis are therefore urgently needed.</p><p id="Par3">Previous studies have shown that calorie restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and exercise are effective ways to improve hepatic steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and are therefore recommended as a first-line interventions for prevention and treatment of NAFLD and pre-diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials have shown that increased fibre intake improves glycaemic control in patients with T2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that it could be used as an additional tool to improve long-term glucose control. However, to date, no randomized control study has evaluated the effect of combined aerobic exercise and fibre-enriched diet on reduction of HFC and glycaemic control in people with both pre-diabetes and NAFLD.</p><p id="Par4">Recent systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials indicate that exercise interventions may improve glycaemic control in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and T2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Systematic reviews have also shown that exercise can reduce hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD, independent of weight loss and dietary intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of fibre intake on glycaemic control in patients with T2D showed that increased fibre intake may improve glycaemic control, and thus could be used as an adjunctive tool in the treatment of patients with dysglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In summary, although exercise or dietary intervention alone showed effective benefit on glycaemic control and NAFLD reduction, no study so far has assessed the combined effect of both exercise and high fibre intake on glycaemic control and hepatic steatosis in people with pre-diabetes and NAFLD. Therefore, we aimed to test our hypothesis that exercise training combined with increased fibre intake reduces hepatic steatosis and improves glycaemic control in pre-diabetic patients with NAFLD.

The study was performed between January 6 and December 25, 2013. We screened 603 individuals, of whom 115 were eligible and randomly assigned to the AEx (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29), Diet (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28), AED group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29), or NI group (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;29). Of the 115 subjects, 85 subjects (74%) completed the intervention (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18 in NI group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22 in AEx, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22 in Diet, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23 in AED, respectively, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The overall compliance was 62.1% for the NI group, 75.9% for the AEx group, 78.6% for the Diet group and 79.3% for the AED group, respectively. The main reasons for drop-out were the following: family reasons (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6); diseases not related to the present trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5); loss of interest (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5); travel (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and other personal reasons (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6). The high drop-out in the NI group was mainly due to loss of interest (disappointment at not being in the intervention groups).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study profile.

In fact, HFC decreased to normal level (&#x0003c;5.6%) in 44% of the participants in the exercise plus diet group. These findings have significant clinical implications for pre-diabetic patients with NAFLD because they show that if lifestyle interventions are instituted at the appropriate time they can prevent NAFLD progression.</p><p id="Par14">In China the prevalence of NAFLD and prediabetes is increasing rapidly, reaching epidemic proportions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These metabolic disorders are largely attributable to lifestyle changes that have occurred over recent decades, and therefore specific lifestyle interventions attempting to modify patients&#x02019; diet and physical activity may have the potential to reduce the severity of NAFLD and prevent development of diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Vilar-Gomez <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that level of improvement in histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) after lifestyle intervention is associated with the degree of weight loss. A recent meta-analysis of twenty randomized controlled trails with 1073 NAFLD patients found that exercise can exert beneficial effects on intrahepatic triglycerides even in the absence of weight loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our study complements this by showing significant reduction in HFC in the intervention groups, independent of change in body weight.</p><p id="Par15">Previous studies indicate that patients affected with NAFLD are at increased risk of developing inflammation and subsequently fibrosis and chronic liver disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In order to obtain accurate information regarding the degree of inflammation and the present of fibrosis, repeated liver biopsies would have been needed. However, given the invasive nature of the biopsy procedure and the possible risks it pertains, it would have been unethical to obtain biopsies from the &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; patients in the present study. In fact, our aim was not to study NASH; instead we focused on the most sensitive non-invasive parameter (liver fat content measured with <sup>1</sup>H MRS) which has been shown to be highly correlated with whole body insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and metabolic imbalance can be detected at an early stage (liver fat content varying between 0.5% and 39.3%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This illustrating <sup>1</sup>H MRS provides unique information which cannot be obtained otherwise.</p><p id="Par16">In the Da Qing study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> exercise training and/or diet counselling led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes over a 6-year period among those with impaired glucose tolerance. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study showed that, in addition to physical activity, increased fibre intake was associated with long-term weight loss and decreased T2D risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Subsequently, randomized controlled trials have shown that increased fibre intake improves glycaemic control in patients with T2D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, no previous study has assessed the combined effects of aerobic exercise training and fibre-enriched diet on glycaemic control and HFC reduction in patients with prediabetes and NALFD. Here, we show that combined exercise and fibre-enriched diet decreased HFC more than either intervention mode alone. Unexpectedly however, no significant improvement in glycaemic control was found, suggesting dissociation between hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. This finding is in agreement with animal and human data, which have shown that under certain conditions simple hepatic steatosis is not accompanied by metabolic dysregulation but is associated with a metabolically benign state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Thus, it could be that hepatic fat infiltration might represent an adaptive mechanism allowing storage of lipids in their least toxic form in situations where triglyceride precursors are abundant. However, when hepatic fat infiltration reaches a critical point, the compensatory mechanism becomes overwhelmed resulting in damaged hepatocytes and impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our results are therefore important from the clinical point of view because simple NAFLD can develop into more severe forms of liver disease and with existing pre-diabetes can increase the risk for T2D and cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, our results suggest that increased fibre intake could be used as adjuvant to exercise training in patients with such comorbid conditions to prevent disease progression. More randomized controlled studies with larger samples size are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p id="Par17">In earlier intervention studies exercise training has generally been performed by using brisk walking or treadmill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the present study, patients exercised using Nordic walking, which is a walking technique using two poles and mimicking the movements performed while cross-country skiing. This walking technique is associated with the involvement of more muscle groups than in the case of classic walking, and therefore makes it possible to increase exercise intensity, resulting in more effective training in a safe and well tolerated way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Nordic walking has shown to be effective in reducing fat mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Besides exercise, increased soluble fibre intake may have played an important role in reducing fat mass and increasing insulin sensitivity in the present study. Our results suggest when the fibre intake is low, increasing the fibre intake even to the recommended level may have significant impact on health. Previous work has shown that soluble fibre modulates the postprandial glycaemic response through its effects on the stomach and small bowel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, both soluble and insoluble fibre intake can improve glycaemic control by increasing insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms associated with the beneficial effect of fibre-enriched diet on glycaemic control have not yet been fully established and the basis of the effect on HFC reduction is even more unclear. Nonetheless, this finding is all the more important for pre-diabetic patients with NAFLD who have heightened risk for type 2 diabetes.</p><p id="Par18">Nutrition and meal planning are known often to be the most challenging aspects of diabetes self-care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The novelty of this study is that, in addition to dietary counselling, we provided lunch to both diet and exercise plus diet intervention groups for the entire duration of the intervention. Thus the daily nutritional intake at least one-third of the meals of each subject was controlled, which is likely to increase the reliability of our results. In addition, the exercise training was performed in community parks near the participants&#x02019; home to make attendance of the supervised sessions as convenient as possible, thereby increasing compliance. However, because all participating subjects originated from the same community, the behaviour of subjects in the no-intervention group may have been affected by interaction with subjects in the intervention groups, even though we asked the no intervention subjects to maintain their existing lifestyle during the intervention. This is, for example, reflected by the observation that the fitness level of the no-intervention group also increased. It is important to note that there were no significant differences in total energy intake and energy yield nutrients between groups, except for the increased intake of fibre in the diet and diet plus exercise groups. Finally, an important aspect of the current study is that it was conducted within a large community, meaning the district volunteers, the nurses from health care centres, hospital doctors and university researchers all had to work seamlessly together to make this study possible. Thus, this study presents a model that can be applied through a community&#x02019;s health education and promotion program which can result in significant health benefits for its participants. We feel that all the aforementioned aspects aiming to optimally control the current study add to the reliability of the observed results and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p id="Par19">We recognize that the sample size in our study is relatively small but the observed effect sizes are similar to other intervention studies reported in systematic reviews for randomized lifestyle trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Of note, the main outcomes of the intervention have been assessed with both efficacy and intention-to treat analysis. Recently, a variation in the PNPLA3 gene has been reported to influence the development of NAFLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, in our study, there were no significant differences in the distribution of PNPLA3 genotypes (GG, GC and CC) among the groups and thus response of exercise and diet intervention was unlikely to be affected by this gene variant. Giving the abovementioned reasons, the significant results obtained in this study are conservative and justified. However, studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.</p><p id="Par20">In summary, people who have both prediabetes and NAFLD are at much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and therefore finding effective ways to combat this comorbid condition are urgently needed. In this study we demonstrated that aerobic exercise training combined with fibre-enriched diet can help to reduce hepatic fat content in pre-diabetic patients with NAFLD better than either increased exercise or fibre intake alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial design and study population</title><p id="Par21">This study was a four-arm parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, conducted in 7 health clinical service centres in the Shanghai Yangpu district.

The lunch box was then delivered to the study district community office where the study subjects were gathered. If the participants did not have time to come to pick up the meal, it was delivered to their home and the participants ate it for dinner. The other two meals (breakfast and dinner) were cooked by subjects themselves following the nutritionist advice. In addition, the diet group was advised to maintain their current level of physical activity during the intervention.</p><p id="Par29">

<italic>The primary endpoint variable</italic> was the change of HFC. Non-invasive measurement of HFC was performed using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) on a 3&#x02009;T Siemens Magnetom Verio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Obtained spectra were analysed using the Linear Combination of Model spectra software suite which is generally considered to be the gold standard for <italic>in-vivo</italic> spectroscopy analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Briefly, the methylene and methyl peak amplitudes of the fat spectrum and the amplitude of the water spectrum were corrected because of differences in T2 decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> and molar concentrations of <sup>1</sup>H nuclei in fat and water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

We estimated that 34 subjects in each group would have 85% power for mean comparison between the groups and therefore we attempted targeting to have 50 subjects in each group. However, during the recruitment period, we found that only about 20% of the subjects met the inclusion criteria and due to the limited funding, we re-calculated the sample size based on of our previous similar type of study result (changing in fat mass). Thus, for this report, sample size estimation for the primary outcome HFC with 29 individuals has 95% power to test against the hypothesis that there is change in any group. Further, when intervention groups compared with NI group having 17 subjects, the power for the HFC was 84% with &#x0003c;0.05 two sided significance level. After every subject reached minimal 6 months intervention, the study did not continue to follow-up all the subjects and consequently, the follow-up study was terminated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par39">All data were analyzed by PASW statistics version 22 (IBM Corporation, USA).

If a participant in the AEx and AED groups did not exercise for more than 4 weeks, or a participant in the Diet group did not take the lunch provided for 4 weeks due to different reasons, they were not included in this analysis.

To be able to perform the ITT analysis by using all the subjects randomized into different groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;115), we used linear regression to impute the missing data. The interaction of group by time was compared by contrast to the NI group and within a group change was compared by time. In addition, change of body weight, intervention duration and baseline value were used as covariates. If the significance of the group by time interaction was p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0&#x000b7;05, the effect was estimated utilizing &#x00160;id&#x000e1;k for multiple comparisons.</p><p id="Par42">The percentage differences were calculated for the period between baseline and end point measurements for each individual.
