The protocol was written by the authors, and the study was approved by institutional review boards. The protocol and written informed consent procedure are published (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>. Unique identifier: NCT01893190).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Key inclusion criteria were World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade 2 to 4 subjects with an external ventricular drain (EVD) inserted as standard of care and a ruptured aneurysm repaired by clipping or coiling. After the first cohort was entered, the inclusion criteria were amended to increase the time from aSAH to study drug administration from 48 to 60 hours to facilitate recruitment. The rationale was that in the first cohort, plasma pharmacokinetics showed a rapid increase in plasma nimodipine concentrations within 24 hours of administration of EG-1962. Nimodipine is approved to reduce DCI after SAH, and this occurs 3 to 14 days after SAH. The approval says to start nimodipine within 4 days of SAH. Therefore, we thought it would be safe to increase the inclusion time to 60 hours. There was no reason to think this would affect the assessment of the MTD. The second cohort was administered EG-1962, 200 mg.</p><p>The study was to include a dose-escalation period followed by a treatment period (Figure I in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.014250/-/DC1">online-only Data Supplement</ext-link>). The primary objective of the dose-escalation period was to determine the MTD of EG-1962 and of the treatment period to further determine the safety and tolerability of the selected dose of EG-1962 compared with enteral nimodipine. The treatment period was not conducted based on the following. There were only 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) spread among 2 different dose groups, and the number of serious adverse events (SAE) among the dose groups did not seem to have any dependence on dose. Favorable responses did not exhibit a dose&#x02013;response, in that the rate was already high at the 100 mg dose. The dose&#x02013;response relationship was assessed by visual inspection of the outcomes by cohort and by e-max and logistic regression models adjusting for WFNS grade and age (dichotomized). Finally, there was a strong dose&#x02013;response seen in some key pharmacokinetic parameters. The secondary objective was to measure plasma and CSF concentrations of nimodipine; these will be reported separately. Exploratory end points were angiographic vasospasm, DCI, cerebral infarction caused by DCI, rescue therapy, and clinical outcomes at days 30 and 90.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Definitions of these events are published and followed recommendations of a multidisciplinary consensus statement.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Health economic outcomes will be reported separately. A computed tomography scan was obtained at day 30. The extended Glasgow outcome score (GOSE), Montreal cognitive assessment, modified Rankin scale, Barthel index, and telephone interview of cognitive status were conducted by study coordinators, who were trained in administering the outcome measures, at days 30 and 90 and National Institutes of Health stroke scale at days 7, 14, and 90.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>In part 1, cohorts of subjects were randomized (by biased coin method) to receive either EG-1962 or enteral nimodipine with a minimization procedure based on WFNS grade.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> WFNS grade was chosen for this because it is the most powerful prognostic factor for outcome after aSAH.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Randomization was computer generated by an independent company using interactive response technology. Allocation concealment was maintained because study centers did not know what other subjects entered into a given cohort had received. Up to 6 dose-level cohorts of EG-1962 were to be assessed during the dose-escalation part. Each dose-level cohort enrolled 12 subjects in a 3:1 (EG-1962:enteral nimodipine) ratio. The starting dose of EG-1962 was 100 mg, and the maximum dose was 1200 mg. These doses were based on preclinical studies and were allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration and a Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> EG-1962 (100 mg nimodipine/mL [Evonik Industries, Birmingham, AL] suspended in hyaluronic acid [Fidia Farmaceutici SPA, Abano Terme, Italy]) was administered as one intraventricular injection. After reconstitution in the pharmacy, it was transported to the subject&#x02019;s bedside and remixed. Up to 5 mL CSF was aspirated from the EVD under sterile conditions. The syringe containing EG-1962 was then administered and flushed through the EVD with sterile, preservative-free 0.9% NaCl. It was recommended that the EVD remain closed and that CSF be drained only if clinically indicated. Once randomized, subjects assigned to EG-1962 no longer received enteral nimodipine. An independent data safety monitoring committee reviewed the safety, occurrence of predefined DLT, stopping rules, plasma nimodipine pharmacokinetics, and tolerability data up to day 14 for each cohort. A decision was then made to increase the dose by some amount to determine that the MTD was reached or to enter another cohort with a lower dose. With the exception of the doses for cohort 1 (100 mg) and cohort 6 (1200 mg), the EG-1962 dose to be administered in cohorts 2, 3, 4, and 5 could be modified based on the data safety monitoring committee recommendation. Safety and DLT information was reported by the investigators up until day 90. The MTD was reached if &#x02265;3 subjects receiving EG-1962 had a DLT or if the 1200 mg dose was reached. Management of subjects, DLT, and adverse events was outlined in the protocol and followed guidelines for management of aSAH.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Cohort size estimates were based on the analysis of published aSAH data and supported a dose-escalation scheme with 9 EG-1962 and 3 enteral nimodipine subjects per cohort.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The safety data set (all subjects randomized who received EG-1962 or enteral nimodipine and were assessed for safety at least once) included 72 subjects. Exploratory outcomes were based on a modified intent to treat (all subjects who were included in the safety analysis set and who had GOSE assessments at day 30 or 90). The modified intent to treat set excluded 1200 mg EG-1962 subjects because this dose was above the MTD. Only 3 subjects received the full dose, and some also received enteral nimodipine, which renders outcomes uninterpretable.</p><p>Demographics and safety data are reported as descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation). The first exploratory end point was the GOSE, analyzed as a dichotomous outcome (favorable outcome 6&#x02013;8 and unfavorable outcome 1&#x02013;5). This cut point was based on analysis of existing data.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The GOSE was compared between subjects in all cohorts combined randomized to enteral nimodipine and those randomized to each of the EG-1962 dose groups and to the combined EG-1962 group. The prespecified analysis used Fisher exact test and the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by WFNS grade (dichotomized as 2 versus 3+4) and age (dichotomized as &#x0003c;60 or &#x02265;60) because these are important admission prognostic factors for outcome and to adjust for differences between cohorts in WFNS grade and age.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Exact 95% (2-sided) confidence intervals (CI) for proportions and approximate 95% CI were used for relative risk ratios.

The maximum tolerated dose was 800 mg; 1200 mg was not tolerable because of the injection volume. Two DLT were reported, one each in cohort 3 (400 mg) and cohort 5 (800 mg). Both were elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Elevated ICP was considered a DLT if ICP was &#x0003e;30 mm&#x02009;Hg compared with the ICP recorded just prior to the administration of EG-1962 within 24 hours after EG-1962 administration and lasting over 4 hours despite appropriate therapy. In one case, the increased ICP was not associated with neurological deterioration, and the subject had a day-90 GOSE of upper moderate disability (favorable outcome). In the second case, there was transient neurological deterioration starting 13.5 hours after administration of EG-1962.

Evidence consistent with this is that at some doses, nimodipine and other dihydropyridines reduce angiographic vasospasm, cortical spreading ischemia, and microthromboembolism.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Nimodipine may have improved outcome because it inhibits these deleterious processes, but at tolerable doses has only a small effect on the most widely measured process (angiographic vasospasm). NEWTON tested the hypothesis that intracranial delivery of EG-1962, which achieved high and sustained CSF concentrations in preclinical studies, would increase efficacy without compromising safety.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The NEWTON study objectives were met. The MTD was determined to be 800 mg because the volume of the 1200 mg injection (12 mL) was not tolerable as a single injection. The only DLT were episodes of transient increased ICP after injection of EG-1962. One SAE, a possible allergic reaction that had no clinical sequelae, was reported as possibly related to EG-1962. EG-1962 was safe with the same or lower risk of central nervous system events such as hemorrhage compared with enteral nimodipine. As hypothesized, no EG-1962-related hypotension occurred, whereas 17% (3/18) of subjects in the enteral nimodipine group experienced dose-limiting hypotension. Meningitis and ventriculitis were the only adverse events more common in the EG-1962 group (5/54, 9%). We attribute this in part to the protocol requesting repeated sampling of CSF for nimodipine pharmacokinetics. This infection rate is comparable to analysis of 33 studies with 9667 cases from the literature that found a pooled infection incidence of 8%.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> This study allowed for institutional practice to be followed for EVD insertion. There was no study-mandated protocol for EVD insertion. Future studies of EG-1962 will mitigate the risk of infection by requiring adherence to protocols for EVD insertion and intraventricular injection and by not obtaining CSF samples unless clinically indicated.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment with EG-1962 was associated with improved outcome on the GOSE, an effect that was robust over different WFNS grades (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Furthermore, EG-1962 subjects had reduction in angiographic vasospasm, DCI, and need for rescue therapy. Favorable response rates were greater than control at all doses, with no obvious dose relationship. The lack of dose&#x02013;response is consistent with randomized trials of enteral nimodipine that showed similar outcomes with doses of 30 to 90 mg nimodipine every 4 hours for 21 days.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies of drugs targeting central nervous system disorders frequently do not demonstrate strong dose&#x02013;responses and have wide ranges of recommended doses.</p><p>Limitations of this study include that the number of subjects treated was small, it was unblinded, and we used a modified intent&#x02013;to-treat analysis for the clinical outcome. There were differences between cohorts in numbers of subjects at baseline with different WFNS grades, which was anticipated and adjusted for in the statistical analysis. Finally, subjects randomized represent a select population of SAH patients. Whether similar results could be obtained by administering EG-1962 by lumbar injection or whether an EVD could be indicated for the primary purpose of administering EG-1962 cannot be determined at this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Intraventricular EG-1962 was safe and tolerable to 800 mg and, in this aSAH population, was associated with reduced DCI and use of rescue therapy. Overall, the rate of favorable outcome was greater in the EG-1962-treated group. A pivotal phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical study of EG-1962 compared with enteral nimodipine has been started.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Integrated Medical Development, LLC, for statistical and study support.</p></sec><sec><title>Sources of Funding</title><p>The study was funded by Edge Therapeutics, Inc.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>Dr Macdonald receives grant support from the Physicians Services Incorporated Foundation, Brain Aneurysm Foundation, Canadian Institutes for Health Research, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and is an employee and Chief Scientific Officer of Edge Therapeutics, Inc.
