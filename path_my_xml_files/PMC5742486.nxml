Vaccination trials in high endemicity settings are needed to provide evidence and guidance on optimal strategies to protect children in these settings against pneumococcal infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This report describes the rationale, objectives, methods, study population, follow-up and specimen collection for a vaccination trial conducted in an endemic and logistically challenging setting in PNG. The trial aimed to determine whether currently available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) are suitable for use under PNG&#x02019;s accelerated immunization schedule, and that a schedule including pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in later infancy is safe and immunogenic in this high-risk population.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">This open randomized-controlled trial was conducted between November 2011 and March 2016, enrolling 262 children aged 1 month between November 2011 and April 2014. The participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 10-valent PCV (10vPCV) or 13-valent PCV (13vPCV) in a 1-2-3-month schedule, with further randomization to receive PPV or no PPV at age 9&#x000a0;months, followed by a 1/5<sup>th</sup> PPV challenge at age 23&#x000a0;months. A total of 1229 blood samples were collected to measure humoral and cellular immune responses and 1238 nasopharyngeal swabs to assess upper respiratory tract colonization and carriage load. Serious adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Of the 262 children enrolled, 87% received 3 doses of PCV, 79% were randomized to receive PPV or no PPV at age 9&#x000a0;months, and 67% completed the study at 24&#x000a0;months of age with appropriate immunization and challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Laboratory testing of the many samples collected during this trial will determine the impact of the different vaccine schedules and formulations on nasopharyngeal carriage, antibody production and function, and immune memory. The final data will inform policy on pneumococcal vaccine schedules in countries with children at high risk of pneumococcal disease by providing direct comparison of an accelerated schedule of 10vPCV and 13vPCV and the potential advantages of PPV following PCV immunization.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par150">ClinicalTrials.gov CTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01619462">NCT01619462</ext-link>, retrospectively registered on May 28, 2012</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pneumococcal</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>PCV</kwd><kwd>PPV</kwd><kwd>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</kwd><kwd>Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</kwd><kwd>Papua New Guinea</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Australian National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>1087200</award-id><award-id>1061428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkham</surname><given-names>Lea-Ann</given-names></name><name><surname>Richmond</surname><given-names>Peter C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research Internal Competitive Research Award Scheme</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas Project </institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution> Telethon Kids Institute&#x02019;s Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases </institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Telethon Kids Institute&#x02019;s Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases </institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Australian National Health and Medical Research Council </institution></funding-source><award-id>GNT1072213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passey</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/ECF/1-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Passey</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Seqirus</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par36">An estimated 921,000 children die annually from pneumonia, with the majority of deaths occurring in third-world countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) is the leading cause of pneumonia deaths in children under 5&#x000a0;years, being responsible for approximately 400,000 of these deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The pneumococcus is also a leading cause of meningitis, septicemia and otitis media. Infants are at greatest risk of dying from pneumococcal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">In Papua New Guinea (PNG), acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is the most common reason for hospitalization and cause of death in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the burden of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) remains high. In a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) trial that we&#x000a0;conducted between 2005&#x02013;2009 in the Asaro Valley, Eastern Highlands Province (the site of this study), the overall incidence rate of ALRI before age 18&#x000a0;months in 109 controls was 1175/1000 person-years; there were 62 episodes of moderate or severe ALRI (incidence rate 439/1000 person-years), 27% of which occurred between 10 and 18&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the same trial, the estimated incidence rate of IPD in the first year of life was 4762/100,000 per annum (95% CI 1936&#x02013;9665), approximately 100 times the rates reported in European infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Upper respiratory tract (URT) pneumococcal carriage starts within weeks of birth in PNG (median age of acquisition is 19&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and is persistent throughout early childhood, with average pneumococcal carriage rates of 70&#x02013;80% from age 3&#x000a0;months to 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in PNG is broad: in&#x000a0;our 7vPCV trial more than 60 different pneumococcal serotypes were identified&#x000a0;in the URT of infants followed from birth until 18&#x000a0;months of age, of which 53 were identified in the first month of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Only 43% of pneumococcal carriage isolates among controls who had not received PCV would have been covered by 13vPCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Vaccines for pneumococcal disease</title><p id="Par38">Protection against IPD is by circulating opsonophagocytic IgG antibodies binding to capsular polysaccharides, which determine serotype. More than 90 different pneumococcal serotypes have been identified to date. The recognition that immunity correlated with anti-capsular antibodies led to the development of multivalent polysaccharide vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, polysaccharides are T-cell independent antigens and therefore the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is poorly immunogenic in infants and does not induce immune memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) containing polysaccharide antigens of individual serotypes covalently bound to protein carriers, hence transforming polysaccharides into T-cell dependent antigens, became available in 2000. In contrast to PPV, PCVs induce immunological memory and serum antibodies with a strong opsonophagocytic capacity in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and they are effective in preventing vaccine serotype-associated IPD, pneumonia and mortality in high-risk infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, PCVs reduce URT carriage of vaccine serotypes in vaccinated children, thus interrupting circulation of vaccine serotypes in the community, which in turn reduces IPD incidence in unvaccinated individuals through herd immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) committed to the introduction of PCVs for infants in Gavi-eligible countries (including PNG). Two PCVs are currently available: i) 10-valent PCV (10vPCV, Synflorix&#x000ae;, GlaxoSmith Kline [GSK], Belgium) containing serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9&#x000a0;V, 14, 18C, 19F &#x00026; 23F; and ii) 13-valent PCV (13vPCV, Prevenar 13&#x000ae;, Pfizer, United States of America [USA]) containing serotypes 3, 6A and 19A in addition to the 10 serotypes in 10vPCV. Both vaccines have been shown to prevent vaccine serotype-associated IPD in high-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">10vPCV also contains non-typeable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (NTHi) Protein D as a carrier, which may offer protection against NTHi disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. NTHi was frequently isolated in lung aspirates from children with pneumonia in PNG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], is a predominant cause of otitis media worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and has also been reported as a cause of invasive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Policy on choice of PCV in low- and middle-income countries has been hampered by the lack of data comparing the two vaccines in high-risk infants. While the three additional serotypes included in 13vPCV improve coverage for prevention of pneumococcal disease, the potential benefits of protection against NTHi-related pneumonia and otitis media by 10vPCV need to be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The broad range of serotypes causing IPD in PNG and other high-risk populations means that even 13vPCV provides limited coverage (50&#x02013;70%) against IPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There are also concerns that serotype replacement is more likely to occur in high-risk populations, similar to what was reported for native Alaskan infants after 7vPCV introduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Despite limited immunogenicity in infants, PPV given to PNG children aged 6&#x000a0;months to 5&#x000a0;years of age has been shown to reduce mortality and severe morbidity due to ALRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], with an age-related maturation of IgG responses correlating with efficacy data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, in high-risk infants, priming with PCV followed by a single dose of PPV in later infancy could potentially increase protection against IPD, particularly for serotypes such as type 2 that is an important cause of meningitis but is not covered by either PCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

However, serotype-specific IgG responses in these children did not decline and were robust with high avidity and opsonic functional activity suggesting protective responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Follow-up of the Fijian study participants at pre-school age showed that serotype-specific antibody levels were similar in those who had and those who had not received PPV at age 12&#x000a0;months, implying that there was no evidence of long-term hyporesponsiveness at pre-school age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">In the&#x000a0;7vPCV trial PPV was found to be immunogenic when given at age 9&#x000a0;months to PNG infants previously primed with 3 doses of PCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and antibody titres to PCV and non-PCV serotypes rose in response to a 1/5<sup>th</sup> PPV challenge dose at age 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years.

To compare continuous and categorical variables between groups, Mann-Whitney tests and Pearson chi-square tests were used respectively. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to investigate correlations between serotype-specific opsonophagocytic and IgG antibody concentrations. Linear and logistic regression models were used for further analyses examining associations between specific outcomes and different factors incorporating generalised estimating equations to take into account multiple samples from individual children. For all analyses, test outcomes were considered to be significant if the <italic>p</italic>-value is smaller or equal to 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec26"><title>Assent and enrolment</title><p id="Par108">A total of 431 women assented to having their child participate in the study, of which 265 (61%) gave their informed consent. Three children did not meet inclusion criteria (2 were overage and 1 child&#x02019;s mother was HIV-positive). Hence 262 children were formally enrolled into the study between 14 November 2011 and 16 April 2014, including 131 children randomized to receive 10vPCV and 131 randomized to receive 13vPCV.

A trial in The Gambia directly compared safety and immunogenicity of 10vPCV and 13vPCV as part of a larger trial of new experimental pneumococcal protein-based vaccines, but did not include a PPV booster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Two other trials comparing different schedules of the two PCVs are underway, one in Vietnam (NCT01953510) and another in Australian Aboriginal children (ACTRN12610000544077 and NCT01174849).</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par124">Despite logistical difficulties in conducting the study in urban and rural areas of the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG, a large enough number of samples were successfully collected to address study outcomes. Two-thirds of those enrolled in this study were fully followed up to 2&#x000a0;years of age, with sera and NPS collected at &#x0003e;1200 routine visits and high numbers of PBMCs (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) isolated from 658 blood samples from age 4&#x000a0;months onwards. This is a reflection of the long-established relationship and trust between the community and PNGIMR staff, in addition to the perseverance of field staff in locating participants.</p><p id="Par125">The two-stage process of assent followed by formal consent was important, allowing parents to discuss their participation with family members. Providing medical treatment to participants and their families and close follow-up in the event of illness was appreciated and a motivation to take part in the study. In addition, all study children received hand-knitted sweaters donated by Australian volunteers, and at the end of the study parents received a certificate of participation with a photograph of their child.</p><p id="Par126">Every vaccination entailed at least three trips to communities (pick-up and drop-off, and 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h follow-up visit), with additional visits needed if not located the first time. Roads were at times impassable and locals repairing roads sometimes charged a &#x02018;toll&#x02019;. In 2012 there were national elections and some families returned to their home villages outside the study area to vote and did not return. Furthermore, disputes between supporters of rival candidates at times restricted movement in the study area.</p><p id="Par127">Despite every effort, approximately one-third of participants did not complete the study. This is in part the result of increasing mobility of the population: 10% of participants migrated out of the area during this study compared with 5% during the earlier 7vPCV study conducted between 2005 and 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Loss to follow-up and withdrawal of consent tended to occur at a young age, similar to the 7vPCV study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In some cases, husbands had not been part of the assent and consent processes and subsequently indicated they did not want their children to participate in the study. While every effort was made to provide full information about what the study entailed, mothers may on further reflection have had doubts about taking part in the study. Some parents were concerned about the volume of blood that was being collected from their child. Collecting blood samples from young children was sometimes difficult, though the nurses/HEOs did not persevere if the child or parent was distressed.</p><p id="Par128">Having a Papua New Guinean doctor to oversee the clinical activities and train nurses and HEOs was a great advantage and much appreciated by parents. When the study doctor left a year and a half into the study to pursue pediatric training, a succession of three competent HEOs oversaw the field and clinical activities. However, these staff changes reduced continuity over the course of the study.</p><p id="Par129">In contrast to laboratory staff who were blinded to the vaccine randomization, study nurses were not blinded due to the limited number of nurses/HEOs available to administer vaccines and conduct follow-ups. However, whenever possible, different nurse/HEOs administered vaccines to those assessing reactogenicity. It is acknowledged that this could potentially impact on the interpretation of clinical outcomes, but cannot affect the primary immunogenicity outcomes.</p><p id="Par130">Despite the launch of the 13vPCV program in PNG in 2014, vaccine was not available in the EHP until 2015 and has been introduced slowly since: coverage with one dose of 13vPCV was only around 25% and with three doses around 5% in late 2015 in the study area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Herd protection following launch of the PNG 13vPCV program in PNG in late 2014 is therefore unlikely to have impacted on the results of the present study.</p><p id="Par131">Notably, there were no deaths among study participants due to uncomplicated pneumonia in a country where pneumonia remains the most common cause of childhood death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is attributed to all study children receiving both pneumococcal and Hib vaccines and close monitoring of study participants when they were sick. While morbidity among study participants will be reported fully elsewhere, 2 of the 3 cases of culture-proven pneumococcal bacteraemia were due to non-PCV serotypes and the third child with a PCV serotype-related bacteraemia had only received one dose of PCV at the time of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The mean age at death was older than previously recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], with 5 of the 8 deaths occurring in the second year of life. While a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was assigned for two children who died, these were not laboratory-confirmed. The emergence of malnutrition as an important cause of death in PNG has been highlighted elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This may be related to undiagnosed tuberculosis, which was previously rare in the highlands of PNG, overall poverty, or a reflection of societal challenges including unwanted pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and associated neglect of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Finally, infants with a birth weight of less than 2000&#x000a0;g were excluded as low birth weight was used as a surrogate marker for prematurity, which may affect immune responses to vaccines including PCVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], as well as that&#x000a0; prematurity is hard to assess in this setting. As is true for randomized clinical trials in general, field studies conducted post-implementation may find different results in individuals due to the influence of various external factors. However, the authors believe that the results for 10vPCV and 13vPCV immunogenicity and safety are largely generalizable to newborns in PNG and other settings where pneumococcal infections are highly endemic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par132">The introduction of PCV in high-risk settings facilitated by Gavi is likely to have a significant impact on the burden of IPD, although the high proportion of pneumococcal disease due to non-vaccine serotypes raises concerns with regard to serotype replacement. The lack of data comparing PCVs has made it difficult for countries to choose the PCV likely to provide the most benefit. This study provides direct comparison of safety, immunogenicity (including functional antibody responses) and impact on carriage rates and bacterial load in a randomized controlled trial of an accelerated 3-dose schedule of 10vPCV and 13vPCV in a low-income setting. Following completion of the primary schedule in this trial without immediate concerns regarding reactogenicity and safety of either PCV, 13vPCV was introduced into the PNG EPI Program in 2014. In addition to comparison of currently available PCVs, this study will provide evidence on the potential advantages of PPV following PCV immunization in infancy in high-risk settings, including immune protection against important IPD-causing non-PCV serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], boosting of immune responses against PCV serotypes to enhance long-term immunity, and will directly investigate any effects on B-cell memory. Samples collected in this cohort are currently undergoing laboratory testing to determine the impact of the different vaccine schedules and formulations on nasopharyngeal carriage, antibody production and function, and immune memory response. Assessment of antibody and T-cell responses to pneumococcal and NTHi proteins will aid an understanding of the development of natural immunity to these antigens relevant to development of protein-based vaccines. These studies will provide data to inform policy on pneumococcal vaccine schedules in countries with children at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>10vPCV</term><def><p id="Par5">10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>13vPCV</term><def><p id="Par6">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par7">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALRI</term><def><p id="Par8">Acute lower respiratory infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCG</term><def><p id="Par9">Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSL</term><def><p id="Par10">Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMB</term><def><p id="Par11">Data safety monitoring board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHPH</term><def><p id="Par12">Eastern Highlands Provincial Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p id="Par13">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPI</term><def><p id="Par14">Expanded Program on Immunization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Gavi</term><def><p id="Par15">Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMC</term><def><p id="Par16">Geometric mean concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GMT</term><def><p id="Par17">Geometric mean titre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEO</term><def><p id="Par18">Health extension officer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hib</term><def><p id="Par19">
