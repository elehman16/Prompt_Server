Persisting CNS deficits due to early deficiency depend on the nutrient and inadequacy at a time vulnerable to morphological or molecular shifts from which recovery is difficult <xref rid="pone.0083764-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Georgieff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In this regard, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), but not other n-3 fatty acids, is enriched in brain and retina membranes where it functions in early developmental events such as neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, axonal elimination, and gene expression <xref rid="pone.0083764-deVelasco1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Katakura2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Loss of CNS DHA is compensated for by increased 22:4n-6, 22:5n-6 and sometimes arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6) in animals and human infants <xref rid="pone.0083764-CotiBertrand1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Farquharson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Neuringer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Although substitution of n-6 fatty acids for DHA fulfils needs for membrane fatty acids, n-6 fatty acids differ in functional properties from DHA. This results in a complex problem whereby the consequences of insufficient DHA may reflect both loss of DHA and the actions of the n-6 fatty acids used in replacement.</p><p>Understanding dietary needs for n-3 fatty acids for CNS development is complicated by the different n-3 fatty acids in the diet, interactions with n-6 fatty acids, and genetic and other variables that impact their metabolism. The n-3 fatty acids are consumed as &#x003b1;-linoleic acid (18:3n-3), mainly in plant oils, and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and DHA from animal lipids, particularly fish. Conversion of 18:3n-3 to DHA occurs in humans, but in a complex pathway requiring &#x00394;-6 desaturase, which has at least 6 substrates <xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Among these, n-6 fatty acids are important due to the abundant 18:2n-6 in westernized diets, inhibition of 18:3n-3 desaturation by high 18:2n-6, and knowledge that 20:4n-6, 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 accumulate, and hence n-6 fatty acid desaturation occurs, in infants and animals fed diets high 18:2n-6 <xref rid="pone.0083764-Novak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Neuringer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Liou1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Arbuckle1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. When consumed, DHA effectively provides DHA to the developing CNS thus overcoming concerns over 18:3n-3 inadequacy, ability to synthesize DHA, or high n-6 fatty acid intakes <xref rid="pone.0083764-Novak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Greiner1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Our work focuses on whether n-3 fatty acid deficiency, leading to DHA low enough to compromise fetal CNS development occurs in gestation.

Randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of supplemental DHA in pregnancy in enhancing child CNS performance have yielded mixed findings <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Makrides1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, but whether the infants in these studies were compromised by underlying n-3 fatty acid insufficiency before birth is unknown.</p><p>The present study is based on a risk-reduction model, and used a randomized intervention with DHA or a placebo to address whether fetal DHA supplies are sufficiently low in some pregnant women as to increase risk that children will not meet their developmental potential. The design recognizes that neither the prevalence nor extent of DHA insufficiency, if present, is known. The efficacy of DHA in enhancing cognitive development can only be tested in individuals known to have deficits in cognitive development. For example, if it is accepted that infants fed formula have cognitive delays compared to breast-fed infants, then the efficacy of DHA in preventing the cognitive deficits due to feeding formula can be tested by comparing infants fed formula with and without DHA. Equally important, our design incorporates understanding that the placebo group in this study is not a non-exposure group. Variable amounts of DHA are present in the diet of all subjects. Further, individuals in the DHA supplement group who are not deficient are not expected to benefit. Because our underlying goals are to demonstrate deficiency and subsequently identify biomarkers of deficiency, maternal blood samples were a pre-requisite to assessment of child outcomes in the present work.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures were reviewed and approved by the Committee for Ethical Review of Research Involving Human Subjects at the University of British Columbia (B.C.) and the B.C. Children's and Women's Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each woman prior to randomization on behalf of herself and for her infant. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083764.s003">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0083764.s004">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design, Intervention and Subjects</title><p>This was a double-blind, single center, randomized study designed to assess whether DHA was sufficiently low among some term infants prior to birth as to limit CNS development to 18 mo-of-age. All of the subjects were residents of Vancouver, Canada and enrolled between 2004 and 2008. The purpose of randomizing a group of women to DHA was to provide a group of infants in which risk of DHA insufficiency during gestation was considered low. The rate of CNS development differs among infants, giving a distribution of scores within which the best potential development of an individual infant is unknown. As a result, the risk reduction model focused analyses on performance of infants in the placebo group within the distribution of development of all infants in the study. We hypothesize that prenatal DHA insufficiency will constrain child CNS development. If this occurs, we expect that fewer infants in the placebo than DHA supplement group will achieve high neurodevelopmental test scores, giving evidence that DHA deficiency occurs during gestation and constrains child development in our population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g001">

As described <xref rid="pone.0083764-Friesen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis4" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, our studies were not designed to test the efficacy of DHA supplements in increasing child CNS abilities, which is a different question and not our hypothesis. Efficacy of an intervention can only be addressed with individuals known to be able to respond to the intervention; in our situation the presence of deficiency and thus the ability to respond is unknown. In the event that no effect is found, the interpretation is that DHA deficiency was not detectable in our study population, not that DHA is not needed by the brain. An assumption of the prevalence of DHA deficiency was used for the purpose of study design. We assumed DHA deficiency in 15% of infants before birth and 35% dropout, with increased risk of not being in the 25% of infants with the highest test scores identified in the placebo group with enrolment of 270 subjects, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p><fig id="pone-0083764-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0083764.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic to illustrate the concept that individuals with high neurodevelopment test scores are unlikely to be nutrient deficient.</title><p>We assessed whether fetal DHA insufficiency sufficient to constrain CNS development occurs based on failure to achieve a neurodevelopmental test score in the upper 25% of infant scores, representing the range of achievement where deficiency is less likely.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0083764.g001"/></fig><p>Eligible participants were &#x02264;16 wk gestation, not taking any lipid or fatty acid supplement, and were expected to deliver one infant at full-term gestation, with no maternal or fetal complications. After enrolment, subjects were assigned to 400 mg/d DHA or a placebo using computer-generated, random codes held in sealed, opaque envelopes using a block design. The supplements were provided in identical capsules in bottles with more than sufficient supplements to cover the study interval. Compliance was monitored from the number of returned unused capsules. DHA was given as algal oil triglycerides and the placebo was an equivalent amount of corn and soybean oil blended to reflect the dietary 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 ratio, but in amounts quantitatively insignificant compared to usual intakes <xref rid="pone.0083764-Friesen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The supplements were identical in appearance, contained an orange flavour mask and were provided by DSM Nutritional Products (formerly Martek Biosciences, MD). We chose a supplement of 400 mg/d DHA since this is equivalent to DHA from about two meals of fatty fish/wk, and four to ten-fold higher than the amount of DHA accumulated/d in fetal tissues <xref rid="pone.0083764-Clandinin1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Kuipers1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Higher amounts of DHA would give greater separation between the intake and blood levels of DHA <xref rid="pone.0083764-Arterburn1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> among women in the DHA and placebo supplement groups. However, this is not a useful strategy for this study because of the underlying understanding that providing more DHA than required by the CNS will not result in enhanced CNS function. Fundamentally, the relationship between the intake of an essential nutrient and functions dependent on that nutrient are non-linear, with a linear dose-response between DHA and child cognitive function unlikely. We do not hypothesize that DHA supplements increase cognitive abilities in individuals who fulfill their DHA requirements. The duration of supplementation was from enrolment until infant delivery. Maternal venous blood and information on dietary intake was obtained at 16 wk gestation prior to commencing supplements, then again at 36 wk gestation.</p><p>A flow diagram of subject enrolment, retention in the study, infant developmental tests and reasons tests were not analyzed are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g002">

Of the variables assessed, only infant sex differed between the two randomized groups and showed a potential relationship to infant outcome (<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05); therefore, sex was included in all subsequent analyses.</p><p>The odds ratio and 5-95<sup>th</sup> confidence interval (CI) that an infant in the placebo or DHA group would fail to perform among the top 25% of all infants was determined with contingency tables and Fisher exact test. For some tests, separation of the cohort into an exact upper 25% and lower 75% of infants was not possible when more than one infant achieved the same test score at the group cut point. In those cases, we defined the upper 25% of infants as the n that gave the lowest possible deviation from n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25% of all infants tested for that test. Pass/fail results for the problem-solving and non-native language consonant tests were compared between the DHA and placebo supplement groups using chi square.

Our study does not address the reasons for inadequate DHA, does not identify dietary requirements, and does not aim to show that supplemental DHA enhances cognitive abilities. However, using a model designed to identify DHA insufficiency in the infant before birth, we provide novel data to show that DHA low enough to limit infant development to 18 mo of age does occur. In the discussion, we highlight the complexity of identifying n-3 fatty acid deficiency before birth, and raise several points for studies designed with this intent.</p><p>In our study, women were enrolled at 16 wk gestation, and randomized to DHA or a placebo until delivery of the infant for the purpose of assessing if fetal CNS development is constrained among infants of women following their usual diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Pragmatically, since DHA consumed by the mother is transported across the placenta <xref rid="pone.0083764-GilSnchez1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and provides DHA to the fetal CNS <xref rid="pone.0083764-Greiner1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, it is expected that maternal DHA supplementation should reduce risk of insufficient fetal DHA. This concept is consistent with observation studies to show lower risk of poor child CNS development in infants and children of women consuming diets rich in fish or marine mammals <xref rid="pone.0083764-Hibbeln1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0083764-Oken1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, the corollary that women with low intakes of DHA necessarily equate with fetal DHA inadequacy cannot be assumed from current knowledge. Data to show poor neurodevelopment in children of healthy vegetarians, despite their low diet and blood lipid DHA <xref rid="pone.0083764-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> has not been published. Variable maternal-to-fetal fatty acid transfer, and fetal n-3 fatty acid metabolism and acylation into neural tissue may also limit extrapolation from measures of maternal DHA to DHA accretion in the fetal CNS. Recognition that assessment of fetal DHA insufficiency differs from assessment in breast-fed and formula-fed infants, children or adults in whom blood levels of DHA can be directly measured is important.</p><p>We randomized pregnant women to take four to ten fold more DHA than the estimated fetal DHA needs <xref rid="pone.0083764-Clandinin1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Kuipers1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, then assessed risk that healthy term gestation infants born to mothers given a placebo would fail to be among the quartile of infants achieving the highest CNS development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Using this approach, we show increased risk of lower language development at 14 and 18 mo of age on the CDI infant and toddler scales (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.02) and on the BSID-III (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) at 18 mo of age among infants in the placebo group. Constraint of language development was robust, affecting both boys and girls, productive and receptive language, and evident in well-controlled testing using the BSID-III with testers blinded to the infant group. Visual acuity also showed evidence of delayed maturation in the placebo group when assessed at 2 mo (OR 2.69, CL 1.10&#x02013;6.54, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03), but not at 12 mo of age. Previous prospective observation studies <xref rid="pone.0083764-Hibbeln1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis5" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and clinical trials with preterm infants given DHA <xref rid="pone.0083764-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> have also found language development appears to be sensitive to the early DHA supply. Possibly, these results reflect a role of DHA in the anatomical and molecular factors involved in early language learning. It is of interest that whereas auditory stimuli elicit large event related potentials over temporal brain regions with absent or small responses over occipital regions in the adult brain, 6 mo old infants show equally large response amplitudes over the visual and auditory cortex on auditory stimulation <xref rid="pone.0083764-Neville1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Maturation and increasing specificity of auditory sensory systems, fundamental to developmental sensitivities of grammatical and semantic/lexical (object-word association) language learning, involve a gradual decrease in responses of occipital regions to auditory stimuli from 6 to 36 mo of age. Although apparently not studied in humans, experimental work has reported evidence of altered auditory evoked potentials in offspring of animals given DHA during pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0083764-Auestad1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We found no evidence of fetal DHA insufficiency sufficient to constrain cognitive, gross motor or fine motor development when assessed using the BSID-III at 18 mo of age. The categorical pass/fail results for problem solving and non-native language tests found no group differences, however, tests which do not enable ranking of infant skill development may lack the sensitivity to detect slower rates of CNS development in term infants.</p><p>Several studies have addressed the efficacy of maternal prenatal DHA supplementation as a means to increase infant and child neurodevelopment, with findings of no benefit on novelty preference at 6 or 9 mo <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, a small increase (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.049) in mean scores on the mental composite scale of the Kauffman Assessment Battery for Children (KAB-C) at 4 y but not at 7 y <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, significant positive effects on group mean problem solving, but not novelty preference at 9 mo <xref rid="pone.0083764-Judge1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and no significant difference in group mean test scores on the BSID-III at 18 mo <xref rid="pone.0083764-vanGoor1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Makrides1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale or Picture Peabody Test at 2.5 y <xref rid="pone.0083764-Dunstan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, the Hemple, Touwen, or KAB-C tests at 4, 5.5 or 6.5 y of age, respectively <xref rid="pone.0083764-EscolanoMargarit1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Campoy1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In our study, we also found no significant difference in group mean test scores between infants in the placebo and DHA groups for any test, at any age. Our results thus concur with a conclusion that at a group level, supplemental DHA does not enhance cognitive development of infants born at term gestation <xref rid="pone.0083764-Makrides1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Assuming no random group bias, our results for language development using the BSID III estimate constraint of development in about 10% of infants in the placebo group, a number too small to detect by group mean comparisons with our sample size enrolled without a priori knowledge of deficiency.</p><p>Studies in other species have shown that n-3 fatty acid deficiency results in increased tissue lipid 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-6 <xref rid="pone.0083764-CotiBertrand1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Novak1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Neuringer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083764-Innis3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Experimental evidence for a pregnancy-associated increase in hepatic &#x00394; 6 desaturase gene expression has been reported <xref rid="pone.0083764-Childs1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Our results show increased 22:4n-6 + 22:5n-6, but not DHA, in RBC PE with advancing gestation in women in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We interpret this as biochemical evidence of insufficient n-3 fatty acids to support the gestational increase in fatty acid desaturation, which thus proceeded with n-6 fatty acids. Whether this was due to insufficient n-3 fatty acids, excess n-6 fatty acids or some other factor is unclear. We found no significant relationship between the maternal RBC DHA at 16 or 36 wk gestation and infant CNS development. Regardless of the positive correlation between the maternal DHA intake and the RBC PE and PC DHA (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), the RBC DHA showed considerable variability among women with similar DHA intakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The RBC DHA levels also overlapped between women in the placebo and DHA group at 36 wk gestation after about 20 wk supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0083764-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Other studies also show high variability in blood lipid DHA and in the response to DHA supplementation. For e.g., the mean &#x000b1; 2SD range of plasma phospholipid DHA was 50&#x02013;153.6% and 79&#x02013;215.4% fatty acids in 35 wk gestation women assignment to placebo or 1183 mg DHA + 803 mg 20:5n-3/d from 17&#x02013;19 wk gestation, respectively <xref rid="pone.0083764-Helland4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, and the RBC PE DHA was 2.92&#x02013;10.2% and 3.46&#x02013;14.1% fatty acids in term gestation women given a placebo or 500 mg DHA + 150 mg 20:5n-3/d from 20 wk gestation <xref rid="pone.0083764-EscolanoMargarit2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Although the reasons for the overlap in blood lipid DHA among women with widely different DHA intakes is not known, it is evident that DHA acylation into blood lipids is more complex than DHA intake. Similar complexity in extrapolating DHA accretion in the fetal CNS from measures of the exogenous, i.e. maternal DHA supply, would seem likely.</p><p>This study has several important limitations. High breast-feeding rates, with 63&#x02013;72% infants still breast-fed at 6 mo may have masked greater constraint of CNS development in infants with shorter exposure to or no breastfeeding. Brain DHA accretion and neural synapse development continues throughout early childhood. Postnatal compensation or other nutrient deficits would dampen any effect of fetal DHA insufficiency on CNS development assessed after birth. Our definition of failure to be among the quartile of infants with the highest developmental test scores was arbitrary, and different definitions would yield different results. Although this study was randomized, it is possible that unmeasured variables in the home environment were present between the groups and contributed to the differences found. Regardless, this study was designed with a randomized intervention in a quasi-risk reduction model to provide evidence of fetal DHA insufficiency in our population. Using this approach, we have shown that language development is robustly constrained risk at different ages and with different tests in infants born to women consuming about 5% energy from 18:2n-6, 0.59% energy as 18:3n-3 and 85mg/d DHA. We emphasize that we do not hypothesize that DHA enhances child neurodevelopment, but our data support an hypothesis of DHA insufficiency among infants of women following typical western diets for which risk may be reduced by increasing the maternal DHA intake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083764.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
