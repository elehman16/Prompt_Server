Management of distal injuries is often different and more complex.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although different treatment methods have been developed for distal tibia fractures and external fixation, plate and intramedullary nailing are the surgical options for tibial fractures, there is currently no consensus on the optimal mode of management.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Fibular fractures in 77.7% of the cases are common with tibial fractures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Fibula fixation as an adjunct method was proposed by Morrison <italic>et al</italic>., to manage the fractures of the tibia and fibula.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In both clinical and laboratory settings the role of fibular fracture fixation in cases of distal tibia-fibula fractures has been examined, and particularly in the setting of distal tibia fractures, has been shown to help maintaining the tibia fracture reduction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Previously, studies have reported that effective plating of the fibula fracture improves alignment and the ability of the tibial fracture fixation to resist motion across the defect and prevents loss of reduction.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] On the other hand, fibular fixation may result in delayed union or nonunion because it inhibits the cyclic loading on the tibial fracture site.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>There seems to be a controversy about fibular fixation in the treatment of distal tibial fractures and data about the impact of fibular fixation in distal tibia-fibula fractures are limited. So, the present study was aimed to determine the role of fibular fixation in combined distal tibia and fibula fractures. We hypothesized that fixation of the fibula increases the stability of fixation in distal tibial and fibular fractures without increasing other complications, such as nonunion or delayed union.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized, parallel-group, non-blind study was conducted between Sep, 2013, and May, 2014, on 60 patients with distal tibial and fibular fractures who were referred to Al-Zahra and Kashani hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. The ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all studied patients.</p><p>Patients older than 18 years old in both genders with combined distal tibia and fibular fractures AO/OTA 43 A1-3, who had fractures less than 2 weeks old, were eligible if they had no evidence of syndesmotic injury or open fractures. Also, exclusion criteria included refractures, pathologic fractures, articular involvement, vascular and soft tissue injuries, multiple fractures and chronic systemic or infective disease with intraction by healing process such as DM.</p><p>Sixty eligible patients were randomly divided into two groups with 30 patients using random-maker software &#x0201c;Random Allocation&#x0201d;. In the case group, fibula was fixed by a 3.5 mm DCP or one-third tubular plate through lateral approach prior to the fixation of tibia. Patients who received fixation of the tibia without fibular fixation were allocated in the control group. All procedures were performed under spinal or general anesthesia. Reamed intramedullary nail or plate and screw was placed in tibia in all of the patients according to type and location of fracture. Patients had locking nail placed in tibia and were statically locked with distal locking bolt configuration two medial to lateral bolts or DCP or LCP plating.</p><p>Between first day and 13<sup>th</sup> days from the time of the injury, surgery was performed by different surgeons. Range of motion of the ankle and knee was allowed immediately after operation. We also allowed partial weight-bearing immediately after surgery and progressively after that depending on radiographic signs of union in the first 3 months.</p><p>Primary outcomes were varus-valgus angulation, ant/pos angulation, union and side effects, which were recorded for each group during the 9-month follow-up. Union was defined as when patients could tolerate unprotected weight bearing accompanied by radiographic criteria of union. Malunion was defined as a varus&#x02013;valgus angulation of more than 5&#x000b0; and an anterior-posterior angulation of more than 10&#x000b0;. Malrotation was assessed clinically. Follow-up visit and radiographs were taken 2, 4 weeks, 3, 6 and 9 months after surgery. Due to the nature of the intervention it is not possible to blind participants or the immediate research team to the allocated intervention.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using the comparison of proportions formula with two-sided log-rank test, a = 0.05, and 80% power. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS software for Windows, version 20. Descriptive data are reported as mean &#x000b1; SD or number (percent) as appropriate.

The possibility of a better control over the length and rotation of the limb and better anatomical alignment are the theoretical benefits of fibular fixation, but delayed union or nonunion because it inhibits the cyclic loading on the tibial fracture site because of fibular fixation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the present study we assessed the role of fibular fixation in distal tibial and fibula fractures. Two groups of cases (with fibula fixation) and controls (without fibula fixation) were treated by intramedullary nailing or plate and screw and outcomes were compared between groups. Varus/valgus and anterior&#x02013;posterior angulation between studied groups during follow-up period were similar. Frequency percentages of tibial and fibula union after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months between groups were not significantly different. The frequencies of nonunion of tibia and fibula were comparable in both groups. Incidence of nerve injury and infection were not significantly different between groups.</p><p>In a randomized clinical trial by Rouhani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] during a 23-month period, a total of 53 patients with concomitant fractures of tibia and ipsilateral fibula at distal third level were assessed to investigate the effect of the fixation of fibula in the treatment of tibia distal fractures. Results in this study showed that frequency of varus/valgus angulation and anterior-posterior angulation during the follow-up period was comparable in both studied groups. Also, they did not found any differences between case and control groups for the frequency of Infection and nonunion. Authors in this study concluded that fixation of fibula did not improve the treatment outcome of distal third of tibia diaphysis fractures. In agreement to Rouhani <italic>et al</italic>. study, there was no significant difference in the frequency of infection as an adverse effect of fibular fixation in our study, and we did not find any advantage of using fibula fixation to treat distal of tibia diaphysis.</p><p>Several studies showed different results in comparison to our study, however, most of these studies are not similar to the present study because have been done in tibial plafond fractures. One of these studies was done by Marsh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed an increasing risk of infection after using the fibular fixation method. In another study by Williams <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] the effect of fibular fixation in the tibial fracture treatment was assessed and they reported that clinical outcomes of tibial plafond fractures with associated fibula fractures were stabilized using monolateral external fixators spanning the ankle joint. Their results also showed an increase of nonunion and infection rate in case group with fibular fixation. They concluded that favorable clinical outcomes may be achieved without fibular fixation in such cases. These contrasts to a retrospective study by Berlusconi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in which a total of 60 patients with distal shaft fracture of the tibia with associated fracture of the fibula were assessed in two groups of patients who had their fibula fixed and patients who did not. The infection rate was not difference among the three groups and investigators recommend fibular fixation in all distal fractures when both fractures lie on the same plane and the tibial fracture is relatively stabilized. Another study by Teitz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that sparing the fibula may result in rapid union of the fracture because of the inhibiting cyclic compression theory.</p><p>Some studies reported that fibular fixation does not affect tibial fracture treatment; one of them reported no benefit of fibular fixation on extra-articular fractures of combined tibia and fibula, and did not recommended it.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Other two studies reported no effect of fibular fixation on the treatment outcome of patients with tibial fractures.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have suggested concurrent fibular fixation and reported some beneficial effects of fibular fixation in same level combined tibial and fibular fractures. One study reported that fibular fixation would preserve reduction of tibia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Other studies showed that fibular plate fixation increased the initial rotational stability after distal tibial fracture in comparison with patients that had tibial intramedullary nailing alone.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Others reported more complications in fibula distal fractures without fibular additional plating compare to fibular additional plating and recommended fibular fixation in combined tibial and fibular fractures.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In agreement with some studies, results of the present research did not show any significant difference in treatment outcomes between groups with or without fibular fixation and we did not found any beneficial effect of fibular fixation. But some studies have different results than our results and reported advantages or disadvantages of fibular fixation in the treatment outcomes. The difference among these results and our results could be explained by the difference in the design of the studies, the difference in surgery procedure and the duration of follow-up.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the small number of samples especially after losses of 11 patients in both groups during the follow-up period. Another limitation is that surgeries were done by different surgeons. Additionally, we did not perform any bone density measurements in the participant and this factor may be introducing a bias in patient selection.</p><p>In conclusion, according to the results of the present study, there was no any advantage of the fixation of fibula fracture associated to distal of tibia fracture. And also it did not show an increase in the frequency of complications after fibula open reduction and internal fixation. However, future studies with appropriate sample size are recommended to further our understanding of this effect.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
