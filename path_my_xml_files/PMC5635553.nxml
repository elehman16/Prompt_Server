The results of an investigation in the United States revealed that 48.8% of men and 48.4% of women reported that they had been victims of emotional abuse or psychological aggression during their lives.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Emotional abuse was the most common type of intimate partner violence among Korean-American women in all age groups.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Studies of emotional spousal abuse among the elderly couples in Iran are rare, but the findings of an investigation on spousal abuse among 1000 married women aged 18-45 years in Tehran revealed that 89.7% of these women experienced emotional spousal abuse without complaints.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Findings of an investigation in six health care centers in Tehran city found that 41.75% of the 384 married women studied had experienced spousal abuse, the most frequent types of which were huffing, ignoring humiliating, blaming, and insulting.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite the considerable growth in Iran&#x02019;s elderly population,<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> spousal abuses in this social group have not received enough attention. Therefore, the globally rapid rise in the aging population and greater vulnerability of older people <sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> necessitate researches to be conducted on spousal abuse among the elderly couples.
</p><p>Physiological changes and longer life expectancies place the elderly couples at particular risk for abuse.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Even in thriving relationships in long-term marriages lasting for several decades, aging people are more at risk and more vulnerable to abuse because of disability and disease.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the last decade, many investigations were carried out on &#x0201c;partner violence&#x0201d; among the elderly women,<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but available studies regarding effective intervention and treatment are limited, while the improvement of effective interventions for the elderly victims of abuse is a strong priority.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> long-term marriages, the elderly, both the abused and abuser, are ashamed of their abusive behavior and try to hide it from investigators. A potent mix of guilt, fear, and dependence upon a spouse often prevents a domestic violence victim from seeking help, even though they really need it.
</p><p>Long-term domestic aggression negatively effects the quality of life and health of its victims and leads to increased utilization of health services,<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which raises the costs for the society.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The annual healthcare costs of women abused by their intimate partners are about 92% more than men in general.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Some studies revealed that the elderly abused women reported considerably more health problems such as digestive problems, bone and joint pain, and hypertension than those who were not abused.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A negative relationship was reported between the prevalence of spousal abuse and psychological well-being among the women of Jordan.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The results of an investigation revealed that the victims of intimate partner abuse complained of different physical and mental health problems such as chronic pain, headache, irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Health care professionals have a main role in detecting and recognizing the elderly abuse; undoubtedly increasing recognition and proper early intervention by health care professionals for spousal abuse will improve the health, quality of life,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and marital satisfaction of many elderly couples who suffer from abuse.
</p><p>Marital relationship is in every society and is well-known as one of the most important resources in human relationships.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Married women and men are often healthier, happier, and report higher well-being and are less stressed than their unmarried counterparts.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The quality of marital relationship can be measured by pleasure, happiness, affection, tenderness, love, intimacy, hearty communication, and marital satisfaction and is related with the level of these individualities.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The results of an investigation in Iran revealed that emotional wellbeing of the couple was strongly affected by the high quality of marital relationship.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Previous studies revealed that marital satisfaction is linked to the partner&#x02019;s emotional understanding, emotional support, conflict resolution, and solving problem.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> But it is still unclear whether Emotional Abuse Behaviors (EAB) and marital satisfaction among the married elderly couples might be affected by an emotional focused intervention. Therefore, due to the lack of emotional focused intervention for the treatment of the elderly couples, this study aimed to examine the effects of an emotion-focused psycho-educational intervention on emotionally abusive behaviors and marital satisfaction among the married elderly couples who suffer from frequent emotionally abusive behaviors.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="MATERIALS AND METHODS" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized, controlled trial with pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up was conducted during September 2013-2014 in Shiraz- Iran, on 57 elderly couples (114 participants). The sample size was determined by G power, with an assumption effect size of 0.40 and power of 0.80; finally, a minimum of 52 applicants were determined. To account for dropout, 58 applicants were needed, but the focus of this study was on couples due to the type and nature of treatment that has been chosen for couple therapy; therefore, 58 couples=116 participants were recruited and assigned by block randomization in the two groups (Experimental=29 couples), (and Control=29 couples).
</p><p>For sampling, at first, the elderly couples were invited to join a program for an emotionally intimate relationship which was advertised and announced on
bulletin boards in the elderly day clinic centers and all primary health care centers affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences for 3 months.
This announcement informed the couples of some of the inclusion and exclusion criteria which were as follows: couples must be aged 60 years or older
and have had emotional difficulties in their intimate relationship for more than 6 months, both partners must register, the marriage must have lasted
at least 5 years, the couple must live together, both partners must be able to participate in an interventional group, and they must sign a consent form.
Couples were excluded if they had a history of a major psychiatric disorder (such as schizophrenia, dementia, or depression) or a history of current drug
or alcohol abuse, use of antidepressant, anti-anxiety, or narcotic drugs, if they were currently enrolled in any other psychological treatment program,
if one member of the couple had difficulty with Activity Daily Livings (ADLs) and was dependent upon his/her spouse for performing daily activities,
or if the couples experienced abuse (physical, financial, sexual) other than emotional as identified by the Abusive Behavior Inventory introduced by
Sheperd and Campbell in 1992.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Data at time 1 were collected before the intervention by means of
a demographic characteristics form, the Multidimensional Measure of Emotional Abuse Questionnaire (MMEAQ), and the Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire
for Older People (MSQFOP). Participants who were unable to complete these tools on their own were assisted by a trained nurse who was blind to the
intervention and who asked the participants some questions and recorded their answers. Then, block randomization was performed to achieve a random
equal allocation into the two study groups. Fifty-seven couples were randomly assigned in the experimental (29 couples), and control groups
(28 couples).The couples in the experimental group were then randomly divided into 7 small groups (6 groups with 4 couples and one group with 5 couples).
An emotion-focused psycho-educational intervention was carried out for all couples in the experimental group; one session of preparation and a total
of eight 90-minute sessions were held twice a week for 4 weeks. The control group received no intervention and was put on a waiting list. Finally,
data were collected from both groups using the MMEAQ and the MSQFOP immediately after the intervention in week 5 (Time 2) and three months after the
intervention in week 16 (Time 3). Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 19, and P&#x02264;0.05 was considered as significant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="IJCBNM-5-329-g001.tif">Figure 1</xref> illustrates

Abusive Behavior Inventory was applied to detect the couples who suffered from only emotional abuse, and excluded those couples experiencing other types or mixed types of abuse. This 30-item tool was made to measure different types of abuse; the psychological subscale includes 17 items. The acceptable validity and reliability (alpha coefficients=0.7 to 0.92) was reported by Shepard, and Campbell (1992) in four groups of abuser, abused, non-abuser, and non-abused people.27 These two questionnaires were applied only one time before the intervention.
</p><p>The frequency and different types of emotionally abusive behaviors were measured using the MMEAQ. This 28-item questionnaire was made by Murphy and Hoover in 1999. Items were scored 0 (this has never happened), 1 (once), 2 (twice), 3 (3-5 times), 4 (6-10 times), 5 (11-20 times), and 6 (more than 20 times). Higher scores showed a higher level of emotional abuse. Moreover, each item of the questionnaire had two parts: the abusive behavior was exhibited by the applicant, and the abusive behavior was exhibited by the applicant&#x02019;s partner. In the current article, only the first part of the data (self-evaluation of abuse) is reported; the second part (partner evaluation) will be discussed in a future article. Marital satisfaction was measured using the MSQFOP developed by Haynes et al., 1992.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The 24 items could regularly be answered in 6-8 min. It is noteworthy that the MSQFOP was designed as a marital satisfaction questionnaire principally proper for older people. However, whether or not the MSQFOP is a more sensitive, reliable, and valid instrument than others currently available ones was not examined. 
</p><p>This study employed the MMEAQ and MSQFOP instruments for the first time ever in Iran. Therefore, the Persian versions of these instruments were checked for validity and reliability among the Iranian elderly. A pilot study was conducted on a sample of 30 elderly people to identify the internal consistency, appropriateness, feasibility, and stability of the instruments.
</p><p>Different domains in the questionnaires were evaluated for internal consistency by using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficients for the Persian versions of MMEAQ and MSQFOP were 0.80 and 0.96, respectively; therefore, the instruments were easily comprehended by the Iranian elderly people who participated in the pilot study. Moreover, an expert panel review was performed to evaluate the content validity. A panel of five expert analysts examined all the items of the questionnaires to detect whether each item was completely relevant (100%) (4), fairly relevant (75%) (3), less relevant (50%) (2), or insufficiently relevant (25%) (1). The results illustrated an acceptable validity (CVI=92.19) for these instruments.

The results revealed that in 58 couples (68.9%), both husbands and wives reported experiencing EAB (at least one EAB four times or more in their relationships with their spouses 6 months prior to the study). Twenty-five (31.1%) couples reported mixed types of abuse; they were excluded from the study and referred to a psychologist or family therapist. One couple was excluded from the study due to personal problems.

The results of testing before the intervention revealed that 58 (68.9%) out of the 83 couples registered to participate in the study reported that both husbands and wives experienced EAB. This illustrates the reciprocity of the spousal emotional abuse in long-term marriages. Similarly, a strong relationship was reported between female and male victimization, signifying the reciprocity of aggressive behavior in the couples.31 The former research indicated that partner violence and aggression are not a merely male phenomenon and are often reciprocal in couples.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The most common type of violence in intimate relationships is bidirectional spousal violence;<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> therefore, it is essential to consider the dyadic mechanisms of taking violent relationships into account with both husbands and wives when evaluating the emotional relationships between couples. 
</p><p>In the current study, no significant correlation was found between age, income, and education level, duration of marriage and EAB and MS. These results may be related to life expectancy, which is completely different between young and elderly couples. In an investigation on 300 married Iranian females between 25-34 years of age, a significant relationship was found between the husband&#x02019;s income and his emotional violence.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> No significant association was found between those who experienced childhood abuse or those who witnessed abuse by parents and EAB. This result may lie in the fact that the older couples participating in the study were asked whether they had experienced child abuse or witnessed as a child abuse by parents. The majority of them answered &#x0201c;No&#x0201d; to questions. It is believed that the real rate may be higher. Some studies indicated that adult survivors of child abuse do not actually view themselves as abused individuals; they minimize their perception of emotional or psychological abuse.<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>To examine the effects of Emotional Focused Intervention on the elderly couples with experience of emotionally abusive behaviors, it was not initially clear to what extent changes in emotional abuse would be formed, because there were some negative beliefs such as &#x0201c;changing the way elders think is impossible after 40 years,&#x0201d; and some expressions of disappointment such as &#x0201c;after 40 years of marriage, how can life change now?&#x0201d; Despite these superstitions, the findings were really surprising. It was revealed that the husbands&#x02019; and wives&#x02019; EAB significantly decreased at T2 and T3 compared with T1.Changes in EAB means after the intervention were greater among women than men due of the greater mean difference and effect size. In the control group, as well, a significant decrease in the wives&#x02019; EAB was found between T1 and T3 with a small mean difference and effect size. Although this change was very small, it should be interpreted with caution and considered in further research. The most probable explanation for this result is that the follow-up intervention took place in the month of Ramadan, the best month in the Islamic calendar. Emotionally abusive behaviors associated with violence, insults, threats, humiliation, and blame are condemned in Islam and the Holy Quran. Ramadan is the fasting month for Muslims, and fasting involves not only abstinence from eating and drinking (fasting for the body), but also from insults, threats, humiliation, blame, and ridicule (fasting for the soul). There is much evidence to confirm that the rates of crime and abuse behaviors significantly decrease during the month of Ramadan.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Overall, the findings of the current study demonstrated that EAB significantly decreased after the intervention (T2, and T3) in the experimental group. Similarly, in an investigation, treatment outcomes of the couples&#x02019; group psycho-educational intervention were evaluated for 80 married distressed couples under 4 different conditions. The results revealed that friendship problems and destructive conflict significantly decreased, and marital satisfaction significantly increased under combined conditions at the one-year follow-up.<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>The effects of the intervention on marital satisfaction revealed that the MS of both husbands and wives improved significantly three months after the intervention with a moderate effect size. However, husbands&#x02019; MS showed no significant change immediately after the intervention at T2. These values for the control group were not significant. In the same vein, the results of an investigation revealed that marital adjustment significantly enhanced by EFT.<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> A recent study in Iran revealed that marital conflicts of couples who received 9 sessions of EFT significantly decreased compared with the control group.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Although these studies were carried out on young or middle-aged couples, the current study also revealed a significant improvement in marital satisfaction in response to a significant decrease in EAB three months after the intervention. Johnson in an investigation on172 young couples revealed that lower levels of marital satisfaction were associated with higher levels of anger, contempt, and sadness.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The results of the current study revealed that emotionally abusive behaviors significantly decreased in both husbands and wives after EFPEI. It seems that any decline in abusive behaviors such as contempt, hostility, intimidation, and humiliation led to improved marital satisfaction. The results of an investigation also revealed that negative verbal communication can indicate the worsening of relationship satisfaction, typically when there is a lack of positive effect on the couple.<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The results of the current study also showed a strong correlation between the husbands&#x02019; and wives&#x02019; emotionally abusive behaviors in older adults. There is no well-known mechanism to explain this relationship in emotional abuse; one possible clarification may be found in the theory of emotional contagion. This theory postulates that emotions are easily transferred to another person when two individuals are in an intimate interpersonal relationship.<sup><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Therefore, one partner&#x02019;s negative feeling significantly affects the marital relationship and predicts his or her spouse&#x02019;s marital adjustment.<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> These results confirm our findings that marital satisfaction will be improved by decreasing EAB. 
</p><p>The strength of this study was using block randomization to make an equal opportunity for all participants to share their experience of abusive relationship and prevent the bias selection. Moreover, the emotional focused psycho-educational intervention, which was applied in this study, was based on a strong theoretical framework. It was an effort to fill a gap in the present literature related to emotional focused interventions for older couples. Furthermore, active engagement of couples (both husbands and wives) in emotional focused intervention increases the possibility that intervention will be linked to the attachment needs of couples. Also, collaboration between clinician and professional nurses in community health, and geriatrics nurses who were expert in family counseling, and couple therapy in daily clinic centers for older people provided important information for screening and treating the older couples with abusive relationship. 
</p><p>There were also some limitations in this study. First, the couples who participated in this study were volunteers; therefore, they may not be representative of the general population in quest of help for treatment of emotional abuse relationship. The coincidence of Ramadan as a month of follow-up was the second limitation of this study, so the findings should be interpreted with caution and considered in further research.
</p></sec><sec sec-type="CONCLUSION" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In conclusion, health care professionals can play a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of older couples who suffer from emotional abuse behaviors. EFPEI based on EFT-C is a proper treatment for decreasing emotional abuse behaviors and improving marital satisfaction among the married elderly couples. Moreover, for treatment of emotional abuse behaviors among the couples it is important that both husband and wife should be considered.
