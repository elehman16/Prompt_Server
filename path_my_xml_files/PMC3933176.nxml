The primary endpoint was combined clinical and endoscopic remission, defined as UC Disease Activity Index score &#x02264;1 with a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and stool frequency, no mucosal friability on colonoscopy, and a &#x02265;1-point reduction in endoscopic index score from baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>410 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Combined clinical and endoscopic remission rates with budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg or 6&#x02005;mg, Entocort EC and placebo were 17.4%, 8.3%, 12.6% and 4.5%, respectively. The difference between budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg and placebo was significant (OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.47 to 13.72; p=0.0047). Budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg was associated with numerically higher rates of clinical (42.2% vs 33.7%) and endoscopic improvement (42.2% vs 31.5%) versus placebo. The rate of histological healing (16.5% vs 6.7%; p=0.0361) and proportion of patients with symptom resolution (23.9% vs 11.2%; p=0.0220) were significantly higher for budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg than placebo.

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation guidelines recommend that active, mild-to-moderate UC should initially be treated with oral mesalazine &#x0003e;2&#x02005;g/day, with systemic corticosteroids reserved for patients with symptoms of active colitis whose disease does not respond to mesalazine.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Oral budesonide is a topically acting corticosteroid with low bioavailability and few systemic side effects. Budesonide's safety and efficacy profiles are well characterised in the treatment of several inflammatory conditions, from asthma and allergies to inflammatory bowel disease.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> The local activity of budesonide in the colonic mucosa is the key to efficacy. Current oral formulations of budesonide, such as Budenofalk and Entocort EC, release the drug only in the distal ileum and proximal colon<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and so are not optimally designed for the anatomical distribution of UC. The pH-dependent release of these formulations means that there is no effective rate-controlling mechanism to ensure extended release of the drug along the entire length of the colon. In a recent study, oral pH-modified release budesonide was significantly less effective than mesalazine for inducing clinical remission in active UC (risk ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91), which may be due to unreliable colonic release in patients with altered intestinal pH.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>To improve the release of budesonide, it can be coupled with a colonic release system (MMX Multi-Matrix System) that provides targeted drug delivery to the entire colon, as supported by scintigraphic data.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This technology has already been used successfully with oral mesalazine (mesalazine MMX).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> The goal of budesonide MMX treatment is to maintain the efficacy of corticosteroids while minimising systemic side effects. Preliminary data in patients with left-sided UC showed that 47.1% of patients treated with budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg once daily achieved clinical improvement (clinical remission, defined as a Rachmilewitz Clinical Activity Index (CAI) score of &#x02264;4, or a &#x02265;50% reduction in CAI score from baseline) at 4&#x02005;weeks, compared with 33.3% of those treated with placebo, suggesting that this formulation might be a viable new treatment option.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The objective of this phase III CORE (Colonic Release budesonide) study was to investigate the efficacy of once-daily budesonide MMX for the induction of combined clinical and endoscopic remission in patients with active, mild-to-moderate UC compared with placebo. A non-powered, internal reference arm of oral budesonide controlled ileal-release capsules (Entocort EC) was included as an active control to conform with regulatory requirements. Because the clinical trial was conducted in 15 countries in the European Union (EU) and outside the EU, ileal-release budesonide was chosen due to its presence in each market which was essential to gain approval to conduct the study from local agencies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Men and women aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years with UC for &#x02265;6&#x02005;months, diagnosed according to international criteria,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> were eligible to participate if they had active, mild-to-moderate disease, defined as a UC Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) score of &#x02265;4 and &#x02264;10.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

Investigators were instructed to obtain three biopsies from the most severely affected areas following examination of each segment of the colonic mucosa. Histological confirmation was obtained via a central histopathologist in an independent lab with examinations performed in batches to maintain homogeneity and blinded conditions while preserving the trial from any possible bias. Concomitant UC medications were not allowed; for patients receiving oral 5-ASA at the screening visit, oral 5-ASA medication was required to be washed out &#x02265;2&#x02005;days and rectal ASAs had a 4-week washout prior to randomisation.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they had infection (defined as the presence of any enteric pathogens (eg, <italic>Shigella</italic> spp, <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp, <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp, ova and parasites) or <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxins A or B) or limited proctitis (UC limited to the rectum &#x02264;15&#x02005;cm above the dentate line); or if they had used oral or rectal steroids in the last 4&#x02005;weeks, immunosuppressive agents in the last 8&#x02005;weeks or anti-tumour necrosis factor agents in the last 3&#x02005;months.

Randomisation was conducted centrally via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Study medication was taken after breakfast every day; each patient took one tablet and three capsules per day of active or placebo study medication according to the randomisation schedule. To maintain blinding, a double-dummy technique, with placebo tablets of budesonide MMX and placebo over-encapsulated Entocort EC, was used. Scheduled full assessment visits were undertaken at screening and at week 8 (day 56, &#x000b1;2&#x02005;days) with intermediate control assessment of clinical conditions at randomisation (day 1), and at weeks 2 and 4.

A hierarchical testing procedure was used for the analyses of primary and secondary endpoints at the &#x003b1;=0.025 level of significance. If at least one primary endpoint comparison was statistically significant, then both dosage strengths were compared with placebo with respect to the first secondary endpoint (clinical improvement). If at least one secondary endpoint comparison for clinical improvement was statistically significant according to the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, then both dosage strengths were compared with placebo with respect to the second secondary endpoint (endoscopic improvement). For other endpoints (histological healing and symptom resolution) and all analyses of Entocort versus placebo (all endpoints), an exploratory two-sided significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 was applied. In the subgroup analyses, the effect of demographic variables on the primary endpoint were investigated using the Cochran Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test at a two-sided significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.

Budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg provided a statistically significant increase in the stringently defined combined clinical and endoscopic remission rate compared with placebo (17.4% vs 4.5%; p=0.0047). Furthermore, budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg improved the rates of histological healing and symptom resolution compared with placebo. The notable features of this trial are its stringent definition of remission, the decision to analyse efficacy only in patients with objective, histological evidence of active inflammation at baseline, and the use of full colonoscopy (rather than flexible sigmoidoscopy) for endoscopic assessment.</p><p>The absolute clinical and endoscopic remission rates seen in this study are lower than the remission rates reported in several recent UC trials.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There are a number of potential reasons for these differences, which relate primarily to the study endpoints and inclusion/evaluation criteria used. A key factor is the criteria used to define remission.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The current study set a high goal: a total UCDAI score of &#x02264;1 with normal stool frequency and no rectal bleeding, together with a &#x02265;1-point reduction in baseline EI score and no mucosal friability on complete colonoscopy. This definition was chosen partly to minimise the placebo response, but also to have an outcome that was clinically relevant. Patients can detect a noticeable benefit from treatment when their symptoms, such as rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency, are alleviated. Additionally, endoscopic improvements, particularly mucosal healing, may be an important indicator of longer-term outcomes, such as the likelihood of colectomy over the following year.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In their study comparing Budenofalk with Salofalk, Gross <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> defined remission as a Rachmilewitz CAI score of &#x02264;4, which might mean anything up to a score of 2 for stool frequency (defined as 30&#x02013;60 bowel actions/week) and 2 for rectal bleeding (defined as a little blood). The mesalazine MMX studies<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> used similar UCDAI criteria to our study, but employed a less thorough method (flexible sigmoidoscopy) for endoscopic evaluation. The entry criteria were also different from those used in the current study, particularly those relating to disease characteristics (newly diagnosed patients and patients with established disease were recruited, but only those with a current flare duration &#x02264;6&#x02005;weeks), relapse history (patients relapsing on maintenance mesalazine &#x0003e;2.0&#x02005;g/day and those relapsing within 2&#x02005;weeks of a dose reduction from &#x0003e;2.0 to &#x02264;2.0&#x02005;g/day were not eligible), and prior treatment response (patients with unsuccessful treatment of their current flare with steroids or mesalazine &#x0003e;2.0&#x02005;g/day were not eligible). These factors, combined with the less rigorous endoscopy and inclusion of patients with normal baseline histology in the efficacy analyses, would very likely have contributed to the higher remission rates across all treatment groups in the mesalazine MMX studies.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> If ORs for the benefit of treatment over placebo on remission rates are compared, however, budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg (OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.47 to 13.72) compares favourably with mesalazine MMX 4.8&#x02005;g (OR 2.78; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.06),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and also with mesalazine 4&#x02005;g (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.05 to 6.25)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and adalimumab 160/80 (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.03 to 3.58).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This highlights the importance of considering relative efficacy. The overall remission rates for placebo versus active drug in these three studies, albeit representing slightly different patient populations, were 12.9% vs 34.1%, 12.2% vs 26.3%, and 9.4% vs 16.5%, respectively.</p><p>Budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg increased clinical improvement and endoscopic improvement rates compared with placebo, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, histological healing (which appears to predict long-lasting remission) and symptom resolution (perceived improvement by patients) were statistically superior in the budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg group compared with the placebo group. The efficacy of budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg and 6&#x02005;mg versus placebo has also been studied in an almost identically designed, 8-week phase III study (CORE I) conducted in the USA, Canada, Mexico and India that used a non-powered control arm.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The CORE I study results were very similar to those obtained in the current study, showing that budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg was effective at inducing remission in active, mild-to-moderate UC. The rates of combined clinical and endoscopic remission at week 8 with budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg and placebo were 17.9%, and 7.4%, respectively (p=0.0143). As in the present study, budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg was also associated with significantly higher rates of symptom resolution than placebo at week 8 (28.5% vs 16.5%, respectively; p=0.0258).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The consistent rates of remission and symptom resolution between these two studies further support the efficacy of budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg in patients with active, mild-to-moderate UC.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was the high number of patients recruited and subsequently excluded from the efficacy analyses due to violations in GCP or lack of active UC on histological analysis. Although lack of active UC on histological analysis should, ideally, have been a prospective exclusion criterion, histology could only be assessed practically after study initiation due to the lengthy time required for central analysis. Objective assessment of active disease was, nonetheless, considered essential, as anti-inflammatory agents cannot reasonably be expected to work in the absence of inflammation. In our study, 15.1% of patients (77/511) with apparent clinical and endoscopic evidence of active disease did not, in fact, have histological evidence of active inflammation. When patients from sites with major GCP violations were removed from the analysis, 9.2% (47/511) of patients did not have active disease. These numbers are slightly higher than the CORE I study with budesonide MMX, which had a relatively low percentage (3.3% (17/510)) of patients without active disease. It is important to note that the CORE I and CORE II studies, though similar in design, were conducted in two mutually exclusive regions and using two separate central laboratories for histology. Typical clinical trials in UC have reported higher normal histology numbers than those reported above. As an example, a recent post hoc analysis of an induction-of-remission trial of mesalazine granules (Apriso) in UC showed that 13.7% of patients (52/380) had no objective histological evidence of active inflammation at baseline despite the presence of clinically and endoscopically active disease.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Central reading of video endoscopies in near-real time, using a validated scoring instrument,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> may be a more practical approach to independent confirmation of disease activity for such patients. The number of GCP violations was also a concern, but they were restricted to four sites: all patients from these sites were excluded from the efficacy (but not safety) analyses. It should be noted that a substantial number of the patients who did not have evidence of active disease on histology at baseline were recruited at these sites. Reassuringly, the sensitivity analysis in which all the patients who were randomised and dosed (ie, the conventional intention-to-treat population) were analysed (with patients excluded from the mITT population set to non-responder imputation) still showed a highly significant effect of budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg versus placebo on combined clinical and endoscopic remission rates (15.1% vs 3.1%, respectively, p=0.0008).</p><p>Overall, budesonide coupled to the MMX colonic release system was well tolerated and raised no new safety concerns, with an AE profile not clinically different to placebo. Reductions in morning plasma cortisol levels occurred at a higher frequency in both budesonide MMX groups and the Entocort EC group, which is an expected consequence of any oral steroid treatment. However, mean morning plasma cortisol levels remained within the normal range at all times, and a subsequent extended maintenance treatment study with budesonide MMX 6&#x02005;mg over 12&#x02005;months showed no further decline.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> There were also no notable increases in glucocorticosteroid-related side effects with budesonide MMX compared with placebo. These data support the hypothesis that low bioavailability and targeted delivery of budesonide limits side effects. The CORE I and II<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> studies were designed only to evaluate short-term efficacy (8&#x02005;weeks) and not maintenance therapy. Since steroids have not to date been shown to prevent relapse in UC, conventional maintenance therapy after a clinical response to budesonide MMX with 5-ASA or thiopurines can be expected to be standard practice. There will be some patients who have mild but persistently active disease and for these patients budesonide MMX might reasonably be continued for longer than 8&#x02005;weeks on an individual basis, but this is not supported by the current data and needs more study.</p><p>In conclusion, budesonide MMX 9&#x02005;mg daily was safe and effective for the induction of remission of active, mild-to-moderate UC. The data also highlight the value of using robust endpoints and the importance of ensuring histological evidence of active disease prior to initiating studies of anti-inflammatory agents. Colonic-release budesonide may therefore be an alternative to conventional corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of active, mild-to-moderate UC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the principal investigators in this study: G Acute, O Antipova, N Arebi, O Arutyunov, Y Avni, A Bazlevych, I Beales, R Befrits, T Borody, Y Bouhnik, I Bunganic, R Cannizzaro, S Cernok, I Chopey, I Ciecko-Michalska, D Dobru, JL Dupas, A Eriksson, A Fich, A Fraticiu, A Goldis, B Golovenko, M Gregus, L Grinevitch, H Herterveig, M Horynski, M Huorka, L Jonaitis, E Kazenaite, A Keegan, A Khrustalev, G Kiudelis, A Kratky, L Kuzela, M Lemann, A Lenghel, LV Lenskaya, R Leong, J Lind, R Lofberg, L Lukac, F Luzza, A Maelt, B Margus, S Minushkin, Y Niv, C Nwokolo, A Oseshnyuk, P Oset, MF Osipenko, M Parkes, S Peralta, R Petryka, E Pirogova, C Prantera, J Romatowski, R Salupere, J Satsangi, V Savarino, A Shvarts, V Simanenkov, H Soloviev, B Starostin, Y Stepanov, GC Sturniolo, Z Telyatnikova, M Tkachenko, A Tkachev, I Tolmanis, N Tryschuk, R Vanagaitiene, R Vasyl, M Vecchi, R Voiosu, Y Volkov, EP Yakovenko, I Yurkov, M Zoli.
