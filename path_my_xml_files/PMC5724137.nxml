It consists of clinicians eliciting and understanding their patients&#x02019; perspectives and social contexts, reaching a shared understanding and empowering patients by offering meaningful involvement in treatments decisions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>One approach to promote patient-centred communication is to provide mechanisms to involve and support active participation in consultations, by encouraging patients to ask questions. Asking questions can be considered a first index of active participation in the discussion and an expression, at the same time, of a patient&#x02019;s most immediate information needs.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> Asking questions can lead to positive benefits for cancer patients, including greater satisfaction and better treatment adherence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p><p>Two main techniques have been tested in the oncology setting to promote question asking. First, Question Listing (QL), before the visit with their oncologist, patients have been encouraged to generate their own list of questions<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> about their cancer and treatment options through a coaching process with an independent assistant.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> A consultation plan is then generated and given to the patient and the oncologist to be used as a visual aid during the consultation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Second a Question Prompt Sheet QPS), before a consultation with their oncologist, patients have been provided with a pre-prepared list of evidence based questions, a QPS that prompt patients to consider novel topics before they see their oncologist and serves to remind patients to raise these questions with their oncologist during their consultation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> In the oncology setting, using the QPS coupled with oncologist endorsement of question asking, had shown that: (a) patients were encouraged to ask more questions, in particular about sensitive and difficult topics such as prognosis, diagnosis, and issues surrounding end of life care<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17 18</xref>; (b) the quality of the information exchanged between the physicians and patients had been increased,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 15&#x02013;17</xref> and (c) patient outcomes had been improved (eg, enhanced information recall and reduced level of anxiety during the consultation).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17 18 20 21</xref></p><p>In this Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) we assessed whether there was a difference in the efficacy of a Question Prompt Sheet (QPS) versus a Question Listing (QL) method to increase the number of questions that breast cancer patients with early stage disease asked during their initial encounter with an oncologist. We also assessed the differential impact of each method on patient outcomes. This study is innovative in three ways. First, this study compared the efficacy of the two interventions with each other while previous studies have compared either the QPS or QL, with a standard of care control group, which risks overestimating the real effect of the intervention.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13 15&#x02013;19</xref> Second, moreover, the oncologists in this study were blind to their patients&#x02019; treatment group allocation. In order to achieve this, both the completed QPS and QL were collected just before the patient visit. This approach enabled the evaluation of the real power of the interventions and guarded against the potential for Hawthorne effects.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Third, patients in the QL group in this study generated their questions alone without coaching or other assistance.</p><p>The QPS is a more structured intervention in that patients receive many previously prepared, evidence based questions in several topic areas that can be selected and asked during the consultation. On the other hand, the QL intervention requires greater patient effort as patients must generate their own question and, in the process, they may focus on a limited range of their most immediate information needs. For this reason we hypothesised that the use of the QPS, prior to an oncology consultation, could further increase the number of questions asked in general and by specific topic areas (eg, prognosis) compared with the use of the QL. We also hypothesised that the use of the QPS would result in; a) greater patient satisfaction about the information, b) greater patient satisfaction with the treatment decision and c) less patient anxiety after the consultation compared with the use of the QL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a multi-centred randomised controlled trial in which patients were randomised to the QPS or QL in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization sequences were generated off-site and stratified by centre by the study statistician (MAM). These sequences remained unknown to the research assistants involved in the data collection phase. Both the randomization procedure and the treatment allocation techniques were developed to fully conceal the allocation from the research assistants, patients and oncologists. First, patients were given the intervention, either the QPS or QL, in a sealed envelope. Once the QPS or QL were completed they were placed into the same envelope, resealed and delivered back to the research assistant (RA). Second, patients were unaware of the detailed contents of the treatment that they <underline>did not</underline> receive, thus patients allocated to the QPS did not know the content of the QL intervention. Third, Oncologists did not know what type of intervention had been completed by the patients before the visit.</p><p>The study followed CONSORT guidelines<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Trust of Verona and by the Provincial Ethics Committee of Brescia.

Eligible patients were approached in the clinic waiting room by the oncology nurse who described the study goals and elicited the patient&#x02019;s interest in participating. Interested patients were accompanied to a dedicated room and were given detailed information by the research assistant. Willing patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study including consultation audio recording. Patients were then randomised to one of the two intervention groups within each centre.</p><p>Group 1 &#x02013; Question Prompt Sheet (QPS) &#x02013; Patients were provided with a Question Prompt Sheet.</p><p>Group 2 &#x02013; Self generated Question List (QL) &#x02013; Patients were provided with a blank lined form to write their own questions.</p><p>Patients completed the QPS or the QL in the clinic room in privacy prior to their appointment with their oncologist. They were not given a time limit to complete either intervention.</p><p>Recruitment was conducted between June 2011 and May 2013.</p><p>Socio-demographic data, such as age, marital status, education and employment were collected before the randomization along with pre-consultation levels of anxiety. All consultations were audio-recorded to allow an analysis of the consultation length and of the number of questions asked by the patient. Immediately following the consultation patients completed three questionnaires that measured post consultation levels of anxiety, satisfaction with information and satisfaction with the decision.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Question counting</title><p>Patients&#x02019; questions were defined as &#x02018;utterances in interrogative form that ask for information or clarification&#x02019;.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Six categories were identified, five derived from those described in the literature<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 15</xref> (symptoms, aetiology, prognosis, prevention and illness management), and one specifically added (administrative questions). A code-book was developed that provided definitions, examples and decision rules to guide question classification, by each category. Inter-rater reliability was calculated among the three coders was calculated based on ten consultations. Three coders were utilised due to volume of transcripts generated by the study requirements. The results revealed an average percent agreement of 62.9% and an acceptable Cohen&#x02019;s kappa of 0.49.</p><p>Subsequently, all interviews were equally distributed among the three coders who listened to the audiotapes, identified all direct patients&#x02019; questions, transcribed them verbatim and categorised them using the categories previously identified.</p><p>The primary outcome was the total number of questions asked and the number of questions within each of these content categories.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Materials</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Question Prompt Sheet (QPS)</title><p>The QPS is a structured list of 50 evidence-based questions that patients commonly want to ask their oncologist.

component of patient centred communication during physician &#x02013; patient consultations. Our knowledge of optimal methods to promote question asking is evolving. It is important to compare the efficacy of methods of promoting question asking and the utility of different methods to improve patient outcomes.</p><p>In this RCT we hypothesised that patients who had selected their question from an evidence based set of questions, available on the QPS, would ask a greater number of questions than patients who self-generated their own list of questions on the QL. After taking into account consultation length and the presence of companion as confounders, we observed no statistical difference in question asking between the two groups. Also regarding the question topics, there were no statistical differences. However patients who utilised the QPS stated that they had been less able to ask questions they had previously selected, and were less satisfied with the information they received, even though they had no more additional questions they want to ask when compared with the QL group. No differences between groups were found regarding the level of satisfaction with decision and the level of anxiety.</p><p>Previous studies in the field<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13 15&#x02013;19</xref> showed that, compared with a standard care control group, the use of either a Question Prompt Sheet or Question Listing improved question asking.</p><p>Counter to our hypothesis it is noteworthy that the use of the QPS and the use of the QL resulted an equal number of overall questions asked. This suggests that both our interventions, administered without a coaching session and not brought into the consultation, are equally important to prepare patients to ask questions during their consultation. Providing space before the consultation can help patients to focus on their own information needs and think about what they want to ask their doctor.</p><p>In our sample, the QPS might have reduced the number of questions compared with QL by encouraging patients to ask more focused and precise questions. This assumption can be supported by the results from a previous observational study<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> conducted by our group in the same context (ie, with patients recruited with the same procedure and with the same clinical and socio-demographic characteristics), showing that patients without question asking interventions prior to the consultation ask a mean of 18 questions (slightly more than 13 questions in this sample). This observation highlights the importance of question phrasing as important to promote salient question asking.</p><p>Our finding although not significant, that patients in the QL group asked more question than those in the QPS group was counter-intuitive. It may be that the number of questions asked could be mediated by the patient&#x02019;s recall ability. Thus, patients who self-generate question using the QL may produce fewer questions and the generated questions may be phrased in salient terms that are easier for patients to recall. In the absence of the QPS/QL to take into the consultation, it may be that QPS patients had more difficulty remembering their desired questions than patients in the QL group. This could be supported by the fact that patients in the QL group asked more of the questions that they had previously written (133 out of 293) compared with patients in the QPS group, who asked fewer questions (259 out of 3392). It is possible that patients in the QPS felt somewhat constrained by the questions they had to choose from and therefore asked fewer questions that reflect the priority needs. However, these results should be deeply analysed, taking into consideration the quality of the communication exchange, exploring whether the physician has provided information without the patient&#x02019;s request and how the physician answer the patient.</p><p>Moreover, in the absence of the QPS/QL to take into the consultation, oncologists may have taken the lead in determining the course of the medical consultation, leaving little space for patients to take sufficiently active question asking role in the consultation.</p><p>Our finding that consultation length was a confounder suggests that Italian oncologists utilise the time spent in consultation somewhat differently than oncologists from other Western medical cultures. The average length of Italian consultation in oncology seems to be slightly longer, 49 compared with 30&#x02013;39&#x02009;min reported by other.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17 26</xref> Since the number of questions noted, regardless of intervention groups is quite similar to other studies,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> it may be that Italian oncologists spend more time giving information when answering patient questions. A QPS might be more effective in enhancing recall of information when the provider receives training in how to endorse it and how to encourage patients to ask questions from it.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref></p><p>It has been demonstrated in English speaking countries that a QPS is a useful tool to improve patient&#x02019;s participation during the consultation. However, we contend that consultation communication may vary across cultures and thus there is the need to explore the efficacy of a QPS intervention in Non-English speaking countries to better explore cross-cultural differences.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>We feel this study contributes to move our scientific knowledge forward by increasing our knowledge of cultural influences on question asking and on doctor-patient communication. More research is needed to improve a mutual understanding between countries leading to a more fruitful doctor-patient interaction and implementing a more effective co-operation and integration of healthcare policies.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the interaction between the patient and the oncologist, focusing on the patient alone may not produce short and long-term benefits for patients. It is plausible that oncologists, trained specifically to respond to more active patients, can further enhance patient involvement and lead to a more successful consultation. Recent studies have observed limited skills of the oncologists in shared decision-making claiming for the need of specific training to implement patient involvement in clinical practice.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> There is the need to improve such skills but we need to know the differences between countries to generate a powerful and focused training programme. For this reason future research is warranted to explore cross cultural differences and the role of the oncologists to improve patient involvement.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitation, strengths and future direction</title><p>This study has some limitations to be considered. First of all, in order to ensure that the oncologists were blind to their patient experimental group assignment, we deviated from the accepted intervention process and did not provide copies of the completed QPS or QL for patients to use during their consultation to serve as a reminder to ask questions.</p><p>Furthermore, even if this study compared two active interventions (QPS vs. QL) and ensured participants blinding, the administration of the QL has been done without any previous coaching session as it was in some previous studies. In order to make the two intervention more similar and comparable the QL was manage independently by the patients.</p><p>Of note, our sample was larger than most previous studies in the field<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 16 18 19</xref> and large enough to generalise our results to early stage female breast cancer patients with access to similar health services in Northern Italy. As far as we know, this is also the first study in Italy analysing audiotapes of routine oncological consultations, an approach which has inherent ecological validity and that is a recommended research tool<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 39</xref> which allow future analysis on information exchange.</p></sec><sec id="s4b" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Findings from the present study suggested that QPS have a similar impact on question asking compared with QL, if completed independently by the patients. Both could be useful tools for stimulating patient&#x02019;s participation during the consultation. Maybe the opportunity to rehearse their information needs before the consultation can help patients to better focus on them and to use the time spent during the consultation more efficiently, asking questions to their doctor that are more precise. This should be explored deeply in future studies along with the exploration of which components of the interventions, focused on increasing patient participation, are really useful and efficacious. These interventions are relatively simple and inexpensive to disseminate in routine care with limited disruption to clinic flow.</p><p>Even if we did not found variables associated to question asking, some patients might find the interventions more helpful than others. Further research is also needed to identify those patients to whom intervention are likely to be most beneficial and the role of the oncologist in leading the consultations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e296" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015079.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e297" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015079.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the participation of all patients and the contribution of the medical oncologistsat the Operative Units of the three centres involved, including Annamaria Molino, Elena Fiorio, Veronica Parolin, Michele Pavarana, and Francesca La Russa (Ospedale Civile Maggiore, Verona); Rolando Nortilli, Federica Maspero, Chiara Caliolo, Alessandra Auriemma, Serena Zuliani, Jenni Furlanetto and Francesca Maines (Policlinico G.
