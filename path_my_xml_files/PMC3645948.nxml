Patients were converted to once-daily OROS hydromorphone ER at 75% of the equianalgesic dose of their prior total daily opioid dose (5:1 conversion ratio), and titrated as frequently as every 3 days to a maximum dose of 64 mg/day. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity numeric rating scale; additional assessments included the Patient Global Assessment and the Roland&#x02013;Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. Safety assessments were performed at each visit and consisted of recording and monitoring all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean (standard deviation) final daily dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was 37.5 (17.8) mg. Mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) numeric rating scale scores decreased from 6.6 (0.1) at screening to 4.3 (0.1) at the final titration visit (mean [SEM] change, &#x02212;2.3 [0.1], representing a 34.8% reduction). Mean (SEM) change in Patient Global Assessment was &#x02212;0.6 (0.1), and mean change (SEM) in the Roland&#x02013;Morris Disability Questionnaire was &#x02212;2.8 (0.3).

Morphine conversion tables were used and assumed a morphine equivalent:hydromorphone potency ratio of 5:1. The lowest starting dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was 12 mg/day and the highest was 48 mg/day. OROS hydromorphone ER tablets, titrated to response and tolerability for each individual, were administered orally once daily in total daily doses of 12 mg, 16 mg, 24 mg, 32 mg, 40 mg, 48 mg, or 64 mg.</p><p>Titration was determined by daily pain intensity NRS scores and occurrence of AEs.

Only one dosage adjustment by telephone was allowed between each weekly visit. Decreases in OROS hydromorphone ER dosage were permitted only once, and not to below 12 mg/day. Dosages were not to exceed 64 mg/day during the course of the study. If the mean pain intensity NRS score during the last seven consecutive days (between visits) was &#x02264;4 and the patient met stable dosing criteria within the 4-week timeframe, the patient was entered into the double-blind phase of the study.</p><p>Entry criteria into the double-blind phase included the following: final titrated doses of OROS hydromorphone ER that were &#x02265;12 mg/day and &#x02264;64 mg/day; patients were on the same dose without change for &#x02265;7 consecutive days (stable dose period) and required a mean of &#x02264;2 tablets of rescue medication per day; patients answered &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to the question, &#x0201c;Has this medication helped your pain enough so that you would continue to take the medication?&#x0201d;; and patients were free of adverse effects that were intolerable or that could impact their ability to complete the study. The final visit in the conversion and titration phase was considered the baseline visit of the double-blind phase for patients reaching stable doses and the termination visit for those who did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the change in pain intensity NRS, recorded daily in patients&#x02019; diaries, from baseline to the final visit of the conversion and titration phase. The proportion of patients with 30% and 50% reductions in pain from screening to the final visit were calculated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-jpr-6-319">52</xref> Reduction in pain was calculated as: (reduction in pain intensity from screening to final visit/pain intensity at screening) &#x000d7; 100.</p><p>Additional efficacy assessments included mean changes from baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) scores, providing patients&#x02019; overall impression of the study drug based on a five-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = very good, 3 = good, 4 = fair, 5 = poor), as well as the Roland&#x02013;Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ).

IR hydromorphone tablet strength was determined as between 5% to 15% of an individual patient&#x02019;s daily dose of OROS hydromorphone ER. Rescue medication use was unrestricted for the first 3 days, but was restricted to two tablets per day after day 3. Overuse of rescue medication did not subject patients to discontinuation prior to randomization in the double-blind phase of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Prior opioids were coded using the World Health Organization encoding dictionary, and the numbers and percentages of patients receiving each opioid were summarized. The primary population for the efficacy analyses was the intent-to-treat population. Weekly NRS scores were calculated from daily patient diary entries, and a weekly mean change from baseline was calculated for each patient. For a patient&#x02019;s mean pain score in a given week to be included in the analysis, there had to be at least one daily pain intensity NRS score in the patient&#x02019;s diary for the week. If a patient discontinued due to opioid withdrawal symptoms, the baseline pain intensity NRS score was carried forward to the final visit. For those who discontinued due to an AE, the pain intensity score at screening was carried forward to the final visit. If a patient discontinued due to lack of efficacy or other reasons (eg, administrative, withdrawal of consent), the last observation (mean pain score over the last week in the study), was carried forward to the final visit (last observation carried forward). Descriptive statistics for PGA and RDQ scores are presented by treatment group at each visit, and for changes from baseline at each visit.</p><p>Total scores were calculated for COWS and SOWS by visit. The scales were imputed with the mean of nonmissing items if up to 25% of the items in the scale were missing. Missing items on a scale were imputed using last observation carried forward methodology. The total scores at each visit and change from screening at each visit were summarized using descriptive statistics and stabilized OROS hydromorphone ER dose.</p><p>The mean number of rescue medication tablets used per day was compared for patients reaching stable doses of OROS hydromorphone during conversion and titration and those who discontinued using a <italic>t</italic>-test with unequal variances.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 806 patients screened for study entry, 459 met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled into the conversion and titration phase.

Patients achieving a stable dose also had a mean (SEM) change in RDQ of &#x02212;4.3 (0.3) [from 13.5 (0.3) at screening to 9.3 (0.4) at baseline of the double-blind phase], compared with a mean (SEM) change of &#x02212;0.4 (0.3) for dropouts during titration (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Almost 80% of patients (213/268) achieving a stable dose had a &#x02265;30% reduction in pain, compared with 21.9% (37/179) of dropouts during titration. Among patients achieving a stable dose who had a &#x02265;30% reduction in pain, 64.3% (137/213) were taking &#x02265;32 mg of OROS hydromorphone ER. Approximately 52% of patients achieving a stable dose (140/268) had a &#x02265;50% reduction in pain (among whom 64% [90/140] were taking a dose &#x02265; 32 mg), compared with 7.7% of dropouts during titration (13/179).</p><p>The mean number of rescue medication tablets per day was 2.7 during the first 3 days of conversion and titration, and ,1 tablet per day by the time a stable dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was achieved. The daily mean (SD) number of rescue medication tablets in patients achieving a stable dose and in those discontinuing during titration was 1.5 (0.89) and 2.4 (1.3), respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Opioid withdrawal symptoms</title><p>Mean (SD) COWS decreased from 1.0 (1.9) at visit 1 to 0.7 (1.4) at the final visit. The ability to achieve a stabilized dose or starting doses of OROS hydromorphone ER did not influence the mean change in COWS. Similar to COWS, SOWS decreased in the overall patient population from 7.2 (8.1) to 4.3 (6.1) from visit 1 to the final visit, respectively. In patients achieving a stable dose, mean (SD) change in SOWS from visit 1 to baseline of the double-blind phase was &#x02212;3.5 (6.4). In contrast, the mean (SD) change in patients discontinuing during titration was &#x02212;1.4 (8.3) from visit 1 to the termination visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>Approximately 55% of patients (n = 247) experienced &#x02265;1 AE. The most commonly reported AEs were constipation, nausea, somnolence, headache, and vomiting, and were consistent among those who did or did not achieve a stable dose during titration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-6-319">Table 4</xref>). About 5% of patients reported drug withdrawal syndrome. Of patients who reported AEs, the majority (90.6%) experienced AEs assessed with a maximum severity of mild or moderate (57.3% and 33.3%, respectively). Compared with dropouts during titration, those achieving a stable dose were less likely to report AEs (51.9% versus 60.3%, respectively).</p><p>Aside from patient sex, baseline demographics such as age and race did not impact the incidence of AEs. Female patients, however, experienced more AEs than male patients (60.5% versus 50.2%), and reported constipation (18.2% versus 12.8%), nausea (15.5% versus 8.4%), and vomiting (9.5% versus 3.5%) more frequently.</p><p>In total, 13.0% of patients (n = 58) discontinued from the study due to an AE. A small percentage of patients (4.3%) withdrew due to GI disorders. Approximately 4% of patients withdrew due to nervous system disorders, such as somnolence (1.8%) and headache (1.6%). Most AEs that led to discontinuation were considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug.</p><p>OROS hydromorphone ER dosage was reduced in 6.9% of patients. Approximately 2% of patients required dose reductions due to AEs. The incidence of AEs in relation to OROS hydromorphone ER dosage strength is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-jpr-6-319">Table 5</xref>. The 24 mg dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was associated with the greatest incidence of AEs (30.2%).</p><sec><title>GI-related AEs</title><p>GI-related AEs, specifically constipation, nausea, and vomiting, were most commonly reported (30.4%). Incidence of GI-related AEs was similar between patients who achieved a stable dose and those who discontinued during titration (29.9% versus 31.3%, respectively), and was similar across all doses (12&#x02013;48 mg) of OROS hydromorphone ER. Over 90% of GI-related AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity.</p><p>Constipation was reported by 69 patients (15.4%), 38 (8.5%) of whom received treatment for constipation during the conversion and titration phase. The incidence of constipation was similar in patients with or without a history of constipation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jpr-6-319">Figure 3</xref>). In patients with a history of constipation, eleven (14.7%) reported an AE of worsening constipation. In patients without a history of constipation, 58 (15.6%) reported an AE of constipation. The incidence of constipation was similar in patients who were or were not treated prophylactically for constipation (14.8% versus 15.5%, respectively) prior to the conversion and titration phase.</p><p>Nineteen patients (4.3%) discontinued study participation because of GI-related AEs, most commonly due to nausea (1.8%), constipation (1.1%), and vomiting (0.9%). Additionally, gastritis and rectal hemorrhage each occurred in one patient (0.2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment-related AEs and SAEs</title><p>Treatment-related AEs were reported by 43.0% of patients; 11.4% discontinued due to a treatment-related AE. The most commonly reported treatment-related AEs were constipation (14.3%), nausea (9.6%), somnolence (8.1%), headache (6.0%), and vomiting (4.5%). Five patients reported SAEs, none of which were determined by investigators to be related to OROS hydromorphone ER (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-jpr-6-319">Table 5</xref>). SAEs included meningitis, herpes, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis (one patient each). One patient experienced all of the following SAEs: hypokalemia, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No deaths occurred during the study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to examine dosing parameters, efficacy, and safety in patients being converted to OROS hydromorphone ER from other ER opioid therapies. Results indicate that the majority of patients can be safely converted to OROS hydromorphone ER and titrated to effective doses within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. The 5:1 morphine equivalent:hydromorphone conversion ratio used in this study is consistent with other published trials of OROS hydromorphone ER in patients with chronic cancer or non-cancer pain,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-jpr-6-319">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-jpr-6-319">43</xref> supporting growing evidence for the use of this ratio in clinical practice. Although the 5:1 ratio indicates that hydromorphone ER is a potent opioid, it is important to note that the ratio is lower than the conversion ratio for oral hydromorphone IR, which has been reported to be as high as 8:1.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-jpr-6-319">55</xref></p><p>Patients included in the current study had previously received other strong opioids, such as other formulations of hydromorphone, fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine, methadone, oxycodone, propoxyphene (no longer available), and oxymorphone. An analysis of conversion success according to prior opioid therapy revealed that the proportion of patients able to achieve a stable dose of hydromorphone ER did not depend to any appreciable extent on the specific opioid from which they were converting. This has clinical implications in the context of opioid rotation, which is often necessary for patients with chronic pain who experience a decline in therapeutic efficacy with their current opioid or inadequate efficacy or tolerability during conversion and titration of a new opioid therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-jpr-6-319">52</xref> Results presented here lend additional support for the consideration of OROS hydromorphone ER as an appropriate option in well-selected patients rotating from any of the opioid therapies commonly used in clinical practice.</p><p>As reported previously, overall mean pain intensity was reduced by 50% with OROS hydromorphone ER treatment during the conversion and titration phase of this study, a reduction that was maintained in the active-treatment group during the 12-week double-blind phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jpr-6-319">41</xref> When the current analysis of the conversion and titration phase reported results separately for patients who did or did not achieve a stable dose of hydromorphone ER, those who successfully converted to OROS hydromorphone ER from prior opioid therapy experienced significantly greater reductions in pain intensity, as well as improved functional abilities and treatment satisfaction.</p><p>Approximately 80% of patients achieving a stable dose of OROS hydromorphone ER experienced at least a 30% pain reduction, which meets an accepted threshold of clinically meaningful pain relief.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-jpr-6-319">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-jpr-6-319">57</xref> Furthermore, 52% of patients in this group experienced a &#x02265;50% pain reduction. These reductions were maintained over time, as 60.6% and 42.4% of patients showed &#x02265;30% and &#x02265;50% reductions in pain, respectively, at the end of the double-blind phase of the trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jpr-6-319">40</xref></p><p>The safety profile of OROS hydromorphone ER is consistent with other strong (World Health Organization Step 3) opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-6-319">31</xref> As expected, the most common AEs during conversion and titration were GI-related, as well as somnolence and headache. GI-related AEs, specifically constipation, warrant further attention. Overall incidence of constipation was approximately 15%, which is substantially lower than what was reported in a systematic review of strong opioids (41%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-jpr-6-319">31</xref> The incidence of constipation did not vary according to a patient&#x02019;s history of constipation or use of prophylactic medications, suggesting that OROS hydromorphone ER has a good GI tolerability profile under a variety of conditions. However, this study was not specifically designed to evaluate the true incidence of constipation or the effects of prophylactic or reactive management of constipation.</p><p>GI-related AEs were more common in female patients, as previously noted in the literature. Gender differences in AEs may be partially influenced by social factors that affect the way men and women communicate distress and perceive bodily experiences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-jpr-6-319">58</xref> Other baseline characteristics, including age, did not appear to influence the incidence of AEs. There was no strong evidence for an increased incidence of AEs at higher doses, although the data should be interpreted with caution because the duration of exposure to each dose was not accounted for in the analysis. In the ten patients who required a dose reduction due to AEs, there was no apparent relationship between the AE and OROS hydromorphone ER dose. The lack of a dose-response relationship for AEs was likely due to the individualized dosing strategy employed in the conversion and titration phase, as dose-dependent AEs are more likely to be seen with fixed dosing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-jpr-6-319">59</xref></p><p>There were no reports of abuse, overdose, or misuse during this trial. COWS and SOWS scores showed that most patients in the conversion and titration phase did not experience drug withdrawal, suggesting that the conversion and titration method used in this study was appropriate. It should be noted, however, that a small percentage of patients did report drug withdrawal syndrome as an AE.</p><p>This study had a number of limitations. Although the open-label, flexible-dose design of this phase of the study reflects usual clinical practice, there may have been factors in the design of this study that limited the ability of some patients to reach a stable dose of OROS hydromorphone ER. The time window for dose conversion and titration was limited to 2 to 4 weeks &#x02013; a shorter time span than may be required in clinical practice to achieve an effective dose &#x02013; and the maximum daily allowable dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was limited to 64 mg. The observation that 64 mg was the most common dose (taken by 22.1% of patients) at the final visit of the conversion and titration phase, and that 12.5% of patients discontinued due to lack of analgesic efficacy, suggests that the upper dose limit may not have been sufficient for a subset of patients. The mean final dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was approximately 38 mg/day in the conversion and titration phase of this study, which is lower than what has been reported in other studies of chronic noncancer and cancer pain (56.6 mg/day and 61.6 mg/day, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-jpr-6-319">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jpr-6-319">40</xref> In addition, the current study was performed in patients who were opioid-tolerant, and results may not be generalizable to opioid-na&#x000ef;ve patients (it should be noted that OROS hydromorphone ER is indicated for use only in opioid-tolerant patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-6-319">26</xref>). Conversion and titration of opioids should be implemented with particular caution in people without prior opioid exposure; medication should be initiated at a low dosage and titrated slowly to decrease the risk for adverse effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-6-319">7</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the detailed analysis of results from this conversion and titration phase confirm the findings of previous studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of OROS hydromorphone ER.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-jpr-6-319">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-jpr-6-319">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-jpr-6-319">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-jpr-6-319">47</xref> Data collected during this phase emphasize the need for individual titration of each patient to a stabilized dose of OROS hydromorphone ER. OROS hydromorphone ER was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in pain in the majority of patients and was generally well tolerated. GI tolerability was good; the rate of GI-related AEs was low across doses, and most were considered mild or moderate in severity. These findings suggest that OROS hydromorphone ER is an appropriate option in an opioid rotation program for the management of chronic pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by Neuromed Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
