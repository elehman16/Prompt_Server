The training data served to determine the expected performance curve of surgeons during their career and factors influencing outcome variation using generalized estimating equations (GEEs).

It can be described as a generalized, predictable improvement in performance witnessed with task repetition over time that tends to be rapid initially, with subsequent smaller improvements leading to an eventual plateau phase <xref rid="pone.0041944-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Surgeons intuitively perceive that they need time to accumulate experience at the beginning of their careers or when undertaking a new procedure in order to gain expert skills <xref rid="pone.0041944-Gaster1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Learning curve patterns may vary depending on the type of surgical procedure, the choice of outcome measurements <xref rid="pone.0041944-Carty1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and from one surgeon to another <xref rid="pone.0041944-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, learning curves may be influenced by a complex interplay of factors including patient case-mix, the surgeon&#x02019;s previous experience <xref rid="pone.0041944-Duclos1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and training <xref rid="pone.0041944-Bianco1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, or other institutional factors <xref rid="pone.0041944-Cook2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Although there is a growing interest in tracking individual surgical outcomes, traditional monitoring tools generally fail to consider the gradual learning process of young surgeons. The ability to generate data of sufficient quality and quantity to investigate surgical learning curves on a procedure-specific basis has historically been a laborious and often impossible task. Fortunately, the recent development and implementation of integrated hospital information systems has permitted the consideration of surgeon-specific factors that influence the value of delivered care <xref rid="pone.0041944-Duclos2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The course of performance of an individual or a group of surgeons can be plotted over time. In principle, recently graduated surgeons are assumed to perform surgery less safely and efficiently than more experienced colleagues at the peak of their career <xref rid="pone.0041944-Choudhry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Duclos3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. By extension, efforts to provide a valid picture of individual performance evolution among young surgeons for a particular procedure should frame their outcomes in relation to what is expected depending on their length of experience.</p><p>Here we propose a new approach to monitoring the outcomes of inexperienced thyroidectomy surgeons that incorporates the learning curve inherent to this procedure. This methodology utilizes the cumulative sum chart (CUSUM) as a graphical monitoring tool. The CUSUM chart was developed by Page in 1954 <xref rid="pone.0041944-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and has subsequently been applied in a limited fashion to healthcare performance improvement efforts <xref rid="pone.0041944-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041944-Biau1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A Risk-Adjusted CUSUM chart has been developed to control for variation in patient case-mix over time when monitoring rare adverse events <xref rid="pone.0041944-Steiner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>; furthermore, the Learning Curve CUSUM test has been proposed to determine when surgeons reach a predefined level of performance while learning a new procedure <xref rid="pone.0041944-Biau2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our effort represents an application of the CUSUM chart and the funnel plot to the elucidation of the natural evolution of surgical prowess in a manner that simultaneously considers procedure-specific, patient-specific and practitioner-specific factors. We derived the learning curve of young thyroidectomy surgeons as a baseline to enable the accurate assessment of their individual outcomes and avoid erroneous conclusions that may derive from more traditional approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Population</title><p>We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study between April 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009, in five high-volume referral centres in France <xref rid="pone.0041944-Duclos3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. From the 28 endocrine surgeons performing thyroid surgery in these academic centres, we selected a subset of 19 young surgeons in their first eight years of practice since graduation; all patients who underwent a thyroid procedure performed by one of these surgeons were eligible for inclusion during a one-year recruitment period. The ethics committee waived the requirement for patient consent. Before surgery, patients received written information about personal data use, and gave verbal consent for sharing their data.</p><p>In order to develop the performance chart independently from the data to be monitored, the database was randomly split into training and testing datasets according to surgeon&#x02019;s identity <xref rid="pone.0041944-Hastie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The training dataset included procedures performed by 14 surgeons and was used to define the baseline parameters of the performance charts, as well as models for outcomes adjustment. The testing dataset included procedures performed by the 5 other surgeons, each belonging to a different hospital, with the aim of putting the performance charts to the test by checking their application to external data.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome Measures and Data Collection</title><p>Two outcomes were monitored as proxies for young surgeon performance: operative time and postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Operative time was measured in minutes and defined as the total duration from skin incision to closure of the wound. All procedures performed in the participating hospitals were eligible for the operative time analysis. Systematic screening for postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was based on the objective evaluation of vocal cord mobility using laryngoscopy within 48 hours following every thyroid procedure <xref rid="pone.0041944-Jeannon1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Exclusion criteria for nerve palsy analysis included pre-existing nerve palsy before the intervention, previous thyroid surgery with unknown pre-existing nerve palsy status, and voluntary resection of nerves during intervention due to invasive carcinoma. Additionally, all the procedures performed in one of the participating hospitals were not included in the nerve palsy analysis because in this institution vocal cord mobility was evaluated by laryngoscopy only in cases of postoperative voice alterations.</p><p>After each thyroidectomy, a patient report form was completed by the attending surgeon, including items about surgical indication and procedure, as well as the surgeon&#x02019;s identity and the presence of a more experienced supervisory surgeon during the intervention. Research assistants completed data collection using medical records. These data included patient demographics and information on previous thyroid surgeries, thyroid specimen weights, and assessments of vocal cord mobility. The completeness of inclusions was measured in relation to the number of eligible thyroidectomies recorded in the hospital administrative databases. The surgeon&#x02019;s length of experience was calculated as the number of years she/he had spent in practice since graduation (i.e., the end of residency).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Performance Curve Modelling and Case-mix Adjustment</title><p>We used the training dataset to determine the expected performance curve of surgeons during their career based on a multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression model, taking into consideration the clustering of patients by surgeon. The operative time or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was the outcome of interest, while surgeon&#x02019;s experience was the predictor and patient&#x02019;s case-mix (sex, age, body mass index, thyroid disease, type of thyroidectomy, weight of specimen, supervision by experienced surgeon) was considered as a covariate in the final model. After testing various combinations to enter surgeon experience in the models, a logarithmic shape was finally retained because it provided the best fit.<sup>2</sup> Expected performance curves were drawn versus the number of years since surgeon&#x02019;s graduation.

For each surgical procedure, the expected operative time or probability of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was computed by controlling for patient case-mix alone (classical adjustment) or by simultaneously controlling for patient case-mix and surgeon experience (performance adjustment). Corresponding adjusted outcomes at a given year of experience were calculated as the ratio between the observed and the expected outcomes multiplied by the overall mean operative time or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy rate. Cross-sectional funnel plots displayed surgeon performance as a function of number of operations <xref rid="pone.0041944-Spiegelhalter1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Mean operative time and nerve palsy rate of each surgeon was plotted, applying both the classical and performance adjustment methodologies <xref rid="pone.0041944-Tekkis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Limits were set at one (68.3% CI), two (95.5% CI) and three (99.7% CI) standard deviations around the central line to indicate whether a particular surgeon&#x02019;s performance differed significantly from the overall mean performance.

The idea was to track surgical outcome to detect as quickly as possible if a small deviation in performance had occurred compared to an expected value. In case of persistent deviation towards a deterioration or improvement in performance, the CUSUM score was supposed to emit a signal by reaching either the upper (h+) or lower (h-) limits, respectively.

In the training dataset, half of the surgeons had a length of experience less than 4 years since graduation (min-max, 1 to 8 years), and the median volume of thyroidectomy cases per surgeon was 87 (21 to 324 cases) during the one-year recruitment period. Among the five surgeons who were allocated to the testing dataset, two had performed less than 10 thyroidectomies and another surgeon practiced surgery in the centre excluded from the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy analysis; we therefore focused on monitoring the outcomes of the two remaining surgeons. Surgeon A was in his second year of practice and had performed 118 procedures during the recruitment period. Surgeon B was more experienced and had started practicing eight years ago with 234 recorded thyroidectomies during the same one-year period.

Although surgeon A may have appeared as a poor performer using case-mix adjustment, he proved to have better outcomes than expected after controlling for his length of experience. Conversely, surgeon B had poor outcomes based on performance adjustment instead of being wrongly considered as a high performer based on the classical adjustment method.</p><p>Finally, variations in operative time and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy frequency were monitored on a procedure by procedure basis for surgeons A and B utilizing CUSUM charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041944-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041944-g003">3</xref>).

As intuited, our analyses demonstrated substantial improvement in efficiency and safety over time; both operative time and complication occurrence declined gradually with increasing surgeon experience. Indeed, other studies have generally shown that operative time and complication rate decline in a similar fashion with increasing experience and that improvement in performance occurs more rapidly during the early part of a surgeon&#x02019;s career <xref rid="pone.0041944-Rogers1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; specifically, learning curves have been explored in thyroid surgery for the assessment of video-assisted <xref rid="pone.0041944-Dionigi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Miccoli1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, endoscopic <xref rid="pone.0041944-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and robotically-performed thyroidectomy <xref rid="pone.0041944-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, as well as for intraoperative neuromonitoring <xref rid="pone.0041944-Duclos1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Dionigi2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>A less anticipated finding, however, was that utilizing these analyses as the backdrop for evaluating individual surgeons&#x02019; outcomes revealed marked differences in performance assessment relative to the classical approach <xref rid="pone.0041944-Steiner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Tekkis1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Funnel plots as well as CUSUM chart interpretations diverged between a classical patient case-mix adjustment model and a more comprehensive scheme that also controlled for surgeon experience. The CUSUM performance chart changed the magnitude of indicator variations and the sense of outlier signals; as such, a very young surgeon in the earliest part of his career had better outcomes than expected, whereas a more experienced surgeon was revealed to be a poor performer given the number of years that he had already spent in practice.</p><p>In performing this study, we benefitted from a richness of data that enabled us to frame our results with confidence: 1) the multicentre study design included prospective patient recruitment with great thoroughness and reliability in data collection; 2) performance assessment was based on objective and systematic measurement of surgical outcomes; and 3) the train-test approach was expensive in terms of data consumption, but allowed us to validate the chart using an external sample of surgeons <xref rid="pone.0041944-Hastie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Despite these factors; we acknowledge several limitations to our study. First, the limited number of surgeons in participating French academic hospitals may have produced a potential selection bias. Second, the cross-sectional design of our study captured only a year&#x02019;s worth of clinical data, and thus included only a small sample of any single surgeon&#x02019;s experience over the study period. While the construction of an amalgamated performance curve based on cross-sectional data is methodologically sound <xref rid="pone.0041944-Choudhry1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041944-Southern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, a more preferable approach would be to monitor the individual performance of a group of surgeons longitudinally over their first decade of practice <xref rid="pone.0041944-Carty1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, or to perform a retrospective chart review based on the same design. Third, our choice of postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy as a proxy for safety may have overstated the long-term complication rate of thyroidectomy, since many such palsies resolve spontaneously with time <xref rid="pone.0041944-Dralle1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Fourth, our study utilized time since graduation as a proxy for attending surgeon experience, as opposed to number of procedures performed. This limitation is a reflection of the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the fact that we did not have data concerning the number of thyroidectomy procedures performed by each surgeon prior to the study window.</p><p>The implications of these findings warrant further reflection on both the micro and macro strata. On an individual practitioner level, valid performance monitoring is necessary to gain surgeons&#x02019; trust and motivate them to rethink the way they are practicing surgery routinely; making performance monitoring tools as rigorous as possible thus facilitates achieving physician buy-in for ongoing performance improvement efforts. On an institutional or higher regulatory level, it has implications for initial training as well as over the long term as part of quality assurance and recertification of practicing specialists. Neglecting to consider the learning process inherent to most surgical procedures predisposes to imperfect measurement and misinterpretation of individual practitioner outcomes <xref rid="pone.0041944-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Developmental or disciplinary interventions informed by such erroneous interpretations will arguably be less effective than those based on assessments derived from more accurate assessments that incorporate procedure-, patient- and practitioner-specific factors.</p><p>It is also prudent to consider the implications of these findings on efforts to facilitate ongoing surgeon education. In the context of public suspicion regarding suboptimal outcomes, learning a new procedure efficiently is becoming more challenging for young surgeons <xref rid="pone.0041944-Hasan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Towards this end, utilization of the performance chart to track outcomes in conjunction with simulation approaches <xref rid="pone.0041944-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> may reduce the learning duration by reinforcing self-evaluation and professional mentorship <xref rid="pone.0041944-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Compared to classical tools, it allows surgeons to know if they are performing well in relation to what is expected based on their growing experience, with the goal to gradually reduce operative time and complication occurrence. Heads of surgical departments and instructors may also be interested in monitoring the evolution of the individual performance of young surgeons they are mentoring. Performance charts will help them to gauge if a given mentee has gained sufficient expertise level to perform safe surgery. They can detect when a surgeon is experiencing difficulties at some point of her/his career, indicating whether increased intraoperative supervision is warranted. On the other hand, promising surgeons with aptitudes to coach their colleagues will be revealed precociously.</p><p>The reproducibility of our methodology must now be tested in a variety of surgical procedures using different performance metrics. Longitudinal outcomes monitoring among large multi-center cohorts of surgeons would be useful in order to accurately predict the performance curve shapes and the acceptable safe standards for particular procedures. In addition, implementing performance chart monitoring of individual surgeons on a prospective basis may help us to further elucidate the factors influencing performance curves, with the expectation of helping surgeons to more rapidly achieve and maintain a high expertise level and optimal outcomes for their patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0041944.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
