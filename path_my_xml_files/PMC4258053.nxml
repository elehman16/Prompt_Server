By the time they are 50-years-old around 80% of women will have developed one. Of these, around half will experience symptoms which will impact negatively on their quality of life. Hysterectomy is the traditional treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids. For women who do not wish to undergo a hysterectomy, two invasive treatments are commonly available: myomectomy or uterine artery embolization (UAE).</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>FEMME is a pragmatic, randomised, open, multi-centre trial examining the quality of life menstruating women with symptomatic fibroids experience after treatment with UAE or myomectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>After providing informed consent, 216 women with symptomatic fibroids from 43 NHS Hospital Trusts and Health Boards across the United Kingdom will undergo randomisation by a centralised computer system to treatment by either UAE or myomectomy. A minimisation algorithm will be used in order to balance the groups with respect to the following three parameters: the longest dimension of the largest fibroid, the number of fibroids present, and whether the woman currently desires pregnancy.</p><p>Using validated questionnaires the women&#x02019;s quality of life will be compared between groups at six months, one year, two years and four years post-procedure, taking into account pre-procedure scores. An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial to determine the cost-effectiveness of UAE compared with myomectomy.</p><p>Validated diaries will also be used to compare menstrual blood loss at the same time-points. The plasma concentration of Anti-M&#x000fc;llerian hormone (AMH), which will act as a proxy measurement of ovarian reserve, will be recorded before the woman has her procedure and then again at six weeks, six months, and twelve months afterwards. Re-intervention rates will be recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The FEMME trial&#x02019;s primary outcome is the quality of life women with symptomatic uterine fibroids experience two years after they have been treated with either UAE or myomectomy, as measured by the disease-specific Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality-of-Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN70772394">ISRCTN70772394</ext-link>, registered on 2 March 2013.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Uterine fibroids</kwd><kwd>UAE</kwd><kwd>Myomectomy</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Menstrual blood loss</kwd><kwd>Ovarian reserve</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Why is there a need to determine whether treatment with uterine artery embolisation or myomectomy is most efficacious in improving the quality of life of women with uterine fibroids?</title><p>Uterine fibroids are the most common tumour in women of reproductive age and increase in prevalence as the woman gets older. By the time they are 50-years-old, around 80% of women will have developed a fibroid. Approximately half of women with fibroids experience significant symptoms which can include heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), pain on intercourse, abdominal pain, and a feeling of pressure, all of which can impact significantly on the woman&#x02019;s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The symptoms experienced by the woman with fibroids may vary depending on the position, size and number of fibroids. Intramural fibroids are the most common form of fibroid but are frequently asymptomatic. Subserosal fibroids, located on the outer surface of the uterus, can become very large and create feelings of bulkiness. Submucosal fibroids project into the uterine cavity and are associated with HMB. As they may distort the uterus and change the local morphology of the uterine tissue, some clinicians believe that the presence of fibroids may have a negative impact on fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Hospital Episode Statistics state that there were just under 31,000 Finished Consultant Episodes of women with fibroids of the uterus between 2012 and 2013 in the United Kingdom. The majority of these women were aged between 40 and 54-years-old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Women with symptomatic fibroids often respond poorly to drug management or risk unacceptable side effects from hormonal preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], so generally the use of these pharmaceuticals is limited to reducing the fibroid bulk and relieving the symptoms prior to surgical intervention. The traditional treatment for symptomatic fibroids is hysterectomy, but with many women associating their uterus with their femininity and sexuality, an increasing number of women with fibroids are questioning whether hysterectomy for a benign condition is necessary and many are seeking alternatives.</p><p>In the National Health Service (NHS) there are two womb-sparing procedures available to treat uterine fibroids; uterine artery embolisation (UAE) and myomectomy. In UAE, an arterial catheter is used to introduce an embolic agent into the blood vessel supplying the uterus. This blocks the blood flow to the fibroid causing it to infarct (die), so relieving the symptoms of the fibroid. Myomectomy is the surgical removal of the fibroid, and depending on the size and position of the fibroid, this can be undertaken by a variety of routes including laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or by a laparotomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous work comparing UAE with myomectomy</title><p>The use of UAE in women who may wish to conceive is controversial within some sections of the medical community. Some authors are concerned by the reduction in blood flow to the ovary that can occur if there are significant connections between the ovarian and uterine arteries, which may result in decreased ovarian function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The extent of this decreased function, how long it is maintained for, and even if it occurs at all, is disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Whilst generally regarded as safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the caution inherent in the guidelines drawn up when UAE was still in its infancy has led to a further reluctance in some circles to use UAE in women who may wish to try to conceive at some point. As a result of this, trials generally excluded women who are seeking fertility.</p><p>One small (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;121) single centre, randomised, clinical trial from the Czech Republic compared myomectomy with UAE in women with intramural fibroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These authors concluded that UAE was less invasive, but as effective and safe as myomectomy for treating the symptoms of fibroids. The REST trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] randomised a total of 157 women in a 2:1 ratio between UAE and myomectomy before assessing the quality of life (QoL) at five years with the Short Form 36 (SF-36) general health survey. Secondary measures included complications, adverse events, and the need for further intervention. These authors reported that there were no significant differences in the reported QoL between the groups at five years. However, there was a significantly greater re-intervention rate after five years for treatment failure or complications in the UAE arm over the myomectomy arm. This negated the initial cost benefit of UAE over surgery at 12&#x000a0;months and made both treatments cost-neutral at five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>A pilot study for the FEMME trial (the FUME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) was conducted at St George&#x02019;s Hospital, London, United Kingdom. In this study 160 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were randomised to UAE or myomectomy and the change in their QoL, hospital stay, complication rates, and need for re-intervention were measured at one year post-procedure. The authors reported that by one year there was no difference in the improvement of the QoL women experienced in the myomectomy and UAE arm but, like the REST trial, there was a higher intervention rate in women who had undergone a UAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>With increasing pressure on ever diminishing NHS budgets the cost-effectiveness is increasing in importance to commissioners and Trusts when deciding which treatment options should be available. The average length of stay in hospital post-hysterectomy is 4.4&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and it is not unusual for women to require an additional three months to recuperate before returning to their normal lives. The average stay in hospital post-myomectomy is 3.6&#x000a0;days and, depending on the route used, the post-procedure recuperation time can be up to several weeks. With its minimally invasive nature, the mean length of hospital stay post-UAE is one day, with a return to normal life typically within a couple of weeks. Whilst superficially this may suggest a significant economic advantage for UAE, the higher re-intervention rates compared with hysterectomy may well negate any cost saving by five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The FEMME trial is a randomised, open, multi-centre trial comparing UAE with myomectomy in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The FEMME trial&#x02019;s primary outcome is to measure the QoL women with symptomatic uterine fibroids experience two years after they have been treated with UAE or myomectomy, through the disease-specific Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The FEMME trial&#x02019;s secondary outcomes are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>EuroQoL EQ-5D score and visual analogue scale score;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Menstrual blood loss, assessed using the Pictorial Blood loss Assessment Chart (PBAC).

In the latter case, potential participants will need to be reviewed by a gynaecologist to ensure they are suitable for myomectomy.</p><p>Depending on local practice and staff availability, the referral letters may be screened by the research nurse who will bring to the gynaecologist&#x02019;s attention those women whose symptoms are suggestive of uterine fibroids and who may be eligible to take part in the FEMME trial. After review, should the gynaecologist agree that uterine fibroids are the likely underlying cause of the described symptoms, they can request the nurse sends out a Research Ethics Committee (REC)-approved participant information sheet (PIS) and covering letter in advance. This will allow the woman to be aware of the FEMME trial before she attends the clinic for her appointment. This stage is optional and dependent on local practice and gynaecology agreement.</p><p>When the woman presents in clinic she will be reviewed by a qualified gynaecologist. Following confirmation of the presence of fibroids, if the gynaecologist feels that these will respond equally well to UAE or myomectomy, then the gynaecologist will make the initial approach to the women to make them aware of the FEMME trial. If the woman expresses an interest in taking part in the FEMME trial then an approved member of the local research team will discuss the protocol with them and answer any queries they may have.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Consent</title><p>Consent will be obtained from any potential participant in compliance with the requirements of the REC before they are included in the trial. Any potential participant will only be approached by an approved member of the local research team.

The approved member of the local research team will fully discuss the trial with the potential participant and answer any questions they may have prior to consent being taken. Any potential participant will be informed that they can withdraw from the trial at any point without having a give a reason why. Should they wish to withdraw, then the patient will be reassured that the medical care they receive will not be affected in any way. The patient&#x02019;s consent will be recorded on a REC-approved consent form and countersigned by the approved member of the local research team. Once signed and dated by all parties, the participant will be given a copy of the consent form for their own records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Randomisation</title><p>In order to reduce bias as far as possible, following informed consent but before randomisation, the participant will be given the validated QoL questionnaires (the UFS-QoL and the EuroQoL EQ-5D) and asked to complete them. Once completed and returned to the clinical staff, the patient&#x02019;s details will be entered onto a centralised online system which will allocate the patient to their treatment (myomectomy or UAE). A minimisation algorithm will be used to ensure that the groups are balanced as evenly as possible with respect to treatment group and also the following variables: the longest dimension of the largest fibroid (under 7&#x000a0;cm or over 7&#x000a0;cm), the number of fibroids present (1 to 3, 4 to 10, over 10), and if the woman desires pregnancy (yes or no).</p><p>The number and size of the fibroids present will be determined by imaging with either: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (contrast enhanced and/or non-contrast enhanced), ultrasound (vaginal or trans-abdominal), or hysteroscopy.</p><p>Should a participant have been randomised on any type of imaging other than MRI then, if local capacity allows, an MRI scan will be requested prior to the patient undergoing their procedure. After randomization, blood will be drawn into two BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; serum separator tubes (SST, BD, The Danby Building, Edmund Halley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford OX4 4DQ, England) for the proxy measurement of ovarian reserve. These blood samples will be placed into a Royal Mail Safebox&#x02122; and sent to Birmingham University&#x02019;s Human Tissue Repository. Upon receipt, the blood samples will be transformed into serum and stored in a secure biobanking facility at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Finally, the participant will be given a copy of the menstrual blood loss diary to take away with them and asked to complete it when they start their next period. Upon completion this blood loss diary will be returned to the trials office in a prepaid envelope provided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Treatment</title><p>A pregnancy test will be performed immediately prior to treatment. As FEMME is a pragmatic trial, other than the randomisation to myomectomy or UAE the treatment the woman receives is the clinician&#x02019;s normal practice. This means that if the woman is randomised to a myomectomy this can be of any type including laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or by a laparotomy. Similarly, should the woman be randomised to UAE, this is performed according to the interventional radiologist&#x02019;s normal practice.

Sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome measure, including imputed values for missing responses, will be performed to determine the robustness of the results obtained. Methods based on multiple imputation will be used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Subgroup analysis</title><p>Subgroup analyses are limited by statistical power and can produce spurious results, particularly if numerous analyses are undertaken. For this reason, any subgroup analysis will be limited to the minimisation variables listed in the Initial assessment and randomisation section. Effects within subgroups will only be investigated further if suitable tests for interaction (by including the relevant interaction parameter in the regression model) are statistically robust.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Economic evaluation of embolisation compared with myomectomy</title><p>An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the clinical trial to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of UAE compared to myomectomy from the perspective of the NHS and the personal social services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Health utility values associated with each arm of the trial will be calculated from the responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire. Information relating to healthcare resource use associated with the procedures and associated complications and events during the trial period will be collected. Unit costs for all healthcare resource use will be obtained from routinely collected data and the literature to estimate the total costs associated with resource use in each arm of the trial. All costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be discounted at the currently recommended rate. Cost-utility analyses will be carried out at two and four years post-randomisation.</p><p>Regression analysis will be used to adjust the estimates for relevant covariates, in conformity with the clinical analysis. Cost-effectiveness will be expressed as incremental cost per QALY gained. The 95% confidence limits for the difference in mean costs between arms and for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated using non-parametric bootstrap methods. In addition, the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be estimated by modelling. A probabilistic decision model will be developed to estimate the subsequent health status and costs beyond the period of the trial until the woman reaches menopause. The model will be populated primarily by data extrapolation from this trial. Extensive sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore areas of structural uncertainty in the analyses. Parameter uncertainty, including that relating to heterogeneity of the pre-specified subgroups, will be handled by using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and presented using cost-effectiveness curves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size for the trial is based around the primary outcome measure of the total HRQL score taken from the UFS-QoL questionnaire, and is informed by the results of the pilot study at St George&#x02019;s Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The mean difference seen here from the 118 patients who provided questionnaire responses at twelve months was 12 points in favour of myomectomy, with a standard deviation of 22 points (using an analysis of covariance approach). This is equivalent to approximately 0.5 standard deviations (rounded downwards to be conservative). To detect a difference of this size (a moderate effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) with 90% power (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) would require 86 patients in each group (172 in total). Whilst the number of women expected to become pregnant before the primary outcome time of two years is expected to be low (10% or less), some provision needs to be made for these women as not all questions on the UFS-QoL will be still relevant. Additionally, a further 10% has also been added to account for loss to follow-up (including withdrawals). Thus, the final target sample size has been inflated to 216 patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data management and quality assurance</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Data protection</title><p>Data will be stored and analysed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, plus any other relevant legislation.
