that affects 3&#x02013;7% of school-aged children<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This disorder is characterized by diminished abilities to pay
attention and regulate impulses and behaviors<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Current research suggests that complex interactions between multiple risk factors are
responsible for ADHD. Deficient or excessive supply of various neurotransmitters belonging
to the amino acid group (GABA), amine group (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
serotonin, histamine, acetylcholine), and peptide group (vasopressin) are believed to be
responsible for the behavioral and emotional symptoms exhibited by the affected
individuals<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, reduced
levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine are reported to be strongly associated with ADHD
symptoms<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Neuro-anatomical
investigations suggest that serotonin, through the orbitofrontal-striatal circuit, may
regulate the behavioral domains of hyperactivity and impulsivity in ADHD<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research has produced mixed results regarding the association between exercise training and
neurotransmitters. An animal study conducted by Dishman<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that physical activity reduces the level of epinephrine.
This is thought to be due to reduced stress perception and stimulation of the sympathetic
nervous system, and an effect on the negative feedback of the HPA axis. A previous study
reported the effects of a single exercise session and regular exercise on dopamine levels.
Most other related studies have also reported changes in dopamine levels during prolonged
exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Combination exercise
incorporates cardiovascular and resistance exercises, and improves body composition and
metabolism<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This type of exercise
physiologically promotes healthy growth in children<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, jump rope exercise is an effective total body exercise that requires minimal
equipment, space, and time. Individuals can easily adjust the intensity and duration of the
workouts by modifying the jumps height, speed, and time<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ball exercises develop reflexes, agility, flexibility, balance,
muscular endurance, and strength, and they are the most popular exercise among children.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine effect of a jump rope and ball
combined exercise program on the physical fitness and neurotransmitter (epinephrine,
serotonin) levels of children with ADHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Upon obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board, potential participants were
recruited from K University hospital&#x02019;s pediatric psychiatry department located in G city. A
thorough information session regarding the purpose and procedures of the study was
conducted, after which a written consent (drafted in accordance with IRB policy) was
obtained from each volunteering parent whose child was diagnosed with ADHD. The children
were diagnosed after a series of test and scale assessments conducted by medical doctor. The
parents were asked to submit a detailed record of the type and amount of food consumed by
the children during the previous day. The food reports were then analyzed with the use of
CAN-pro 3.0 (computer aided nutritional analysis program for professionals 3.0) to determine
the children&#x02019;s dietary habits and nutritional profiles. Subsequently, children with similar
dietary habits and nutritional profiles were selected for the study.</p><p>Initially, the subjects comprised 18 boys attending elementary school, whose grade levels
ranged from 1&#x02013;4. The block randomization method was used to distribute the participants
between a combination exercise group and a no-exercise (control) group. Six children dropped
out of the study for personal reasons, leaving a total of 12 children (6 in the exercise
group, 6 in the control group) who completed the 12-week program (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Physical characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fat (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.83&#x000b1;0.98</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">131.23&#x000b1;6.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.33&#x000b1;4.68</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.73&#x000b1;3.40</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.83&#x000b1;0.98</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">133.12&#x000b1;7.91</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.32&#x000b1;5.31</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.70&#x000b1;3.87</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are M&#x000b1;SD.

measured, and the pediatric BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated. All the participants were
instructed to avoid engaging in excessive physical activity during the 24-h period before
the measurements. They were also instructed to fast during the 4-h period before the
measurements. The measurements were performed using the bioelectrical impedance analysis
method with the participants wearing light clothing.</p><p>For muscle strength measurement, the participants&#x02019; grip (kg) was measured with a grip
dynamometer. For muscle endurance measurement, a 1-min sit-up test, cardiorespiratory
endurance and a step-test were administered. For measuring flexibility, a sit and reach
flexibility-measuring tool was used (T.K.K. 5103, Japan).</p><p>The pre-exercise blood sampling required the participants to fast for a period of 10&#x02005;h.
Additionally, the participants were instructed to avoid medication, caffeine, vitamins, and
excessive physical activity for the 12-h period prior to the sampling as these can affect
the outcomes of blood analysis. The post-exercise blood sampling followed the same procedure
with the exception of methylphenidate intake.</p><p>For both the pre- and post-exercise blood sampling, participants were instructed to rest
for at least 30&#x02005;min. A disposable syringe and vacuum tubes treated with anticoagulants (SST,
EDTA) were used to collect the samples. A 5&#x02005;ml sample in SST, and two 3&#x02005;ml samples (a total
of 6&#x02005;ml) in EDTA from each participant&#x02019;s antecubital vein were obtained.</p><p>Epinephrine analysis was performed using electrochemical detection (ECD) to measure the
concentration of metabolites separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For
analysis of the serotonin level an Agilent HP1200 Series with ECD (Esa) was used.</p><p>The results were analyzed using the SPSS 18.0 statistics software. The mean (M) and
standard deviation (SD) were computed for all measured parameters. In order to verify the
normality of the data distributions, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (goodness of fit) test was
performed. In order to test the homogeneity of the major participant variables before the
exercises, the independent t-test was performed. To examine the significance of pre- and
post-exercise differences within the groups, the paired t-test was performed. To examine the
differences between the groups post-exercise, the independent t-test was performed.

in the synapses between neurons. Serotonin and other widely known neurotransmitters,
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine make up catecholamine. These neurotransmitters are
involved in the stress response, and are potential causes of ADHD, and other psychological
disorders such as sleep disorder, and depression<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the pathophysiological hypothesis for ADHD, the
disorder is a dysfunction of the neurotransmitters in the catecholamine group<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the various methods that have been
suggested for improving neurotransmission, exercise is known to help alleviate the symptoms
caused by neurotransmitter deficiencies<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study show that the combination exercise program significantly
improved the epinephrine levels in the exercise group. However, no statistically significant
improvement was observed in any of the neurotransmitter levels in the control group or
between the two groups. Epinephrine is secreted by the adrenal medulla, and activates the
central motor stimulus and peripheral vascular extension, and increases muscle enzymes.
Therefore, it is more important than other hormones when sudden muscle strength and power
are required<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the
significant improvement observed in the epinephrine level of the participating children
could be a result of the body&#x02019;s adaptation to the regular exercise performed for 12 weeks.
In other words, the level of epinephrine in the blood is associated with the lactic acid
level during exercise: arousal, including exercise, elevates the level of epinephrine in the
body<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the increased level
of epinephrine found in the study participants may have been a result of the body&#x02019;s
adaptation to a higher level of arousal, stimulated and sustained during the 12-week
exercise program.</p><p>On the other hand, serotonin is involved in motor control and it influences the central
nervous system. Its dysfunction in the nervous system causes severe inattention and
attention deficit, depression, fear, aggressive behaviors, feeding issues, sleep issues,
pain regulation issues, etc. in children<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, no significant differences in the serotonin
levels were observed between the groups. However, both pre- and post-exercise levels of
serotonin in the groups exceeded the normal range. In fact, the change in the post-exercise
serotonin level in the exercise group was negligible. However, the change in the serotonin
level in the control group was relatively significant. This could be because the effects of
serotonin imbalance were mitigated by the combination exercise in the children with ADHD.
Additionally, the abnormally high level of serotonin observed in the study participants may
imply that children with ADHD have serotonin dysfunction, in addition to the already proven
dopamine and norepinephrine dysfunctions. Further studies are required addressing this
issue.</p><p>In the characteristic cognitive and emotional deficiencies, children with ADHD also exhibit
motor control deficits as evidenced by poor balance, coordination, muscle strength, and
reaction time<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, increasing
the fitness level of such children through physical activities is of great importance. In
the present study, the cardiorespiratory endurance of the exercise group increased
significantly after the 12-week intervention, indicating that the jump rope exercises and
ball exercises had a positive effect on the cardiovascular capacity of the children with
ADHD. Although the changes in the fitness levels observed in the control group were not
significant, a trend towards an increased fitness level in the control group was seen over
the study period. This could be due to the mechanisms of growth hormone and insulin-like
growth factor-1 being related to different physiologic patterns of response to physical
fitness in pubertal children. The present study speculates that the exercise program that
combined jump rope and ball exercises had a positive effect on the cardiovascular endurance
of the children with ADHD. Jump rope exercise, in particular, promotes cardiovascular
health<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, since it is a high
impact exercise that requires individuals to jump up and down, it is especially effective at
improving balance, coordination, accuracy, explosive muscle strength, and agility. Gappmaier
et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that ball exercises are
primarily used in physical therapies for patients with neurological problems, and that they
improve the strength of the back muscles<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The discrepancies in the findings could be due to the differences
in exercise type, measuring area, participants, etc. Because of the lack of available
studies on the effects of jump rope and ball combination exercise on the muscle strength of
children with ADHD, further study is required to derive a more definite conclusion.</p><p>The present study had the following limitations: the participants&#x02019; lifestyle factors, such
as physiological and dietary/nutritional profiles as well as sleep patterns could not be
controlled in a uniform manner; the participants&#x02019; psychological and genetic profiles were
not similar; and the participants were limited to boys diagnosed with ADHD.</p><p>In conclusion, the 12-week combination exercise program of the present study (jump rope and
ball exercises) had a positive effect on the body composition, overall fitness level, and
neurotransmission of children with ADHD. Based on these findings, we suggest that
combination exercise should be utilized as an effective intervention for improving the
symptoms of ADHD in children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">American Psychiatric
