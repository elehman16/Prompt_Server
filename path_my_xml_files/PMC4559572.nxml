Bypassing a longer segment of the small bowel may increase weight loss. The objective of the study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic proximal and distal gastric bypass in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of superobese patients. The study was conducted at two public tertiary care obesity centers in Norway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with body mass index (BMI) 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomly assigned to a proximal (150&#x000a0;cm alimentary limb) or a distal (150&#x000a0;cm common channel) gastric bypass. The biliopancreatic limb was 50&#x000a0;cm in both operations. Patients and follow-up personnel were blinded to the type of procedure. Thirty-day outcomes including complications are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We operated on 115 patients, of whom two were excluded at surgery, leaving 56 and 57 patients in the proximal group and distal group, respectively. The median (range) operating time was 72 (36&#x02013;151) and 101&#x02009;(59&#x02013;227)&#x02009;min, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Two distal procedures were converted to laparotomy during the primary procedure. Median length of hospital stay was 2&#x02009;(1&#x02013;4)&#x02009;days in the proximal group and 2&#x02009;(1&#x02013;24)&#x02009;days in the distal group. The number of patients with complications and complications categorized according to the Contracted Accordion classification did not differ significantly. However, all six reoperations were performed in the distal group, of which three were completed by laparoscopy (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01 between groups). There were no deaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In superobese patients with BMI between 50 and 60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, distal gastric bypass was associated with longer operating time and more severe complications resulting in reoperation than proximal gastric bypass.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bariatric surgery</kwd><kwd>Gastric bypass</kwd><kwd>Malabsorptive gastric bypass</kwd><kwd>Distal gastric bypass</kwd><kwd>Malabsorptive procedure</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopic bariatric surgery</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanisms of weight loss after bariatric surgery include restriction of food intake and malabsorption of nutrients. For some procedures, altered gastrointestinal endocrine physiology may mediate weight loss through modulation of appetite and energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provides substantial and sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Superobese patients (body mass index, BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), however, may remain morbidly obese after this procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch induces greater weight loss than proximal gastric bypass, possibly through greater malabsorption, but is seldom performed as a primary bariatric procedure. The biliopancreatic diversion is a more challenging and technical procedure to perform and associated with a high frequency of short- and long-term adverse events including protein-calorie malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is no general consensus as to the optimal intestinal limb lengths to be used in gastric bypass for superobese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Lengthening the alimentary or the biliopancreatic limb or shortening the common channel may increase malabsorption and subsequent weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Brolin et al. introduced the distal gastric bypass with a common channel of 75&#x000a0;cm, resulting in increased weight loss but also severe metabolic problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar problems with malnutrition and liver failure occurred when combining a longer common channel of 150&#x000a0;cm with a short alimentary limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Building upon the work of Nelson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we hypothesize that a common channel of 150&#x000a0;cm combined with a long alimentary limb may ensure malabsorption without severe metabolic problems.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has compared weight loss outcomes or complications of proximal and distal gastric bypass in superobese patients. In this first report, we compare the perioperative outcomes of the two procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>This study is part of an ongoing two-center randomized (1:1) double-blind, controlled trial comparing proximal and distal gastric bypass in superobese patients. The trial was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and is registered in Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00821197. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for trial inclusion were BMI 50 to 60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the time of referral (48 to 62&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> at enrollment) and age between 20 and 60&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria included previous bariatric or major abdominal surgery, urolithiasis, chronic liver disease, and conditions associated with poor compliance. All patients referred to bariatric surgery at the study centers were reviewed for inclusion in the period January 2011 to March 2013. The patients were operated on between March 2011 and April 2013.</p><p>Both participating hospitals, Oslo University Hospital and Vestfold Hospital Trust, are public tertiary care centers, each performing over 200 bariatric procedures annually. Prior to the study, the centers had performed over 1000 proximal gastric bypass procedures and a total of 40 distal gastric bypasses. All procedures were performed by senior surgeons at Vestfold Hospital Trust (RS and BS) and Oslo University Hospital (CFS, JK, and TM) in order to reduce potential learning curve effects. All senior surgeons had performed 200 or more bariatric procedures, mostly gastric bypass, prior to the start of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Treatment</title><p>All enrolled patients followed standard preoperative logistics, including schooling on nutrition, exercise, and what to expect after surgery. All patients were prescribed a low-calorie diet (&#x0003c;1000&#x000a0;kcal/day) 3&#x000a0;weeks before surgery and recommended a preoperative weight loss of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;%.</p><p>At each study visit, all patients underwent a physical examination and data including demographics, comorbidities, and medications were registered. Fasting blood samples were obtained, and study questionnaires completed at the hospital. Weight was measured with participants wearing light clothing and no shoes.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting serum glucose &#x02265;7.0&#x000a0;mmol/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x02265;6.5&#x000a0;%, or the use of at least one glucose-lowering medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure &#x02265;140/90&#x000a0;mmHg or the use of at least one antihypertensive medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surgical Procedures</title><p>Both procedures were performed with an antegastric antecolic Roux-en-Y configuration using linear staplers and an omega loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Standard port placement was applied with four bladeless trocars and a Nathanson liver retractor (Cook Medical), and an extra 5-mm port was inserted if needed. All stapling was performed using a linear stapler, with blue cartridges for the stomach and white cartridges for the small bowel. The pouch was created by stapling the stomach horizontally from the minor curvature and vertically to create a gastric pouch of about 25&#x000a0;ml. The gastrojejunostomy was created using a 45-mm stapler with blue cartridge and completed with a running suture. The omentum was not transected routinely. The biliopancreatic limb was 50&#x000a0;cm in both procedures. Limb lengths were measured sequentially using 5-cm markers on the graspers; the bowel was held taut but not stretched.</p><p>Following the creation of the gastrojejunostomy, the alimentary limb was measured to 150&#x000a0;cm from the gastrojejunostomy in preparation for a proximal gastric bypass, with a side-to-side jejunojejunostomy created using a 45-mm stapler cartridge and closed with a running suture. In preparation for a distal gastric bypass, the common channel was measured to 150&#x000a0;cm from the ileocecal junction and marked with a suture. The bowel was then run from the gastric pouch until reaching the marker, and a side-to-side jejunoileostomy was created using a 45-mm stapler cartridge and closed with a running suture. The Roux-en-Y configuration was completed by dividing the jejunum between the anastomoses, with the patency of the gastrojejunostomy evaluated by instilling diluted methylene blue in a nasogastric tube. The fascial defects after trocars were not closed.

Low molecular weight heparin was administered subcutaneously the first 10&#x000a0;days after surgery, and all patients were recommended a standard daily oral supplement of a multivitamin and mineral tablet, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. Vitamin B12 was administered through injections, and ursodeoxycholic acid prescribed for 6&#x000a0;months in order to prevent gallstone formation, with the exception of patients who had previously undergone cholecystectomy. The first scheduled follow-up was at 6&#x000a0;weeks after surgery in the outpatient clinic, where we also registered 30-day complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>In this report, we present perioperative outcomes to evaluate short-term safety.

These patients had a mean BMI reduction of 15.8&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 4.7) 1&#x000a0;year after surgery (unpublished data). We hypothesized that a distal gastric bypass would be associated with a further BMI reduction of 3.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> 1&#x000a0;year after surgery, i.e., an estimated 1-year change in BMI of 18.8&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 5.0). Assuming a similar change in BMI within the groups at 2&#x000a0;years and 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) difference between the groups, we calculated that 88 patients would have to complete the study. We decided to enroll a minimum of 112 participants in order to allow for possible dropouts. The participants were block randomized (random blocks of 4 and 6) using computer-based randomization and sealed envelopes to conceal allocation.</p><p>Study participants and follow-up personnel were blinded for type of procedure. The operating surgeons were not involved in the study follow-up except in cases of surgical emergencies. Information about type of procedure was available for medical emergencies.

<sup>a</sup>The patient underwent a second laparotomy due to bleeding after removal of an abdominal drain</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>Six patients, all in the distal gastric bypass group, underwent a total of seven reoperations. Three of the reoperations were completed laparoscopically and were the result of staple line bleeding, internal herniation, and small bowel entrapment under an intraperitoneal onlay mesh. Three reoperations were performed by laparotomy. One was the result of a leakage from the enteroenterostomy and one the obstruction of the enteroenteroanastomosis, with both requiring a new anastomosis. The third patient had an iatrogenic small bowel injury requiring suture, and had a second laparotomy due to bleeding after the removal of a non-suction abdominal drain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we found that in patients with a BMI of 50 to 60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, distal gastric bypass was associated with longer operating time than proximal gastric bypass. The overall frequency of complications did not differ; however, distal gastric bypass resulted in more severe postoperative complications requiring reoperation than proximal gastric bypass.</p><p>The overall complication rate in the proximal group of 9.4&#x000a0;% is comparable with that found in other studies of patients with a BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our finding of 18.5&#x000a0;% overall complication rate in the distal group is higher than reported in two case series of distal gastric bypass reporting 2.8&#x000a0;% (laparoscopic) and 13&#x000a0;% (open) major complications. These studies, however, reported only major morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, one non-randomized controlled study of gastric bypass versus distal gastric bypass noted 32&#x000a0;% complications in both groups, with a 6&#x000a0;% overall rate of reoperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The statistical comparison of complications in the two groups should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of events.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, five randomized controlled trials have compared intestinal limb lengths in bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], of which four included superobese patients. Four of eight retrospective studies that evaluated the outcome of varying limb lengths included superobese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Few of the studies reported on perioperative outcome, and none have used standardized classification of complications, making direct comparison of outcomes difficult. Our finding of longer operating times when performing distal gastric bypass has been described by others and may reflect technical surgical aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The main difference between the proximal and distal bypass is the handling of the small bowel. There is more manipulation, and the long alimentary limb increases the strain on the enteroenteroanastomosis. Most reoperations observed in our study were related to the small bowel. Changes in surgical technique and greater experience with the handling of the distal small bowel while creating the enteroenteroanastomosis might reduce the differences in operating time and complication rates. Dividing the short bowel before fashioning the gastrojejunal or the jejunojejunal anastomosis might lead to less small bowel-related complications than using the omega loop technique. Of the other studies, only Nergaard et al. describes using the omega loop technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but in most studies this is not specified. Some advocate dividing the mesenterium beyond the first vascular arcade to reduce the strain on the anastomosis, but we have not used this method routinely, and increased strain on the jejunoileal anastomosis was not perceived to be a problem during the procedures.</p><p>The incidence of short-term complications for biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, an alternative malabsorptive procedure, is also high. Two previous studies of duodenal switch in superobese patients, of which one was from our study group, both present complications in 24&#x000a0;% of the patients within 30&#x000a0;days of surgery, one reporting 12&#x000a0;% severe complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a recent single-center review, laparoscopic duodenal switch had a significantly higher leak rate of 5&#x000a0;% compared to proximal gastric bypass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The distal gastric bypass may be an alternative to duodenal switch in superobese patients, although there is little evidence as to long-term outcome. Malabsorptive bariatric procedures, however, can impose adverse events that may offset the benefits of increased weight loss in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The major strengths of the present study include the double-blind, randomized controlled design, a high follow-up rate, and standardization of the surgical procedures. In addition, we used a well-established grading system for reporting complications, which is essential for facilitation of comparison with other studies. The study was not powered for analyzing differences in complications, thus limiting reasonable statistical comparisons of outcome between the two groups. We restricted the study to patients with a BMI of 50 to 60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and therefore the results may not apply to patients with a BMI outside of this range. The surgeons had greater experience performing proximal gastric bypass as opposed to distal gastric bypass, and learning curve effects may thus contribute to the differences observed in postoperative outcome. We tried to minimize this potential bias by limiting the number of surgeons involved; however, the small number of procedures suggest that the surgeons were still in the learning curve for the technical steps that differ between proximal and distal gastric bypass. However, the procedures are identical in all other parts than the handling of the small bowel.</p><p>The technical skills of the individual surgeon are likely to be of importance for the risk of complications. Birkmeyer et al. have shown that technical skills correlate with less complications and shorter operating time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The small number of patients in our study does not allow for reasonable statistical evaluation of any potential correlation between operating times and complications; however, the mean operating times are shorter than in comparable studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Cook et al. found that by standardizing the anesthetic agents and the operative steps, length of hospital stay and outcomes in regard to cardiac surgical practice improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To facilitate the use of standardized surgical technique in the present study, the surgeons at the two study centers operated a few patients together before the outset of the study. Detailed description of operative techniques might allow for more standardized care for bariatric patients and may enable comparison between studies.</p><p>Measuring the small bowel by using graspers or umbilical tape introduces risks of measurement biases. We are not aware of any studies validating these methods. Measurement of the total bowel length could have given more information on procedural effect on postoperative nutritional status and weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Distal gastric bypass was associated with longer operating time and a higher frequency of reoperations and severe perioperative complications than proximal gastric bypass surgery in patients with BMI 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The current study is part of a work-intensive collaboration between two bariatric centers in southeastern Norway.
