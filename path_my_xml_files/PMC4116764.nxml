We hypothesized that a ventilation strategy, without recruitment manoeuvres, using a combination of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a reduced end-expiratory oxygen fraction (F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) before ending mask ventilation with CPAP after extubation would reduce the area of postoperative atelectasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p> Thirty patients were randomized into three groups. During induction and emergence, inspiratory oxygen fractions (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) were 1.0 in the control group and 1.0 or 0.8 in the intervention groups. No CPAP/PEEP was used in the control group, whereas CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was used in the intervention groups. After extubation, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was set to 0.30 in the intervention groups and CPAP was applied, aiming at F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 0.30. Atelectasis was studied by computed tomography 25 min postoperatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> The median area of atelectasis was 5.2 cm<sup>2</sup> (range 1.6&#x02013;12.2 cm<sup>2</sup>) and 8.5 cm<sup>2</sup> (3&#x02013;23.1 cm<sup>2</sup>) in the groups given F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 with or without CPAP/PEEP, respectively. After correction for body mass index the difference between medians (2.9 cm<sup>2</sup>) was statistically significant (confidence interval 0.2&#x02013;7.6 cm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). In the group given F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.8, in which seven patients were ex- or current smokers, the median area of atelectasis was 8.2 cm<sup>2</sup> (1.8&#x02013;14.7 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p> Compared with conventional ventilation, after correction for obesity, this ventilation strategy reduced the area of postoperative atelectasis in one of the intervention groups but not in the other group, which included a higher proportion of smokers.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Atelectasis</kwd><kwd>CPAP</kwd><kwd>general anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>oxygen fraction</kwd><kwd>PEEP</kwd><kwd>ventilation strategy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="ss1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During general anaesthesia, the combination of reduced functional residual capacity, airway closure, and a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are the main factors implicated in the development of atelectasis, shunt and shunt-like effects that account for the majority of the impaired oxygenation seen during general anaesthesia (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1,2</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that formation of atelectasis during preoxygenation and induction of anaesthesia can be avoided by adding a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) followed by a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3,4</xref>). During emergence from anaesthesia, high concentrations of oxygen (&#x02018;postoxygenation&#x02019;) predispose to atelectasis formation (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Even a recruitment manoeuvre, followed by ventilation with F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 with a PEEP/CPAP of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O until extubation, failed to improve postoperative oxygenation compared with that achieved with zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This failure may have been caused by the presence of lung regions with high oxygen concentrations, which are prone to collapse shortly after extubation and the discontinuation of CPAP. We hypothesized that by inducing and discontinuing anaesthesia during CPAP/PEEP and deliberately reducing F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> after extubation, postoperative atelectasis would be reduced compared with standard protocols. We also designed the study with two intervention groups differing in oxygen concentration to investigate if, in the longer term, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 0.8 confers any benefit over F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 in reducing the area of atelectasis. To test our hypothesis, we studied 1) a control group with no CPAP/PEEP and an F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 while breathing spontaneously after extubation; and 2) two intervention groups that were on CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O from induction to extubation, one group receiving an F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 and the other F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.8 until extubation, and then in both groups an F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 0.3 via a face-mask while on CPAP after extubation. Computed tomography (CT), undertaken in the immediate postoperative period, was used to investigate the degree of atelectasis, and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.21 was measured to estimate differences in oxygenation during mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="ss2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="ss3" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>The Regional Ethics Committee (Uppsala, Sweden, protocol D-nr 2008/251) approved the study (2008-10-23), and all patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) gave their written informed consent for participation.

The Primus Draeger (built-in PEEP: 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) (Draeger Medical Ag &#x00026; Co.

Neuromuscular function was monitored using a neuromuscular train-of-four (TOF) monitor from Draeger (Medical Ag &#x00026; Co. KG) or the TOF-Watch S (Organon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland). Target-controlled infusions (TCI) of propofol and remifentanil were delivered by target-controlled infusers, the Care Fusion (Alaris Medical UK Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) or the Agilia Injectomat TIVA (Fresenius Vial, Brezius, France).

After 1 min a TCI of propofol was started at 2 &#x003bc;g/mL. Three minutes after the start of preoxygenation, the propofol infusion was increased to 6 &#x003bc;g/mL, and a TCI of remifentanil was started at 4 ng/mL. To facilitate endotracheal intubation, rocuronium was given at 0.5 mg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). During anaesthesia induction, the patients were hydrated with Ringer acetate to reduce the risk of post-induction hypotension. After intubation, the TCI infusions of propofol and remifentanil were reduced to match the level of surgical stimulation, according to the clinical signs of the depth of anaesthesia.

When spontaneous breathing ceased during induction in the control group, the anaesthesiologist inflated the lungs manually. After intubation, the patients were given volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) with ZEEP.</p><p>In the intervention groups, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was either 1.0 or 0.8 during preoxygenation and induction, and the ventilator was used in the pressure support mode with a CPAP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. When spontaneous breathing subsided during induction, the ventilator mode was shifted to pressure control ventilation (PCV), and the former CPAP level was transformed automatically to the same PEEP level.</p><p>After endotracheal intubation, the patients in the intervention groups were continuously ventilated in PCV with a PEEP level of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. After confirmation of successful intubation, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was reduced to 0.40 (in nitrogen) in all groups. The minute ventilation was monitored to keep <sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> concentration as constant as possible at approximately 5%, with the respiratory frequency set between 8 and 11 breaths per minute and the tidal volume set to approximately 6 mL/kg IBW. Fresh gas flow was set to 8 L/min during induction and to 1 L/min during maintenance of anaesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="ss8"><title>Ventilation during emergence from anaesthesia</title><p>After completion of surgery, F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was set to the same level as during anaesthesia induction with a fresh gas flow of 8 L/min in all three groups. The patients in the control group were extubated after establishing spontaneous breathing, and they were given F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 via face-mask after extubation. The patients in the intervention groups were extubated in the same manner as the control group, but they were given a CPAP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O applied via face-mask immediately after extubation. Within a few seconds, as soon as the anaesthesiologist could confirm a free upper airway, the F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was lowered to 0.30, and spontaneous breathing with CPAP continued, aiming at a F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#x02264; 0.30. The duration of mask ventilation after extubation was recorded for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="ss9"><title>Ventilation during transport to and in the radiology department</title><p>Postoperatively, SpO<sub>2</sub> was measured continuously. During this period, all patients were awake and breathed room air spontaneously. Patients were given extra oxygen if they did not fulfil the recommendations of the British Thoracic Society (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), i.e. if the SpO<sub>2</sub> was &#x0003c;94%.</p></sec><sec id="ss10"><title>Oxygenation</title><p>During air breathing, SpO<sub>2</sub> was recorded when patients were positioned supine on the operating table just before the start of preoxygenation. Oxygenation was measured on two occasions during maintenance of anaesthesia: firstly, during stable anaesthesia approximately 20 min after the start of preoxygenation and, secondly, under stable anaesthesia conditions approximately 40 min later. The tests were performed after reducing the F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to 0.21 (air). The fresh gas flow was set to 12&#x02013;18 L/min during the tests, to shorten the time for establishing a new steady state for F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. When F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reached 0.21 and a new matching level of F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was established after about 1 min, the observations of F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub> continued for approximately 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="ss11"><title>CT</title><p>Aeration and area of atelectasis in the lungs were studied by CT (Philips MX8000 Quad; Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands, or GE LightSpeed VCT XTe; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). During awakening, the time-frame from the final removal of the face-mask, with the patient still on the operating table, to completion of the CT scan in the Radiology department was measured in all patients. All patients were placed horizontally on the CT table in the supine position with their arms parallel to their body. A basal single-slice transverse scan, 5 mm thick, 10&#x02013;20 mm above the dome of the right diaphragm was performed for each patient. The scan was located in the proper position following a scouting scan of the lungs. Both the scouting and the basal scan were carried out while the patients held their breath after a normal expiration. A radiologist, blinded to the group affiliation of the patients, measured the area of atelectasis. Calculations of the atelectasis area in each basal scan were made using the region of interest (ROI) program present in the CT computer software. For tracing the area of atelectasis, the window level and width were set at &#x02013;500 and &#x000b1;1,500 Hounsfield units, respectively. Atelectasis was defined as an area with attenuation values between &#x02013;100 and +100 Hounsfield units and was expressed in square centimetres and in percentage of the total area of the lung at the basal scan. The dorsal border was traced manually between the atelectasis and the pleura. The ventral border was drawn a few centimetres above the dense area, and the area of atelectasis was calculated using the software program. Each ROI was redrawn twice and the mean value was used.</p></sec><sec id="ss12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The main dependent variable, the area of postoperative atelectasis, determined the sample size. Based on earlier studies, it was predicted that a difference of 50% in the area of atelectasis could be achieved between groups, which would require 10 patients in each group, assuming &#x003b1; = 0.05 and 1 &#x02013; &#x003b2; = 0.8.</p><p>Because of the small number of patients, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to test the median difference between groups. The difference in SpO<sub>2</sub> between the awake state and during anaesthesia for all patients and the differences between groups during anaesthesia and postoperatively were analysed with the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss13"><title>Results</title><p>With the exception of their smoking habits, the groups were similar in demographic and physiological data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>).

However, the number of previous and current smokers in this group was significantly higher than in the control group given F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 without CPAP/PEEP.</p><sec id="ss15"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>This study was planned to detect a difference in the area of atelectasis of at least 50%, so an actual difference of 40% reached a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.07. The only modifying factor that has previously been proven to increase the area of atelectasis is a high BMI. It was assumed that the randomization procedure would render the impact of BMI equal between groups, but it was not. However, the primary result was so close to being statistically significant, which can be inferred from the confidence interval, that a small and justified correction for the difference in the uneven BMI effect between the two groups given an F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 moved the confidence interval and the <italic>p</italic> value was lowered to 0.04.</p><p>That age was also found to be a modifying factor, increasing the area of atelectasis, has not been shown before. Overall, the sample size was too small to accommodate for uneven distribution of known (BMI) or unproven (age, smoking?) effect modifiers, exposing the results to the risk of making a type 2 error.</p></sec><sec id="ss16"><title>General considerations</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive ventilation strategy, from preoxygenation and induction of anaesthesia to spontaneous breathing after awakening from anaesthesia, on the immediate postoperative area of atelectasis. The ambition was to keep the lung open for the whole perioperative period without relying on an RM. There were three major differences between the control and the intervention groups: 1) the mode of controlled ventilation; 2) the use of CPAP/PEEP; and 3) the level of F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The design of the study therefore precludes any definitive conclusions regarding the separate importance of these factors. However, they were selected based on findings from previous studies and compared with a control group, representing the historical appearances of a conventional ventilation strategy with an F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 during preoxygenation, without CPAP/PEEP, with VCV and a high F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during postoxygenation.</p><p>Despite a clear effect on atelectasis formation, the preventive effect of our investigated strategy might have been even more obvious had the technique of applying CPAP via a face-mask been more effective. In practice, leaks occurred that could have lowered the airway pressure from the target 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The leaks also made F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> readings at the end of mask ventilation less reliable. It is also possible that our chosen level of CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was not high enough to keep the airways open in some patients. A CPAP level of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O during induction has been shown to prevent early formation of atelectasis in patients up to a BMI of 27 (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but we included patients with a BMI up to 31. In a study of anaesthetized patients with a mean BMI of 26.7, only a minor degree of atelectasis was found 10 min after a vital capacity manoeuvre and a PEEP level of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O with 100% oxygen (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In another study, a PEEP level of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was found to be optimal with regard to the best compliance and the smallest dead space fraction (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, although a PEEP level of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O might be optimal during stable anaesthesia after expanding the lungs, we chose 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O to facilitate spontaneous breathing and patient comfort, especially during awakening, and to reduce the risk of hypotension during induction and intubation. We realize that the technique can be improved, and that it might be better to adjust the level of CPAP/PEEP for each patient to optimize prevention of atelectasis.</p></sec><sec id="ss17"><title>The impact of BMI and age</title><p>We found no significant correlation between BMI and atelectasis, although previous studies found a weak correlation (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13,14</xref>). It is probable that the use of a CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O reduced the impact of overweight on atelectasis formation. However, because of reduced variance the difference in atelectasis formation between groups became statistically significant after adjusting for BMI.</p><p>Age was found to be a risk factor for the formation of atelectasis. To understand this finding, it is necessary to comprehend the relationship between airway closure and age. With increasing age, the amount of airway closure within the tidal volume increases, which is presumably the main explanation for the reduced oxygenation of arterial blood with increasing age (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). One would thus predict more atelectasis in older persons, but this has not been shown previously. The explanation may be that with a greater degree of airway closure, preoxygenation takes a little longer in the older person (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16,17</xref>). If preoxygenation is short and the minute ventilation low, as could be the case with heavy premedication, older patients will have less denitrogenation of the lungs, which may counteract the collapse of the alveoli behind the closed airways. More efficient denitrogenation using CPAP may thus promote the formation of atelectasis, and if more time is allowed for the older patient to reach the same F<sub>ET</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during preoxygenation as the younger patient, atelectasis may become more apparent in the older patient.</p></sec><sec id="ss18"><title>Smoking</title><p>Smoking was more common in the group given 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O CPAP/PEEP and F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 0.8, in spite of randomization. A link between smoking in clinically lung-healthy subjects and anaesthesia-induced atelectasis has not been previously described. Therefore, several months after completion of the study, every patient was contacted and a more in-depth interview regarding smoking habits and postoperative respiratory problems was carried out. No patient reported a postoperative respiratory problem. In another recent study we have demonstrated, in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, that patients smoking more than six pack-years constituted a subgroup of patients with more atelectasis (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss19"><title>Oxygenation</title><p>The lack of difference between groups in SpO<sub>2</sub> postoperatively, despite the difference in the amount of atelectasis, might be because the accuracy of the SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate a small difference in oxygenation. Even though all groups presented some atelectasis, in two patients as much as 10% of the lung CT area in dependent parts of the lungs, almost all patients fulfilled the British Thoracic Society recommendation for SpO<sub>2</sub> without being given extra oxygen, and all patients were in good clinical condition. A previous study (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), investigating the effect on postoperative atelectasis of different F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> before tracheal extubation, found an even higher level of atelectasis than in our study. All patients in that study also had a SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265; 94% while breathing air. As atelectasis consists of compressed lung tissue, the amount of lung that has collapsed during and after &#x02018;uneventful&#x02019; anaesthesia is in fact larger than the detected area of atelectasis, close to 15% on average and exceeding 30%&#x02013;40% in some cases (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It is also notable that a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 94% when breathing air can be observed with a shunt fraction of approximately 15%, assuming &#x02018;normal&#x02019; values for the other variables in the shunt equation (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19,20</xref>). This will go unnoticed if SpO<sub>2</sub> is the only variable monitored.</p></sec><sec id="ss20"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The recommendation for optimal preoxygenation differs, but a period of 3 min is often advocated (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We chose to preoxygenate for only 1 min, as this is in fact a common procedure when not anticipating a difficult induction. A longer period of preoxygenation should increase the alveolar oxygen concentration, thus making the lungs more vulnerable to early collapse (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Reducing the time for preoxygenation probably influenced alveolar oxygen concentration more in the control group than in the intervention groups, since no CPAP was used in the control group. This, if anything, should reduce the difference in atelectasis between the control and study groups. More atelectasis might have been observed in the controls if preoxygenation had been longer.</p><p>The control group was given VCV during maintenance of anaesthesia, as opposed to PCV in the intervention groups. The ventilation mode in the control group was chosen to make this group comparable with previous studies. The ventilation mode in the intervention group was chosen for practical purposes, as it made the transition from spontaneous breathing to controlled ventilation easy, setting the right values for PCV from the preceding values for pressure support ventilation and CPAP. No advantage has been shown per se for PCV over VCV (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23,24</xref>), and we believe that the difference in ventilation mode had little influence on the results.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that a ventilation strategy with CPAP/PEEP and F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 1.0 during induction of and emergence from anaesthesia, followed by CPAP and low oxygen concentration via a face-mask after extubation, was successful in reducing the amount of postoperative atelectasis in non-smoking patients. CPAP is relatively simple to implement during induction of anaesthesia but might be more difficult after extubation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Anders Nydahl, MD, PhD, Chief of Staff and Lena Lundgren, CRNA, Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University Hospital, &#x000d6;rebro, Sweden for their support and skilful assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold><italic>Declaration of interest:</italic></bold> This study was financially supported by intramural departmental funding (both Departments of Anaesthesiology), and from the Centre for Clinical Research.
