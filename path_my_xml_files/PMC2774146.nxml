In addition, an area was left untreated but was occluded to provide a baseline control sample. Test products were applied to clean skin on days 1, 4 and 8 of the assay. RA (0&#x000b7;025%; Retin-A&#x000ae; cream; Janssen-Cilag Ltd, Beerse, Belgium; 20 &#x003bc;L) was applied to an untreated site on day 8 and left <italic>in situ</italic> for 4 days to avoid potential complications of irritancy caused by extended occlusion. On day 12, the Finn chambers were removed and 3-mm punch biopsies were obtained under 1% lignocaine local anaesthesia from each test site. Biopsied tissue was embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek&#x000ae;; Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN, U.S.A.), snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C prior to immunohistochemical analyses.

Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. These were: mouse antihuman fibrillin-1 (clone 11C1.3; Neomarkers, Union City, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1 : 100; rat antihuman procollagen-1 (pCI) (clone M-58; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1 : 1000; or mouse antihuman MMP-1 (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA, U.S.A.) diluted 1 : 100. Negative controls were by incubation of isotype sera at the appropriate concentration or omission of the primary antibody. Sections were washed in TBS prior to incubation with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min. Antibody staining was visualized using a well-characterized immunoperoxidase reaction (VectaStain&#x000ae;<italic>Elite</italic> ABC system; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) utilizing Vector SG&#x000ae; as chromogen. Following light counterstaining with nuclear fast red, sections were serially dehydrated and permanently mounted. Stained sections were randomized, blinded and examined on a Nikon OPTIPHOT microscope (Tokyo, Japan). The degree of immunostaining for fibrillin-1 and pCI was assessed as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> In brief, a five-point semiquantitative scale was used where 0 = no staining and 4 = maximal staining within the experiment. The numbers of epidermal keratinocytes positive for MMP-1 were quantified per high-power field (hpf; &#x000d7; 400). Four sections (including control) were examined per subject, per site, per treatment and the average score calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomized controlled trial</title><p>Sixty healthy but photoaged volunteers were recruited to this study (11 men, 49 women; age range 45&#x02013;80 years). All test products were supplied in identically packaged, coded containers so that the investigators and subjects were unaware as to the treatment. Subjects were randomly allocated to self-treatment with either the vehicle formulation or the test product as described by a randomization programme (StatsDirect Ltd, Altrincham, U.K.) and instructed on the use of their allotted cream&#x02014;daily evening application to the entire face and dorsa of the hands, including the wrists and extensor forearm, for 6 months. Clinical assessments of the skin of the face and dorsal hands were performed for all participants at baseline and following 1, 3 and 6 months of product use. The following four parameters were assessed at each visit: fine lines and wrinkles, dyspigmentation, overall clinical grade of photoageing and tactile roughness. The degree of fine lines and wrinkles, dyspigmentation and the overall level of photoageing were scored according to the well-characterized Griffiths photonumeric scale for photoaged skin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> The scale ranges from 0 to 8, where 0 represents no evidence of photoageing and 8 represents the most severe photoageing. Pigment was assessed on a similar 0&#x02013;8 scale, where 0 denotes a uniform coloration of the skin with absence of photoageing-related colour change and 8 represents severe dyspigmentation. Likewise, tactile roughness was scored on the treated areas from 0 to 8, where 0 represents totally smooth skin with no rough patches and 8 represents very roughened skin.</p><p>In addition, 28 subjects provided 3-mm skin biopsies from the dorsal wrist at the beginning and end of the 6-month study period (vehicle formulation, <italic>n</italic>=13; test product, <italic>n</italic>=15).

This improvement is associated with restoration of fibrillin-1, the major component of fibrillin-rich microfibrils, in product-treated skin.</p><p>In these studies, we performed a double-blind RCT to assess whether or not an over-the-counter cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product can produce clinically significant improvement in the appearance of photoaged facial skin. The trial was executed to the highest standards, with study creams coded and randomized at source, and with the volunteers, investigators and independent statistician &#x02018;blind&#x02019; to the coding until after study completion and initial data analysis. We did not observe any benefit of the vehicle or test product on the appearance of mottled dyspigmentation or actinic lentigines associated with photoageing. Expert clinical assessments (S.O., J.Y.B.) showed that subjects treated with the vehicle formulation had improved skin texture compared with that observed at their recruitment, but did not exhibit any change in the appearance of their facial wrinkles. Those treated with the test product showed improvements in both skin texture (compared with their baseline clinical assessment) and, more importantly, in the appearance of facial wrinkles. This improvement in the appearance of facial wrinkles became significant only after 12 months of daily product use comparing between groups. It is interesting to note, however, that when compared with the baseline, the test product did lead to a noticeable clinical improvement in facial wrinkles (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#x000b7;013) in 43% of treated individuals after 6 months, compared with only 22% of those treated with the vehicle where there was no significant improvement in appearance (<italic>P</italic> = 0&#x000b7;11). In a comparison between groups, this improvement was not statistically significant but does indicate that larger clinical trials of cosmetic products might be expected to show useful clinical improvement after 6 months&#x02019; use. The data from this study are indicative that cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; products can result in noticeable clinical improvement in facial wrinkles. To our knowledge, this is the first time such benefits have been reported for a commercially available cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product and paves the way for larger studies with more statistical power.</p><p>In addition, we examined the distribution of a key biomarker of photoageing&#x02014;loss of fibrillin-1 in the papillary dermis&#x02014;in skin samples obtained during the RCT. Fibrillin-1 is the major glycoprotein component of fibrillin-rich microfibrils (oxytalan fibres). Skin treated with the test product contained significantly more fibrillin-rich microfibrils in the papillary dermis than either the baseline samples or those treated with the vehicle (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;019). Our previous research, which demonstrated that an over-the-counter cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product can bring about increased fibrillin-1 deposition in the papillary dermis, used a short-term, exaggerated-use patch test assay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> In the current study, we sought to determine whether results obtained using such an experimental system were predictive of clinical improvement following long-term use of such a product.</p><p>Consumers purchasing cosmetic skin care products&#x02014;particularly those purporting &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; properties&#x02014;are presented with a broad choice of available products and only limited data regarding their efficacy. The situation is further complicated for consumers by the use of trademarked proprietary names for ingredients and the relative lack of published long-term studies to demonstrate product performance. We previously sought to investigate if a cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product can have a measurable effect on fibrillin-1 and established that histological improvement could be achieved in a short-term exaggerated-use assay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The results from that study were indicative of some degree of structural change in the skin following use of a cosmetic but provided no evidence for actual clinical improvement. To address this question, the current study compared the use of a commercially available cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; skincare serum to its vehicle and has shown that such a product is capable of bringing about a clinical improvement in the appearance of photoaged skin when used for 12 months.</p><p>The difference in efficacy between the vehicle and the test product demonstrates that a correctly formulated skincare product can deliver clinically relevant skin improvement, above that delivered by the vehicle base. The studied product contains the retinol ester, retinyl palmitate, together with natural plant extracts, peptides and lipopeptides and antioxidants. Other authors have shown evidence for the role of many of these cosmetic ingredients in protecting against mechanisms that lead to dermal degradation, such as increased MMP activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and stimulating repair of dermal components.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> It was our belief that a combination of ingredients with activities known to address the multiple changes which occur in photoaged skin (degradation of collagen and elastin, the appearance of surface wrinkling and textural changes) may be beneficial in a cosmetic product when used long term. Specifically, the retinyl palmitate, palmitoyl peptides and <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> extracts have been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to lead to deposition of collagen 1 in model skin systems and the extract of white lupin has been shown to inhibit MMP-1 (S.P. Long, unpublished data). In our previous study using the 12-day assay, a similar product induced deposition of pCI as well as fibrillin, together with inhibition of MMPs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> These data suggest that the long-term benefits described here may be due to a combination of actions. The product does not contain sunscreens, so the visible skin improvements cannot be attributed to photoprotection of the skin. Further work is underway to elucidate the relative contributions of the individual ingredients.</p><p>The finding that a clinically relevant improvement in the appearance of photoaged skin was demonstrated with long-term use of a commercially available cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product may cause some to question whether such effects are within the definition of a cosmetic. Improvement in the appearance of wrinkles is considered to be a cosmetic action, as the effect is localized to the skin and is not concerned with treatment or correction of a disease condition. Several other authors report that application of cosmetic products leads to changes in skin physiology, including changes in barrier function,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> stratum corneum thickness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and lipidogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and that cumulative effects of cosmetic products are possible, a principle demonstrated for skin moisturization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and recognized by regulatory authorities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> When compared with the long-term clinical effects of topical RA, it can be seen that the degree of improvement offered by a cosmetic product is still markedly less than that which is achievable with a prescribed medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></p><p>In conclusion, these studies provide evidence that use of an over-the-counter cosmetic &#x02018;anti-ageing&#x02019; product is able to induce clinically identifiable improvement in the appearance of facial wrinkles following long-term use. This improvement is associated with deposition of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in the papillary dermis of treated skin. The study further supports the use of fibrillin-1 in a short-term assay as a biomarker for assessing efficacy of potential photoageing repair products.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Independent statistical analysis of the RCT phase of this study was provided by Chirostat Statistical Consulting, Nottingham, U.K. The authors would also like to acknowledge the helpful and insightful comments by Mr I.
