However, there is a lack of knowledge about the acceptance of detection and intervention procedures. These analyses describe the attitudes of general physicians [GPs] toward 1) dementia in general, 2) systematic detection of people with dementia, and 3) an intervention approach after they have experienced both.

In this trial, systematic screening is implemented and an intervention group receives support through dementia care management (DCM). GPs were categorized into either GPs with DCM and systematic screening (DCM-GP), GPs with systematic screening only (DelpHi-GP), or GPs not participating in the trial.

Adequate treatment and support of these people is a major challenge for the health care system. Among the specific challenges, the early detection of symptomatic dementia as well as the integration of the patients into the existing structures are provided by the health care system. The majority of people with dementia live at home<xref rid="b1-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and more than 99% of patients with dementia (PWD) living at home consult their primary care physician at least once a year.<xref rid="b2-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Thus, the appropriate setting for the early detection of dementia and the integration into the dementia-specific treatment seems to be the general physician (GP).<xref rid="b3-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is empirical evidence that GPs consider dementia care as a relevant topic and attitudes toward caring for people with dementia are positive.<xref rid="b4-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> GPs have been described to be dedicated to and concerned with caring for their PWD.<xref rid="b5-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, surveys indicate that there is a need to improve the detection process, the inclusion of caregivers, with a very few participants agreeing that this is already happening to the appropriate degree.</p><p>Early detection of symptomatic dementia is one of the most important determinants for the therapy of the disease.<xref rid="b6-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The World Alzheimer report 2011 states that the earlier a diagnosis is known for that the patients can be treated better medically, patients and their family members can adapt to the disease and learn to deal with it and its sequela.<xref rid="b7-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This concept is adapted in current guidelines which highlight the necessity of a formal dementia diagnosis for appropriate syndromic and etiological treatment.<xref rid="b8-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Early diagnosis also leads to higher cost-effectivity, which will further improve, if treatments and social care interventions become more effective in the future.<xref rid="b9-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In a primary care setting in Germany, only approximately 40% of patients screened positive for dementia in primary care had been formally diagnosed with dementia.<xref rid="b10-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Clearly, detection of symptomatic dementia in primary care needs to be improved. However, the implementation of routine screening for dementia is discussed controversially;<xref rid="b11-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and not recommended in current dementia guidelines, because there is still a lack of evidence that patients benefit from it.<xref rid="b14-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Conducting systematic screenings increases dementia diagnoses in routine care.<xref rid="b18-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> One screening study has been conducted to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of brief screening instruments to detect dementia in community-dwelling people or primary care patients.<xref rid="b14-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> While the diagnosis of dementia has often been associated with fears and stigma in an anecdotal study,<xref rid="b7-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> approximately 70% of older German people agree to be screened for dementia.<xref rid="b20-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In USA, even more than 80% are interested in screenings.<xref rid="b22-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, there are important disadvantages of systematic screenings. First, screenings are limited in their use, since most of the screenings neither provide norms for age, sex, and education nor can they provide clues toward differential diagnoses. Second, their limited specificity leads to a high rate of false positives.<xref rid="b23-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> False-positive diagnoses can give rise to unnecessary medical interventions and costs for the health care system and may cause negative personal consequences for the patients and their relatives, including fears and social stigma.</p><p>While there is evidence about the benefits of early detection and subsequent provision of adequate treatment and care,<xref rid="b25-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> there is a lack of knowledge about the acceptance of detection and intervention procedures among people applying those or being affected by those, ie, the care provider. Most studies assess attitudes toward screening without indicating whether or not there has been any previous experience with it. Furthermore, studies relate early detection with improved outcomes without giving details about the means how these were achieved. This information however, is crucial to the implementation process of new concepts.</p><p>An innovative concept to encounter these challenges is the provision of dementia care management (DCM).<xref rid="b26-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> DCM aims to provide &#x0201c;optimum care&#x0201d; by integrating multi-professional and multimodal strategies to individualize and optimize treatment of dementia within the framework of the established health care and social service system. The intervention is conducted by Dementia Care Managers &#x02013; nurses with dementia-specific training &#x02013; at the people&#x02019;s homes after having been systematically detected by GPs in their routine care. Based on German guidelines for evidence-based diagnoses and the treatment of dementia, in a first step, a comprehensive assessment of the care situation, needs and resources is conducted. After this, the DCM develops and implements an intervention plan tailored to the individual conditions and unmet needs in close cooperation with the GP and monitors its implementation. This concept is being evaluated in primary care close to routine since 2012 involving more than 130 GPs who gained experience regarding systematic detection and approximately half of them also in providing integrated care based on DCM.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of the current analyses are: 1) to describe attitudes toward systematic detection of people with dementia by GPs with experience in conducting screening in routine care, 2) to describe attitudes toward an intervention approach (DCM) to integrate people with dementia into the care system by GPs with experience with this approach in routine care, and 3) to compare general attitudes toward dementia care between GPs with specific experience in systematic detection/integrated care and GPs without this specific experience.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sample</title><p>This analysis is part of the on-going, randomized, controlled, prospective intervention DelpHi-MV trial (Dementia: life- and person-centered help in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania [MV]<xref rid="b28-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) involving more than 130 primary care physician practices<xref rid="b26-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (Trial registration: NCT01401582; approved by the Ethical Committee of the Chamber of Physicians of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, registry number BB 20/11).

In addition to the questionnaire, a cover letter was provided explaining on what grounds the participant was chosen (publicly available address list of GPs, or having been participant of the DelpHi-study in which the informed consent explicitly allows recontacting for further studies/analyses). Participation in this survey was voluntary. GPs were informed that they could actively decline to participate (full address details were given in the cover letter) or decline by not responding. GP practices who did not respond in any way until the time of analysis were not contacted again. There are no consequences (neither positive nor negative) associated with participation or non participation in this survey. Subsequent to the assignment to either subgroup, all questionnaires were pseudonymized.</p><p>The respondents of this survey were on average 54 years of age and 56% of them were females. The majority of them (70%) were treating patients in single residency, GP care on average for 1,241 patients per quarter year. On average, 60 PWD were treated per quarter.

There was strong agreement toward the helpfulness of implementing a brief cognitive screening test (M=4.4, 89.9% agreed). The agreement toward the feasibility of the screening test used in the study was high (m=3.9) with 85.6%. When asked whether a systematic screening for all elderly patients is useful, agreement was similarly high (m=3.8) with disagreement of approximately 13%. There was a difference between DCM-GP and DelpHi-GP in this item with 70% of the DCM-GP agreeing while only 55.2% of the DelpHi-GP are agreeing. However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. The majority of respondents indicated that they would keep on using brief screening tests for early identification (m=4.3) even after the DelpHi-trial, again with higher agreement in the group of the DCM-GP (85%) compared to the DelpHi-GP (72.4%). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Approximately two-thirds of the respondents indicated that they had identified at least some patients as being cognitively impaired for the first time by using the screening test.

In both cases, the GPs in MV showed an attitude similar to the DCM-GP, seeing dementia detection and treatment and the detection process more positive (3.6 and 3.7, respectively).

The regression analyses did not reach significant results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, this was the first study to analyze attitudes toward dementia detection and treatment in primary care in Germany with GPs having conducted systematic screening/identification and experienced subsequent, systematic, comprehensive DCM. The results indicated that a procedure for early recognition was highly appreciated by GPs and was considered feasible to be implemented in routine care. The GPs indicated that systematic screening helps to identify people with cognitive impairments the GPs did not identify before. There was high agreement to extend the systematic identification procedure even after recruitment for the trial has stopped. Agreement toward the implementation of a systematic identification tool, however, seemed to be higher in GPs who were offered DCM. This is an important evidence to be considered in the discussion about pros and cons of the implementation of early identification or screening for dementia. Our results implied that the attitude toward early detection is more positive in GPs who have a systematic access to adequate subsequent treatment and care as provided in the intervention group of the DelpHi-study. It made sense to the GPs to systematically identify PWD in routine care, but the consequences have to be taken care of in a similar systematic way.</p><p>DCM as defined and conducted in this study (DCM<xref rid="b26-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-jmdh-9-183" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) has been supporting GPs and was considered as a relieve in routine care by participating GPs. The integral parts of the DCM such as home visits, systematically identifying care needs, systematic and written feedback to the GP, evidence-based recommendations, etc were well accepted and appreciated. The GP thought that the patients and caregivers benefit from DCM likewise. The specifically qualified nurses were regarded as competent; time spent with them was considered as a useful investment. A continuation of the cooperation and even the introduction of DCM as a basic service in routine care are requested by the majority of the respondents.</p><p>However in interpreting our results, some methodological limitations have to be considered. First, we cannot rule out that the agreement toward study procedures was distorted by social desirability. Even though participation in the survey was voluntary and the data analysis was pseudonymized, respondents might have tended to more positive statements since they knew personally the authors of the survey as well as the study staff whose work was to be rated. Second, a selection bias in our sample under analysis might be a threat to the validity of our results. One selection bias could be linked to the recruitment procedure of the original trial. We cannot rule out that GPs who were already more supportive of early recognition or DCM participated in our trial since participation was voluntary. However, such a selection bias should have caused rather more and bigger differences in measuring attitudes and comparing the total sample of GPs and the GPs in our trial. Another selection bias could be due to the fact that not all of the GPs participating in the DelpHi-trial answered the survey. It might be that GPs disagreeing more with the early recognition or DCM did rather not answer the questionnaire. While this possibility cannot be ruled out, a response rate of over 50% is considerably high for a postal survey in primary care. Furthermore, the questionnaire gave the opportunity to express disagreement as much as agreement, so that we do not think that our results are skewed to any major extent. However, in the light of that, we carefully draw our conclusions, eg, by referring to the respondents more than referring to the GP in general. The second limitation of our study is that we draw conclusions from personal statements that are not backed by objective data. While this is the nature of surveys, it still has to be considered in drawing conclusions and implications for routine care. Even if the GP thinks that, eg, the patient benefits from DCM, our analysis does not provide proof of actual benefits.
