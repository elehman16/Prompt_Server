Recently, a widening of the angle at 750&#x02005;&#x003bc;m from the scleral spur in 15 non-Caucasian patients with acute PAC in a single horizontal cross-section was observed 1&#x02005;hour post-ALPI as an only treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>When treating acute angle closure cases, ALPI has shown to be more effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) than systemic medications immediately after an angle closure attack.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The IOP control following ALPI was maintained over a 3-month period.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The mechanism of lowering of IOP by ALPI is likely to be mainly due to reduction of the area of trabecular meshwork that is occluded by the iris. The effect of ALPI on diurnal intraocular pressure (DIOP) fluctuation has not been investigated. We have shown previously that there is an inverse association between DIOP fluctuation and the dimensions of the anterior chamber angle in untreated patients with a diagnosis of primary angle closure suspect (PACS) or PAC in both eyes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Considering the use of ALPI in the clinical management of patients with occludable angles, it is important to understand if ALPI affects DIOP fluctuation in addition to the dimensions of the anterior chamber angle.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal change in anterior chamber angle anatomy following ALPI in eyes with gonioscopically occludable angles post-LPI compared with eyes receiving no further treatment, using swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Additionally, the effect of ALPI treatment on DIOP fluctuation (maximum-minimum IOP) was also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a longitudinal, prospective, double-randomised research study as part of the Investigating Management of Primary Angle Closure and Treatment (IMPACT) study. The aim of the IMPACT study is to identify factors that affect risk of conversion between PACS, PAC and PACG as well as to understand the effects of laser iridotomy and argon laser iridoplasty on the dimensions of anterior chamber in those eyes. IOP and the presence or absence of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) are used to categorise a patient into differing diagnostic categories. These categories reflect a differing risk for glaucoma-categorised individuals such as PACS, where only an occludable angle is present, and PAC, in which PAS and/or a raised IOP are additionally observed.</p><p>Forty Caucasian consecutive patients newly referred to a hospital glaucoma service with a gonioscopic diagnosis (&#x0003c;180&#x000b0; posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork visible on applanation gonioscopy) of bilateral PAC, PACS or a combination of both conditions and no other ocular comorbidity were recruited to the IMPACT study.</p><p>LPI procedures were performed by a single operator (RB) using a standard technique with superior placement of the iridotomy in a randomly allocated eye of each patient. The randomisation allowed the untreated eye to be used as control and patients were closely monitored for the duration of the study to monitor for signs of progression. The mean total power used to perform the iridotomy was 16.11&#x02005;mJ (SD 10.8&#x02005;mJ) and the mean number of shots was 13 (SD 8.6 mJ). A patent iridotomy post-LPI was present in all the treated eyes post-LPI and throughout the study. Patency was tested at the slit-lamp using a retroillumination technique.</p><p>The second randomisation (where eyes with gonioscopically closed anterior chamber angles were randomised to ALPI or no further treatment) took place 3&#x02005;months post-LPI. A gonioscopically occludable anterior chamber angle was defined as an angle in which 180&#x000b0; or more of the posterior trabecular meshwork was obscured on applanation gonioscopy. Gonioscopy examination was performed by a single examiner (RB) using standardised protocol. Patients were followed after ALPI treatment for 3&#x02005;months with regular SS-OCT measurements and single IOP measurements until the final visit for DIOP measurements. A gonioscopically occludable anterior chamber angle was defined as an angle in which 180&#x000b0; or more of the posterior trabecular meshwork was obscured on applanation gonioscopy. An overview of the patient pathway is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2016308720F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BJOPHTHALMOL2016308720F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic of IMPACT study pathway.

Twenty laser spots were applied using the following laser settings: 0.5&#x02005;s duration, 500&#x02005;&#x000b5; spot size and 180&#x02013;300&#x02005;mW power.</p><p>Three-dimensional SS-OCT (Casia SS-1000 optical coherence tomograph; Tomey, Nagoya, Japan) images were obtained on the same day as the IOP measurements. A three-dimensional image of the anterior segment of the patient's eye was obtained by high-speed scanning without making a contact with the eye. The infrared measurement laser emitted to the patient&#x02019;s eye resulted in the acquired tomographic image of the eye displayed on the OCT monitor. After measurements were completed, the data were automatically transferred to the computer.</p><p>The scans were taken in darkness (between 0.3 and 0.5 lux) and the images taken were subsequently analysed using the commercially available software with this instrument. Image acquisition was always by the same examiner and an ophthalmologist subspecialising in glaucoma performed all the gonioscopic examinations (RB). The scleral spur position was identified manually by two independent observers with good concordance. The observers were not masked to the intervention and in case of disagreement, a third observer was asked to review the position of the scleral spur.</p><p>The analysis of SS-OCT images involved calculation of the following parameters in each eye: the angle opening distance (AOD), the trabecular-iris angle (TIA), the angle recess area (ARA) and the trabecular-iris space area (TISA). Eight sectors (superior, superonasal, nasal, inferonasal, inferior, inferotemporal, temporal and superotemporal) for every eye with their corresponding eight parameters (AOD, ARA, TISA and TIA, each at 500 and 750&#x02005;&#x003bc;m) were assessed with the Casia analysis software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2016308720F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="BJOPHTHALMOL2016308720F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the eight iridotrabecular angle sections under study.

IOP measurements involved Goldmann tonometry (Goldman tonometer AT900; Haag-Streit International, Koeniz, Switzerland) using disposable prisms to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. The same tonometer was used for every IOP measurement for every participant and regular calibration checks were undertaken, with no calibration errors detected during the study. Two IOP measurements were taken per eye, with a maximum of 1&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg difference permitted between these measurements.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software Version 20 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and Microsoft Office Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) with p&#x0003c;0.05 values considered statistically significant. Angle width-related measures at different visits before and after LPI were compared using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, with intervisit difference analysed using Tukey's method.</p><p>Ethical approval by Cambridgeshire Research Ethics Committee (REC) for the IMPACT study was obtained on 3 August 2010 (REC Reference 10/H0301/14). The study was entered on the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) Portfolio on 9 September 2010 (NIHR CRN Study ID: 8955).

In the eyes that underwent ALPI due to the angle remaining gonioscopically occludable, following the ALPI treatment all eyes changed from an occludable gonisocopic configuration 2&#x02005;weeks prior to treatment to a non-occludable configuration maintained for 6&#x02005;weeks following treatment. We observed a statistically significant increase in all angle parameters in all eight sectors under study following ALPI. Leung <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> observed changes in one eye before and after ALPI using OCT imaging, but these changes were not quantified. Recently, Sng <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> evaluated AOD750 and TISA750 parameters in acute PAC eyes following ALPI treatment using time domain OCT. They observed an increase in both of these parameters, with measurements taken in one meridian (nasal-temporal) in a single evaluation at 1&#x02005;hour post-ALPI. The increase in all eight angle parameters in our study was statistically significant and the observed changes were maintained in seven of the eight sectors for at least 3&#x02005;months following ALPI. Some regression of angle parameters was observed at 3&#x02005;months following ALPI, but the changes observed were not statistically significant. This is interesting as although the angle parameters remained stable up to 3&#x02005;months, a longer follow-up may show eventual decrease of the widening effect of ALPI over time. Therefore, a limitation of this study is the length of follow-up necessitated by monitoring the untreated eye as well as not masking the observers to the procedure due to the nature of the study data collection. The only exception was observed in the inferior sector, where a regression towards the baseline was observed for all parameters. It is unclear what might have accounted for the regression in one sector only, but it is possible that it could result from a gravitational effect or alternatively influenced by the positioning of the inferior sector opposite the existing iridotomy site, which may alter the stiffness or flexibility of the iris inferiorly.</p><p>Chew and Yeo<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> investigated the IOP levels of 11 ALPI-treated PACG participants whose angles remained occludable following LPI. They observed an initial reduction of IOP during the first week post-treatment, but a final comparison with baseline at 6&#x02005;months following treatment showed a maintained decrease in IOP in only seven of the treated eyes. However, it is difficult to compare these results with our data as the time of day for the IOP assessment was not specified, their patients had PACG and it was not evident that the timing of the IOP measurement was kept constant from visit to visit. Attention to this detail has been demonstrated to reduce the intervisit variability in IOP measures.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Similar limitations may apply in a recent study by Sun <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> where 158 PAC/PACG participants were randomised into two groups as follows: (1) LPI alone or (2) LPI followed by ALPI. The IOP in the study was measured at baseline and at seven more visits during the following year. The authors report a reduction in absolute IOP of approximately 6.7&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in the LPI-treated group and 7.8&#x02005;mmHg in the LPI plus ALPI group 12&#x02005;months following the laser treatment. However, it is not clear if these IOP measurements were taken at the same time of the day as in the prelaser visit and therefore whether the observed reduction in IOP following the laser procedures would fall within the limits of the patient's usual diurnal IOP fluctuation. Lee <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> randomised one eye to receive LPI and the fellow eye to receive LPI plus ALPI (same setting) in patients with bilateral PACS and reported that the anterior chamber depth measured at 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;mm from the centre of the eye was significantly different between the two treatment groups. The measurements were performed 1&#x02005;week after the procedure and assessed with Pentacam. No statistically significant differences in IOP measurements were found between baseline and 1&#x02005;hour, 1&#x02005;day, 1&#x02005;week, 1&#x02005;month and 3&#x02005;months post-treatment. However, the time of IOP measurement again was not specified. A recent study by Narayanaswamy <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported that in eyes with persistent appositional angle closure and raised IOP, ALPI reduced IOP on average by 4.9&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and in 35% of the patient achieved IOP of &#x0003c;21&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg without medication. However, when assessed at 1&#x02005;year following treatment, ALPI was associated with higher failure rates and lower IOP reduction compared with medical treatment. The comparison of their results with the changes we observe in the angle parameters will be difficult due to the shorter follow-up time and smaller number of patients in our study.</p><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that ALPI is effective in lowering DIOP fluctuation by 1.56&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (p=0.047) at 12&#x02005;weeks post-treatment compared with before treatment. The difference in DIOP fluctuation was due to the lower maximum measurements in the ALPI group (1.87&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, p=0.026) compared with the occludable post-LPI group. Furthermore, in our study the ALPI-treated group of eyes showed the lowest DIOP fluctuation compared with the non-treated control eyes, eyes deemed not occludable post-LPI and eyes that were occludable post-LPI, demonstrating that ALPI significantly reduces DIOP fluctuation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>ALPI increased all angle parameters under investigation in all eight sections in eyes that remained occludable post-LPI. The changes in angle dimension detected using SS-OCT were also confirmed on gonioscopy. The increase in angle parameters was maintained for 12&#x02005;weeks with the exception of the inferior segment where some regression in the evaluated parameters was observed at 12&#x02005;weeks. The finding that ALPI significantly widens the anterior chamber angle circumferentially may confer protection from the onset or progression of existing damage to the trabecular meshwork. The reduction in DIOP fluctuation caused by the ALPI is likely to be related to these changes in anterior chamber dimensions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge the work of Laura Sanchez Parra in data collection and Paula Turnbull and Heather Pearman for administration of the study.
