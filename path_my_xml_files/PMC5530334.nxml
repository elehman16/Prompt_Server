</p><p>The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of a pre-activity movement control exercise intervention to reduce the incidence and burden of rugby-related injuries in a schoolboy population and to assess the influences of programme dose and compliance on injury outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>A cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted across independent school rugby teams over one playing season (August to December 2015). The&#x000a0;study design was in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&#x000a0;statement,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the trial was registered before recruitment (trial registration number: ISRCTN13422001). Study procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Approval Committee for Health at the University of Bath.</p><p>Each school was treated as a cluster, within which under-15 (U15), under-16 (U16) and under-18 (U18) teams were allocated to the same trial arm. A&#x000a0;priori sample size calculations were undertaken,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> incorporating injury data collected from a previous study on injuries in schoolboy rugby players.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> To discern a 30% reduction in match injury incidence at 80% statistical power, 13 schools per trial arm were required. Seven additional schools were recruited in each trial arm to account for attrition, yielding a target sample of 40 schools. Schools deemed eligible to participate had on-site access to physiotherapists or nurses who would treat all rugby-related injuries. Two&#x000a0;hundred and twenty schools were identified and sequentially contacted in randomised groups of 60 through trial invitation letters, emails and direct telephone calls to senior members of the sport and rugby programmes until 40 schools had provided written informed consent from a member of the senior management team to participate in the trial. Schools were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups on a 1:1 basis. The randomisation process for both recruitment and allocation was completed independently of the research team. Schools were briefed that they would receive an exercise programme to be delivered by the coaches to their U15, U16 and U18 teams, but were blinded to their trial arm allocation. All U15, U16 or U18 players who participated in training or match&#x000a0;play at the school were eligible to participate in the trial. Coach consent (in loco parentis), player assent and opportunity for parental opt-out (via school&#x02013;parent mailing lists) were sought.</p><p>Coaches attended a pre-study workshop (typically 1&#x02009;hour duration) led by the research team at each school (June to July 2015), at which they were introduced to either the intervention or the&#x000a0;control exercise programme and data collection materials, in addition to being provided with a practical demonstration of the programme. The practical demonstration of the programme entailed coaches observing a research team member leading a group of youth rugby players (U15, U16 or U18) through a session. Coaches across both trial arms received identically formatted data collection and programme materials (except for exercises). Programme materials included a filmed demonstration of the exercises (as a DVD), laminated cue cards (images and key coaching cues for each exercise) and a booklet detailing how to complete individual exercises. A further meeting was arranged at all schools during pre-season for members of the research team to collect informed assent and baseline anthropometric information (standing height, seated height&#x000a0;and body mass) from all players involved in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The exercise programmes being trialled</title><p>The process of devising the intervention and control exercise programmes have been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Both programmes comprised four phases, with progressions occurring via increased difficulty and repetition volume of exercises. Phase 1 was devised for the pre-season period (typically 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks&#x02019; duration). Both programmes progressed to phase 2 on the school term commencing in September 2015, with two further planned phase progressions occurring every 4&#x02009;weeks until the end of the study in December. This timing enabled players to master the exercises before being introduced to a more advanced phase. Progression of the exercises was undertaken at the team&#x000a0;level, with all players within the same age group teams completing the same exercises at the same time. Phase difficulty was offset by age group (ie, phase 3 of the U15 programme was similar in difficulty to phases 2 and 1 of the U16 and U18 programmes, respectively) to maintain a sufficient stimulus for players at an appropriate level. Both programmes were intended to take place during the first 20&#x02009;min of each pitch-based training session and match warm-up, and coaches in charge of each team acted as delivery agents. Coaches were instructed to use the programme materials, particularly the laminated cue cards during sessions, to assess movement execution in relation to the specified cues for each exercise and to identify movements that could be improved.</p><p>The exercise programme allocated to teams in the intervention group integrated balance/perturbation training, resistance training, plyometric training and controlled rehearsal of sport-specific landing and cutting manoeuvres with verbal feedback and reinforcement of technique from the coach (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary material)</xref>. The exercise programme allocated to the control cohort was derived from currently regarded best practice within schoolboy rugby and featured a running-based warm-up, dynamic stretching, controlled wrestling, mobility and speed/change of direction-related drills (without the specific feedback instructions given in the intervention programme). The content within both the intervention and control programmes were categorised into four separate parts (parts A, B, C and D) to aid the structure of sessions and compliance reporting. A sample phase from the intervention exercise programme has been supplied for supplementary reference.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bjsports-2016-097434.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary material 1</title></caption><p>

Programme compliance indicated the proportion of programme parts that were completed at the team level across all exposures. Coaches started the injury reports by logging the date that the injury occurred, the injured player&#x02019;s trial ID and playing position, and the event leading directly to the injury. School medical staff recorded the injury location and a diagnosis when players visited for treatment. Logging the injury location and diagnosis aligned with the first two levels of the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (V.10).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Coaches recorded the return-to-play date (date of full participation in training or match&#x000a0;play). A member of the research team visited schools periodically (2&#x02013;3&#x02009;weeks&#x02019; interval) during the study period to retrieve completed report forms and to discuss study progress, but not to promote compliance or fidelity with using the programmes.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were undertaken with IBM SPSS Statistics (V.22.0 for Windows). Trial arm comparisons across baseline player characteristics (age, anthropometric characteristics and maturity timing) were assessed using linear and logistic regression. The odds ratio (OR) generated from the logistic regression was converted to a proportion ratio to permit analysis via magnitude-based inference.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>Intention-to-treat analyses compared injury measures between the trial arms for all teams that provided injury and exposure data, regardless of returning complete programme compliance or dose data. Trial arm comparisons were also undertaken on a per-protocol basis with teams that maintained a mean programme completion rate of three or more weekly sessions, which represented a threshold for optimal compliance based on previous findings.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The effects of intervention-only programme dose on injury were assessed by comparing injury measures between teams that maintained an average of three or more sessions per week with those who averaged completing the programmes less than three sessions per week. Overall match injury incidence (injuries/1000 player-hours) and burden (days lost/1000 player-hours) rates acted as dependent variables, with further stratification by injury location and event. All estimations were made using generalised linear modelling with a Poisson distribution, a log-linear link function and offset for hours of exposure to generate rate ratios (RR) and 90% confidence limits (90%&#x02009;CL) for injury incidence and burden values. RR and 90%&#x02009;CL were assessed against predetermined smallest worthwhile effects in injury outcome.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The smallest worthwhile effects favouring the intervention and favouring the control were given as RR=0.90&#x02009;and RR=1.11, respectively.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Effects were deemed clear if the per&#x000a0;cent likelihood that the true effect favoured the intervention (RR below 0.90) was greater than 25%, and the OR between favouring the intervention and favouring the control was greater than 66 (ie, if the likelihood of effect favouring the intervention was 25% and the likelihood of effect favouring the control was less than 0.5%); otherwise, effects were deemed unclear. Effects were qualified against probabilistic terms from the following scale:&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.5%, most unlikely; 0.5%&#x02013;5%, very unlikely; 5%&#x02013;25%, unlikely; 25%&#x02013;75%, possibly; 75%&#x02013;95%, likely; 95%&#x02013;99.5%, very likely;&#x000a0;&#x0003e;99.5%, most likely.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

Following intention-to-treat analyses, effects of the trial arm were unclear for overall match injury. Per-protocol trial arm comparisons under conditions of high dose (&#x02265;3&#x02009;weekly programme sessions) revealed clear reductions for the intervention arm for overall match injury, contact-related injury, upper and lower extremity injury and concussion incidence values. Moreover, a higher intervention programme dose was shown to reduce the incidence and burden of overall match injuries and contact injuries compared with lower intervention programme doses (&#x0003c;3&#x02009;weekly programme completions).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Intention-to-treat analyses</title><p>Intention-to-treat analyses indicated unclear effects of trial arm for overall match injury (incidence RR=0.85, burden RR=0.83) and match contact injury (incidence RR=0.85; burden RR=0.88). The 15% reduction in overall match injury incidence in this study is lower than the 41%&#x02013;56% reductions noted in other studies conducted in male basketball and soccer players,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10 11</xref> which may be partly attributed to differences between definitions of reportable injuries, programme content, or the distribution of injury types and locations between the respective sports, that&#x000a0;is, proportion of non-contact lower limb injuries. However, clear effects favouring the intervention exercise programme were noted for head/neck injury incidence (incidence RR=0.72) and concussion incidence (incidence RR=0.71). Sixty-two per&#x000a0;cent of reported head/neck injuries in the trial were attributed to concussion, and therefore the reductions in head/neck injury incidence were likely because of reductions in concussion incidence. Concussion is a priority for prevention across contact and collision sports due to potential concern over medium-term and long-term player welfare.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Thus, the substantially reduced concussion incidence across the intervention arm is a very promising finding with regards to current efforts to reduce the risk of concussion.</p><p>Neck strength has been shown to be substantially lower in adolescent rugby players when compared with adult players despite similar peripheral strength profiles.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Increased concussion risk is associated with lower neck strength, highlighting this characteristic as a potentially modifiable risk factor.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Enhancing neck muscle strength may prevent concussion by improving the dissipation of impact forces transmitted to the brain.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Therefore, it is possible that the neck resistance exercises in the intervention exercise programme contributed to reduced concussion incidence via this mechanism. Neck pain is a common physical complaint among young sportspeople participating in collision sports<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> and may be associated with increased concussion risk.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Given that acute and cumulative rugby exposure can adversely impact neck function,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> the neck resistance exercises may also have contributed to preserving neck function during the playing season,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> in turn reducing concussion incidence.</p><p>Upper limb injuries are common in contact sports and can also result in substantial time&#x000a0;loss in youth rugby players.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 40</xref> Teams in the intervention trial arm suffered substantially fewer days absence due to upper limb injuries than teams in the control arm (burden RR=0.66). Little is known about the underlying risk factors and mechanisms for upper limb injuries, and examples of evidence-based upper limb injury prevention are scarce.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Reduced glenohumeral rotation and rotator cuff muscle strength imbalances may be modifiable risk factors for shoulder injuries in rugby players.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The intervention programme may have improved joint kinematics and force-handling capabilities within the upper limb as a result of incorporating resistance and plyometric training of upper body regions,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> thus implying that reducing upper limb injury risk across youth contact sports is possible through improving upper limb strength, stability and mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Per-protocol analyses</title><p>The lack of clear substantial effects for overall match and contact-related injuries following intention-to-treat analyses should be considered in the context of dose, which may have affected these outcomes. Although mean intervention programme dose in this study was higher (1.9 completions per week) than has been reported in previous studies (1.3&#x02013;1.4 completions per week),<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> the level of dose that teams received in the intervention trial arm may have been insufficient to demonstrate a clear effect on overall match injuries. Greater effects of preventive exercise programmes may be realised if regularly used at least three times per week.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Trial arm comparisons conducted on a per-protocol basis showed that intervention trial arm teams that regularly completed the programme more than three times per week suffered 72% fewer overall match injuries, 72% fewer contact-related injuries, 81% fewer upper limb injuries, 70% fewer lower limb injuries and 59% fewer concussions than control teams with an equivalent dose. When per-protocol analyses were conducted within the intervention arm, teams that regularly completed the programme over three times per week suffered 39% fewer match injuries, 48% fewer days lost to match injuries,&#x000a0;42% fewer contact injuries and 55% fewer days lost to contact injuries than teams with less than three weekly programme completions. Regularly performing a preventive exercise programme three times per week over a sustained period has been shown to improve markers for neuromuscular control and muscle strength in male soccer players.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Therefore, these physiological benefits may explain the enhanced effects noted in this study with a high dose of the intervention programme use compared with the control programme and a lower dose of the intervention programme.</p><p>Evidence of a dose&#x02013;response effect on overall and contact-related injuries in this study presents wider applications of the dose&#x02013;response effect of preventive exercise programmes, and has the potential to inform subsequent implementation attempts through identifying a minimum effective dose in this population. The collective findings from the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses highlight that teams involved in contact sports can obtain benefit from using preventive exercise programmes, but more importantly, regular exposure of more than three times per week can result in substantial injury risk reduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>There were several limitations to this study that should be acknowledged. First, the research team members that ran the pre-trial workshops and conducted pre-season visits were not blinded to the programme allocation for each school, creating potential bias between the two groups in terms of the processes followed and information disseminated at these workshops; this was mitigated through use of a unified workshop format. Second, individual player compliance was not monitored during the study. Results of previous studies have indicated that individual player compliance may be a more sensitive measure than team compliance in determining the influence of compliance on programme efficacy,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> but puts considerable strain on coaches, and so was&#x000a0;not feasible in this setting. Third, it was&#x000a0;not possible to validate coach compliance reports or to monitor exercise fidelity (the quality of performing the exercises) through unannounced visits or observations, given that schools have strict policies around access to premises. The fidelity with which teams used the programmes is uncertain, but may actually have mediated programme efficacy along with dose and compliance.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</p><p>Further work is required to understand the mechanistic bases by which the intervention exercise programme reduced injury outcomes, particularly in relation to the proposed effects of the programme on neck strength and function in reducing concussion incidence, as well as kinematics and force handling capacities in the upper limb. Determining efficacy is a crucial step towards effecting a public health impact of injury prevention measures in rugby, although results of this controlled trial alone are not sufficient to translate to reducing injuries in &#x02018;real world&#x02019; contexts.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref> Further research is required to further understand the contexts into which the exercise programme would be implemented, as well as identifying what factors may facilitate or inhibit programme use.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In particular, studies should be directed to identifying what factors could facilitate or inhibit teams from completing the intervention programme three times per week.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although intention-to-treat results highlighted trivial effects of the intervention exercise programme on overall match injury incidence when compared with the control exercise programme, a substantial reduction in overall match injury incidence was evident from per-protocol trial arm comparisons under conditions of high programme dose (three or more weekly sessions).
