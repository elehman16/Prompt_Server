Providing trained para-teachers to teach regular after-school remedial education classes has been shown to improve literacy and numeracy in children of primary school age residing in such areas in India. This trial investigates whether such an intervention can also be effective in a West African setting with similarly low learning levels and difficult geographic access.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Design: cluster-randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Clusters: villages or groups of villages with 15&#x02013;300 households and at least 15 eligible children in the Lower River and North Bank Regions of The Gambia.</p><p>Participants: children born between 1 September 2007 and 31 August 2009 planning to enter the first grade, for the first time, in the 2015&#x02013;2016 school year in eligible villages. We anticipate enrolling approximately 150 clusters of villages with approximately 6000 children as participants.</p><p>Intervention: a program providing remedial after-school lessons, focusing on literacy and numeracy, 5 to 6 days a week for 3 years to eligible children, based on the intervention evaluated in the Support To Rural India&#x02019;s Public Education System (STRIPES) trial (PLoS ONE 8(7):e65775).</p><p>Control: both the intervention and control groups will receive small bundles of useful materials during annual data collection as recompense for their time. If the education intervention is shown to be cost-effective at raising learning levels, it is expected that the control group villages will receive the intervention for several years after the trial results are available.</p><p>Outcomes: the primary outcome of the trial is a composite mathematics and language test score. Secondary outcomes include school attendance, enrollment, performance on nationally administered exams, parents&#x02019; spending on education, spillover learning to siblings and family members, and school-related time use of parents and children. Subgroup analyses of the primary outcome will also be carried out based on ethnic group, gender, distance from the main highway, parents&#x02019; education level, and school type.</p><p>The trial will run by independent research and implementation teams and supervised by a Trial Steering Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Along with the overall impact of the intervention, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>There are no major ethical issues for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12500245">ISRCTN12500245</ext-link>. 1 May 2015.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Primary education</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd><kwd>Para-teachers</kwd><kwd>West Africa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Motivation</title><p>It is widely recognized that one of the preconditions of a country&#x02019;s successful development trajectory is a well-educated citizenry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Across the developing world, educational attainment levels are often quite low and, even when students are attending schools, sometimes very little is learned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This situation is more severe in rural parts of the developing world where monitoring public servants is harder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and, as our previous research has shown, the situation is particularly alarming in parts of rural West Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Much recent work in education in the developing world has evaluated different methods of addressing these low learning levels and the difficulties in implementing public policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The policy of training and providing para-teachers to teach supplementary classes after the normal school day has been shown to work in several settings in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The main purpose of this study is to implement such a program in rural Gambia and, using a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), assess its effectiveness in raising literacy and numeracy rates among primary-aged children there.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p>The trial will take place in The Republic of Gambia, located in West Africa. The Gambia has a population of approximately 1.9 million, of which 38.7 % are 14 years of age or younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is characterized by substantial ethnic diversity. In addition to the official language (English), the tribal languages Mandinka, Wolof, and Fula are widely spoken.</p><p>In 2012, The Gambia&#x02019;s Human Development Index value was 0.439, ranking it 165th out of 187 countries and territories measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Over 60 % of all Gambians depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is low, at around US$470 in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Education levels are also low &#x02013; despite a moderate gross primary enrollment ratio (82.0 % for boys and 84.0 % for girls), the net attendance ratio is quite low, at 40.0 % for boys and 45.0 % for girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Learning levels are also quite low. The United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund (UNICEF) Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2010 assessed literacy among women aged 15&#x02013;24 at 61.2 % in urban areas and only 33.8 % in rural areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The intervention</title><p>One method of dealing with low learning levels in rural areas is to identify individuals to provide supplementary after-school classes to reinforce lessons learned in school. Several of the authors of this protocol<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref><sup>1</sup> partnered with the Naandi Foundation, an Indian non-governmental organization (NGO) which had been running such a program for several years, to implement the STRIPES RCT in rural Andhra Pradesh, India, to evaluate its effects on learning levels. We found that after 2 years, students in the para-teacher intervention arm of the trial scored 0.75 standard deviations (SD) higher on mathematics and language tests than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similar interventions in other parts of India have also had large impacts on learning levels, catalogued in Muralidharan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The intervention in this study will adapt the STRIPES para-teacher intervention to the Gambian context, providing remedial after-school education classes focusing on numeracy and literacy, 5 to 6 days a week, in each intervention village, to attempt to replicate the results from STRIPES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in a new context.</p><p>In intervention villages, we will deliver the following package of interventions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Supplementary remedial education classes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Teaching and learning materials</p></list-item><list-item><p>Student assessment and evaluation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Community mobilization</p></list-item></list></p><p><italic>Supplementary remedial education classes</italic>: the main component of the intervention is to provide additional educational support to children through a two and a half hour-long class, to be held five to six times a week before or after school hours and during vacations.</p><p>After-school classes (ASCs) will usually be conducted by residents of the community. They will be trained by the Effective Intervention technical team, in conjunction with appointed personnel from the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE), to provide remedial lessons for the children of each target community in a space provided by the community. These &#x0201c;para-teachers&#x0201d; who will run the ASCs will be selected by the implementation team in consultation with the members of each intervention community. We will aim to hire only para-teachers who have completed the 12th grade, pass an Effective Intervention qualification exam, and reside or choose to reside in that particular village. In the absence of an individual with at least a 12th grade education, we will choose an individual who passes the qualification exam and offers the most suitable combination of proximity to the intervention village and level of schooling: e.g., someone with a 9th grade education who lives in a neighboring village.</p><p>A child-friendly pedagogy lesson plan, based on child participation, reflection, and interaction, with frequent use of teaching and learning materials (TLMs), will be prepared by the technical team based on the STRIPES intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Para-teachers and monitors will be trained by Effective Intervention team members, in partnership with the Naandi Foundation, which developed and administered the STRIPES intervention, on the following subjects:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pedagogical best practices for ASCs</p></list-item><list-item><p>How to facilitate English and mathematics learning during ASCs</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary aim of an ASC is to ensure mastery of the concepts learned in regular classes during school hours.</p><p>The intervention will be provided to children from intervention villages planning to enroll in grade 1, for the first time, in the 2015&#x02013;2016 school year. The intervention will consist of 3 years of ASCs, taking place in the child&#x02019;s home village, spanning the 2015&#x02013;16, 2016&#x02013;17, and 2017&#x02013;18 academic years, covering the first to the third grade curricula in consecutive years<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>. At the end of each academic year we will train the para-teachers to update their skill sets and to prepare them to teach the material in the next grade level. We will conduct capacity-building exercises for para-teachers and monitors throughout the trial using an in-service approach.</p><p><italic>Teaching and learning materials:</italic> appropriate teaching/learning materials will be used in conjunction with oral instruction at the ASCs to help children understand concepts in English and mathematics. The materials will ensure children get time to practice and apply concepts taught to them in the classroom to increase the likelihood of mastery. These interactive materials are developed for language and mathematics corresponding to grade-specific competencies. They assist in reinforcing these competencies through repeated application and practice of each concept until mastery is reached. Intervention materials have been prepared based on the national curriculum and textbooks used in schools for each grade. The materials aim to explain, illustrate and practice the grade-level concepts covered in regular class.

These periodic assessments will be designed independently of the outcome assessments used for the primary outcome. They will be used to evaluate learning level progress and provide feedback used to improve the teaching and learning methods. There will also be a similar independent evaluation administered semi-annually or annually to only enrolled participants in intervention villages, for the intervention team to track its progress. The implementation team will share these assessments of individual and composite learning levels of children with parents and other community members with the goal of imparting a sense of shared responsibility for children&#x02019;s learning outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Community mobilization</title><p>Community sensitization, through mobilization campaigns and monthly meetings, will be conducted in the intervention villages to motivate children to attend academic support classes and to sensitize and engage parents and the greater community to the importance of education and their role in ensuring better outcomes. The process of community involvement is intended to galvanize families to take responsibility for their children&#x02019;s attendance and performance in school and ASCs. From the start, communities will play a vital role in the program, as they are the ones responsible for identification of possible candidates for para-teachers. These candidates will be interviewed and tested by Effective Intervention. Communities will then participate in the final para-teacher selection.</p><p>The implementation team will work closely with the Village Development Committee (VDC) and School Management Committee (SMC) in each village, when available, to promote active participation and involvement of parents and communities in the process of children&#x02019;s learning. VDCs and/or SMCs will be involved in the management of the academic classes and monitoring children&#x02019;s attendance and their learning progress. Meetings will be conducted regularly with VDCs and SMCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p>Our main research question is whether the success of the STRIPES trial in providing an after-school para-teacher intervention to raise learning levels among primary school students in rural India can be replicated in rural parts of The Gambia.

This research arm will be operated entirely independently of the team delivering the intervention in the intervention group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data collection, entry, and management</title><p>In all eligible villages we will collect the following information:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Individual-level information about the parents/guardians of eligible children and about the children themselves at the beginning of the trial, child-level information at the end of the first and second academic years, and child, sibling, and parent/guardian-level information at the end of the trial</p></list-item><list-item><p>The performance of eligible children on an EGRA/EGMA examination<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref>, administered at the end of the trial, and on the National Third Grade Assessment Examination</p></list-item><list-item><p>Village-level information on the access to various facilities and amenities in each eligible village</p></list-item><list-item><p>School-level information about the school facilities and teachers, including attendance at school, observed during the course of the trial, of both students and teachers</p></list-item></list></p><p>Tests will be administered to all eligible children available in the village on the day of testing. In some cases, if a holiday, strike, or administrative necessity negatively impacts attendance at the test, a second visit to that village to reach all eligible and available children will be conducted.</p><p>The main challenge we foresee in maintaining the integrity of the data we collect is finding and motivating the children to take the test at the end of the trial period, particularly those children not receiving the education intervention. To address the motivation problem, we will provide all test takers and their caretakers with a small bundle of useful materials, such as snacks and writing utensils, as recompense for the children&#x02019;s time in taking the test. To ensure we are able to locate as many enrolled control and intervention children as possible at the end of the trial for the test, we will have a &#x0201c;field day&#x0201d; in each village at the end of each academic year in which we will invite all of the eligible children in a village and their parents to a brief meeting in a central location in each village. This location will be chosen for its suitability as a place of test administration at the end of the trial. In the meeting, we will collect data on the children, including their enrollment in school, and on their parents. As recompense for the time spent at these meetings, we will provide attendees a small bundle of useful materials, similar to that mentioned above, for the final assessment. The goals of these meetings are to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Keep track of eligible children to ensure we are able to find as many as possible at the end of the third year</p></list-item><list-item><p>Establish a place where testing can be done in each village in a fashion that is balanced between intervention and control arms, as not all villages have schools and intervention villages will establish such a place through the process of administering the intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p>Establish and maintain familiarity of enrolled children with data collection efforts during the course of the trial to maximize turnout at the final assessment</p></list-item></list></p><p>Data will be collected on paper form by survey enumerators and entered into a database in Banjul, the capital of The Gambia. Data will be entered onto a server in Banjul and the database will be stored securely with &#x02018;Cloud&#x02019; backup through a third-party service. All data will be double-entered and the database will provide an interface for resolving inconsistencies which will be adjudicated by an administrator consulting the paper forms and correcting the record accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis will follow the intention to treat principle, i.e. the participants will remain in the group they were randomized to and not analyzed according to the interventions actually received.</p><p>Child-specific composite test scores at the end of the third academic year will be compared between intervention and control groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. Stratification factors included in the randomization (and no others) will be adjusted for in the primary analysis. Provided normality assumptions hold, robust standard errors, allowing for the clustering, will be used here and elsewhere. Bootstrap confidence intervals will be reported if the normality assumptions are seriously violated. The adjusted difference in means will be divided by the SD of the test score in the control group to give a standardized difference, with a non-parametric bootstrap confidence interval (bias corrected and accelerated, 2000 replications) computed for this.</p><p>Secondary analyses will extend the ANCOVA model described above to (separately) investigate interactions by ethnic group, gender, wealth and geographic location. Sensitivity analyses will examine the effect on the treatment effect estimate of different treatment of missing data: e.g. imputation, assigning all missing values a zero, and other specifications according to Manski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Program cost per 0.1 SD improvement in test scores will be calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Monitoring</title><p>As we anticipate no potential harms from this intervention, there will be no Data Monitoring Committee, interim analyses or stopping rules.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Interventions Research Ethics Committee, approval dated 27 November 2014, ethics reference number 8767.
