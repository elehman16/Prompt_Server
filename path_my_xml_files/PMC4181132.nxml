Fear of needles and pain associated with vein puncture is a common phobia in the general population.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Fear of pain and anxiety associated with venous cannulation may contribute to the overall stress experienced by patients in the preoperative setting.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>According to Shaikh <italic>et al</italic>. there is a lack of cooperation, low rate of the successful procedure attempts, repeated attempts, additional pain, and a prolonged total procedure time. Injection-injury consequently leads to avoidance among patients from medical care and blood donating or precipitating fainting episodes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Therefore, the healthcare providers recommended some methods to alleviate pain during the injections. In addition, patients are often more satisfied with their doctors when they are treated by methods having minimal or no pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Considering premedication relieves the anxiety and fear associated with pain as well as the pain itself. Choosing the more effective analgesia is required to reduce the actual pain experienced.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The effect of various pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures has been explored in several studies in order to minimize venous cannulation pain.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>However, there are a few cost-effective, simple and effective methods associated with pain reduction during venous cannulation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These methods commonly comprised local skin infiltration, topical application of eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) or nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical alkaline vapocoolant spray, ibuprofen, etc.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Nevertheless, analgesia is an integral part of anesthesia management.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] One of pain methods is injection. Injections in general and especially the placement of intravenous cannula are often the cause of pain and anxiety for many patients. However, there is no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; and there is a need for the development of innovative analgesic methods that are simple to use, painless, effective with a minimal delay, without adverse effects, and cost-effective.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Thus, clinical practice has recently interested to incorporate various techniques for decreasing the discomfort and pain of procedures involving routine needle punctures, such as vein puncture, intravenous catheter placement, and lumbar puncture.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] One of these methods is applying the EMLA. EMLA, a local anesthetic cream composed of a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine provides.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, a topical formulation may offer substantial benefits for prevention of needle and procedural pain. A eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA) is the first commercially developed topical transdermal anesthetic agent that provides adequate effective analgesic properties.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, we aimed to compare the effect of ELMA cream and diclofenac gel in pain reduction in patients undergoing caesarian section surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This controlled, randomized clinical trial study has assessed the effect of diclofenac gel, EMLA and placebo on vein puncture pain.

Exclusion criteria include addiction to opium or analgesics, mental, visual and verbal inability, use of analgesic in last 24 h, anaphylactic response to NSAID. Considering inclusion and exclusion criteria and homogeneity of samples, the researchers selected patients in cesarean section.

After 60 min ointments and gel were cleaned from the hand and side-effects were recorded. Then, venous puncture was done by angiocath number 3-5 min after puncture, pain was recorded by VAS.

However, we suggest using diclofenac gel rather than EMLA because it is more cost-effective and effective in the reduction of pain with less side-effects. Hence, we suggest that there should be some policies in health care centers and treatment clinics of our country in a different ward to use diclofenac gel as a choice to vein puncture pain.</p><p>There was some limitation in this study such as small samples. We did not measure the anxiety level of samples, which is extremely related to pain severity. The samples selected only from one center. We could not measure the effect of pain severity on birth related outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nill.</p></fn><fn
