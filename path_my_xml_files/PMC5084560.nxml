Grades of energy expenditure were set at predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak and divided as 50%, 60%, and 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak to study the effect of increasing intensity of walking on the BP reduction. Younger age group was studied as in present outlook they are more vulnerable to risk factors associated with the development of hypertension. An acute study is justifiable as utilization of acute responses allows for a more efficacious study of possible variations in the accumulation of physical activity in lowering of the BP in prehypertension throughout the day. Finding reduction in BP as an immediate result may motivate the volunteer to continue incorporating the modification in PA in their daily routine.</p><p>In this study, we found a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP following PAcumm over a period of 30 min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). BP reduction during the rest period between short PA sessions in the accumulated PA over 30 min was also observed in pre-HT.</p><p>Reduction in SBP was observed after each of the sessions in rest period but was statistically significant only when compared to basal BP. A higher average reduction of SBP (8.2 &#x000b1; 8 mmHg) was reported in the 1<sup>st</sup> session of PA of walking in 50%, 60%, and 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak. Next two sessions did not show a major reduction (3.4 mmHg and 1.2 mmHg). Reduction in DBP was also observed following 30 min of PACumm (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and after each of the sessions in rest period but was statistically significant only when compared to basal BP. Major reduction was observed in the 1<sup>st</sup> session of 10 min in all grades of PA (1<sup>st</sup> session 7.3 mmHg, 2<sup>nd</sup> session 1.5 mmHg, and 3<sup>rd</sup> session 0.4 mmHg). A study done by Park <italic>et al</italic>. found a fall of SBP in all the session of PAcumm but the reduction of SBP in first two sessions was not significant when compared to baseline. Decrease in SBP in the third session was significant when compared to baseline (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Several other studies investigating the health outcomes like postexercise oxygen consumption during the rest periods found no significant reduction in SBP in first two sessions.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The effect of exercise on decreasing SBP became stronger with each additional walking session to eventually result in a clinically meaningful reduction. Since the change in SBP was not much in second and third session it could be explained by the assumption that over the period of PEH a reflexive response of baroreceptor may partially offset the observed reduction in BP. Although PEH lasted several hours after PAccum, Park <italic>et al</italic>. observed that the residual effect of BP decreases across rest intervals between subsequent short sessions of aerobic exercise in pre-HTs over 40 min of PACumm.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The potential mechanisms underlying hypotension after one bout of exercise have been theorized to reflect a functional product of changes in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance (due to local vasodilation in working muscles), both of which are affected by thermoregulation, nitric oxide, various vasoactive hormones, and autonomic activity to name a few.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) studies by Floras <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have documented a decrease in sympathetic activity following exercise in borderline hypertension and since they exhibit a higher than normal sympathetic activity in resting condition, a transient suppression of augmented sympathetic outflow may be related to hypotension. As sympathetic outflow governs the peripheral resistance, both regional and systemic resistance may be decreased below the preexercise levels hence fall in DBP.</p><p>Although the mean arterial pressure is related to the cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, the fall in SBP as observed by us may not be related to CO, which depends on HR which is increased postexercise.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Decrease in SBP as observed in our study may be related to decrease circulating catecholamine because of decreased sympathetic activity.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The magnitude of a BP reduction after exercise is dependent on the presenting BP. That is, patients who present with higher BPs exhibit greater BP reduction.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Since baseline BP may be a predictor of PEH[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] relative/normalized reduction in BP was taken for measuring the change and for seeing the association with autonomic modulation and other covariates. The mean relative change in SBP in all the grade of PACumm (50%, 60%, and 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak) over 30 min was 0.09 &#x000b1; 0.05 mmHg (absolute &#x02212;11.4 &#x000b1; 6.4 mmHg). Mean relative reduction in DBP was 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.07 mmHg (absolute &#x02212;6.6 &#x000b1; 7.0 mmHg) following PACumm over 30 min in all grade of walking. We observed a higher fall in BP (9.9 &#x000b1; 8.0/9.4 &#x000b1; 5.8 mmHg) after the 1<sup>st</sup> session following 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak as compared to other grades of PA. Padilla <italic>et al</italic>. on their work on PAccumm following lifestyle PA over 8&#x02013;12 period in a day among normotensive, pre-HT found difference in SBP after PA only in pre-HT (6.6 &#x000b1; 2.3 mmHg) which persisted for the duration of 6 h when ambulatory BP was measured.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] They did not find a reduction in DBP in normotensives and pre-HTs following the lifestyle PA. Murphy and Hardman[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported a reduction in SBP to be greater in women who walked three short bouts of 10 min (&#x02212;7.4 &#x000b1; 7.3 mmHg). A study by Lacombe <italic>et al</italic>. on older pre-HTs also observed a reduction of SBP - 4 &#x000b1; 6 mmHg following equicaloric bouts of exercise in the interval (IE: 5 &#x000d7; 2:2 min at 85% and 40% maximal oxygen uptake). Effect on DBP observed was raised rather than reduced following postexercise and was similar to that of control during the rest period.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Dunn <italic>et al</italic>. reported a similar reduction in both SBP and DBP in adult engaged in structured exercise (&#x02212;3.2/5.1 mmHg) which was almost similar to the lifestyle PA (&#x02212;3.6/5.3 mmHg) but after a long period of exercise.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A reduction in ambulatory BP after a single session of exercise of 5&#x02013;8 mmHg for SBP over 11&#x02013;12 h and 6&#x02013;8 mmHg for DBP for 6&#x02013;8 h has been reported by Wallace.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Higher change in the LF<sub>nu</sub> and LF/HF was observed in our study in all grades of exercise over 30 min of PACumm as compared to control. Fall in the mean values was observed in rest period after each of the PA session, but the change was nonsignificant. Sympathetic drive decreased after each bout of PA with a maximal reduction in 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak. Which may be due to the fact that pre-HT exhibited higher than normal LF<sub>nu</sub> in resting condition and observed fall in BP may be due to transient suppression of augmented sympathetic flow.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It may be possible that with reduced BP may not be an adequate stimulus for decreased sensitivity of baroreceptors to cause a significant reduction in sympathetic efferent activity. Reduction in normalized LF as a marker of sympathetic activity was observed in the control group but was small compared to interventional groups. Similar decrement in MSNA activity was observed by Halliwill in normotensives.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] HF<sub>nu</sub> value showed an increase after each session of PA in all grades of exercise, but relative change in HF<sub>nu</sub> was not significant over 30 min of PAcumm. Moreover, the change was almost same in all grades of exercise and comparable to control group.</p><p>In our study, the magnitude of change in autonomic parameters of LF<sub>nu</sub>, HF<sub>nu</sub>, and LF/HF ratio was not associated with the relative change in SBP and DBP the autonomic modulation did not mirror the change in BP. A study by Park <italic>et al</italic>. also could not find any association of autonomic parameters with a reduction in BP following PAcumm at 50% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak over 30 min. They also could not find any significant difference in the autonomic parameters during the rest after each session of PA.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A study by Liu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported a decrease in the LF and HF following a single session acute exercise for 30 min at 65% of VO<sub>2</sub> max, and the difference was significant from the baseline suggesting a rebalancing of sympathovagal balance to heart,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] although parameters were recorded immediately after exercise during the lowest BP levels. A study by Lacombe <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that both HRV parameters LF (ms<sup>2</sup>) and HF (ms<sup>2</sup>) were reduced following equicaloric five sets of 2 min exercise and 2 min of active recovery at 85% maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) and 40% VO<sub>2</sub> max, respectively, but in old pre-HTs and the difference of HF (ms<sup>2</sup>) was significant.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Our findings are similar to those reported by Legramante <italic>et al</italic>. who found no significant changes in autonomic modulation, although they elicited a significant 11.9 mmHg reduction in SBP and a 5.3 mmHg reduction in DBP.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Postexercise (graded exercise to 87% of predicted maximum heart rate) BP and HRV were measured for 5 min between 60 and 90 min following a single session of exercise.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>We observed a minimal rise in HF following PAcumm over 30 min, which was similar in all grades of exercise to that in control. Pober <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found no significant increase in parasympathetic activity at 1, 3, and 6 h after 60 min of cycle ergometry at 65% of VO<sub>2</sub> peak. They did, however, find a significant decrease in sympathetic activity between 6 and 22 h following the exercise as observed in our study. It appears as though the change in autonomic modulation lags behind the change in early stage of PEH (1&#x02013;2 h following the exercise). Halliwill[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] suggested that a PEH is associated with a 30% reduction in sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity to skeletal muscle, likely mediated by the arterial baroreceptors.</p><p>As observed in our study, grades of exercise do not seem to affect change in BP. The intensity of exercise of 50, 60, and 70% of predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak and duration seems to be a weak predictor of BP reduction after acute exercise.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, an average reduction in BP of 11/6.6 mmHg is physiologically important though reduction following each bout of PA could not establish statistically significant levels. The reduction in resting sympathetic activity following 30 min of PAcumm was evident and was present after each session of activity which may suggest a decrease in vascular tone, hence fall in DBP. Change in the parasympathetic activity was not significant in rest period during the three sessions of PA (Same change in HRR 2 min and no change in HF<sub>nu</sub>) but could be observed over a longer duration of PAcumm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Autonomic function mechanisms underlying BP decrease during rest between several short periods of exercise over 30 min remain as yet unclear and could be different from those proposed for the longer standing PEH.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Limitation</title><p>It was a small group study, and the calculated predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak was used instead of VO<sub>2</sub> max. The study results may be interpreted in light of the variance in the predicted VO<sub>2</sub> peak and limited to the study group. Due to lack of funds, we could not procure the machine for the recording of VO<sub>2</sub> max and hence an indirectly calculated method which can only predict the value of VO<sub>2</sub> peak was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>HIMS, SRH University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors acknowledge the HIMS, SRH University for providing finance and logistics for the work.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chobanian</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Bakris</surname><given-names>GL</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Cushman</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Izzo</surname><given-names>JL</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure</article-title><source>Hypertension</source><year>2003</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>1206</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14656957</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Qureshi</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Suri</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirmani</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Divani</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammad</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is prehypertension a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases?</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>2005</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>1859</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16081866</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whelton</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Appel</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutler</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Havas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kotchen</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Primary prevention of hypertension: Clinical and public health advisory from the National High Blood Pressure Education Program</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2002</year><volume>288</volume><fpage>1882</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12377087</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Jakicic</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lifestyle physical activity interventions.
