Making risk based judgments has been shown to be important to athletes in optimizing pacing during endurance events (Renfree et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the effect of 50 mg exogenous cortisol on neurophysiological responses and risk taking behavior in nine healthy men. Further to this, to examine the effect of exogenous cortisol on exercise performance.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Using a double blind counterbalanced design, cyclists completed a placebo (PLA), and a cortisol (COR) trial (50 mg cortisol), with drug ingestion at 0 min. Each trial consisted of a rest period from 0 to 60 min, followed by a risk taking behavior task, a 30 min time trial (TT) with 5 &#x000d7; 30 s sprints at the following time intervals; 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29 min. Salivary cortisol (SaCOR), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRs) were measured at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min post-ingestion. Glucose and lactate samples were taken at 0 and 60 min post-ingestion. During exercise, power output (PO), heart rate (HR), EEG, and NIRS were measured. SaCOR was measured 10 min post-exercise.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Cortisol increased risk taking behavior from baseline testing. This was in line with significant neurophysiological changes at rest and during exercise. At rest, SaCOR levels were higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in COR compared to PLA (29.7 &#x000b1; 22.7 and 3.27 &#x000b1; 0.7 nmol/l, respectively). At 60 min alpha slow EEG response was higher in COR than PLA in the PFC (5.5 &#x000b1; 6.4 vs. &#x02212;0.02 &#x000b1; 8.7% change; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). During the TT there was no difference in total km, average power or average sprint power, although Peak power (PP) achieved was lower in COR than PLA (465.3 &#x000b1; 83.4 and 499.8 &#x000b1; 104.3; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and cerebral oxygenation was lower in COR (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first study to examine the effect of exogenous cortisol on exercise performance. These results are in line with previous research showing altered risk taking behavior following exogenous cortisol, however the altered behavior did not translate into changes in exercise performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>risk taking</kwd><kwd>exogenous cortisol</kwd><kwd>neurophysiological responses</kwd><kwd>BART test</kwd><kwd>exercise performance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Charles Sturt University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001769</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="58"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="10271"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cortisol is generally associated with mediating the primary effects of stress such as aversive and avoidance inducing behavior (Marinelli and Piazza, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and is widely used as a biomarker for stress (Hellhammer et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Conversely, the provision of exogenous cortisol has recently been shown to be a modulator in processing of threat related stimuli, such as reduced fearful symptomology in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Putman et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Exogenous cortisol has also been shown to increase motivated decision making behavior in humans (Putman et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Further to this, animal models have shown that high levels of glucocorticoids (GCs) increase reward and approach related behavior (Piazza et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1996a</xref>; Marinelli et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Mikics et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), produce greater locomotor activity and higher levels of impulsivity (Koob and Bloom, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Piazza et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1996b</xref>). The mechanisms by which exogenous cortisol may alter reward and approach related behavior has been postulated to be due to increased dopamine (DA) activity (Marinelli and Piazza, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) which occurs when stress levels of GCs induce an increased release of DA from the nucleus accumbens (Roug&#x000e9;-Pont et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), a component of the brain's reward system (Roitman et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Within an athletic situation, making risk based judgments has been proposed to be important to athletes in optimizing pacing during endurance events (Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Not only is it important to ensure that pacing is optimized but, in achieving the fastest overall speed possible, pace at the end of the event is not compromised resulting in a slower overall time. In addition to this, during a race or event, competitors are subject to further risk evaluation situations (Renfree et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Exposure to external environmental conditions may alter the decisions and calculations that are being made by the brain in relation to pacing. The presence of opponents and the necessity to respond to them, creates the need to weigh up all possible behavioral choices, relating to a change in pace, and their associated benefits and risks (Renfree et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>An individual's propensity to take risks and its effect on performance, pacing and RPE, has recently been examined (Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Cyclists with a higher perception of risk showed a slower starting pace and perception of risk was also shown to be associated with deviations from a predicted pace (Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Ultra-marathon runners were also investigated revealing the same relationship with greater risk perception, associated with slower starting pace (Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Whilst risk played a role in pacing strategy, their overall race time in both events examined was the same. Calculation of a hazard score has also shown that a fast start elevates the perception of hazard compared to a slow start (Williams et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) but again with no change in TT performance. These data show that a greater perception of risk results in slower starting strategies which is likely due to the risk assessment of having to get to the end of the race with less chance of a catastrophic collapse (de Koning et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). As of yet the internal manipulation of risk behavior via exogenous cortisol and the impact on exercise performance has yet to be examined.</p><p>Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the effect of exogenous cortisol on neurophysiological responses and risk taking behavior. Further to this, to examine the effect of exogenous cortisol on time trial performance. The hypothesis was that risk taking behavior would be enhanced with exogenous cortisol and that this would also influence participants approach to exercise, with a less risk adverse approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Subjects and ethical approval</title><p>Eleven, healthy, trained, male cyclists from local cycling and triathlon clubs were recruited for this study. Participants were required to have been training for at least 2 years and to be currently training for a minimum of 2 h a week. Each participant was paid a small amount on completion of the study, as an incentive to participate. Their mean &#x000b1; <italic>SD</italic> age, height, weight, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula> max and maximal aerobic peak power were, respectively; 39.6 &#x000b1; 10.4 years, 183.7 &#x000b1; 8.2 cm, 83.6 &#x000b1; 14.0 kg, 4.4 &#x000b1; 0.6 l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 397.1 &#x000b1; 36.3 W. After being informed of the risks associated with the experiment each participant signed a letter of informed consent. Subjects were cleared by a physician for any contraindications of consuming 50 mg of cortisol as defined by the medical practitioner; which included neurological diseases as well as dysfunction of the adrenal glands. The study was approved by the Charles Sturt University Research and Ethics Committee and conformed to standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants attended the laboratory on three different occasions; baseline and two intervention trial visits. At each intervention trial, participants were given either 50 mg of cortisol (COR) or a placebo (PLA). The experimental design was double blinded, randomized and counterbalanced. All test sessions were scheduled to take place between 1300 and 2000 h to reduce diurnal variations of the cortisol response (Putman et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and at a time when hormone levels are relatively stable (Henckens et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Each participant was tested at the same time of day for all visits. Prior to each visit subjects were asked to refrain from any exercise for at least 24 h prior to testing and to undertake only easy training from 36 h prior to each visit. All participants maintained a regular diet during the study period and were asked to refrain from alcohol ingestion for at least 24 h prior to testing and caffeine 6 h prior. Participants were required to not consume any food or drink with the exception of water from 1.5 h prior to arriving at the laboratory. Prior to each visit subjects were provided with a food diary to complete which ensured that meals were consumed at the same time of day to avoid interaction with diurnal changes in cortisol and food intake (Follenius et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). This also served to ensure that macronutrient intake was kept the same to maintain high levels of muscle glycogen for exercise performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Baseline and initial screening</title><p>As part of an initial screening process, participants collected salivary cortisol measures on the morning of their baseline test to determine cortisol awakening response (CAR). Samples were collected on awakening, and at 30, 45, and 60 min post-wakening. Samples were collected by placing oral swabs under the front of the tongue for 2 min before being placed into salivette tubes (Salimetrics, State College, PA, USA) and refrigerated. Participants were instructed to only drink water during this period and for nothing to be consumed 10 min prior to each sample. These instructions were explained verbally as well as via written instructions provided with the salivettes and swabs. After collection samples were frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>This was completed to ensure that participants did not have dysfunctional cortisol regulation. On the afternoon of the same day, participants came into the lab to complete a baseline (BASE) visit including an initial Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) described subsequently (Lejuez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and a maximal oxygen uptake test to establish fitness levels.</p><sec><title>Balloon analog risk task (BART)</title><p>Reliability of the BART test has been shown previously both within (Lejuez et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and across (Lejuez et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2003a</xref>) task administrations. The test has also been validated for risk taking behavior in adolescents (Lejuez et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003b</xref>) and risk taking behaviors such as drug use (Lejuez et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and delinquent activity (Aklin et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Participants completed the computer based test and were blinded to the rationale behind the test so that they could not manipulate the results.</p><p>The computer screen showed a small simulated balloon accompanied by a balloon pump, a button labeled <italic>Collect $$$</italic>, as well as a &#x0201c;money earned&#x0201d; display which informed the participants of the running total of money earned to that point. Participants were blinded from the amount earned per balloon. This was to ensure that they could not judge how many times they had pumped up the balloon. Each participant was faced with 30 balloons which were set to explode randomly. When each balloon was pumped past its set point, it exploded and no money was accrued and a new balloon was presented. If the <italic>Collect $$$</italic> button was pressed before the balloon exploded, the participants earned the money from the number of pumps on completed on that balloon. At any point during each balloon trial, the participant could stop pumping the balloon and click the &#x0201c;collect $$$&#x0201d; button.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise tests</title><sec><title>Maximal oxygen uptake</title><p>Participants were fitted with a facemask (Hans Rudolph Kansas City, MO) connected to a rapid response gas analyser (AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for the measurement of pulmonary gas exchange. A 1 min resting sample was collected before the initiation of the test. Cyclists performed a cycle ramp test to exhaustion on a Lode cycle ergometer consisting of a ramp increase in power output of 30 W min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (1 W every 2 s) until volitional exhaustion. Participants were asked to maintain their preferred cadence (all participants selected between 80 and 100 rpm) for as long as possible. The test was terminated voluntarily by each subject when they could no longer sustain the required power output whilst staying seated in the saddle. The test was performed in a quiet room with no internal or external interruptions and no verbal encouragement was provided during the test.</p><p>Pulmonary gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath throughout the exercise test using a custom-designed expired gas analysis metabolic system. All data were acquired using custom-developed software (LabVIEW; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and commercial electronic acquisition devices (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec><title>Thirty minute cycle test familiarization</title><p>Following a rest period of at least 15 min participants were then required to complete 15 min of the 30 min protocol to ensure that they were familiar with the bike gearing and the requirement for sprinting during an all-out time trial type effort.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Intervention trials</title><p>Each participant also completed two intervention visits, in addition to the BASE visit, as described subsequently. All test days were completed within 15 days with at least 2 days between trials.</p><sec><title>Resting measurements</title><p>On arrival at the laboratory subjects were seated and made comfortable. They were instructed that they were allowed to drink water during the resting period as long as they did not drink within 10 min of a saliva sample. Following this they were fitted with a wireless EEG headset (B-Alert, ABM, Ca) and two near-infrared spectrometer (NIRs) probes (NIRO-200, Hamamatsu, Japan), outlined subsequently. EEG and NIRs measures were taken at rest. Subjects also provided a resting saliva sample, as described above. Capillary blood samples were provided for the determination of blood lactate and glucose as described subsequently. Following initial resting measures (at 0 min), subjects were given two capsules to take, containing either 50 mg cortisol (COR; Cortate, Aspen Pharmacare, NSW, Aus) or placebo (PLA). This dose was chosen as it is the equivalent to the highest dose given to humans in a research environment (van Peer et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The EEG, NIRS, and salivary resting measures were repeated at the following time points post-capsule ingestion; 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. A second blood sample was also taken at 60 min post-ingestion. Following this, the participants were asked to complete a BART test, as described above (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of the intervention trials with resting and exercise measures at their relevant time points</bold>.

Bike set up was replicated as per their BASE trial. Each exercise trial consisted of a 30 min effort with 30 s sprints at the following time intervals; 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29 min. Sprints were included in the protocol to allow potential access to higher levels of work regulation which might appear with the cortisol ingestion. During the 30 min trial, participants were blinded to all feedback with the exception of time. This ensured that they were unaware of their performance level between trials, but that the exercise bout was closed loop allowing self-pacing. Each participant was asked to approach the exercise bout as they would a race and to complete as much distance as possible in the 30 min.</p><p>During exercise, power output (W), distance (km), and heart rate were recorded continuously. EEG and NIRS samples were collected for 30 s, 1 min prior to each sprint at the following steady state (ss) time points; 4, 10, 16, 22, and 28 min. During this collection period, participants were asked to keep their eyes closed to reduce eye blink noise and to maintain as stable a cycling posture as possible in order to avoid excess movement artifact. During each 30 s sprint NIRS data were collected. No EEG data were collected at this time due to the noise associated with collecting EEG during high intensity exercise. Following each sprint an RPE score was obtained. Exercise blood samples were collected via finger prick capillary technique at 14 min (BL 1) and 26 min (BL 2); which equated to approximately half way through the protocol and as near to the end as possible without interfering with the other measurements taking place. Immediately post-exercise, subjects were permitted to have one drink of water if they wished and 10 min post-exercise a further salivary cortisol sample was taken (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Heart rate</title><p>Heart rate in beats.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (HR) was measured and recorded with a chest strap and monitor (Polar RS400, Kempele, Finland) continuously throughout the trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Rating of perceived exertion (RPE)</title><p>As an index of perceived exertion, the RPE was assessed using the Borg scale (Borg, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>) where rankings ranged from 6 (no exertion at all) to 20 (maximal exertion).

Measurements for EEG strap size were taken; Sagittal, coronal plane, and circumferential measures were taken for correct strip size and EEG placement using the 10&#x02013;20 international system (Rowan and Tolunsky, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Marker pen was used for placement of marks on the forehead at 10% of the coronal measure from the nasion to the inion for placement of FP1 and FP2, to ensure correct strip placement as defined by Jasper (cited in Rowan and Tolunsky, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Synapse Conductive Electrode Cream (ABM, Ca) was used to increase conductance from scalp to electrode. The impedance of all electrodes was maintained below 40 k&#x003a9; as suggested by the manufacturer due to the hybrid active electrodes. Paired mastoid references were used and electrode and reference sites were cleaned and abraded prior to fitting. Data were sampled with a bandpass filter from 0.5 to 65 Hz (at 3 dB attenuation) obtained digitally with Sigma-Delta A/D converters. Data were acquired wirelessly across a RF link via an RS232 interface. The EEG signals were inspected continuously via online assessment at rest and during exercise. While EEG was recorded at all 20 electrode sites, data produced at the following sites were used for analysis; F3, F4, Fz, F7, F8, FP1, FP2, C3, C4, Cz.</p></sec><sec><title>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)</title><p>Two near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS) probes (NIRO-200, Hamamatsu, Japan) were placed over the left and right pre frontal lobes between FP1 and F3 (left) and FP2 and F4 (right; Billaut et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The NIRS probes were adhered to the skin after the EEG strip had been put in place in accordance of the 10&#x02013;20 international system to ensure accurate placement for each repeat trial. Each probe pair was placed in a black plastic probe holder, with predefined inter optode spacing of 4 cm. The larger inter optode distance was chosen to provide a greater maximum depth measured (Okada et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). The emission and detection probes were placed in opposite directions for each channel and the detection probes placed next to each other when on the forehead. The probes were housed in black rubber holders and attached to the skin with double sided adhesive discs. The probe holders were also secured in place by a black headband to reduce any extraneous light infiltration and to prevent any change in their position during exercise. Data were sampled at 1 Hz.

Each 30 s sample was visually inspected for artifact (Polyman, version 1.153.1065) and eye blink and muscle artifact was removed by the B-Alert decontamination algorithms. Decontaminated data were then Fast Fourier Transformed into power spectra and power spectral densities were calculated for the following frequency bands; Alpha slow (&#x003b1;S) (8&#x02013;10 Hz), alpha fast, (&#x003b1;F) (10&#x02013;13 Hz), Beta (&#x003b2;) (13&#x02013;30 Hz), and Gamma (30&#x02013;40 Hz). Prior to statistical analysis EEG channels were divided into specific regions based on Brodmann's areas (Brodmann, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) aligning with 10&#x02013;20 international EEG system as follows; Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) F7 and F8, Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) F3 and F4, Anterior prefrontal cortex (AntPFC) FP1 and FP2 and motor cortex (MC) C3, CZ, and C4. Both resting and exercise data were then calculated as percent changes from EC power spectral density baseline measures to correct for day-to-day and between-subject variability as previously reported (Nielsen et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Bailey et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NIRS analysis</title><p>Changes in concentration of Oxyhemoglobin (<italic>OHb</italic>) and De-Oxyhemoglobin (<italic>HHb</italic>) were calculated using the modified Beer-Lambert law, based on changes in light attenuation at three wavelengths and the adult forehead differential path length factor of 5.93 (Van der Zee et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI) and normalized Tissue Hemoglobin Index (nTHI) were measured by the Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy (SRS) method. The TOI is a percentage ratio of <italic>OHb</italic> to Total Hemoglobin (<italic>THb</italic>) and represents the oxygen saturation of tissue hemoglobin. The nTHI is the sum of <italic>OHb</italic> and <italic>HHb</italic>, expressed as a ratio, which represents the relative concentration of total tissue hemoglobin and is, therefore, an indicative measure of regional blood volume (Van Beekvelt et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Following testing, data were imported into an excel spreadsheet for normalization to the baseline measure. Each parameter was averaged for the period of the data collection (60 s during rest, 30 s during exercise). These averaged data were then normalized as percentage change from baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Salivary cortisol analysis</title><p>Salivary cortisol concentrations were determined using commercially available high sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kits (Salimetrics, State College, PA, USA).

During exercise, peak power production was lower in the COR trial. Further differences during the COR trial, compared to PLA, were identified in exercise responses of TOI and nTHI during sprinting which were lower than the PLA trial. There were no other differences in exercise performance.</p><sec><title>Changes in salivary cortisol levels</title><p>Salivary cortisol levels were successfully elevated with the COR condition over the 60 min rest following ingestion. Previous studies using exogenous cortisol have found similar levels as these (Buchanan and Lovallo, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Henckens et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) although higher levels have also been reported with similar protocols (Putman et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the PLA trial salivary COR showed a decline from initial baseline levels during rest. This has been shown previously and likely reflects normal diurnal variation or possibly habituation to the slight initial stress of coming into the lab for a study (Putman et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Despite the presence of elevated cortisol levels prior to exercise, further cortisol release was still stimulated from the adrenal cortex but there did not seem to be a relationship between elevated cortisol levels and an impact on exercise performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk taking behavior</title><p>The BART test provides a sequential assessment of risk taking. There was one significant change in the number of pumps made in the COR trial compared to the BASE. This suggests that in the COR trial subjects made more pumps in an attempt to win more money. However, there were no changes between groups in terms of overall performance or in pacing strategy that was suggestive of an altered perception of risk. Previous research has shown that risk perception can impact on initial pacing strategy (Micklewright et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), however, we did not find that this was modulated here.</p><p>In previous research showing motivated decision making being increased by COR in some studies the participants had much higher COR levels following a 40 mg dose than was shown in the present study; 116.4 nmol/l 1 h after administration (Putman et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) vs. 29.7 &#x000b1; 22.7 nmol/l at 60 min post-administration and 33.8 &#x000b1; 21.3 nmol/L as peak values in the present study. This difference may explain why we were not able to find more changes in risk related behavior in our participants. Changes in risk related behavior are also time dependent (Henckens et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and although we aimed to measure delayed effects of exogenous cortisol, it is possible that some rapid effects remained in some individuals and thus changes in reward based decision making might have been impaired in this instance (Koot et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Further to this, HPA axis physiology is determined by previous stressful events associated with hypercortisolism (Herman and Cullinan, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; de Carvalho Tofoli et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and, therefore, it has been hypothesized that endurance-trained individuals might develop adaptive mechanisms such as decreased sensitivity to cortisol to protect muscle and other glucocorticoid-sensitive tissues against this increased post-exercise cortisol secretion (Duclos et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Neurophysiological measures</title><p>There were significant alterations to the neural responses at rest in the EEG. Changes in neuronal excitability are known to occur with glucocorticoid receptor mediated events (Jo&#x000eb;ls and de Kloet, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) such as would have occurred with exogenous cortisol. An increase in alpha slow at rest in the COR trial, predominantly within the PFC at the ANTPFC and VLPFC occurred, but also in the MC. Our understanding of changes to alpha are varied and, therefore, interpretation of these data is complex. For example Alpha oscillations seen at the surface EEG occur when there is disengagement of underlying cortical systems in active processing (Coan and Allen, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) also described as inhibition of neural ensembles (Uusberg et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). On the other hand it is generally held that alpha oscillations are seen in surface EEG if neurons are synchronously active across several centimeters of cortex (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Nunez et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>The presence of alpha has also been proposed to relate to metabolism in the area in which it is measured. The increase in alpha may, therefore, reflect a change in metabolism as a result of the presence of the COR. Previous research has attempted to examine the change in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in conjunction with changes in frequency of alpha bandwidth. Increased alpha activity has been shown to coincide with decreases in blood flow to the same area (Oakes et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and to positively correlate with glucose metabolism and activity in the thalamus (Schreckenberger et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) suggesting a close functional relationship between thalamic activity and alpha rhythm. These studies have predominantly examined changes in the Occipital lobe created with eyes closed alpha and, therefore, may make it difficult to apply these theories to changes at the PFC which have been shown to relate to attention and motivational affective responses (Uusberg et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, desynchronization has also been found in both frontal and parietal lobes to have greater BOLD signal, that is greater metabolism with less alpha present (Laufs, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>Changes in the EEG response at rest with exogenous COR may, therefore, reflect a change in the areas of the brain that are metabolically active which might be in conjunction with increased activity of thalamic areas. The negative feedback role of cortisol on the brain has been proposed to directly inhibit the core structures of the HPA axis (Herman and Cullinan, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) which would support a cause for changes in thalamic metabolism. If an increase in alpha is reflective of inhibition or decoupling of neural networks then this may explain the EEG changes seen here, where by the cortisol binds to GRs and suppresses subsequent HPA activation. It may also be a reflection of changes in activity within parts of the PFC involved in the HPA axis response and feedback loop which might be expected (Crane et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Jo&#x000eb;ls et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>During exercise the COR did have a significant impact on cerebral oxygenation responses, predominantly during the sprints where TOI signal declined over time throughout the sprints. This continual decline in oxygenation during repeated sprints is not uncommon (Racinais et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Smith and Billaut, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Smith et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) even though more mechanical work is not produced to prompt a greater demand in brain circulation or metabolism. The decline in nTHI would seem to indicate a reduced blood volume in that area and in relation to the changes of TOI, the percentage of OHb within the blood flowing to that region was less, suggesting a greater level of desaturation via higher oxygen uptake (Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Alonso et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This is supported by the fact that HHb was higher in the COR trial, although not significantly so. Higher HHb may indicate a greater level of deoxygenation in the underlying tissue (Billaut et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) which further suggests that the presence of COR created a demand which lowered blood volume at the PFC and also desaturated the PFC to a greater extent. However, these events did not impact on exercise performance.</p><p>Oxygen availability did not change during the exercise period as OHb remained elevated in both trials throughout exercise. As power output was not affected by either condition this is in support of previous findings that suggest maintenance of oxygen availability does not impact on power output (Rooks et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Smith and Billaut, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Although other changes in NIRS measures may indicate a change in metabolism, oxygen availability remained high which is in agreement with previous findings that performance levels are maintained in this instance (Rooks et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These changes in NIRS are in support of previous work showing that during self-paced exercise changes in cerebral oxygenation remain within a range that does not hinder exercise performance (Billaut et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) or conversely that changes in these parameters are not an important indicator for exercise regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased peak power output</title><p>Despite decreases in peak power during exercise in the COR trial, overall TT performance was not affected between the two conditions. This, therefore, emphasizes the need to examine several aspects of performance when manipulating neurotransmitter responses. Previous manipulations of the dopaminergic pathways during exercise have only shown changes in time trial performance in the heat rather than in normothermic environments (Watson et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Roelands et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This may be due to the role of the hypothalamus in the manipulation of these pathways and its role in thermoregulation. In addition to this, previous research interrupting the HPA axis prior to exercise with ACTH dose has not shown any effects on maximal cycling performance (Soetens et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). However, having found a change in peak power output with elevated cortisol levels but no change in overall exercise performance it may be prudent in future research to include examination of several exercise models when manipulating neurotransmitter responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Limitations</title><p>We would like to highlight the limitations to our study which may impact on the interpretation of the results.
