Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid that produces analgesic activity primarily via mu receptor agonism [<xref rid="pnv004-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Immediate release (IR) hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen is the most commonly prescribed opioid medication in the United States [<xref rid="pnv004-B2" ref-type="bibr">2,3</xref>]. Until recently, hydrocodone was available only in IR combination products with hydrocodone doses of 5, 7.5, or 10 mg in combination with up to 325 mg acetaminophen or up to 200 mg of ibuprofen. For these IR combination products, the total daily hydrocodone dose is limited to 20&#x02013;60 mg due primarily to the risk of hepatotoxicity for acetaminophen combination products [<xref rid="pnv004-B4" ref-type="bibr">4,5</xref>] and toxic gastrointestinal effects for other nonopioid components. Single-entity, extended-release (ER) opioids provide another treatment option for patients with pain by addressing the toxicity of the nonopioid component of IR hydrocodone combination products and offering less frequent dosing [<xref rid="pnv004-B6" ref-type="bibr">6,7</xref>].</p><p>The abuse and misuse of prescription opioids in the United States is itself a significant medical and public health problem affecting multiple aspects of life and greatly impacting the health care system [<xref rid="pnv004-B8" ref-type="bibr">8,9</xref>]. Of the prescription opioids, IR hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen is among the most widely abused drugs [<xref rid="pnv004-B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>], and its misuse rose by 107% between 2004 and 2011 [<xref rid="pnv004-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Prescription opioid abuse primarily involves oral, intranasal, and intravenous routes of administration. Opioid abuse frequently consists of taking more than the recommended dose of intact dosage forms using the intended route of administration; however, abusers often choose to manipulate opioid dosage forms (particle size reduction and/or opioid extraction) to defeat the control of opioid release and/or facilitate administration by oral, intranasal, or intravenous routes [<xref rid="pnv004-B10" ref-type="bibr">10,11,14</xref>]. Development of opioid formulations with abuse-deterrent properties [<xref rid="pnv004-B8" ref-type="bibr">8,14&#x02013;17</xref>] is one approach in the overall strategy to minimize the abuse and misuse of prescription opioids while preserving their analgesic benefits for patients. The real-world impact of opioid formulations with abuse-deterrent properties on patterns of drug misuse and abuse is being evaluated as more of these products are approved and marketed. Recent experience with products with abuse-deterrent properties suggests that these products may reduce the abuse of prescription opioids by certain methods and routes of administration [<xref rid="pnv004-B18" ref-type="bibr">18,19</xref>].</p><p>HYD (Hysingla ER&#x000ae;, Purdue Pharma L.P., Stamford, CT) is a single-entity, once-daily, extended-release, hydrocodone bitartrate tablet with abuse-deterrent properties [<xref rid="pnv004-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved HYD for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which other treatment options are inadequate. HYD tablets contain no nonopioid analgesic component (e.g., acetaminophen) and are formulated in multiple strengths (20&#x02013;120 mg) for prescribers to tailor daily dosage to meet individual patient needs. HYD is formulated using RESISTEC&#x02122;, a proprietary extended-release solid oral dosage formulation platform. RESISTEC uses a unique combination of polymer and processing that confers tablet hardness and imparts viscosity when dissolved in aqueous solutions.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the abuse potential of HYD in healthy, nondependent recreational opioid users relative to hydrocodone powder (positive control) and placebo, and to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of manipulated HYD when administered intranasally. Two methods of HYD tablet manipulation were studied. Reproducible reduction of HYD tablets to fine particles required specialized equipment, while reduction of HYD tablets to coarse particles could be achieved using manual implements and is more likely to be representative of real-world manipulations of HYD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2A"><title>Subject Eligibility</title><p>Study subjects were healthy, moderately experienced opioid users aged 18&#x02013;55 years with a history of intranasal opioid abuse. Moderate experience was defined as opioid use for nontherapeutic purposes (i.e., for psychoactive effects) on at least 10 occasions in the previous year, with use of opioids&#x02009;&#x02265;three times in the 12 weeks prior to screening, and&#x02009;&#x02265;three occasions of intranasal opioid use for recreational abuse purposes in the past year. Subjects had a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a weight of&#x02009;&#x02265;50 kg. Subjects must have taken a dose of opioid equivalent to 40 mg hydrocodone or higher by any route of administration at least once in the past year. Negative urine drug screen results were required prior to administering the naloxone challenge and all subsequent treatments. Due to the long half-life of cannabinoids and benzodiazepines (and their metabolites), urine drug screen results for these molecules were required to be negative, stable, or decreasing during the study. Negative ethanol breath tests were required at screening and all subsequent visits.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had any clinically relevant findings in their medical history, including a history or presence of any significant illness, past or planned abdominal surgery, a history of hypotension, or a history of acute asthma or other obstructive airway disease. Subjects who consumed&#x02009;&#x0003e;20 cigarettes per day or were unable to abstain from smoking for at least 10 hours were excluded. Subjects who had a self-reported history of dependence within the previous two years, or who participated in a drug rehabilitation program at any time were also excluded. Subjects demonstrating drug/alcohol dependence as classified by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) clinical interviews were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2B"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was conducted in 2013, in accordance with a 2013 FDA draft guidance on the evaluation of abuse-deterrent opioids [<xref rid="pnv004-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This study remains consistent with the final version of that guidance, made available in April 2015 [<xref rid="pnv004-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This was a single-center, double-blind, positive- and placebo-controlled, randomized, four-treatment crossover study. The study protocol and its informed consent form were reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, and the study was conducted according to current Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all relevant parts of the United States Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. Prior to study entry, all subjects provided written informed consent. The study consisted of five phases: screening, dose selection, qualification, treatment, and follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pnv004-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Following the screening phase, eligible subjects underwent a naloxone challenge to exclude subjects who were physically dependent on opioids.

To qualify for the treatment phase, subjects were required to have acceptable responses to placebo and hydrocodone powder on visual analog scales (VASs; 0&#x02013;100) for various subjective pharmacodynamic (PD) measures. Peak scores in response to hydrocodone powder had to be greater than placebo by defined increments for &#x0201c;At this Moment&#x0201d; Drug Liking VAS, a difference of&#x02009;&#x02265;15 points, or 30%; Overall Drug Liking VAS, a difference of&#x02009;&#x02265;10 points, or 20%; and Feeling High VAS, a difference of&#x02009;&#x02265;30 points, or 30%.

Euphoric mood was most commonly reported following administration of hydrocodone powder (88.9%, 24 subjects), in addition to pruritus (55.6%, 15 subjects) and somnolence (25.9%, seven subjects). The most common AE for HYD coarse particles and HYD fine particles was nasal congestion (28.6% and 50%, respectively). The majority of subjects recovered from AEs with no action required, except for five subjects who were treated with concomitant paracetamol. One subject experienced mild ventricular tachycardia following administration of HYD coarse particles which led to discontinuation from the study. This AE resolved less than 1 minute after onset without intervention and was assessed as &#x02018;possibly related&#x02019; to study drug. A follow-up ECG (approximately six days after the AE) was normal. There were no deaths in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Opioid analgesics serve an important role in the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain; however, there is a widespread abuse and misuse in the United States and across the world [<xref rid="pnv004-B23" ref-type="bibr">23,24</xref>]. Currently, there is an emphasis on the development of opioid formulations with abuse-deterrent properties to minimize abuse and misuse as part of a multifaceted approach to combating this public health problem. One category of formulations designed to deter abuse are those that incorporate physicochemical barriers which hinder chewing, crushing, cutting, and other physical manipulations, and inhibit extraction of the opioid in common solvents such as water or alcohol [<xref rid="pnv004-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interpretation of abuse potential results for different dosage form manipulations must take into account the time, effort, equipment, and knowledge required to produce the manipulated result.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of various methods of physical manipulation of HYD tablets that abusers might employ, two manipulation methods were studied. One method of manipulation represented the FDA Guidance requirement for particle size reduction and the other represented real-world relevance. Due to the intrinsic hardness of HYD tablets, there were challenges in standardizing the manipulation methods in order to provide reproducible particle size reduction. Consistent with the FDA Guidance requirement, the HYD fine particle size treatment was included to represent the manipulation that would cause the highest release of the opioid and the highest plasma opioid concentrations. Reproducible production of fine particles from HYD tablets required the use of a laboratory-grade analytical mill, and consequently is not representative of a practical, real-world manipulation. Therefore, the HYD coarse-particle size treatment was included to represent greater real-world relevance. The coarse-particle size was prepared using a standardized method of manipulation involving manual implements that is more likely to be representative of real-world manipulations of HYD.</p><p>A preliminary, dose-selection phase determined 60 mg of hydrocodone provided sufficient levels of discrimination vs placebo in non-dependent recreational opioid users and was the dose used during the qualification and treatment phases of this study. In the treatment phase, statistically significant differences between hydrocodone powder and placebo for the primary measures of &#x0201c;At this Moment&#x0201d; Drug Liking and Feeling High were observed, confirming the sensitivity of the measures and study validity. The physicochemical properties of HYD significantly reduced hydrocodone abuse potential when HYD was insufflated either as coarse or fine particles. This effect was demonstrated by significantly lower E<sub>max</sub> for Drug Liking and Feeling High VAS. The Drug Liking reduction analysis, where a majority of subjects showed a reduction in drug liking for the HYD coarse and fine particles compared with hydrocodone powder, supports the comparisons of E<sub>max</sub> scores. In addition, secondary measures of Balance of Effects (Overall Drug Liking VAS, Take Drug Again VAS, and SDV); Positive Effects (Good Effects VAS), Negative Effects (Bad Effects VAS), Sedative Effects (Drowsiness/Alertness VAS), and the Any Effects VAS also showed statistically significant differences between HYD coarse or fine particles and hydrocodone powder.</p><p>Consistent with these reductions in subjective effects, insufflation of HYD coarse or HYD fine particles produced opioid-induced pupil constriction that were significantly lower than those produced by hydrocodone powder. Subjects had greater difficulty insufflating both HYD treatments and reported greater nasal irritation in comparison with hydrocodone powder. Both HYD coarse and HYD fine particles had significantly higher E<sub>max</sub> values for observer-rated assessments (nasal congestion, nasal irritation, and nasal discharge) and subject-rated assessments (need to blow nose, nasal discharge, facial pain, and nasal congestion) of intranasal irritation measures relative to hydrocodone powder.</p><p>The PK profile for insufflated HYD coarse and fine particles showed reduced C<sub>max</sub> and delayed T<sub>max</sub> in comparison with hydrocodone powder. Here, mean C<sub>max </sub>of HYD coarse and fine particle sizes was reduced by 75% and 66%, respectively, to that of hydrocodone powder, while median T<sub>max</sub> was 158% and 96% longer, respectively. These differences may be associated with lower abuse potential, because the rate of increase (i.e., C<sub>max</sub>/T<sub>max</sub>) in opioid plasma concentrations affects response&#x02014;the faster the increase in opioid plasma concentrations, the more likely it is to be abused [<xref rid="pnv004-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, compared with insufflated hydrocodone powder, overall exposure to hydrocodone was reduced by more than half following administration of HYD coarse or HYD fine particles. These PK results likely reflect, in part, the incomplete insufflation of manipulated HYD, which was for a common occurrence both HYD coarse and HYD fine particles but did not occur for hydrocodone powder. In addition, the slower onset of effects may reflect retention of some of the controlled-release properties of the formulation, despite physical manipulation of the HYD tablet.</p><p>Adverse events were generally mild in severity and consistent with those of opioids [<xref rid="pnv004-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Intranasal administration of HYD coarse and fine particles produced lower rates of euphoric mood and somnolence compared with hydrocodone powder, but higher levels of nasal irritation, in agreement with the PD assessments.</p><p>This study does have limitations inherent to any assessment of a formulation with abuse-deterrent properties [<xref rid="pnv004-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As this was carried out in a controlled, clinical environment, the abuse-deterrent potential in the real world cannot be directly determined. The relationships between reductions in abuse potential measured in controlled settings and reductions in abuse liability in real-world settings remain to be fully elucidated. Further, the complex socioeconomic factors that also affect abuse liability over time and across geographic space further complicate the direct translation of abuse potential reduction into expectations of real-world effects. Another limitation is that, although careful consideration was given to blinding study treatments (e.g., use of tinted vials with preinserted tubes for insufflation), it was not possible to completely prevent subjects from making certain comparisons between study treatments, thus potentially compromising the blinding and introducing bias.</p><p>Consistent with FDA&#x02019;s 2015 guidance for industry on the development and assessment of abuse deterrent technologies [<xref rid="pnv004-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], HYD has shown through premarketing studies that its abuse-deterrence properties are expected to reduce abuse of the drug by chewing and then taking orally, or by crushing and snorting or injecting [<xref rid="pnv004-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Laboratory based in vitro manipulation and extraction studies (Category 1) demonstrated that HYD has physical and chemical properties that are expected to deter intranasal and intravenous abuse [<xref rid="pnv004-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clinical studies of abuse potential (Category 3), which include the present study as well as an oral abuse potential study, along with support from the in vitro studies, also indicate that HYD has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce intranasal abuse and oral abuse when chewed [<xref rid="pnv004-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, abuse of HYD by the intravenous, intranasal, and oral routes is still possible. Ultimately, the full abuse-deterrent potential of HYD cannot be completely ascertained until the product is introduced into the market and long-term postmarketing epidemiologic studies are performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based upon the pattern of responses on subjective measures of drug liking and intranasal irritation, the intranasal abuse potential of HYD, when manipulated to produce coarse or fine particles, is significantly reduced compared with the hydrocodone powder. The time course of subjective opioid effects was generally consistent with the time course of both objective opioid effects and systemic hydrocodone concentrations. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that the physicochemical properties of HYD tablets provide barriers that deter the effective physical manipulation of HYD tablets for the purpose of insufflation in order to achieve a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; or euphoric effect. Postmarketing studies of HYD are needed to assess the real-world abuse-deterrent effects of HYD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was wholly funded by Purdue Pharma L.P.
