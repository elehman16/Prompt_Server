training (TOT) on hand dexterity and strength in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral
palsy. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy were
randomly assigned to either the TOT group (n=6) or the control group (n=6). In both
groups, conventional occupational therapy was performed 40-min/day, 2 times a week, for 4
weeks. In the TOT group, TOT was additionally performed for 20&#x02005;min, and the control group
received usual care. The box and block test (BBT) was performed to assess hand dexterity.
Hand strength was also assessed using hand dynamometer. [Results] After intervention, the
TOT group showed a significant improvement of hand dexterity. In the control group, BBT
and grip strength were not significantly improved after intervention. [Conclusion] In
clinical settings, we suggest that TOT may be used as an intervention to improve hand
dexterity in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Task oriented training</kwd><kwd>Hand dexterity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder by pre-birth, at birth, post-birth or
brain injury of early infancy. CP children often experience delayed development and body
movement, as well as a limitation of activity of daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study has reported that a spastic type accounts for 36%
of all CPs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with hemiplegic CP
suffer from spasticity, sensory deficit, and muscle weakness, affecting functions of the
upper limb more than that of the lower limb<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Decreased upper limb function in children with spastic hemiplegic CP reduces the efficiency
of manipulative function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Children with
spastic hemiplegic CP experience problems of motor control, with inefficient movement
patterns. Thus, they have a mass movement pattern and difficulty performing specific
tasks<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, children with spastic
hemiplegic CP are limited with activities of daily living, such as dressing, feeding, and
function mobility, due to problems of the upper limb and hand function<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of various interventions, such as
constraint-induced movement therapy, neurodevelopmental treatment, and sensory-integration,
which have been suggested to improve functions of the upper limb and hand in children with
CP<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of these interventions, task-oriented
training (TOT) has been the treatment approach to improve functional movement<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have reported the effects of TOT on gait function in stroke patients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as mobility in children with CP<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Higgins et al. has also reported that TOT
significantly increases upper limb function in stroke patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a few studies have reported the effects of TOT
on upper limb function in children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Therefore, this study
investigated the effects of TOT on hand dexterity and strength in children with spastic
hemiplegic cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve children with spastic hemiplegic CP, who were admitted to a community welfare
located in Seoul, participated in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1)
Diagnosis of CP (hemiplegic type), 2) age 5&#x02013;13&#x02005;years, 3) levels 1 and 2 on the gross motor
function classification system, and 4) no history of epilepsy. The exclusion criteria were
as follows: 1) Botulinum toxin A treatment for the upper limb in the previous 6 months and
2) excessive spasticity in the upper limb. Parents of the children who participated in this
study were well informed about the content of the experiment and the procedure. This study
was approved by the Gachon University Institutional Review Board
(1044396-201604-HR-033-01).</p><p>Twelve children with CP were randomly assigned to either the TOT groups or the control
group. Both groups received the same conventional occupational therapy 40 minutes a day, 2
times a week for four weeks. The TOT group additionally received TOT for 20&#x02005;min, while the
control group received the usual care.</p><p>In the TOT group, tasks focused on improving the upper limb function. The TOT group
repeated reaching, ring activity, and stacking cup to catch the target using a paretic hand.
For example, the participant stretched the arms to reach for the target point, the paretic
hand to the ring activity, the paretic hand to the side, and the paretic hand to the side of
body. The therapist gave feedback so that the children could train with their own
volition.</p><p>Box-and-Block Test (BBT) was used to assess hand dexterity. The BBT score is a number of
blocks (1 inch) moved from one box to the other box for 1&#x02005;min. This test reported high
inter-rater reliability (r=0.94&#x02013;0.98) and intra-rater reliability (r=0.99&#x02013;1.00)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Grip strength was evaluated with a Jamar
dynamometer (Therapeutic Equipment Corporation, USA), in accordance with the standard
procedure<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The score of grip strength
was determined as the average of 3 trials.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 22. All values were expressed as the mean &#x000b1;
standard deviation (SD). Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of the data was used. General
characteristics of children between groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U Test and
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare before and after for
each group. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the difference of hand
dexterity and strength between the two groups. The significance level was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 12 patients completed the study. There were no significant differences between

spastic hemiplegic CP. TOT significantly increased hand dexterity, but did not improve grip
strength; conversely, there was no significant improvement in hand dexterity and strength
after intervention in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two
groups. In conclusion, we recommend that TOT be used as an intervention method to improve
hand dexterity in children with spastic hemiplegic CP.</p><p>The results of this study confirmed the effect of combined TOT with conventional
occupational therapy. The control group received conventional occupational therapy only. In
the control group, the BBT increased from 11.33 to 12.17 after intervention, while grip
strength improved from 1.92 to 2.08; but this showed no statistical significance. In the TOT
group, there was no significant improvement in grip strength, going from 2.25 to 2.63 after
intervention; however, in this group there was a significant improvement in BBT, going from
11.17 to 13.33 post-intervention. This result supports the notion that an increase in the
intervention dosage may result in a greater improvement<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lang et al. has reported that the clinical intervention dosage is insufficient for
significant brain neuroplasticity and functional recovery in stroke patients<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, children do not receive
adequate rehabilitative intervention in South Korea, due to the burden of treatment costs
and clinical setting problems<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
study demonstrated that TOT with conventional rehabilitation significantly improves hand
dexterity. Therefore, TOT should be provided in the rehabilitation of children with spastic
hemiplegic CP.</p><p>Despite positive results for the effect of combined TOT with conventional occupational
therapy, the present study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small.
Additionally, this study did not confirm the long-term sustained effects after the
intervention. Further studies are needed to supplement the findings of this study accounting
for these limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cans</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe: <article-title>Surveillance of
