Systemic infections due to <italic>C. albicans </italic>exhibit good susceptibility to fluconazole and echinocandins. However, the echinocandin anidulafungin was recently demonstrated to be more effective than fluconazole for systemic <italic>Candida </italic>infections in a randomized, double-blind trial among 245 patients. In that trial, most infections were caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and all respective isolates were susceptible to randomized study drug. We sought to better understand the factors associated with the enhanced efficacy of anidulafungin and hypothesized that intrinsic properties of the antifungal agents contributed to the treatment differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Global responses at end of intravenous study treatment in patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infection were compared post-hoc. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict response and to adjust for differences in independent baseline characteristics. Analyses focused on time to negative blood cultures, persistent infection at end of intravenous study treatment, and 6-week survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 135 patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infections were identified. Among these, baseline APACHE II scores were similar between treatment arms. In these patients, global response was significantly better for anidulafungin than fluconazole (81.1% vs 62.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference, 3.7-33.9). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, the odds ratio for global response was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.06-5.25). Study treatment and APACHE II score were significant predictors of outcome. The most predictive logistic regression model found that the odds ratio for study treatment was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.14-5.91) in favor of anidulafungin, and the odds ratio for APACHE II score was 0.935 (95% CI, 0.885-0.987), with poorer responses associated with higher baseline APACHE II scores. Anidulafungin was associated with significantly faster clearance of blood cultures (log-rank <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and significantly fewer persistent infections (2.7% vs 13.1%; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Survival through 6 weeks did not differ between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infection, anidulafungin was more effective than fluconazole, with more rapid clearance of positive blood cultures.

Epidemiological data demonstrate that the frequency of <italic>Candida </italic>infections is rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], along with an increase in the proportion of infections caused by non-<italic>albicans Candida </italic>species that are intrinsically resistant or variably susceptible to fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, <italic>C. albicans </italic>continues to be the most common <italic>Candida </italic>species isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The vast majority of <italic>C. albicans </italic>isolates from bloodstream infections remain fully susceptible to fluconazole, which has been the treatment of choice for these infections in most settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, updated IDSA guidelines now favor an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin) as first-line treatment for systemic candidiasis in moderately severe to severely ill patients or those with prior azole exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Echinocandins have several potential advantages over fluconazole for the treatment of systemic candidiasis. They have a broader spectrum of activity (encompassing fluconazole-resistant <italic>C. glabrata </italic>and <italic>C. krusei</italic>) and exhibit potent fungicidal activity against most <italic>Candida </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Echinocandins are highly active in vitro against <italic>C. albicans</italic>, with lower MICs than those of fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While fluconazole and the echinocandins have similarly favorable safety profiles, the latter do not require dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>A phase III, randomized, double-blind study compared anidulafungin with fluconazole as primary treatment of systemic candidiasis in adult patients infected with any <italic>Candida </italic>species, except <italic>C. krusei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Global response rates at the end of IV study treatment in mITT patients were significantly higher with anidulafungin (76%) than fluconazole (60%). The superiority of anidulafungin was questioned because of a potential center effect. However, a number of robust statistical tests all failed to show the presence of such an effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Of note, <italic>C. albicans </italic>was identified as the cause of infection in the majority of cases (62%) and the difference in global responses among this clinically important subgroup was remarkable: 81% with anidulafungin versus 62% with fluconazole (<italic>p </italic>= 0.02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since <italic>C. albicans </italic>isolates were almost uniformly susceptible to fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the excess failures in the fluconazole group could not be attributed to antifungal resistance. However, due to the lack of a multivariable analysis, it was unclear whether these differences were potentially related to unknown host factors. We therefore conducted a post-hoc analysis using data collected from that trial, in order to explore the factors associated with the better global response of anidulafungin, specifically in patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The design of the original randomized clinical trial in patients with confirmed candidemia or other forms of invasive candidiasis has been described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Enrolled patients were randomized to receive blinded IV treatment with either anidulafungin or fluconazole; after &#x02265; 10 days, the antifungal regimen could be changed to open-label oral fluconazole. The primary endpoint was global response at end of IV study treatment in the mITT population. Other comparisons included time to negative blood culture, rates of persistent infection at end of IV study treatment (as assessed by the investigator based on available clinical and microbiologic data), and 6-week survival.</p><p>For the purposes of this post-hoc analysis, the study database was reviewed to identify all patients with systemic candidiasis caused by <italic>C. albicans </italic>only.

The significance of this analysis is that it enabled us to directly compare the efficacy of a fungicidal with that of a fungistatic drug in patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infections, without potential confounding by differences in susceptibility. Despite all isolates of <italic>C. albicans </italic>being susceptible to the antifungal agent received by each patient, response to anidulafungin was significantly greater than to fluconazole. Logistic regression analysis, using the Akaike Information Criterion methodology, demonstrated that study drug and baseline APACHE II score were the principal independent variables determining this outcome, reflecting pharmacological and host factors, respectively. Study drug remained a significant predictor of treatment success even after adjustment for APACHE II scores and center variability, with an estimated OR of 2.6. While there was notable variation in this odds ratio, in part due to the relatively small sample size, it remained significant from a statistical perspective and should therefore be considered important. These results suggest a pharmacological benefit of anidulafungin in the treatment of systemic candidiasis due to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, since no other factor, such as potential baseline imbalances and center variability, was shown to have impacted the outcome.</p><p>Understanding the factors determining clinical outcomes in patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infections was important, since treatment differences among this most common subpopulation in turn drove the treatment differences observed in the overall clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Among patients infected with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, anidulafungin resulted in better global response at end of IV study treatment, at the end of all treatment, and at the 2-week follow-up. Moreover, patients treated with anidulafungin also had more rapid eradication of yeast from the blood, as well as lower rates of persistent <italic>C. albicans </italic>infection.</p><p>Whether the better response of anidulafungin in the subpopulation of patients with systemic candidiasis caused by <italic>C. albicans </italic>emerged as the result of an imbalance in characteristics between the two treatment arms was not evident from the previously available data. However, the present analyses show that the efficacy differences were not due to imbalances in baseline clinical or demographic characteristics between treatment arms. There was also no imbalance in the proportion of patients whose central venous catheters remained in place during the study; this factor is considered important, because removal or replacement of central venous catheters may lead to better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, the lower response to fluconazole could also not be explained by in vitro resistance. Finally, first-line therapy with anidulafungin was identified as a significant and independent predictor of successful treatment outcome and remained so after adjustment for APACHE II score.</p><p>Even though we did not specifically test fungicidality, the recognized fungicidal properties of the echinocandin may have contributed to this outcome. In fact, the more rapid clearance of blood cultures and greater patient survival during the early phase of therapy are consistent with the pharmacodynamic properties of a fungicidal agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Similar results have also been observed in pre-clinical studies. For instance, a neutropenic murine model of disseminated <italic>C. albicans </italic>infection demonstrated that anidulafungin yielded significantly greater reduction of fungal burden in the kidneys than fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and, in a neutropenic rabbit model of systemic candidiasis, anidulafungin cleared <italic>C. albicans </italic>from tissues more effectively than fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Organism-mediated tissue injury appears to be an intrinsic component of <italic>C. albicans </italic>pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and failure to quickly control candidemia can lead to disseminated infection and poor outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Considered together, these results suggest that the enhanced fungicidal activity of echinocandins may have an impact on treatment outcomes in invasive <italic>C. albicans </italic>infections.</p><p>Although there was a clear clinical benefit with anidulafungin, this did not translate into a difference in long-term survival. We can merely speculate why this may have occurred. It is possible that later deaths were attributable to underlying illnesses rather than to systemic candidiasis. In a matched case-controlled study among candidemia-exposed and candidemia-unexposed patients, slightly less than half of the overall mortality was caused by candidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Another possible explanation is that optimal management of patients with invasive <italic>Candida </italic>infections includes other interventions besides antifungal therapy, and these factors were not controlled for in our study. Also, the clinical trial may have selected for patients with better prognoses, thus making it more difficult to demonstrate a survival benefit.</p><p>Our study has several potential limitations. Although the comparison of global response in patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>infection was planned <italic>a priori</italic>, the analyses described in this manuscript were performed post-hoc in a subset of patients, albeit using prospectively collected data from a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Owing to the post-hoc nature of these analyses, the two treatment groups did not have the same sample size, which was not chosen to be statistically powered. However, this slight disproportion should not impact our overall results, as all relevant differences in baseline factors were adjusted for using multivariate logistic regression; the odds ratio for the treatment effect is thus corrected for any baseline imbalances. Of note, despite incorporating a relatively large number of baseline variables into the multivariate analyses, there may have been unidentified confounding variables with a potentially significant impact on response. Since no adjustment was made for multiplicity, the results should be interpreted with some caution. Another potential limitation is the lack of daily blood culture collection during the original trial, which precluded an accurate determination of the exact time to negative blood culture; the corresponding analysis should thus be interpreted with some caution. This shortcoming is somewhat compensated for by the fact that the vast majority of blood cultures were collected on time points (&#x000b1; 1 day) prespecified by the study protocol. Finally, extrapolation of our results to all patients with systemic candidiasis due to <italic>C. albicans </italic>may not be appropriate, since we focused on patients with <italic>C. albicans </italic>only and excluded those with mixed (<italic>albicans </italic>and non-<italic>albicans</italic>) infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This analysis based on prospectively collected data from a pivotal clinical trial confirms that anidulafungin had better efficacy than fluconazole for the treatment of candidemia or invasive candidiasis due to <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
