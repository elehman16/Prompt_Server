It is enrolling 2016 MDD outpatients (ages 18-65) from primary or specialty care practices (672 per treatment arm; 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls). Study-eligible patients are antidepressant medication (ADM) na&#x000ef;ve or willing to undergo a one-week wash-out of any non-protocol ADM, and cannot have had an inadequate response to protocol ADM. Baseline assessments include symptoms; distress; daily function; cognitive performance; electroencephalogram and event-related potentials; heart rate and genetic measures. A subset of these baseline assessments are repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Outcomes include the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (primary) and self-reported depressive symptoms, social functioning, quality of life, emotional regulation, and side-effect burden (secondary). Participants may then enter a naturalistic telephone follow-up at weeks 12, 16, 24 and 52. The first half of the sample will be used to identify potential predictors and moderators, and the second half to replicate and confirm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>First enrolment was in December 2008, and is ongoing. iSPOT-D evaluates clinical and biological predictors of treatment response in the largest known sample of MDD collected worldwide.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>International Study to Predict Optimised Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) <bold>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: </bold>NCT00693849</p><p><bold>URL: </bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00693849?term=International+Study+to+Predict+Optimized+Treatment+for+Depression&#x00026;rank=1">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00693849?term=International+Study+to+Predict+Optimized+Treatment+for+Depression&#x00026;rank=1</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth most disabling medical condition worldwide (based on disability-adjusted lifeyears) and is expected to be ranked second by year 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. MDD is typically recurrent, often chronic and disabling, with a lifetime prevalence rate of over 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Women are approximately twice as likely to develop MDD as men. MDD is associated with high health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Antidepressant medications (ADMs) are effective, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but only about 50% of patients with MDD show a response (&#x0003e;50% reduction in baseline symptoms) and only about one in three attain remission (virtual absence of symptoms) within the first eight weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Those who do not attain remission remain at high risk for subsequent depression, functional impairment and serious general medical conditions (GMCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Several treatments for MDD are available, but they are currently selected using a trial-by-trial approach because the field has yet to identify clinically-useful patient baseline measures that reliably recommend one treatment over another (moderators) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, several baseline features that foretell overall outcome regardless of treatment type (predictors) have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The ongoing International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment - in Depression (iSPOT-D) is designed to evaluate a range of potentially useful moderators and/or predictors within a group of representative outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD. iSPOT-D is a 'practical trial' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in that it aims to mirror clinical practice in a representative spectrum of outpatients (to enhance generalizability). In addition to symptoms, iSPOT-D analyzes a range of outcomes including function, adverse events, and side effect burden.</p><p>The primary aims of iSPOT-D are to:</p><p>1. Identify overall predictors of treatment outcome (response or remission) after up to eight weeks of ADM treatment with escitalopram, sertraline or venlafaxine</p><p>2. Identify moderators of treatment outcome (response or remission) after up to eight weeks of ADM treatment</p><p>3. Develop a model to incorporate the effects of multiple predictors or moderators on response and remission</p><p>4. Conduct a replication study that utilizes the second half of the sample to replicate and confirm the results of the analyses of the first half (Aims 1-3).</p><p>Secondary aims include determining predictors and moderators of (1) treatment response according to MDD subtype and (2) symptom severity over time within the primary study period (baseline to week 8) and over the more exploratory follow-up period of 12 to 52 weeks.</p><p>In addition, a brain imaging sub-study is assessing 10% of participants and matched controls with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) under rest conditions, and functional MRI under task conditions, to evaluate neuroanatomical and neural circuitry measures for diagnostic sensitivity and state versus trait-like effects from baseline to week 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Organizational Structure</title><p>The infrastructure of the iSPOT-D multi-centre, international, randomized, prospective, open-label trial includes the Global Coordinating Center and Data Center (Sydney) with Global Trial Coordinator and executive management team; a Molecular Center (Indianapolis); and 20 clinical sites (see Appendix 1), each with a Principal investigator(s) and Clinical Trial Coordinator (CTC). Study clinical sites include clinical research sites within academic settings and clinical sites in clinical practices. Monitoring visits at each clinical site are conducted by Clinical Trial Monitors every eight to 12 weeks (depending on recruitment rates) to ensure procedural and data integrity.</p><p>CTCs at each clinical site assist in the recruitment, evaluation, management and assessments of participants. Clinical data are acquired by trained clinicians (psychiatrists or psychologists) who have passed inter-rater reliability training. The iSPOT-D Executive Committee oversees the trial, which is supported by the Clinical Research Organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Site selection/training/recruitment</title><p>Clinical sites were selected based on the likelihood of meeting recruitment goals and executing the protocol. Most sites are practices that do not typically engage in clinical trials. During a site initiation visit, CTCs at each site are trained and certified in protocol implementation and data collection methods. As new staff is added, they are trained by the Principal Investigator. CTCs work closely with participants and clinicians, administer some clinician-rated instruments, ensure that participants complete all self-rated instruments, and function as study coordinators (i.e., liaise among sites, Clinical Trial Monitors and the Global Coordinating Center).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Participants</title><p>The iSPOT-D study is ongoing, with enrolment having begun in January 2009. The goal is to recruit 2016 participants with nonpsychotic MDD, with 672 in each of the three treatment groups and 672 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls. Broad inclusion and minimal exclusion criteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) are used to recruit representative adult outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD who would typically receive ADM in routine practice. Patients over age 65 are excluded because concomitant medical conditions or medications could interact with protocol medications. Adolescents/children are excluded because the efficacy and safety of most study ADMs have not been established for this age group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inclusion/Exclusion criteria for iSPOT-D study entry</bold>. *DSM-IV: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

All protocol modifications are submitted to each IRB for approval before implementation. Prior to undertaking any study-related procedures, each participant receives a verbal and written explanation of study aims, methods, potential hazards and benefits from investigators, and provides written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Regimens</title><sec><title>Enrolment/randomization</title><p>Participants are enrolled at each clinical site and randomized to receive escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR as these ADMs are commonly used in practice <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guidelines.gov">http://www.guidelines.gov</ext-link> and have distinct pharmacological properties which may enable the identification of moderators. Randomization is carried out using PhaseForward's&#x02122; validated, Web-based Interactive Response Technology. A blocked randomization procedure (block size of 12) is undertaken at the level of the Global Coordinating Center, given that treatment options are equipoise across sites. Open treatment is used to ensure safety and represent clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment visits and follow ups</title><p>Clinical visits are required at week 0 (baseline) and week 8. Telephone monitoring is undertaken at weeks 2, 4 and 6 to obtain measures of the primary and secondary outcomes. Telephone monitoring with these same measures is continued in the follow-up period at weeks 12, 16, 24 and 52 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of iSPOT-D monitoring of participants</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-4-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Protocol Treatment Delivery</title><p>iSPOT-D aims to ensure representative but high quality treatment implementation and maximal participant retention by collaborating with treating clinicians. Doses for ADM medications are adjusted by the treating clinicians according to routine clinical practice, within the following dose ranges: escitalopram (10 to 20 mg/day), sertraline (50 to 200 mgday) and venlafaxine-XR (75 to 225 mg/day). Participants are compensated for each research assessment (equivalent to $25/1-hour assessment). CTCs remain in contact with participants to enhance participation and minimize premature discontinuation. Newsletters and updates are provided to participants on a monthly basis via e-mail and teleconference, respectively, to maintain interest and motivation and to enhance shared learning.</p><p>CTCs at each clinical site perform protocol-specified data gathering and enter data in an electronic case report form (eCRF) after each clinic visit and telephone contact. An investigator site file containing all relevant clinical procedures and study-related documentation has been supplied to each site to provide clear instructions on all relevant clinical procedures, including eCRF completion; psychiatric rating scales; how to perform ECGs; Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting; example templates of source document collection forms; and logs used to assist in tracking patient screening, enrolment and discontinuation targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Concurrent Treatments</title><p>The study allows additional treatments for associated symptoms (e.g., insomnia) or medication side effects (e.g., sexual dysfunction) to reflect common practice. Participants may receive any treatment for concurrent GMCs except medications contraindicated for the use of escitalopram, sertraline or venflaxine-XR. The study proscribes any concurrent medication likely to affect brain function recordings and those that cannot be washed out, including antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics and clonidine. Data on concomitant medication are recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>All participants are encouraged to continue the same type and dose of ADM used in the 8 week acute treatment period and to provide telephone-acquired data at weeks 12, 16, 26 and 52.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>Self-report questionnaires and tasks used in cognitive and electrical brain and autonomic recordings are each based on well-established constructs in the literature. Unlike previous trials and experimental research in which these constructs were assessed using methods that vary across sites and laboratories, iSPOT-D uses a Web- and computer-enabled infrastructure to acquire data in a standardized way across participants and sites. Self-report data are acquired using standardized Web-based questionnaires, cognitive data are obtained using a standardized computerized touchscreen platform, and electrical brain and autonomic data are acquired using standardized hardware and software (see Appendix 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The Brain Resource International Database has been established using this standardized infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which provides a systematic frame of reference for quality control in the acquisition of all iSPOT-D data.</p><sec><title>Screening and Clinical Data</title><p>At screening, CTCs gather participant eligibility and sociodemographic data. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-Plus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] is used to confirm DSM-IV criteria for nonpsychotic MDD, and assess for psychiatric and substance abuse disorders and other potential exclusion criteria.

These protocols also meet the specifications of the ICH-GCP. Recording channels with confirmed artifact are set as missing in the study database. The senior technician has the authority to override an automatic score in the case of discrepancy.</p><p>For quality control of data scoring, at least 10% of data for each measure is de-identified, reprocessed and compared to the original results to ensure reproducibility with zero-tolerance for error. For auto-scored EEG and ERP data, trained and accredited hand scorers confirm the quantification against criteria from the established literature (Brain Resource ERP Scoring Manual, 2010). For accreditation, scorers must have &#x02265;50 hours experience and have passed reviews of their scoring by the scoring manager, reporting to the GTC. Any queries or changes must be approved by the Data Center manager and are recorded in the Quality Control Review Record.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Analytic Approach</title><p>iSPOT-D has been registered and is being conducted as a single study. However, study aims will be addressed by a two-step analysis procedure.</p><p>Aims 1 through 3 will utilize the first half of the sample (n = 1,008) to identify potential predictors and moderators. Aim 4 will utilize the second half of the sample (n = 1,008) to replicate and confirm the results generated from the analyses of the first half. The four aims of the study and hypotheses are as follows:</p><sec><title>1. Identify overall predictors of treatment outcome (response or remission) after up to eight weeks of ADM treatment</title><p>The predictive effect of baseline characteristics will be assessed overall, controlling for any treatment effect. Regression models will be used to assess the predictive effect of each characteristic on outcome. Independent variables in the model will include main fixed effects for treatment and the possible predictive variable. All effects will be centered to aid interpretability (+1/2 and -1/2 for treatment choice and any binary predictor, deviation from the mean baseline for any ordinal predictor). A baseline characteristic will be considered a predictor if the p-value is &#x0003c;.05.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Identify moderators of treatment outcome (response or remission) after eight weeks of ADM treatment</title><p>The moderating effect of baseline characteristics will be assessed separately for each pairwise comparison of treatment (escitalopram vs. sertraline, escitalopram vs. venlafaxine-XR, sertraline vs. venlafaxine-XR). Regression models will be used to assess the moderating effect of each characteristic on outcome. Independent variables in the model will include main fixed effects for treatment, the possible moderator variable and the two-way interaction between the characteristic and treatment. All effects will be centered to aid interpretability (+1/2 and -1/2 for treatment choice and any binary moderator, deviation from the mean baseline for any ordinal moderator). A baseline characteristic will be considered a moderator if the p-value is &#x0003c;.05.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Develop a model to incorporate multiple predictor or moderator effects on response and remission</title><p>Recursive partitioning methods will be used to identify how various baseline characteristics interact with treatment and with each other in their association with treatment response. The recursive partitioning approach will be used to develop a decision tree which selects treatment and baseline characteristics with maximization of the sensitivity and specificity of the decision tree in the prediction of treatment response, while minimizing the complexity of the decision tree. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the tree will be reported, along with 95% confidence intervals for each estimate.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Replicate the findings in Aims 1-3</title><p>A confirmatory analysis will be conducted and the same models that were fit in Aims 1 and 2 will be fit to the data from the relevant comparison in the replication sample. For example, if gender is identified as a predictor of outcome, then the effect of gender will be examined as a potential predictor in the replication sample. For both the initial model and the replication model, a confidence interval will be estimated for the parameter estimate for the main effect of the potential predictor variable model (Aim 1) or for the interaction term in the model (Aim 2). If the two confidence intervals overlap, the results will be considered partially confirmed.</p><p>A decision tree will have been generated using data from the first half of the sample, along with an estimate of the tree's overall sensitivity and specificity, and a calculation of a 95% confidence interval for the sensitivity and specificity. The data from the replication sample will be applied to the decision tree from the initial sample and the sensitivity and specificity will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals from the initial and replication samples overlap, the results will be considered partially confirmed.</p><p>Specific working hypotheses to test each of the primary aims of the study are listed below. These hypotheses draw on a theoretical integration of the published research evidence. From this evidence, 'candidate markers' for predicting and moderating response to antidepressants have been identified. To date, studies have typically examined one candidate marker of antidepressant response and major depressive disorder at a time, using laboratory-specific measures. By using standardized assessments to assess multiple candidate markers in the same study and same patients, iSPOT-D provides enhanced statistical power to identify which markers contribute the most effect size to predicting and moderating antidepressant response.</p><p>For each hypothesis, the primary outcome measure of response to antidepressants is change on the HRSD<sub>17</sub>, and the secondary outcomes are change on the self-reported QIDS-SR<sub>16 </sub>and functional outcome measures (WHOQoL, SOFAS, SWLS, ERQ):</p><p>1. Baseline severity of clinical symptoms will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>2. Baseline psychological features, including exposure to early life trauma and stress-related temperament, will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>3. Baseline level of cognitive function on emotion tasks will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>4. Baseline level of cognitive function on thinking tasks will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>5. Baseline degree of asymmetry on the EEG measure of Alpha power will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>6. Baseline degree of heart rate variability on autonomic measures will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up.</p><p>7. For genetics, the presence of specific SNP alleles will predict acute response to antidepressants, and moderate response to type of antidepressant, at 8-week follow up; the 5HT-2A rs7997013 AA allele, 5HT-2A 102T/CC and -1438A/G G alleles, GRIK4 rs1954787gene, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) A218C C allele, FKBP5 and CRF1 will moderate a positive response, and the 5HTT-LPR short allele, HTR1A (rs6295) - 1019 G allele, COMT (val108/158met) Val allele, and the BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) will moderate a non-response.</p><p>Analyses are planned to test each of the core aims and hypotheses. The primary outcome measure of response to antidepressants is change on the HRSD<sub>17</sub>. The secondary outcomes are change on the self-reported QIDS-SR<sub>16 </sub>and functional outcome measures (WHOQoL, SOFAS, SWLS, ERQ). Independent measures of clinical severity, psychological function, EEG and genetics being tested as predictors/moderators of the independent variables are listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>. For genetic predictors and moderators, we have focused on an allele-wise approach to target those SNPs that have reported associations in the literature. Sufficient blood is being collected to also explore genome-wide associations between antidepressant response and predictor/moderator variables in future, unplanned analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample Size, Power and Effect Size</title><p>The primary goal of the proposed study is to identify a number of characteristics which are differentially associated with outcomes across various treatments. This extends the traditional randomized clinical trials which directly compare treatments or a study designed to specifically test the moderating effect of one or more baseline characteristics. The sample size has been selected to provide statistical power of at least 89% power to detect small effects for predictors (odds ratio 1.3 per standard deviation change in the independent baseline measure) at an alpha level of p &#x0003c; .05; 94% power to detect medium effects for predictors (odds ratio of 1.5) at an alpha level of p &#x0003c; .001, 94% power to detect medium effects for moderator interaction terms (odds ratio of 1.5) at an alpha level of p &#x0003c; .01. In addition to replication in the second 1000 participants, we aim to control type I error by applying effect size criteria for each logistic model that odds ratios for the main parameter of interest must exceed 1.3.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Monitoring and Safety Reporting</title><p>A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) meets every two months to monitor various aspects of the study including participant recruitment, protocol compliance, and SAEs. The DSMB comprises a minimum of three members with representation from psychiatrists, primary care physicians and a statistician. Statisticians at the Global Coordinating Centre monitor the age, sex and education distributions of each group every month to ensure matching (&#x000b1;3 years for age, &#x000b1;1 year for education).</p><p>Site recruitment and retention is monitored weekly by the Global Trial Coordinator and CTC for each site. Monitoring is undertaken in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines. The Monitoring Plan requires 100% source data verification of SAEs and primary outcome measures, and a sample of cognition and brain data. All informed consents are reviewed. Sites that enrol more participants are monitored more frequently.</p><p>The Clinical Research Organization is responsible for ensuring that the rights and welfare of participants are maintained, data quality is satisfactory and the trial is conducted in accordance with ICH-GCP and country-specific guidelines, as well as with the protocol's standard operating procedures.</p><p>All SAEs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) are recorded in the eCRF and on the "Serious Adverse Event Report" form. All SAE entries indicate whether the SAE is serious, the severity, date of onset, whether it is related to study medication or procedure, the action being taken, and resolution. The Global Trial Coordinator may request additional information from the investigator to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports. SAE follow-up continues through the last day on study (including the off-study follow-up medication period) and/or until the Global Trial Coordinator and Principal Investigator for the site determine that the participant's condition is stable. Brain Resource may request that certain SAEs be followed until resolution.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Definition of Serious Adverse Events</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-12-4-3"/></fig><p>The Principal Investigator ensures that all measures necessary for resolution of the SAE are taken. All medications necessary for treatment of the SAE are recorded in the concomitant medication section of the eCRF.</p><p>The investigator notifies the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee (in writing) of SAEs as soon as is practical where this is required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance with the local institutional policy. In accordance with the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC), the Sponsor or its designee notifies the Ethics Committees of the concerned Member States of SAEs that are unexpected and possibly attributable to the treatment medication. In all countries, SAEs are reported in accordance with the regulations governing expedited reporting for registered products. SAE reporting is monitored by the Clinical Research Organization and all SAEs are reviewed by the DSMB.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>iSPOT-D, a randomized controlled study, aims to identify moderators and predictors of treatment response among three treatments: escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine-XR. Potential moderators or predictors include measures of depressive symptoms, functional status, side-effect burden, genomic, cognition, brain function and brain imaging. Participants are being recruited from clinical and academic sites to assemble a broadly inclusive and representative population. Thus, study results should be widely generalizable.</p><p>iSPOT-D includes an innovation in study design with the use of cognitive, brain and gene measures for the identification of objective markers that may moderate or predict response to ADMs. Identifying these markers will be an important first step in a 'personalized medicine' approach to the management of MDD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>LMW has received consulting fees and stock options in Brain Resource Ltd, and is a stock holder in Brain Resource Ltd.
