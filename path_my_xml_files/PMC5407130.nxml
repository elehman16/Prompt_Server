The primary objective was to evaluate immune responses induced by QIV for the 4 vaccine strains 28 days after completion of vaccination. A secondary objective was to demonstrate superiority of QIV versus TIV for the B/Victoria strain contained in QIV but not TIV.

Quadrivalent influenza vaccines demonstrated immunogenic superiority over TIV for B/Victoria with a geometric mean titer ratio of 4.73 (95% CI, 3.73%&#x02013;5.99%) and SCR difference of 54.02% (95% CI, 43.88%&#x02013;62.87%).

No serious adverse events were reported related to vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (15 &#x000b5;g HA/strain) was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile. The next phase of its development in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age is a phase III trial in countries where it is not yet licensed. In countries where it is already licensed, a switch from TIV to QIV would provide broader protection in this vulnerable group.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>immunogenicity</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>quadrivalent</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Influenza infection creates a high disease burden among children [<xref rid="PIV041C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with routine vaccination recommended in the United States [<xref rid="PIV041C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and elsewhere. Until recently, most programs used trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) containing 2 influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and 1 B strain. Two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria) have cocirculated worldwide since 2000, and in the past decade, a substantial proportion of influenza B isolates from patients have been mismatched to the influenza B strain in the seasonal TIV. For example, during the 2012&#x02013;2013 season, one third of influenza B viruses tested by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were of the lineage absent from the seasonal vaccine [<xref rid="PIV041C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>During seasons where the predominant circulating influenza B virus is from the alternate lineage than the B strain included in the TIV, suboptimal vaccine protection can be expected [<xref rid="PIV041C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) containing B strains derived from both lineages could offer broader protection by eliminating B lineage mismatch. This may be particularly important in children because, although vaccinated adults show moderate cross-reactive antibody responses against the alternative B lineage [<xref rid="PIV041C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], children show poor cross-reactivity [<xref rid="PIV041C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Indeed, a meta-analysis of vaccine trials in young children found that efficacy was substantially reduced against influenza B strains of the alternative lineage to that contained in the vaccine [<xref rid="PIV041C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the licensed dose in the United States for children between 6 and 35 months of age is 0.25 mL with 7.5 &#x003bc;g hemagglutinin (HA) of each influenza strain. This represents half of the 0.5 mL dose with 15 &#x003bc;g HA per strain that is licensed for older children and adults. The practice of administering the lower dose to young children began more than 30 years ago to reduce the fever and febrile convulsions associated with the whole virus vaccines available at the time [<xref rid="PIV041C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, studies have shown that children of this age mount a variable immune response to the 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA dose. Current split virus vaccines are better tolerated compared with whole virus vaccines and are associated with substantially lower rates of fever and febrile convulsions. Several studies have now evaluated these vaccines at the 15 &#x003bc;g HA dose in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age. The higher dose elicits an increased immune response, particularly in children younger than 18 months, without increasing reactogenicity compared with the 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA dose [<xref rid="PIV041C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The QIV manufactured by GSK Vaccines has been developed for use at the 15 &#x003bc;g HA dose regardless of age. It is licensed in Canada and Mexico for children from the age of 6 months. However, in the United States, it is only licensed from the age of 3 years. Herein, we describe a phase II study evaluating immunogenicity and safety of the QIV at a 15 &#x003bc;g HA dose in children between 6 and 35 months of age in the United States. Ideally, we would have compared the investigational QIV with a licensed QIV at the same 15 &#x003bc;g HA dose. Unfortunately, this was not possible. The TIV and QIV manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur are the only influenza vaccines licensed in the United States in this age group, both of which are used at a dose of 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA. Trial access to the QIV could not be guaranteed. Hence, the TIV at a 7.5 &#x003bc;g dose was the only available choice of comparator for the study.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was a phase II randomized, controlled, observer-blind, multicenter trial comparing the immunogenicity and safety profiles of an inactivated QIV versus TIV in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age in the United States (identifier NCT01974895). The primary objective was to evaluate immunogenicity of the QIV according to the US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criteria for seroconversion. This criterion, rather than the seroprotection rate, was selected because it is more relevant for children who may be both unvaccinated and unexposed previously to either or both influenza A and B infection.</p><p>The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA, and it was approved by independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards, conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and US regulatory requirements. Parents or legally acceptable representatives provided written informed consent prior to participation of their child.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants, Vaccines, and Study Design</title><p>Healthy children and those with chronic illness who were not acutely ill at the time of enrollment (determined by the investigator's clinical examination and assessment of the child's medical history) were enrolled from 12 centers across the United States during the fall and winter of 2013&#x02013;2014. Children were excluded if they were febrile (temperature &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C), acutely ill, immunocompromised, allergic to any vaccine component, had a history of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome within 6 weeks of prior influenza vaccination, had a known coagulation disorder, had received any influenza vaccine within the last 6 months, had received any immunoglobulin or blood product within the last 3 months, or had received an investigational product within the last 30 days.</p><p>In accordance with the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices definition, children were considered vaccine-primed if they had received 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since July 1, 2010; all others were considered vaccine-unprimed.</p><p>The investigational QIV (GSK Vaccines, dba ID Biomedical Corporation, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada) contained 15 &#x003bc;g HA of each of 4 strains (A/California/7/2009 [A/H1N1], A/Texas/50/2012 [A/H3N2], B/Brisbane/60/2008 [B/Victoria], and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 [B/Yamagata]), in a 0.5 mL dose. The HA content was measured by a validated Single Radial Immunodiffusion assay. The licensed comparator TIV (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) contained 7.5 &#x003bc;g of each of the same A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B Yamagata strains in a 0.25 mL dose. Vaccine-primed children received 1 vaccine dose on study day 0. Vaccine-unprimed children received a vaccine dose on days 0 and 28. Administration was via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm for children &#x02265;12 months of age or the anterolateral region of the left thigh for children &#x0003c;12 months of age.</p><p>Children were randomized 1:1 to receive either QIV or TIV according to an internet-based randomization system. A minimization algorithm was used to balance enrollment by group accounting for age (6&#x02013;17 and 18&#x02013;35 months), center, and priming status. The randomization system provided the unique treatment number to be used for each dose. GSK Vaccines performed the randomization.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Endpoints and Procedures</title><p>Each child had a blood sample taken at baseline and again 28 days after completion of the 1- or 2-dose vaccine series (depending on vaccine-priming status). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were determined from serum obtained pre- and postvaccination. Results were reported for each vaccine group as (1) geometric mean titers (GMTs), (2) seropositivity rates, (3) seroconversion rates (SCRs), (4) seroprotection rates (SPRs), and (5) mean geometric increases (MGIs). The limit of quantitation for the HI assay was 1:10; samples &#x0003c;1:10 were considered seronegative and were given an arbitrary value of 5 for the GMT calculation.</p><p>Seropositivity rate was defined as the percentage of participants with reciprocal HI titer &#x02265;1:10. Seroconversion rate was defined as the percentage of participants with either (a) prevaccination reciprocal HI titer &#x0003c;1:10 and postvaccination reciprocal titer &#x02265;1:40 or (b) prevaccination reciprocal titer &#x02265;1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in postvaccination reciprocal titer. Seroprotection rate was defined as the percentage of participants who attained reciprocal HI titers of &#x02265;1:40. Mean geometric increase was defined as the geometric mean of the within-subject ratios of the postvaccination/prevaccination reciprocal HI titer.</p><p>Solicited injection site and general adverse events (AEs) were recorded in diary cards on the day of vaccination and for 6 days afterwards. Spontaneously reported symptoms were recorded until 28 days after vaccination. Serious AEs (SAEs), potential immune-mediated disorders (pIMDs), and medically attended AEs (MAEs) were recorded until the final telephone contact on day 180. Fever was defined as temperature &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C by any route (axillary, rectal, oral, or tympanic).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate whether the QIV elicited an immune response against each vaccine strain that met the CBER target for SCR 28 days after completion of the vaccine course, ie, lower limit (LL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) &#x02265;40%. Secondary objectives included: (1) demonstrating superior immunogenicity of QIV versus TIV against the B/Victoria strain 28 days after completion of the vaccine series (criteria: LL of the 95% CI for GMT ratio [QIV/TIV] &#x0003e;1.5 and for SCR difference [QIV minus TIV] &#x0003e;10%); (2) describing GMT, SPR, SCR, and MGI; (3) describing safety and reactogenicity; and (4) evaluating the relative risk of fever (&#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C) in the QIV group versus the TIV group over the 4-day postvaccination period. The tertiary objective was to describe the GMT ratio (TIV/QIV) and SCR difference (TIV minus QIV) for the H1N1, H3N2, and B/Yamagata strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistics</title><p>The primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the per-protocol cohort, which included children who met all eligibility criteria, complied with the protocol and vaccine schedule, and had data available for antibodies against at least 1 vaccine strain postvaccination. Immunogenicity analyses excluded participants with missing or nonevaluable measurements. The safety analysis was based on the intent-to-treat cohort.</p><p>A point estimate and its 2-sided exact 95% CI were calculated using Proc StatXact for GMT, SCR, SPR, and MGI by vaccine group for all children. In addition, subgroup analyses were conducted to explore potential differences between 2 age strata (6&#x02013;17 and 18&#x02013;35 months). The 95% CIs for the mean of log-transformed antibody titers were first obtained assuming that log-transformed values were normally distributed with unknown variance. The 95% CIs for GMT were then computed by exponential-transformation of the 95% CI for the mean of log-transformed titer. The GMT ratio (QIV/TIV) was computed using an analysis of covariance model on the log-transformed titers, including the vaccine group as a fixed effect and prevaccination HI titers, age, and vaccine-priming status as covariates. The asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in SCR between QIV and TIV was computed using Proc StatXact [<xref rid="PIV041C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Study power was calculated using PASS 2005. Assuming 50 evaluable children in the QIV group, the overall power of the study was 99.34% to meet CBER criteria for SCR simultaneously for all 4 strains (primary objective). Assuming 50 evaluable children in each vaccine group, the power to demonstrate superiority of the QIV over the TIV was 99.17% in terms of GMT ratio and &#x0003e;99.99% in terms of SCR difference (a secondary objective). No power calculation was performed for other secondary and tertiary objectives. However, the study planned to enroll 250 participants per group to assess the SCR difference for the common strains between the 2 groups with reasonably adequate power and to increase the probability of detecting fever, a potential consequence of the increased antigen content in the QIV.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The first participant was enrolled in October 2013 and the last study contact was in July 2014. The initial enrollment target was 500 children, but 1 major planned center was unable to participate; thus, 316 children were enrolled. Although the planned enrollment of 500 children was not attained, the 316 children enrolled assured adequate power for the analysis of the primary and secondary confirmatory objectives. A total of 314 and 280 children were included in the intent-to-treat cohort (Total Vaccinated Cohort) and per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PIV041F1">1</xref>). Demographics were similar between groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="PIV041TB1">1</xref>). In the QIV group, 64 (40.5%) children received 1 vaccine dose, whereas 94 (59.5%) received 2 doses. Corresponding values in the TIV group were 64 (41.0%) and 92 (59.0%).

Although QIV eliminates the risk of reduced vaccine effectiveness due to influenza B virus lineage mismatch for all ages, children lacking prior exposure to both influenza B lineages may especially benefit from QIV. The QIV manufactured by GSK Vaccines and studied in the present trial is licensed for children from 6 months of age in Mexico and Canada but only from 3 years of age in the United States. To license GSK's QIV in younger children in the United States, a study demonstrating immunological noninferiority and an acceptable safety profile versus a licensed product is required. After the positive results of this phase II trial, a phase III trial (identifier NCT02242643) comparing GSK's QIV at a dose of 15 &#x003bc;g HA with the licensed QIV manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur is now underway at more than 60 sites in the United States and Mexico in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age.</p><p>The present study showed that the QIV is immunogenic in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age in stable health, with SCRs of 80.4%, 72.0%, 86.0%, and 66.4% against the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria strains, respectively. Because the LL of the 95% CI was &#x02265;40% for each strain, these results met CBER's SCR licensure criterion. In addition, the QIV had superior immunogenicity against the B/Victoria strain compared with TIV. Immunogenicity against the 3 strains common to both vaccines was similar, indicating that addition of the second B strain does not affect immunogenicity of the other influenza strains. A study of Sanofi Pasteur's QIV in young children also supported that the addition of a second B strain has no negative impact on the immune responses to other strains, albeit at a dose of 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA [<xref rid="PIV041C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There were no treatment group differences within either age strata. This is an important finding because in a previous study of an investigational inactivated TIV given at doses of either 7.5 &#x003bc;g or 15 &#x003bc;g HA, the investigational TIV elicited a lower immune response in children &#x0003c;18 months of age than Sanofi Pasteur's TIV [<xref rid="PIV041C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the same comparator as used in our study. In contrast, in our study, the immune response against the common vaccine strains was similar with the QIV and TIV in children 6&#x02013;17 months of age.</p><p>Immunogenicity and safety of inactivated QIVs have been evaluated in adults [<xref rid="PIV041C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and children [<xref rid="PIV041C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In all studies, the QIVs produced superior immune responses to the B lineage not contained in the control TIV and a comparable response to the common vaccine strains. One open-label [<xref rid="PIV041C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 1 TIV-controlled study [<xref rid="PIV041C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] evaluated GSK's QIV in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age during the 2010&#x02013;2011 and 2012&#x02013;2013 influenza seasons. The results of those studies, taken together with the results described here, show that the QIV produces comparable immunogenicity across seasons. The GMT ratio and SCR difference versus TIV for the B/Victoria strain were of similar magnitude in the present study to those in the above-mentioned TIV-controlled study of GSK's QIV (GMT ratio 6.3 and SCR difference 64.2%) [<xref rid="PIV041C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and a study of Sanofi Pasteur's QIV (GMT ratio 4.4 and SCR difference 51.8%) [<xref rid="PIV041C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The QIV was given at the full adult dose of 15 &#x003bc;g HA per influenza strain in the present study, rather than the lower 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA dose traditionally recommended for infants in the United States. Historically, the lower dose was recommended because of the increase in fever and febrile convulsions observed in young children given a full dose of the whole virus vaccines available at the time [<xref rid="PIV041C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, studies of the TIV have shown variable immune responses in young children to the 7.5 &#x003bc;g HA dose, particularly to the vaccine B strain [<xref rid="PIV041C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, studies using the full 15 &#x003bc;g HA dose as a split virion vaccine in young children have shown a consistently robust immune response with no increase in reactogenicity or fever [<xref rid="PIV041C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, our study showed that the QIV and the TIV have similar reactogenicity and AE profiles, with no apparent adverse effect on tolerability of the higher antigen content in the QIV (60 &#x003bc;g HA for 4 strains compared with 22.5 &#x003bc;g for 3 strains in the TIV). Some previous studies have suggested that pain at the injection site may be modestly increased with QIV compared with TIV or hepatitis A vaccine [<xref rid="PIV041C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whereas others report similar levels of pain [<xref rid="PIV041C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The incidence of fever was similar with both vaccines, consistent with previous published studies [<xref rid="PIV041C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Quadrivalent influenza vaccines in young children are expected to be particularly valuable during seasons in which both B lineages are cocirculating or there is an unexpected shift from one lineage to another. Influenza B is reported to cause a disproportionate number of influenza-related deaths in children [<xref rid="PIV041C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, it is well recognized, particularly in children, that vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity against influenza B is reduced if the B strain in the TIV is of a different lineage to the circulating B strain [<xref rid="PIV041C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="PIV041C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mismatching of the vaccine and circulating B strain has occurred frequently. In the United States, the B strain in the seasonal TIV was mismatched to the circulating strain in 6 of the last 14 seasons [<xref rid="PIV041C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Use of QIV in place of TIV is predicted to reduce the number of influenza cases, influenza-related hospitalizations, and influenza-related deaths in the overall population [<xref rid="PIV041C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIV041C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, the investigational QIV was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age. Compared with the licensed TIV, QIV had superior immunogenicity against the B/Victoria strain and comparable immunogenicity against the 3 strains common to both vaccines. The next phase of the QIV's development in children 6&#x02013;35 months of age is a phase III trial in countries where it is not yet licensed. In countries where it is already licensed for this age group, a switch from TIV to QIV would provide broader protection in this vulnerable group.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are indebted to the participating study volunteers and their parents, clinicians, nurses, and laboratory technicians at the study sites, as well as to the sponsor's project staff for their support and contributions throughout the study.
