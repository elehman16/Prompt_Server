It is produced by activated T cells and natural killer T cells and released from cytoplasmic granules upon degranulation of activated basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils. Preclinical models have demonstrated a dominant role for IL13 in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, IL13 mRNA and protein levels are detectable at elevated levels in the airways of patients with asthma <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In subjects with mild asthma following local lung allergen challenge, active secretion of IL13 in the airway was shown during the late asthmatic phase <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Huang and colleagues (2008) also noted that there was a significant up-regulation of IL13 transcripts and IL13 protein following allergen challenge <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. These studies provide significant evidence that IL13 is involved in the regulation of allergen-induced inflammatory response. As such, IL13 blockade is an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment for bronchial asthma.</p><p>Lebrikizumab is a novel humanized stabilized immunoglobulin G (IgG) four monoclonal antibody exhibiting high binding affinity to human IL13 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Lebrikizumab was demonstrated to be effective in improving prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in patients with uncontrolled moderate&#x02013;severe asthma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in the context of a bronchial allergen challenge in subjects with mild asthma. Bronchial allergen challenge studies in patients with mild asthma conducted prior to the initiation of larger asthma trials <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> can be useful to test exploratory hypotheses and evaluate mechanism of action of therapeutics. The primary outcome measures of allergen challenge studies reflect the acute changes in airway function in response to a specific allergic stimulus and hence allow for more in depth mechanistic assessments of experimental asthma therapies that target components of allergic inflammation.</p><p>Pitrakinra <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, a non-signalling IL4 mutein that binds to IL4R&#x003b1;, and IMA-638 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody to IL13 significantly reduced the late-phase allergen response in mild asthmatics. Furthermore, genetic analysis of the patients in this small study suggested that variants in the IL4R&#x003b1; may have enriched for treatment response <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>An emerging body of evidence suggests that what is currently defined as asthma is pathophysiologically heterogeneous. In particular, Th2-driven inflammation as manifested by atopy and/or eosinophilic infiltration of the airways is evident in only a subset of asthma patients <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In a previous study with lebrikizumab, increased pretreatment serum periostin levels appeared to identify patients in which IL13 is a prominent driver of disease as a greater improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> when compared to patients with lower pretreatment serum periostin levels <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Also, AMG-317, a humanized monoclonal anti-IL4R&#x003b1; antibody, showed clinically significant activity only in a subset of patients with the most uncontrolled or symptomatic asthma <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Non-invasive biomarkers will be instrumental to further understand the heterogeneity of asthma and to assess and predict the potential effects of targeted therapies. Biomarkers associated with Th2 inflammation that are increased in the airways and blood of asthma patients include eosinophils, as well as serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), periostin <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, chemokine ligands (CCL)13 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, CCL17 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HC gp-39) (YKL-40) <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEA) <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This phase II, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab compared with placebo in reducing the airway reaction to an inhaled aeroallergen solution in adult subjects with mild allergic asthma.

The median levels of serum IgE, CCL13, CCL17, CEA, periostin, YKL-40, and eosinophil were 180 IU/mL, 167 pg/mL, 331 pg/mL, 1.0 ng/mL, 28 ng/mL, 22 ng/mL, and 200/&#x003bc;L, respectively.

Nevertheless, increased baseline serum levels of IgE, eosinophils, composite of serum IgE &#x0003e; 100 IU/mL and peripheral blood eosinophils &#x0003e; 140/&#x003bc;L, and periostin appeared to identify asthma subjects who were more likely to respond to IL13 blockade.

These data are in line with the hypothesis that IL13 blockade is an appropriate therapeutic approach for the treatment for asthma and plays a key role in the allergen-induced inflammatory response. Our data are similar to other monoclonal antibodies targeting the type 2 inflammation, such as the IMA-638, which inhibited the EAR and LAR in subjects with mild atopic asthma <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, and pitrakinra, which inhibited the LAR response in subjects with atopic asthma <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.

Furthermore, while animal model data have shown that IL13 blockade inhibits AHR, this has not translated into humans with any of the biologics studied so far, indicating species differences between mice and men in the underlying mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness.</p><p>This study was a small proof-of-activity study to demonstrate the pharmacological activity of lebrikizumab and to explore the feasibility of IL13-related biomarkers as predictive biomarkers for response. Specifically, the results suggest that (i) IL13 contributes to allergen-induced airway obstruction in mild allergic asthma; (ii) asthma patients with increased levels of biomarkers correlating with Th2/eosinophilic airway inflammation (IgE, eosinophils, and periostin) appeared to have a larger treatment effect from lebrikizumab compared with subjects with lower levels of those biomarkers, and (iii) in addition to reducing the LAR, lebrikizumab significantly reduced the levels of systemic biomarkers (CCL13, CCL17, and IgE) that can be induced by IL13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd4">S3</xref>, Supporting Information). Although the effect of lebrikizumab on the LAR in the group as a whole was not statistically significant, the results of this study taken together [including the predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers (Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd5">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd6">S5</xref>, Supporting Information)] highlight possible mechanisms of action of lebrikizumab. It is important to standardize the selection of subjects and to have procedures in place to try to minimize variability in the late-phase response; previous studies have adopted a number of measures to minimize variability in the late-phase response: (i) allergen challenge not performed within (at least) 4 weeks of a respiratory infection; (ii) avoidance of new sensitizing allergen exposure throughout the study; (iii) stability of FEV<sub>1</sub> prior to allergen challenge days (defined as FEV<sub>1</sub> to be not lower than 10% form baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measured during the screening period; (iv) stability of AHR (PC<sub>20</sub>) prior to allergen challenge days (defined as methacholine PC<sub>20</sub> within one doubling dose lower than baseline PC<sub>20</sub> measured during the screening period <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). None of our subjects had a respiratory infection within 4 weeks of the screening allergen challenge, and exposure to new allergens was not specifically recorded but would have likely affected both treatment groups. We measured FEV<sub>1</sub> on four occasions during screening and at least once before allergen challenge and all subjects were within 10%. We did not measure methacholine prior to allergen challenge to minimize the number of visits and procedures, which is a limitation of our study. Finally, we recorded variations in the amount of allergen given at the post-treatment challenge compared with the individuals screening allergen challenge. These variations were unavoidable for the 12 cases where less allergen had to be delivered for safety reasons. Overall, the impact of these variations is likely to reduce the ability of the study to be precise in the conclusion about the magnitude of the treatment effect but given the relative balance of these variations across the treatment arms, it is unlikely to have had a major impact on the conclusions of the study. Thus, despite its limitations, this study provides supportive evidence to pursue additional studies of lebrikizumab as a potential novel therapeutic agent in asthma prior to embarking on large proof-of-concept studies.</p><p>A subsequent study evaluating the efficacy of lebrikizumab in subjects with uncontrolled asthma has shown that IL13 blockade improved lung function and this mainly driven by changes in a subset of patients with asthma with evidence of IL13-driven airway inflammation <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>It is known that IL13 promotes eosinophilic inflammation in part by up-regulating expression of eosinophil-attracting CCR3-binding chemokines. In addition, IL13 acts on leucocytes and resident airway cells to induce the CCR4-binding chemokines, CCL17 and CCL22, which act on Th2 cells. Of these chemokines, peripheral blood levels of CCL13 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and CCL17 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> are robustly increased in allergic asthma patients. IL13 can also mediate isotype switching of activated B cells to produce IgE, which along with eosinophils, is detectable at elevated levels in the peripheral blood of asthma patients with increased Th2 inflammation in their airways <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The reduction in serum CCL13, CCL17, and IgE observed after lebrikizumab dosing in this study increases our confidence that the reduction in the LAR is indeed mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of Th2 inflammation via IL13 blockade. Although CCL13 and CCL17 decreased after lebrikizumab treatment and subjects with the highest baseline chemokine levels had the largest reduction in serum chemokines, these subjects did not appear to have increased improvement in LAR response when compared with all subjects. This may reflect extrapulmonary sources of IL13-induced CCL13 and CCL17 production. As lebrikizumab was administered systemically and these biomarkers were assessed systemically, their tissue of origin cannot be determined in this study. The pharmacodynamic effects of lebrikizumab on serum biomarkers of IL13 activity in mild asthmatics were similar to those observed in patients with moderate&#x02013;severe uncontrolled asthma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Exploratory analyses indicated that increased pretreatment levels of serum periostin, IgE, and peripheral blood eosinophils identified subjects with increased treatment effects from lebrikizumab, indicating a more prominent role of IL13 and Th2 inflammation in the airways of these subjects. Of these predictive biomarkers of Th2 inflammation in patients with mild asthma periostin also enriched for clinical benefit from lebrikizumab in patients with uncontrolled moderate&#x02013;severe asthma <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.
