AR is characterized by sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal hypersensitivity, and non-nasal symptoms such as itching and watery eyes or itching ears and palate, and signs of invasion of nasal mucosa by inflammatory cells.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The prevalence of AR varies from population to population, but on an average, it can affect 25%&#x02013;35% of people. AR is associated with sleep disturbances that result in impaired work productivity and interference with cognitive and emotional functioning.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Today's therapy is based on three measures, mainly avoidance or elimination of the causative agent (allergen), symptomatic pharmacotherapy, and specific immunotherapy. The new patient should be managed differently according to the duration and severity of the clinical picture, patient's personal preferences, accessibility and the affordability of medications, and the success and effectiveness of a therapeutic option applied in the patient's particular case. The current therapeutic modalities for the management of AR include: H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines), decongestants, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and anticholinergic agents in oral or topical nasal formulations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Two new second-generation H1-receptor antagonists, olopatadine and rupatadine, are known as dual blockers since both these drugs block the action of not only the histamine but also of other inflammatory mediators such as platelet-activating factor (PAF), LTs, and chemokines. Olopatadine is a newly approved drug for the treatment of AR. It is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist, in addition possessing inhibitory effects on PAF and on the release of inflammatory lipid mediators such as LT and thromboxane (TX) from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Olopatadine was shown to be highly useful for the treatment of AR, chronic urticaria, and conjunctivitis in double-blind clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Rupatadine is a selective and long-acting oral histamine H1-receptor antagonist that has also been shown to have PAF antagonist activity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is indicated for use in AR and chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients aged 12 years or more.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Although individually olopatadine and rupatadine are efficacious in AR, data on the head-to-head study of these drugs in Indian population are scanty. In spite of extensive literature search, we could not find any study comparing the cost-effectiveness of these drugs. Therefore, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of olopatadine with that of rupatadine and to determine the cost-effectiveness so that better option will be offered for the treatment of AR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, comparative 2 weeks clinical study conducted in eighty patients of AR attending ENT outpatient department (OPD) in a tertiary care teaching hospital.

Headache and dryness of mouth were noted in both groups while gastric irritation was noted in olopatadine group. Adverse event rate was more in olopatadine group as compared to rupatadine group. Adverse events were tolerable, and there was no need to withdraw the patients from treatment group.</p><p>For cost-effectiveness analysis, only direct health cost of drug treatment was taken into consideration. The cost of each tablet of olopatadine was Rs. 12.4, and for rupatadine, it was Rs. 5.25. Thus, calculating the total cost of treatment at the end 2<sup>nd</sup> week gave us the idea of difference of total cost in the treatment which is more in olopatadine group. The cost of treatment was calculated per patient. The cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as described elsewhere.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, effectiveness parameter is TNSS, i.e., the difference in TNSS score after 2 weeks from baseline values in both groups. The treatment modality having less cost-effectiveness ratio is considered as superior. In our study, the cost-effectiveness ratio is less in rupatadine group at the 2<sup>nd</sup> week stating that the rupatadine is more cost-effective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It remains a challenge to the physicians to treat the symptoms of AR and ensure a good quality of life to the patients. An increase in the understanding of the pathomechanisms of AR in the last few decades has revealed the potential of the new-generation antihistamines with dual-blocking property in the treatment of AR. Rupatadine and olopatadine are known to be effective in AR in several clinical trials, but this study was performed to compare their efficacy and safety and thus to choose the better agent. Inspite of extensive literature search, we could not find any double-blind study comparing the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of olopatadine and rupatadine in AR. Moreover, data on such types of studies from Indian setup are very scanty. Hence, we considered it worthwhile to conduct this study in Indian setup where patients have less affordability for costly medicines.</p><p>The TNSS is a widely accepted and reliable tool to assess the efficacy of a drug in the treatment of AR, and a decrease in the score suggests that there is an overall clinical improvement in the condition. We observed a significant difference in TNSS after completion of the treatment in olopatadine as well as rupatadine groups. Rescue medication was not required in any of the subjects. In the present study, a significant and progressive decrease in the TNSS was observed at the end of 2 weeks of treatment with olopatadine and rupatadine.</p><p>In a study conducted to test the efficacy of rupatadine in treating patients with AR, rupatadine was found to be effective in reducing nasal symptoms, improving signs secondary to mucosal inflammation with sustained and even improving results after 2 weeks of treatment.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Another comparative dose ranging trial of rupatadine showed improvement in nasal and ocular symptoms of AR.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our study supports this finding of a significant reduction in symptom score and improvement in nasal symptoms.</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, oral olopatadine significantly suppressed sneezing (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), rhinorrhea (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and nasal congestion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In another comparative open-labeled study, olopatadine and rupatadine have decreased the TNSS, but olopatadine was found to be superior to rupatadine in reducing the TNSS.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Our study supports this finding of significant reduction in TNSS with rupatadine and olopatadine both. Change in TNSS was significant and more pronounced in olopatadine than in rupatadine group.</p><p>Olopatadine and rupatadine are known as dual blockers since both these drugs block the action of not only the histamine but also of other inflammatory mediators such as PAF, LTs, and chemokines. The probable superiority of olopatadine over rupatadine may be attributed to the following findings. Olopatadine can reduce the amount of cell-associated PAF by 52.8%, which is more than rupatadine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] PAF known to increase vascular permeability and is increasingly recognized as an important mediator in inflammation. It also suppresses LTs and TxA2 release, and PAF formation by reducing arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids, probably through interference with phospholipase A2.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Olopatadine has been shown to suppress the activity of S100A12, which is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, and exerts multiple pro-inflammatory activities including chemotaxis for monocytes and neutrophils.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] All these actions inhibit the inflammatory mediators which are the main contributors for vasodilation, vascular leakage, and eosinophil chemotaxis, thus decreasing the symptoms of AR by reducing number of sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal blockade more significantly as compared to rupatadine.</p><p>Allergic conditions are usually associated with the changes in the percentage of eosinophil and its absolute count and probably that's why the effects of the drugs have not been directly reflected on total leukocyte count and neutrophil count. The increase in eosinophil count is the hallmark of the late phase of AR. The scrupulous control of this parameter is an important therapeutic aim in the treatment of AR.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Our study showed a significant decrease in differential eosinophil count in both groups. The comparative change in the differential count of eosinophil in olopatadine group was found to be significantly more as compared to the rupatadine group. This observation supports the previous study of analysis of rupatadine and olopatadine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There was no significant difference in differential monocyte count and differential basophil count in both groups. In our study, we did not find any significant change in biochemical parameters. This observation supports the previous study on safety analysis of rupatadine and olopatadine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Most frequently occurring adverse event with rupatadine was sedation, which supports the previous studies conducted on rupatadine for its safety profile. Other adverse events noted were headache, gastric irritation, and dryness of mouth.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Similarly, with olopatadine, the most commonly occurring adverse event was sedation, which supports the finding of the previous study. Other adverse events noted were headache and dryness of mouth which were also found in the previous study.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our study did not reveal any change in electrocardiogram (ECG), supporting the previous studies which also showed no change in ECG findings.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>To compare the cost-effectiveness of two drugs, only the direct health cost of the drug treatment was taken into consideration. When we compared the cost-effectiveness ratio of the treatment, i.e., rupatadine and olopatadine, we found that cost-effectiveness ratio was less in rupatadine. For pharmacoeconomic analysis, treatment modality having less cost-effectiveness ratio is considered as superior. Thus, it suggests that rupatadine is more cost-effective than olopatadine for the treatment of AR. However, after an in-depth search, we could not find any study related to our finding. This information can help physicians in selecting a drug for treating the patients of AR. Patients, who can afford costly treatment, can be prescribed more effective olopatadine, while for patients who cannot afford, it can be prescribed rupatadine as it is more cost-effective.</p><p>Although the present study was double-blind with small sample size and of short duration, the results of the study cannot be ignored. However, studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up periods, along with measurements of absolute eosinophils counts, may yield more meaningful data to compare rupatadine and olopatadine. Furthermore, to determine the cost-effectiveness, studies considering direct cost, indirect and incremental cost can provide more meaningful data to compare rupatadine and olopatadine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both rupatadine and olopatadine provide effective relief of the symptoms of AR.
