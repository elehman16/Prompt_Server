One of the first campaigns was &#x02018;How are the Kids&#x02019; where personalised feedback was provided to families who completed a brief questionnaire about their children&#x02019;s eating behaviour and activity. Using a cluster randomised trial design Crocker and co-workers<sup>(</sup>

The &#x02018;Change4Life&#x02019; commercial was rated the most motivational of twenty-nine different television commercials (from the UK, USA and Australia) by a representative sample of 1000 adults<sup>(</sup>

More recent campaigns have included behavioural change techniques such as goal setting, monitoring and feedback, which have an increasing evidence base for success in weight management<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. The present study shows a potential method for small-scale evaluation of such campaigns by utilising a mobile phone app and recruiting a group as a control in a neighbouring country not exposed to the campaign. However, there was a small level of contamination of the comparison group, suggesting that some of those in Wales had been able to sign up.</p><p>That more than 400 000 families signed up for &#x02018;Change4Life Smart Swaps&#x02019; in 2014 highlights the potential impact of such campaigns if the types of outcomes highlighted in the current evaluation were demonstrable across the wider campaign. Although not demonstrable in terms of cause and effect, it is interesting to note that data from the Kantar Worldpanel, a panel of 27 000 households in England, showed a 8&#x000b7;6 % reduction in the purchase of sugary carbonated drinks in January 2014 compared with January the previous year<sup>(</sup>

Similarly, the use of a mobile phone app to aid collection and personal verification of self-reports is likely to have facilitated the high retention rate<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> and enabled a significant change to be demonstrated in purchase habits over the short period of the campaign. Owing to the delivery of the intervention pack in week 1 it is not surprising that patterns of purchase at this time were not significantly different; whereas greater changes occurred in the subsequent weeks as families had time to plan their food and drink swaps. The intervention was developed to engage and support families to identify and choose the most relevant swap for their family&#x02019;s lifestyle. While the specific aspects of the intervention and supporting materials were not assessed, this approach appears to have been successful.</p><p>Limitations within the study include the fact that participants in the comparison group were likely to be more interested and engaged in the campaign messages than the general population, having previously signed up for similar campaigns. Although the campaign was aimed at those in social grades C2, D and E, the sample selected had a higher proportion of participants from the higher social grades (A, B and C1) but this could be because such families are more likely to participate in the research element of the campaign. However, there were no differences in the proportion of families making swaps by social grade, so it was assumed that the observed differences were due to the intervention rather than the higher proportion of social grades A, B and C1 in the intervention group compared with the comparison group. The data were also self-reported and could be subject to social desirability bias<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the mobile phone app was not formally verified against a gold standard reporting mechanism.</p><p>Overall, the present evaluation has shown that, in the short term, the &#x02018;Change4Life Smart Swaps&#x02019; campaign positively affected food and drink choice in a sample of interested individuals. While this does not definitively demonstrate the impact of the campaign, the small significant differences between the groups at weeks 2 and 3 demonstrate the potential impact of the campaign given the wide sign-up in England. The potential to build on the use of mobile phone apps to help record and verify food choices more easily, together with utilising increasing insight from behaviour change techniques and more focused messages within public health campaigns, continues to offer opportunities for further evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>
