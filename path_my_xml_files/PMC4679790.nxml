Visomitin is the first registered (in Russia) drug with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (SkQ1) as the active ingredient.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multicenter (10 sites) study of 240 subjects with DES, study drug (Visomitin or placebo) was self-administered three times daily (TID) for 6&#x000a0;weeks, followed by a 6-week follow-up period. Seven in-office study visits occurred every 2&#x000a0;weeks during both the treatment and follow-up periods. Efficacy measures included Schirmer&#x02019;s test, tear break-up time, fluorescein staining, meniscus height, and visual acuity. Safety measures included adverse events, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, blood pressure, and heart rate. Tolerability was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>This clinical study showed the effectiveness of Visomitin eye drops in the treatment of signs and symptoms of DES compared with placebo. The study showed that a 6-week course of TID topical instillation of Visomitin significantly improved the functional state of the cornea; Visomitin increased tear film stability and reduced corneal damage. Significant reduction of dry eye symptoms (such as dryness, burning, grittiness, and blurred vision) was also observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the results of this study, Visomitin is effective and safe for use in eye patients with DES for protection from corneal damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Mitotech LLC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dry eye syndrome</kwd><kwd>Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants</kwd><kwd>Ophthalmology</kwd><kwd>SkQ1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Mitotech LLC</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Healthcare 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms such as discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability, with potential damage to the ocular surface. DES is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Increased osmolarity of the tear film can lead to morphological changes in the cornea and conjunctiva; activation of the inflammatory cascade can induce apoptotic cell death in the corneal epithelium and reduce the number of conjunctival goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prevalence of DES increases with age, significantly affecting the quality of life of senior patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Artificial tear treatment that is typically used to alleviate DES symptoms does not target the cause of the disease. Therefore, there is a need for drugs with reparative action that help to protect against the onset and progression of corneal lesions associated with DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>One promising therapeutic approach is protection of the anterior segment of the eye from oxidative stress, as oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play an important role in age-related eye diseases in general, and in DES in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One of the main sources of ROS in cells is mitochondria, which synthesize ATP and are the main consumers of molecular oxygen in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Natural antioxidants are not capable of penetrating mitochondria and neutralizing the excessive amounts of free radicals generated by these organelles. Only recently a new class of chemical compounds&#x02014;mitochondria-targeted antioxidants&#x02014;capable of neutralizing mitochondrial ROS has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The active ingredient SkQ1 in Visomitin (Mitotech LLC, Moscow, Russian Federation) ophthalmic solution belongs to this class of compounds and is capable of targeting and neutralizing mitochondrial ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Pre-clinical studies have shown that SkQ1 is a promising agent for treating ophthalmic diseases associated with oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Visomitin is the first drug containing SkQ1 that has been studied in clinical trials. In an initial clinical study, Visomitin demonstrated efficacy in treating signs and symptoms of DES compared to an artificial tear treatment used as a control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subsequently, Visomitin ophthalmic solution was approved in Russia in December 2011 and has since been marketed there as a prescription product. The purpose of the second clinical study that is the subject of this article was to assess the safety and tolerability of Visomitin and to evaluate the treatment and post-treatment efficacy of Visomitin compared with placebo (with the same artificial tears formulation used as a control in the initial Visomitin study) in patients suffering from DES with mild to moderate severity levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>A double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of Visomitin was conducted at 10 ophthalmic research centers in Russia and Ukraine. The study was conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice guidance, the Declaration of Helsinki, and Russian/Ukrainian regulatory requirements, and was registered with the Russian Ministry of Health. The study was approved by local ethics committees, and each subject was provided with a written informed consent to participate.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Population</title><p>The study included 240 patients (50 men and 190 women) aged 18&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years demonstrating clinical signs of DES of mild to moderate severity levels, as determined by the investigator. Patients were excluded if they: had hypersensitivity reaction to the SkQ1 drug; had low visual acuity [VA; Sivtsev-Golovin scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] of &#x0003c;0.3 adjusted for worst seeing eye, with 1.0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;good vision (equivalent to 20/20 on the Snellen chart) and approaching 0.0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;poor vision (e.g., 0.1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20/200 on the Snellen chart)]; had elevated intraocular pressure (IOP; &#x0003e;21&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;Hg); had acute inflammatory diseases of the eye; or had other diseases or conditions (e.g., diabetes, drug or alcohol addiction, pregnancy, breast feeding) that could have had an impact on treatment performance evaluation or safety.</p><p>There were no limitations for use of concomitant therapy during the study.

In the treatment group, patients were assigned Visomitin eye drops, and in the control group, patients were given placebo (in a double-masked manner). Patients were instructed to instill one drop per eye three times a day for 6&#x000a0;weeks. Visomitin eye drops contained 0.155&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL (250&#x000a0;nM) SkQ1. The placebo consisted of benzalkonium chloride (0.1&#x000a0;mg), hypromellose (2&#x000a0;mg), sodium chloride (9&#x000a0;mg), sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.14&#x000a0;mg), and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (0.96&#x000a0;mg) per 1&#x000a0;mL, pH 6.5, and was identical to the treatment drug Visomitin formulation except that the active ingredient SkQ1 was absent. During the treatment period, patients were required to visit their research center for examination every 2&#x000a0;weeks. After the end of the treatment period, patients discontinued instillations and visited the center every 2&#x000a0;weeks for another 6&#x000a0;weeks (follow-up observation period).</p><p>The study had 7 scheduled visits, with Visits 1&#x02013;4 occurring during the 6&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, and Visits 5&#x02013;7 occurring during the follow-up observation period (the next 6&#x000a0;weeks). At the visits, the following standard ophthalmological examinations were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy: Schirmer&#x02019;s test, tear break-up time (TBUT) test, fluorescein staining, meniscus height, and VA. In addition, to evaluate safety, slit lamp biomicroscopy was conducted to assess pathological changes, tonometry was conducted to determine IOP, blood pressure and heart rate were measured, concomitant therapy drugs were noted, and complaints and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. After completion of treatment, patients and physicians were asked to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and residual efficacy (continued drug effect after treatment is terminated) using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 points, where 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;no effect and 100&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very good effect.</p><p>Efficacy measurements for both eyes for each patient were pooled by group (treatment group or placebo group) to develop group statistics. For these parameters, positive response to treatment was assessed (i.e., number of eyes that showed an improvement by more than 5% from the initial level).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>All criteria for evaluating the results of efficacy procedures were determined prospectively. The Schirmer&#x02019;s test was performed by applying certified test strips in the lower eyelid of each eye for 5&#x000a0;min without anesthesia. Schirmer&#x02019;s test results for tear production were evaluated as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]: wet segment of &#x02265;25&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;hyperlacrimation, 15&#x02013;24&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal, 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild level of tear production dysfunction, 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate, &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;mm&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe. The TBUT test for TBUT was performed in accordance with standard procedures. Results of the TBUT samples were evaluated as follows: 10&#x000a0;s or more&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 5&#x02013;9&#x000a0;s&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild level of TBUT dysfunction, 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;s&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate, &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;s&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Corneal staining was performed using fluorescein strips, with the cornea divided into five zones: central, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal. The number and size of corneal lesions were evaluated separately for each zone using the following scale: no staining&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0 points, 1&#x02013;15 punctate staining areas&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1 point, &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;areas of punctate staining or one continuous area&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 points, &#x0003e;15 areas of punctate staining and one or more continuous area&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3 points. The total damage to the cornea was determined by adding the scores for all five zones. Tear meniscus height was determined before other procedures were performed. VA was determined using Sivtsev&#x02013;Golovin tables illuminated at 600&#x02013;1000 lux at a 5&#x000a0;m distance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Two-sided levels of significance and confidence intervals were calculated and reported, and a statistical level of significance of 0.05 was used (unless otherwise indicated).

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 6.12 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). No changes were made to the methodology after the trial began. One post-study subgroup analysis was conducted for baseline total corneal damage (elevated or not elevated), as discussed in this article.

Despite the large number of diagnostic techniques, there is no single &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; that can determine the severity of the syndrome and evaluate therapy effectiveness. For example, the commonly used Schirmer&#x02019;s test is not sufficient to uniformly assess severity of DES. Basal tear deficit can be compensated by reflex tear production, in which case the Schirmer&#x02019;s test result will not indicate decline and sometimes will even show an increase.</p><p>Another standard method for diagnosing DES&#x02014;corneal fluorescein staining&#x02014;also has its drawbacks. Elevated levels of staining sometimes occur in patients who do not have DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, reproducibility of corneal and conjunctival staining has been shown to be rather low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A study that involved 300 patients found tear osmolarity to be the best marker of DES severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, conjunctival and corneal stainings were shown to have the highest correlation with DES severity among commonly used diagnosis techniques. According to ophthalmologists of the ODISSEY European Consensus Group, which studied 14 commonly used DES diagnosis techniques, a joint analysis of symptom scores and fluorescein staining scores is usually sufficient for assessing DES severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Taking the above DES assessment methods into consideration, a variety of measurement techniques was used in the randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Visomitin. Symptoms scores, slit lamp exam data, Schirmer&#x02019;s test data, TBUT, and corneal fluorescein staining data were assessed in patients with mild to moderate DES levels during the course of this study.</p><p>The study results of corneal fluorescein staining (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) are of particular interest. It was demonstrated that the Visomitin group had significantly less corneal damage in the central zone after the sixth week of treatment than the placebo group. Furthermore, this effect persisted for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks after the therapy was terminated.</p><p>This statistically significant difference between the efficacy of Visomitin and placebo was mainly driven by the subgroup of patients with more elevated corneal damage (with total fluorescein staining scores &#x02265;3 at baseline). Based on Sullivan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], these patients can be described as a subgroup with a moderate degree of dry eye. Interestingly, TBUT values in this subgroup were significantly higher (improved) in patients treated with Visomitin than in patients treated with placebo at the end of treatment and for the duration of the follow-up observation period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Results also showed improvement in the symptom of blurred vision in this subgroup (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Tutt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] argue that blurred vision, typical for patients with dry eye, is associated with a decrease of tear film stability and, therefore, should correlate with TBUT measurements.</p><p>The results of this study showed that SkQ1 eye drops did not affect tear production levels: Schirmer&#x02019;s test scores increased in both the Visomitin and placebo groups and did not differ significantly between the groups. According to Lemp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], results of the Schirmer&#x02019;s test may significantly vary even throughout a single visit. Also, the Schirmer&#x02019;s test appears to be more reproducible in patients with low test values, that is, more severe disease. Therefore, it is believed that the applicability of the Schirmer&#x02019;s test in patients with mild to moderate dry eye is limited.</p><p>It is known that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. An increase in soluble mediators (cytokines and proteases) in the tear fluid, adhesion molecule expression by the conjunctival epithelium, and T cell infiltration of the conjunctiva have all been observed in dry eye patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It was previously shown that the anti-inflammatory effect of SkQ1, which inhibits the NF-kB signaling pathway, can lead to a decrease in the level of expression of adhesion molecules and in leukocyte infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is probable that the anti-inflammatory effect of SkQ1 plays an important role in reducing corneal damage in patients with DES.</p><p>These data indicate that Visomitin not only has a moistening effect due to the presence of hypromellose, but also that the active compound SkQ1 restores corneal cell function and tear film stability, thus directly addressing the causes of DES. Improvements in both symptoms and corneal staining associated with DES are attributable to Visomitin treatment, suggesting a beneficial therapeutic effect of the drug. Furthermore, post-therapy efficacy of Visomitin for TBUT, corneal staining, and symptoms over 4&#x000a0;weeks of the follow-up observation period, especially in patients with moderate dry eye, shows a clear advantage of Visomitin over artificial tear treatments.</p><p>One possible limitation of the study was that the severity of dry eye was determined by the investigator and not quantified or specified earlier in the study as to how the investigators would decide the subject&#x02019;s dry eye was mild or moderate in severity.&#x000a0;However, the better results in the higher corneal staining subgroup suggest that the population was mixed; also, no standardized definition or selection criteria of DES severity currently exists. Also, there are limitations of some of the dry eye tests themselves (e.g., Schirmer&#x02019;s test, corneal fluorescein staining), as mentioned above; using several dry eye tests compensates somewhat for the test limitations. In addition, seasonality may contribute to a reduction in the effects of dry eye treatments as the drier season progresses. Also, environmental factors, such as subjects&#x02019; increased use of computers or reading or exposure to tobacco smoke or wind, may also decrease the effects of drug treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Visomitin has several important benefits for dry eye patients. Visomitin has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients with DES. Visomitin exhibited a more pronounced and stable post-therapy effect in patients with DES than placebo. Visomitin is highly effective in protecting patients with DES from corneal damage.
