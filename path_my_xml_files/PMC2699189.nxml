To balance clinical recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4">3, 4</xref>] and the needs of older adults with diabetes, a working group of the German Diabetes Association has developed a structured diabetes treatment and teaching programme (DTTP) specialised for older adults with T2DM called SGS (Strukturierte Geriatrische Schulung, structured geriatric DTTP). In comparison to a standard education programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6">5, 6</xref>] for patients with T2DM on insulin therapy, which has been well validated in inpatient and outpatient cohorts in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], the new SGS programme focuses particularly on individual therapeutic goals and maintenance of autonomy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the SGS DTTP for insulin-treated older patients with diabetes mellitus, in a prospective, randomised and controlled multi-centre trial.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>The SGS DTTP for elderly patients with diabetes</title><p>The SGS comprises seven educational classes of 45 min duration. In contrast, the standard DTTP of Berger <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] for insulin therapy takes a period of 5 days with 20 h of training. The SGS DTTP focuses less on theoretical knowledge (pathophysiology, insulin dose adoption, or assessment of carbohydrate intake) but allows a more intensive training of practical capabilities such as insulin injection, self-monitoring and management of hypoglycaemia. The new SGS programme takes into account the changes in learning habits of older people (reduced short-term memory, slowed informational processing). The programme is adapted to the demands of older people, for example by giving instruction more slowly and loudly, avoiding technical terms or giving more intensive practice and using defined numbers of repetitions. Educational materials such as patient books and flipcharts with an adequate type size are provided. In the SGS DTTP, a smaller class size of four to six patients is used, whereas the standard DTTP allows up to 10 people to participate in the education classes.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3-1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>A total of 196 patients with insulin-treated T2DM were screened for study participation from May 2004 until May 2005. Inclusion criteria were insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, at least one geriatric syndrome (such as incontinence, reduced mobility requiring the use of assistive devices, a history of falls during the previous 2 years or cognitive dysfunction), multi-morbidity (more than two chronic diseases besides T2DM) and age &#x0003e;65 years. Exclusion criteria were stroke or myocardial infarction within 2 weeks prior to enrolment as well as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) below 18 points implying moderate cognitive dysfunction. Of the 196 screened patients, 41 were excluded from statistical analysis (dropouts) because of missing data sets (<italic>n</italic> = 22) or their not finishing the DTTP (<italic>n</italic> = 17).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Randomisation was performed centrally by one study investigator. Randomisation lists were used throughout. The study investigator received a fax of the planned education group (with the study codes, age and sex of the patients) and randomised the group according to the randomisation protocol. Nine of the 18 study centres were outpatient diabetes clinics recruiting 105 study participants (67.7%). Ten inpatient diabetes departments recruited 50 study participants (32.3%). Eighty-three of the 155 patients who were eligible for statistical analysis were randomly sent to the new SGS DTTP, and 72 were placed in the standard programme (patient flow, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Due to delayed patient recruitment, dropout rate and limited financial resources, the study had to be stopped after the inclusion of 155 patients.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient flow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="afp056fig1"/></fig><p>The ethics committee approved the study in 2003.

To assess patient skill in diabetes self-management (correct insulin injection, self-monitoring), a detailed standardised handling test (maximum score 23 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]) was performed.

The MMSE score of 24&#x02013;30 points reflects no cognitive dysfunction, 18&#x02013;23 points mild cognitive impairment and below 18 points moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment.

3.9 points vs. 15.4 &#x000b1; 5.0 points, n.s.). The handling test was performed only on patients independent of third-party assistance regarding their insulin therapy. The total number of patients who were able to inject insulin by themselves was higher after the SGS DTTP (SGS vs. standard: 88.2% vs. 75.8%). Six months after teaching, there were still more patients from the SGS group able to perform precise insulin injection (SGS vs. standard: 83.1% vs. 72.2%). In both groups together, 90% of the elderly patients were able to perform correct insulin injection and 85% correct self-monitoring of blood glucose. A total of 96.4% of the patients knew the correct timing and area of insulin application after the structured DTTP, but only 63% of the geriatric patients were able to remember the name and type of their insulin.</p></sec><sec id="S5-2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Diabetes knowledge increased significantly in both groups after the DTTP (SGS t0 vs. t1: 7.4 &#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3 points vs. 8.7 &#x000b1; 2.6 points, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004; standard t0 vs. t1: 6.8 &#x000b1; 2.8 vs. 8.7 &#x000b1; 2.7 points, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001.

The randomisation of study participants was performed using group randomisation lists. HbA1c was measured in one central laboratory at the University of Jena to avoid bias. As other variables were well randomised, we suggest that the reason for the differences in HbA1c is the small sample size. According to the sample size calculation, 102 patients per group should have been randomised to obtain a significant HbA1c decrease, but due to limited financial resources and difficulties in recruitment of older geriatric patients facing multi-morbidity, the study had to be stopped before. In our opinion, both groups tend to stay close to the target levels and differences in baseline HbA1c should not strongly affect the study results. The adjustment of HbA1c reduction for baseline HbA1c in this study cohort was not indicated due to its small variance.</p><p>Both training groups had a favourable effect on diabetes knowledge. The present study demonstrates that patient-oriented education is suitable to enhance diabetes self-management skills in the older patients. Moreover, the SGS DTTP needs fewer resources (e.g. time expense). Its didactic particularities reduce common barriers for the diabetes education of older patients.</p><p>Prevention of frailty, cognitive decline or immobility not only reduces the need for care by the elderly, but increases quality of life as well&#x02014;and clearly promotes motivation for better diabetes control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18 R19">17&#x02013;19</xref>]. Furthermore, epidemiological data indicate that serious quality issues in the treatment of elderly people with diabetes will indeed challenge health care providers in the near future, because of the increasing life expectancy and incidence of diabetes in older age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21">20, 21</xref>].</p><p>The participation in structured education programmes is associated with improvement in quality of life in elderly patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Elderly diabetic patients showed a slight but not significant increase in treatment satisfaction in both groups, but SGS participants showed less personal anxiety due to hyperglycaemia even though they showed higher HbA1c levels at enrolment. One conclusion of this study is that geriatric patients with diabetes, even with mild cognitive impairment and depression, can benefit from a DTTP concerning objective outcomes as well as self-reported measures, as shown by the reduction of fear of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that patient-oriented education is beneficial with regard to quality criteria and patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Patient education enables patients with diabetes to perform treatment strategies on their own authority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Several studies have found that younger patients with diabetes who have participated in a structured DTTP perform more accurate blood&#x02013;glucose self-monitoring, show improved diabetes knowledge, improved metabolic control and increased diabetes-related quality of life and suffer fewer acute complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p><p>The innovative training programme SGS addresses a current and rapidly growing problem, and fills an existing gap centring on the geriatric patient with diabetes.</p><p>Although the average diabetes duration in this study was nearly 14 years, only half of the participants had previously participated in any structured diabetes training programme. The barriers to health care are still more for geriatric patients. Increasingly, patients with diabetes live to an advanced age accompanied by a variety of impairments and geriatric syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18 R19">17&#x02013;19</xref>] as well as multi-morbidity. Besides the prevention of catabolic symptoms or acute complications, the new DTTP SGS embraces a practical approach focusing on the maintenance of autonomy and definition of individual therapeutic goals to assure well-being of the older patients concerning also the interaction between diabetes and geriatric syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p>The SGS is a new approach to education of the geriatric patient, focusing on resources, accepting deficits and lowering barriers to participation in modern treatment strategies for elderly patients.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Key points</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The SGS programme is a new structured DTTP for geriatric patients with diabetes mellitus considering the limited resources and learning capabilities of older people.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The SGS programme focuses on the maintenance of autonomy of older people and is effective in transferring both diabetes knowledge and diabetes management to geriatric patients.
