It remains accordingly unclear whether injured patients who are acute drinkers or &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; hazardous drinkers have similar injury time distribution, something which can have implications for the design and implementation of interventions.</p><p>The present study investigates the relationship between alcohol consumption and time of injury, considering both acute (ie, prior to injury) and hazardous (ie, at risk) usual alcohol consumption. Hazardous alcohol consumption is considered from the point of view of both risky volumes of usual consumption and of frequent heavy episodic drinking (HED).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design, setting, and sample</title><p>Data were gathered from interviews compiled within a case-crossover study focusing on the triggering effect on injury of alcohol and cannabis use.<xref rid="b13-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Based on a randomized selection of time slots covering day and night time (24/24 hours) and every week day (7/7), 486 injured patients (mean age, 37.9 years; males, 68.3%) admitted to the ED of the Lausanne University Hospital (Switzerland) were interviewed over 4 one-month periods between September 2005 and July 2006, ie, accounting for seasonal variability. A total of 774 patients were eligible for the study (eligibility criteria: French speaking, age 16 and above, and seeking injury care within 24 hours). Patients with degenerative brain disorders (n = 37) or with major trauma (n = 29) were excluded on the grounds that they could not manage an interview. Another 160 patients were not contacted due to work overload (n = 115), transfers to other wards (n = 43), and other reasons (n = 2). Of the 548 patients contacted, 60 declined participation (10.9%) and 2 were excluded because of poor interview results. The questionnaire followed the protocol developed by the World Health Organization Collaborative Study Group on Alcohol and Injuries.<xref rid="b15-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> More information on the sampling frame and inclusion criterion can be found elsewhere.<xref rid="b13-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of the Lausanne University Medical School.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Time of injury was measured considering both day of week (seven categories/days) and time of day (three categories/time periods: night/0:00&#x02013;7:59, day/8:00&#x02013;15:59, and evening/16:00&#x02013;23:59).

HED was defined as the monthly intake of certain amounts of alcohol based on a question about the frequency of consumption of five or more standard drinks of alcohol on the same occasion for men, and four or more for women.<xref rid="b4-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>Prevalence of acute and hazardous alcohol consumption was plotted on graphs according to time of day and day of week of the injury. Logistic regression models assessed associations between time of injury and the three alcohol-related measures. Acute consumption (yes = 1, no = 0), risky volume of consumption (yes = 1, no = 0), and HED (yes = 1, no = 0) are regressed on time of day and day of week (both categorical), adjusted for participants&#x02019; gender and age. Interaction effects between time and day are modeled in a final set of models to assess effect modifications (treated as categorical as for the main effects). Wald tests and odd ratios (ORs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), are given.

Injury prevalence for HED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-oaem-2-061">Figure 2</xref>) peaked on Saturday but did not vary much over days and hours for risky volume of consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oaem-2-061">Figure 3</xref>). Considering variability of prevalence across time periods of the day (see the legends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-oaem-2-061">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-oaem-2-061"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-oaem-2-061">3</xref>), low variability was observed for risky volume of consumption (between 12.3% and 15.5%) and HED (between 30.6% and 43.3%), whereas acute consumption varied more markedly (between 10.2% during day time and, as mentioned earlier, 51.8% during night time).</p></sec><sec><title>Regression analyses</title><p>As mentioned above and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-oaem-2-061">Table 1</xref>, acute alcohol consumption not surprisingly showed a significant overall association with both time of day and day of week of injury (Wald tests significant at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for day of week and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for time of day; model adjusted for gender and age).

By contrast, neither day of week nor time of day was associated with risky volume of alcohol consumption.</p><p>Finally, no effect of interaction terms (between time and day) was significant when estimated in the final set of regression models (at a 5% level of significance; results not presented).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Half of all night-time injuries and as much as 8 in 10 of those taking place during the night between Friday and Saturday occurred after alcohol consumption. The distribution of these alcohol-related injuries was strongly associated with the time of occurrence, as in previous studies.<xref rid="b10-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, our results argue for the absence of synergetic (ie, interaction) effect between time of day and day of week in the etiology of alcohol-related injuries; a finding reported, to our knowledge, for the first time in the literature. Confirming the implicit knowledge of medical staff with this regard, these results highlight the importance of considering the time dimension of an injury when providing emergency care, eg, to prevent possible harmful consequences of the combination of alcohol and medical drugs or anesthetic agents.<xref rid="b18-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>As described in previous studies, heavy episodic drinkers show a propensity for trajectories of drinking concentrated to weekends, which influences their risk for alcohol-related adverse consequences, and injuries, during this period.<xref rid="b4-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Our findings point in the same direction as HED was associated with day of injury (prevalence and ORs peaking on Saturday) but not time of day (this lack of statistical association could, however, be due to low number of cases in the sample). Though, the categorical combination of time and day, in addition to the main effects of each variable, was not associated with HED in the final regression model, noteworthy variations in prevalence of HED were recorded across the week. For instance, the difference in night-time prevalence between Tuesday and Wednesday is surprising (57.1% vs 11.1%). However, with less than 10 injuries, these specific periods had the smallest case numbers of all time/day combinations. Interpreting crude differences between these periods imply, thus, to keep in mind the important sensitivity of crude prevalence in case of small subsamples.</p><p>Self-reported data may challenge the reliability of our results. Yet, a study shows corroboration between self-reported and biological measures of acute alcohol consumption in a subsample of our participants.<xref rid="b20-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Also, the items and criteria used to measure hazardous alcohol consumption are similar to the ones used in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test<xref rid="b21-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and their validity is regarded as high in epidemiological studies.<xref rid="b22-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Further, the exclusion of severely injured patients, unable to answer interview questions, implies that our results cannot easily be extrapolated to that group. The sampling frame nevertheless secured the time representativity needed for the study purposes.</p><p>ED admissions provide an opportunity for targeted interventions aimed at influencing the alcohol consumption of injured people and thereby lowering the alcohol-related burden of injury and disease.<xref rid="b2-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b25-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-oaem-2-061" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Injuries sustained under the influence of alcohol (ie, acute consumption) and injuries sustained by people with hazardous alcohol consumption, ie, respectively with &#x0201c;at health risk&#x0201d; volumes of consumption or with frequent episodes of heavy consumption, concern specific populations, and accordingly distinct target groups for interventions. Accordingly, the fact that acute alcohol consumption is significantly associated with both time of day and day of week, HED with day of week, and risky volume of consumption with none may not only have implications for the triage and care of injured patients in the ED. For instance, these findings have also potential implication for interventions aimed at influencing the alcohol consumption patterns of injury patients presenting to the ED. This is particularly the case as undifferentiated screening and interventions are not likely to affect all patients equally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, acute alcohol consumption and HED show a specific time distribution for injuries, but risky volumes of consumption does not. It remains nonetheless unclear whether these results, observed for all kind of ED-treated injuries aggregated, would remain steady if specific injury mechanisms, and intentional injuries in particular, were to be considered. These findings nevertheless suggest that time of injury can be a key indicator of potential alcohol involvement; an important feature in clinical perspectives since presence of alcohol in the organism is known to be a crucial element in the diagnosis and treatment of injured patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The Swiss National Science Foundation supported the original study (grant 3200B0-105967) as well as the participation of Herv&#x000e9; Kuendig on the present article (grant PBSKB-119860/1).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-oaem-2-061"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cherpitel</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alcohol and injuries: a review of international emergency room studies since 1995</article-title><source>Drug Alcohol Rev</source><year>2007</year><volume>26</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>201</fpage><lpage>214</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17364856</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-oaem-2-061"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>National Institute on Alcohol and Alcoholism (NIAAA)</collab></person-group><source>Alcohol Alert &#x02013; Brief Intervention. 66</source><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>US Department of Health and Human Services, NIAAA</publisher-name><year>2005</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-oaem-2-061"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arfken</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Temporal pattern of alcohol consumption in the United States</article-title><source>Alcohol Clin Exp Res</source><year>1988</year><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>137</fpage><lpage>142</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3279844</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-oaem-2-061"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heeb</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Gmel</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehm</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohler-Kuo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Exploring daily variations of drinking in the Swiss general population.
