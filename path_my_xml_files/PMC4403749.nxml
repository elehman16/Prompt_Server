Participation in bowel cancer screening using a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) in accordance with recommended guidelines reduces bowel cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and potentially incidence, although lowered incidence rates from use of FOBT alone has not been absolutely demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Data on screening participation in Phase 2 of the Australian government-funded National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), which operated between July 1 2008 and June 30 2011, and provided free screening with an FOBT to people turning 50, 55 and 65&#x000a0;years, indicate sub-optimal uptake rates of 34.0%, 38.8% and 46.9% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Low participation rates in bowel cancer screening are widely reported and consistently evident across programs with different screening modes (e.g., colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy) and in different geographic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Decision aids have been developed to assist consumers to optimise health-related decision making, including screening. These include written and audio materials, as well as interactive web-based tools. A recent systematic review has concluded that decision aids improve participants&#x02019; knowledge of the options available and perceptions that decision-making is informed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Some evidence suggests that tailoring health information used in decision aids to the needs of the individual may facilitate desired changes in intention and behaviour, including cancer screening. Rimer and Kreuter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] defined tailored health communication as &#x0201c;any combination of information and behaviour change strategies intended to reach one specific person based on information unique to that person, related to the outcome of interest, and derived from an individual assessment&#x0201d; (p. S184). A meta-analytic review of 56 tailored print health behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported a sample-weighted mean effect size of <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.074 (95% CI .066, .082). Although this can be characterised as approaching a small effect size, the impact of tailoring was largely moderated by demographic and behavioural variables and methodological features of the study. Importantly, the following were included among the variables that predicted a larger effect size; a focus on preventive or screening behaviour, recruiting participants from the household rather than an organisation, focusing tailoring on demographics and 4 or more theoretical concepts that predict behaviour, and using a social cognitive theory or stages of change model, or both, to guide tailoring.</p><p>Computer-based tailoring provides increased opportunity to deliver personal, tailored messages in a flexible, novel, timely and economically feasible manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis by Krebs, Prochaska and Rossi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] confirmed that tailoring achieved benefits when information was delivered by computer. The study included 88 interventions that examined the impact of computer tailoring on smoking, physical activity, healthy eating and regular attendance at mammography. All four behaviours were positively impacted by computer-based tailoring with mammography adherence enhanced by 6% over the control condition. Although these results appear promising they failed to identify the nature of the information to be tailored, or the theories that might guide identification of the appropriate variables.</p><p>Albada, Ausems, Bensing, and van Dulmen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] undertook a systematic review that assessed the impact of tailoring information about cancer risk and screening, concluding that more evidence was required before a positive impact from tailoring could be assumed. Moreover, the two studies included that examined FOBT use found only limited evidence of a beneficial effect from tailoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consistent with this result, a recent attempt at establishing the efficacy of tailoring for people considering bowel cancer screening has had only limited success. Vernon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] undertook a randomised, controlled trial of a tailored, interactive intervention designed to enhance participation in a patient-selected bowel cancer screening option. In this study, messages received by the tailored on-line intervention group were determined by matching &#x0201c;process of change&#x0201d; feedback to the individual&#x02019;s current stage of readiness to screen and preferred screening approach. Processes of change (e.g., &#x0201c;consciousness raising&#x0201d; as a process to move an individual from precontemplation to contemplation; see Prochaska, Redding &#x00026; Evers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]) were, in turn, mapped to hypothesised determinants (e.g., knowledge of the various forms of screening for bowel cancer) and a behaviour change technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although exposure to the intervention material improved knowledge and self-efficacy for screening, these improvements did not lead to improved participation rates.</p><p>Although disappointing, these results may reflect tailoring on suboptimal variables. Myers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] tested both targeted (at those who were overdue for screening) and tailored invitations (messages that addressed personal barriers to screening) to increase screening participation. Tailored messages were developed on the basis of previously obtained scores on Preventive Health Model (PHM) variables (i.e., salience and coherence of screening, perceived susceptibility to bowel cancer, cancer worries and concerns, self-efficacy for screening, response efficacy for screening and perceived social support for screening) and matched to the individual&#x02019;s decision stage for a stool blood test or a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Increased screening participation of between 11 and 15% was achieved for targeted and tailored interventions over usual care controls.</p><p>These promising results, together with the demonstrated positive effect of computer-based tailoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], encouraged us to develop an internet-based, tailored, Personalised Decision Support (PDS) tool for bowel cancer screening. Tailoring was based on the utilisation of individual responses to the PHM variables, previously validated for use in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and their relationship to stage of readiness to screen in a manner directly comparable to Myers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An exploratory study to investigate the effectiveness of the PDS, whilst lacking statistical power, indicated the potential to positively address attitudes toward screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for the current trial was developed after completion of the exploratory study. The aim was to compare the impact of communication materials tailored in real time and delivered over the internet to non-tailored material received in the same manner and mailed, non-tailored material (the latter approach being usual care for population screening in Australia). This design enabled us to investigate the contribution of message delivery mode (computer versus paper) and personal relevance of information (tailoring versus non-tailoring) or both, on participation. The primary hypothesis was that the internet-tailored information group would demonstrate higher return rates of FOBT compared to both internet and mailed non-tailored information groups. The secondary hypothesis was that internet-tailored information group would be at a higher stage of readiness to participate after the intervention and demonstrate greater improvements on PHM variables targeted on the basis of stage of readiness at baseline, and tailored according to need for motivation or reinforcement, also determined by responses at baseline, than participants in the other two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The methods described below summarise those in the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] with the exception of two aspects. Firstly, the final sample size approached to recruit sufficient eligible persons was higher than that envisaged (~25,000 compared to the forecast of 18,000) due primarily to non-return of surveys and ineligibility arising because of recent participation in screening or endoscopic examination. Secondly, the protocol indicated that a secondary outcome of decisional conflict and satisfaction scores would be reported in addition to change on psychological variables. In the event, given the length and breadth of the current article, it was decided that these conflict and satisfaction outcomes should constitute a separate, future report.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organisation Human Research Ethics Committee (09/33). The study was a parallel, randomised, controlled trial, stratified by sex and population density at the Australian state level and conducted in Australia from 2010 to 2012. A randomly-selected sample of men and women aged between 50 and 74&#x000a0;years from every mainland state who resided in urban electoral divisions was obtained from the Australian Electoral Commission roll. Electors whose addresses indicated that they were likely to be living in assisted accommodation (for example, an aged care hostel facility) were excluded from possible selection. Only one member from each household was included in the final sample to avoid possible cross-contamination between the groups. The family member retained was the one whose details came first in the supplied randomised list. The trial proceeded through a number of phases (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Messages pertaining to each PHM variable were presented in an order that accorded with the results of previous research.

Control Group (CG) participants were mailed an information sheet and a printed BS, which they were requested to complete and return in a supplied, pre-paid envelope. Consistent with usual care, the CG participants received an information booklet with the FOBT.</p><p>All participants were mailed an FOBT and associated materials two weeks following completion of the BS. The screening package consisted of: (a) two-sample FOBT (immunochemical FOBT, OC Sensor, Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with instructions, two sample collection sheets and a reply paid envelope; (b) a Participant Details form to confirm personal details and nominate a preferred doctor, with a simple section for participants to provide signed consent to obtain clinical follow-up reports if required. A research-scale bowel screening facility (Bowel Health Service) provided all FOBTs, test development and reporting services. CG participants received a printed version of the NBCSP consumer information booklet and those in the intervention groups were reminded that they could return to the website and revisit their tailored messages and the NBCSP information booklet (tailored PDS group); or the NBCSP information booklet only (non-tailored PDS group). The Bowel Health Service, unaware of group allocation, analysed the returned samples and informed the participant if the result was negative. Where a positive result was found, both the participant and their nominated doctor were informed and assisted if requested with clinical follow-up. A postal reminder was sent to those who did not return their completed FOBT within 6&#x000a0;weeks of despatch. Individual FOBT return data were relayed to the investigators as ID only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 3: evaluation</title><p>Participants were contacted by letter 1 to 2&#x000a0;weeks after receipt of their FOBT, or 12&#x000a0;weeks following the invitation to screen if an FOBT was not returned. They were asked to complete the Endpoint Survey (ES), either by returning to the online site (intervention groups) or completing the accompanying ES in paper format (control group). The ES re-measured PHM/PAPM variables and collected additional information relating to outcome measures. Return of the ES determined a participant&#x02019;s eligibility for inclusion in analyses examining the impact of changes on psycho-social variables on participation in screening. This group has been termed the PHM variable change sample (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Phase 3 also encompassed a qualitative exploration of decision-making around bowel cancer screening. A series of focus groups and individual telephone interviews were conducted with <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63 participants representing the 3 study arms, who had both returned and not returned an FOBT. The interviews revolved around the participants&#x02019; reasons for their decision to screen or not to screen.

GLMs were also used to assess the impact of the intervention on FOBT uptake in participants distal to screening at baseline. As a secondary analysis, we examined change in the psychosocial variables over time. Change scores were calculated by subtracting baseline from endpoint scores in individuals who completed an endpoint survey (PHM variable change sample).

Ninety-eight percent of the Per Protocol Sample (2227/2270) provided complete data regarding their baseline decision stage and the distribution of individuals across these stages is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>. About 15% of participants had never heard of screening for bowel cancer and about 28% had heard of screening but were not currently considering screening. However, the majority of participants in all conditions wanted to screen at study commencement (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1144/2227, or 51.4%). This is particularly relevant to the current trial, given that tailoring is concerned primarily with moving individuals who are not yet ready to screen towards actual screening behaviour rather than having an impact on those people who are already prepared to screen. To further explore the impact of tailoring on FOBT return, participants who already &#x02018;want to screen&#x02019; were excluded (total n remaining for analysis&#x02009;=&#x02009;1083/2227; TPDS&#x02009;=&#x02009;351; NTPDS&#x02009;=&#x02009;344; CG&#x02009;=&#x02009;388) and a GLM was conducted in which trial condition in those not yet ready to screen was used to predict FOBT return. In addition to trial allocation, significant psychosocial predictors of screening in these individuals were identified through an iterative univariate and multivariate process and the final model is shown as Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. Results indicated that participants who were not ready to screen, and allocated to the internet PDS (tailored or not) were significantly more likely to complete an FOBT than those assigned to the paper-based control condition. FOBT return rates across all conditions in these individuals was as follows: TPDS 80% (279/351); NTPDS 82%; (282/344); CG, 70% (272/388).<table-wrap id="Tab8"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>

An inspection of the means plot indicated that there was a generally consistent improvement in self-efficacy in all conditions for FOBT returners (CG: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14, 95% CI [0.09, 0.19]; non-tailored PDS: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17, 95% CI [0.12, 0.22]; tailored PDS: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.21, 95% CI [0.16, 0.26]).

Rates of participation varied little between groups, ranging between 32.5 and 34.5%, a rate comparable to the 33.5% most recently reported by the NBCSP for those invited between 2012 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Observed demographic differences between participants and non-participants were also largely consistent with those reported by the national program, although, unlike the NBCSP, neither gender nor socio-economic disadvantage had a significant effect on participation. Participation rates increased with age and differences between states were similar to published participation patterns.</p><p>By contrast, intervention effects were observed within the Per Protocol Sample (defined as those who completed a BS and were mailed an FOBT) in which participants exposed to online information provision returned FOBTs at a higher rate than those utilising paper-based information. This effect was also apparent in the reduced Per Protocol sample of individuals who at baseline were not ready to screen; this analysis excluded individuals who indicated in the baseline survey that they &#x02018;<italic>wanted to screen for bowel cancer&#x02019;</italic>. The difference between the results from the Per Protocol analyses and those of the ITT analysis suggests that people who complete a study questionnaire (i.e. the baseline survey) are in some way different from the broader sample, notwithstanding their demographic comparability. This difference may reflect differential engagement with the topic of bowel cancer screening and this may moderate the impact of any intervention. More specifically, individuals may need to have some degree of interest in the topic in order for an intervention to have an impact on behaviour.</p><p>Despite the contradictory results evidenced in the ITT and Per Protocol analyses, outcomes from the latter suggest that people in the recommended age group for screening who were connected to the internet, and who were prepared to participate in a questionnaire about bowel cancer, benefited from the provision of advice about the relevance of screening delivered via the computer. Screening rates varied significantly in the Per Protocol Sample with screening participation significantly higher for those who interacted with the screening materials online (tailored PDS and non-tailored PDS) rather than through the usual mail-based delivery (CG). These results did not, however, support online message tailoring as a strategy for incremental improvement of participation. Analysis of the impact of demographic variables on FOBT return highlighted again the generally positive relationship to age that was consistent with the ITT result. The only social cognitive variable to predict return in multivariate analysis of these data was self&#x02013;efficacy for screening. This finding is largely consistent with other studies of tailoring including results from Vernon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The Per Protocol data results were also confirmed in analyses of intervention effectiveness that utilised only those in the sample who did <bold>not</bold> indicate a desire to screen at baseline, as measured by the PAPM. In this further reduced sample of people uncommitted to the targeted behaviour at baseline, provision of information about screening via the internet led to higher rates of FOBT return. The psychosocial predictor of FOBT return identified in the full Per Protocol sample, self-efficacy, was not influential when committed screeners were removed from the sample. Instead, salience and coherence of screening and perceived susceptibility to bowel cancer were influential; uncommitted participants who were more aware of screening salience and coherence at study start were more likely to be moved to act, and those with lower levels of perceived susceptibility at baseline were also more responsive to the intervention.</p><p>Results that analysed changes following the intervention on social cognitive variables of the Preventive Health Model and faecal aversion suggest that tailoring may influence some cognitions about screening. Consistent with Myers et al&#x02019;s proposition that messages that improve people&#x02019;s responses to critical social cognitive variables will impact intention and behaviour by moving them to a higher stage of readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], our results confirm improvement on self-efficacy was a correlate of movement to action and improved more in those receiving tailored messages than in the control group, although not more than for non-tailored. Salience and coherence of screening was also positively impacted by tailored messages. Similarly, tailored internet-based information decreased faecal aversion more than mailed non-tailored information although not significantly more than non-tailored, internet-based information provision. Taken together with the analysis of non-committed participants, this result highlights the importance of making information about bowel cancer screening salient and coherent to potential participants, especially those not currently committed to screening. It is also important to note that failure to comply with the targeted behaviour (i.e. FOBT return) may negatively impact self-efficacy to act measured subsequently. This possibility is highlighted in the main effect of FOBT return on changes in self-efficacy. Moreover, the interaction effect suggests that, for non-participants, an internet-based, non-tailored message may exacerbate threats to confidence. An explanation for this would require further exploration.</p><p>There are both strengths and limitations to the current study. For example, the number of invitations required to achieve an eligible sample was notably higher than the initial proposed number (~25,000 versus 18,000). This was essentially due to a lower uptake rate for the eligibility phase and also the higher than expected incidence of self-reported screening in those who did return the eligibility survey, and these outcomes have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The number of invitations was increased to ensure that we still recruited sufficient individuals per trial arm as governed by the power analysis. Despite the fact that there were significant demographic group differences (residence, age group, sex) between those who did and did not respond to the invitation, the eligible and randomised ITT groups were relatively homogenous with regard to these variables. An additional threat to generalisability was the study&#x02019;s focus on internet-enabled participants; this compromises generalisability to population screening programs that include individuals who are not active internet users. However, this approach was necessary to ensure that internet access rates did not confound study results. Whilst a growing segment of the population within the targeted age-group is using the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], there are still many sub-groups within the community without ready physical access, desire or capability to access the internet. Additionally, the study design, with the incorporation of survey return as a precondition for FOBT access, provided an additional hurdle to participation that is not observed in real-world screening programs. The significance of this threat is lessened by the observation that participation rates in the ITT sample were comparable to that obtained in the NBCSP.</p><p>The strength of the study rests with its multiple levels of analysis&#x02014;from ITT to Per Protocol to subgroup analysis. Two of the three levels of analysis suggested that participation in screening may be enhanced in internet-enabled people by the use of internet-based communication. The incorporation of the measurement of change in psychological constructs provided the opportunity to analyse how message tailoring and mode of delivery impact upon attitudes and cognitions with some suggestion that the benefits of tailoring may accrue at this level. The implications of this require further examination; changes in the way people think about screening may impact ongoing participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Internet-based information resources may have a role in encouraging some sections of the community who are uncommitted to screening to move along the decision pathway towards participation. Routine collection of these data in health practices might facilitate effective communication. Further research should examine the potential impact of social cognitive changes on subsequent participation in rescreening. It is possible that changes on important psycho-social influences on an intermittent behaviour like participation in biennial bowel cancer screening enhance perceived importance of screening and reduce dropouts from screening programs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CW, IF, DT, GY and SC were responsible for identifying the research question.
