In patients with systemic malignancies, brain metastases occur in 10%-30% of adults and 6%-10% of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The incidence of brain metastases appears to be rising as a result of superior imaging modalities and earlier detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The most common route of metastatic dissemination resulting in brain metastases is hematogenous, and it is therefore presumed that the entire brain is &#x0201c;seeded&#x0201d; with micrometastatic disease, even when only a single intracranial lesion is detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, this assumption has been questioned, prompting a contrarian philosophy that in some patients, the intracranial disease is truly limited&#x02014;the so-called oligometastases situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The management of brain metastases can be divided into symptomatic and therapeutic strategies. Symptomatic therapy often includes corticosteroids to reduce peritumoral edema and anticonvulsants to prevent recurrent seizures. Therapeutic approaches to brain metastases include surgery, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and chemotherapy. Many patients are treated with a combination of these, and treatment decisions must take into account factors such as patient age, functional status, primary tumor type, extent of extracranial disease, prior therapies, and number of intracranial lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>WBRT has been used for decades as the mainstay of the management of patients with brain metastases being widely applicable and technically easy to deliver. It also improves symptoms in 75% of symptomatic patients with brain metastases and improves median survival to 3&#x02013;6 months compared with a median survival of only 1&#x02013;2 months in untreated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, for patients who truly have limited intracranial disease, the potential exists that WBRT could be replaced by focal therapeutic options such as resection or SRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Also, the recognition of potential late neurotoxicity and the inadequate local control with WBRT and the development of better imaging and focal therapies, such as microsurgical resection and SRS, have shifted the research focus to study which patients are best treated with WBRT and which patients are best treated with other therapies. Numerous randomized trials have investigated strategies for patients who would most likely benefit from these aggressive therapies, namely those of good performance status with single or few brain metastases. The median survival times reported for these relatively favourable prognosis patients enrolled in these trials were typically 6&#x02013;11 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>SRS employs multiple convergent beams to deliver a single, large dose of radiation to a discrete target volume. The three most common delivery systems are the linear accelerator, gamma knife, and cyclotron, which make use of high-energy photons, gamma rays, and protons, respectively. Most brain metastases have distinct radiographic and pathologic margins, making them attractive targets for SRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. SRS has emerged as a common treatment modality for newly diagnosed patients, alone or in combination with WBRT, and as salvage therapy for progressive intracranial disease after WBRT.</p><sec><title>Aim of the study</title><p>The current study is a prospective randomized study to evaluate role of WBRT combined with SRS compared to SRS alone and to WBRT alone in improvement of the overall survival, brain local control, performance status and its effect on treatment-related morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The present work involved 60 patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, each with a maximum diameter of no more than 4&#x000a0;cm on contrast-enhanced MRI scans, derived from a histologically confirmed systemic cancer. An ethical approval and an informed written consent was obtained from the patients before entering the study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of National Cancer Institute Cairo University Egypt.</p><p>These patients are randomized into 3 arms, 21 patients received whole brain radiotherapy WBRT, 18 patients received SRS and 21 patients received WBRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;SRS, the study took place in the radiotherapy department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt from January 2008 until March 2011 with the following inclusion criteria: Age&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;years, KPS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70%, Ensured adequate organ function (Haemogram, Kidney and Liver function), no previous treatment for brain metastases.</p></sec><sec><title>Regarding technique of treatment</title><p>1) <bold>Patient immobilization</bold></p><p>Head and neck immobilization for patients of WBRT group was performed using thermoplastic mask and head support in supine position.</p><p>Precise immobilization of patients of the SRS group was done by the Brown-Roberts-Wells CT Stereotactic (BRW) localization system frame. Local anaesthesia (1&#x000a0;cc of 0.5% xylocaine) was injected subcutaneously at the site of insertion of each headpins; the pins are artifact free carbon fiber with ceramic tips as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of patients in studied arms according to no. of brain lesions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1748-717X-9-116-1"/></fig><p>2) <bold>Image acquisition</bold> (<bold>CT- MRI- Fusion)</bold></p><p>The MRI study consists of post-contrast T1-weighted images, followed by the acquisition T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Slice thickness was 2.5&#x000a0;mm with no gaps.</p><p>For patients receiving SRS; a Brown-Roberts-Wells CT stereotactic (BRW) frame and localizer system were used and attached to the CT couch, using an adjustable support bracket. CT scan was taken throughout the full cranial volume from the superior edge of the frame to the cranial vertex after injection of intra venous contrast. The image slice interval was 2.5&#x000a0;mm. The patient&#x02019;s images were transferred to the treatment planning computer using the transfer protocol and optical disc.</p><p>Axial MRI images were fused to the axial CT images using chamfer match technique where sets of points belonging to the same anatomical structures on each study were used.</p><p>3) <bold>Target and critical organs deleneation</bold></p><p>The stereotactic team began by delineating on each image slice the external cranial surface, dose limiting structures such as optic nerves and chiasma, eyes, functional brain areas such as the brainstem and the target volume which included the gross target volume +1&#x000a0;mm as planning target volume. In addition, all nine rod intersections on each slice are digitized to define the transformation for each slice from the CT reference system to the frame system.</p><p>4) <bold>
<italic>Selection of method of treatment</italic>
</bold></p><p>The most important criteria for selection of SRS method were tumor volume and shape. Patients with radiographically well defined lesion with small volume were candidate for SRS using non coplanar arcs by circular collimator (cones). In general, arc therapy was preferred in tumors with rounded regular surface, while lesions with large volume and irregular outlines were treated using mMLC.</p><p>5) <bold>Evaluation of the treatment plans</bold></p><p>Multiple parameters were evaluated including surface dose, isodose distribution, dose volume histogram, conformity index and tissue volume ratio.</p><p>6) <bold>Quality assurance</bold></p><p>To confirm the precision of isocenter, as SRS treatment uses the rotation of gantry and couch. Mechanical Isocenter Standard (MIS; Radionics Inc.), Rectilinear Phantom Pointer (RLPP; Radionics Inc.) were used to achieve this precision.</p><p>7) <bold>Dose specification and fractionation</bold></p><p>The WBRT dosage schedule is 30&#x000a0;Gy in 10 fractions over 2&#x000a0;weeks delivered using megavoltage machines with photon beams of energy 6 MV. Treatments were delivered through parallel opposed fields that cover the entire cranial contents. Doses were specified at the central axis at midplane on the brain.</p><p>The WBRT treatment preceded SRS when patients were assigned to the WBRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;SRS group and the whole treatment duration was within 1&#x000a0;month.</p><p>In the current study, the prescribed dose of SRS in the WBRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;SRS arm ranged from 14 to 20&#x000a0;Gy (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.6&#x000a0;Gy, median&#x02009;=&#x02009;14&#x000a0;Gy), while the prescribed dose in the SRS alone arm ranged from 18 to 20&#x000a0;Gy (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;19.5&#x000a0;Gy, median dose&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x000a0;Gy). The dose choice was dependant on the size, number of the brain lesion and proximity to critical structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Regarding patient follow-up</title><p>The follow-up included neurologic examinations and magnetic resonance imaging 3&#x000a0;months after start of treatment and in 3&#x000a0;months intervals to evaluate response or failure criteria and to evaluate treatment morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>This was an intention to treat analysis.</p><p>Comparison between two groups for numerical variables was done using either student t- test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney &#x02013;U test (non-parametric t-test) as appropriate. Comparison between more than two groups for numerical variables was done using ANOVA or non parametric Kruskal-Wallis as appropriate. Relation between qualitative data was done using Chi-square test or non- parametric Fisher&#x02019;s exact test as appropriate.

<italic>Definition of response</italic>
</bold></title><p>The bidimensional product for each of the brain metastases identified at baseline was measured and calculated. The bidimensional product is defined as the largest dimension multiplied by the second largest dimension that is perpendicular to it. This value was recorded on the baseline form and every subsequent follow-up form and the response was recorded as whether there is CR or PR or no response or CNS progression. The appearance (yes/no) of any new brain metastases was recorded on all follow-up forms. Local control was defined as unchanged or improved serial post-treatment MRI scans judged as either complete response, partial response, or stable disease.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;<bold>Complete response </bold><bold>
<italic>(CR</italic>
</bold><italic>)</italic> - disappearance of all tumors on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least one month apart, off steroids, and neurologically stable or improved.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;<bold>Partial response </bold><bold>
<italic>(PR)</italic>
</bold> - 50% or greater decrease in tumor size on consecutive CT or MRI scans at least one month apart, steroid dose stable or reduced, and neurologically stable or improved.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;<bold>Stable disease</bold> - a 0-50% decrease in size of all lesions with improving or stable neurological examination.</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;<bold>CNS progression</bold> - was defined as a defined increase in perpendicular bi-dimensional tumor area for any of the 1&#x02013;3 tracked brain metastases, or the appearance of any new brain metastasis on a follow-up MRI.</p><p>For lesions smaller than 1&#x000a0;cm in maximum diameter, a maximum increase of 50% in perpendicular bi-dimensional treatment area was necessary to score as progression.

Also WBRT&#x02009;+&#x02009;SRS provide better survival in patients whose largest brain metastasis was less 3&#x000a0;cm in diameter and those with controlled primary. Regardless of the treatment group, our data suggest that both survival and local control are better for single brain site involvement compared to multiple brain sites involvement. Further studies with larger number of patients is needed to be conducted for more reliable statistical results.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no
