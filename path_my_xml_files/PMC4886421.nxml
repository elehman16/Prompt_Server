It compares 16 Boys and Girls Club sites implementing Making Proud Choices (MPC, control group), a structured teen pregnancy prevention evidence-based program with 16 similar sites implementing MPC augmented with GTO (intervention group). All sites received training and manuals typical for MPC. GTO has its own manuals, training, and onsite technical assistance (TA) to help practitioners complete key programming practices specified by GTO. During the first year, TA providers helped the intervention group adopt, plan, and deliver MPC. This group then received training on the evaluation and quality improvement steps of GTO, including feedback reports summarizing their data, which were used in a TA-facilitated quality improvement process that yielded revised plans for the second MPC implementation. This paper presents results regarding GTO&#x02019;s impact on performance of the sites (i.e., how well key programming practices were carried out), fidelity of MPC implementation, and the relationship between amount of TA support, performance, and fidelity. Performance was measured using ratings made from a standardized, structured interview conducted with participating staff at all 32 Boys and Girls Clubs sites after the first and second years of MPC implementation.

Implementation support interventions that can facilitate the successful delivery of EBPs are becoming available. Yet, there is little theory-driven research using rigorous designs that test whether these support interventions improve program delivery or participant outcomes. This is especially the case in the domain of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, where programs are often implemented in low-resource, community-based settings that some argue have been under-studied in implementation science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Enhancing Quality Interventions Promoting Healthy Sexuality (EQUIPS) is a 2-year, randomized controlled trial of an implementation support intervention called Getting To Outcomes&#x000ae; (GTO).

</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Difficulty implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs</title><p id="Par10">Although teen pregnancy rates have been declining recently, teen pregnancy and STI continue to be problematic for the USA. In 2013, there were almost 27 births per 1000 adolescent females ages 15&#x02013;19 (274,641 babies), 89&#x000a0;% of which were outside of marriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sexually active teens are at high risk for contracting STIs and other poor outcomes (e.g., dropping out of school, requiring public assistance, living in poverty) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These outcomes cost the USA between $9.4 and $28 billion a year from public assistance expenditures, uncollected tax revenue, and public health, foster care, and criminal justice costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">These poor outcomes highlight the need for implementation support in community-based settings. The US Department of Health and Human Services has identified 35 EBPs that have reduced rates of teen pregnancy and STI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Yet communities often face difficulty implementing these EBPs with the quality needed to achieve outcomes demonstrated by researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], yielding a &#x0201c;gap&#x0201d; between research and community practice. This gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] often results from limited resources and a lack of capacity&#x02014;the knowledge, attitudes, and skills&#x02014;individual practitioners need to implement &#x0201c;off the shelf&#x0201d; EBPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Getting To Outcomes&#x02014;an implementation support intervention</title><p id="Par12">Getting To Outcomes (GTO) builds capacity for implementing EBPs by strengthening the capacity (i.e., knowledge, attitudes, and skills) needed to carry out practices which are critical to running any program successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], namely goal setting, planning, process and outcome evaluation, and using data to improve and sustain programs. GTO builds capacity through three types of assistance: (1) the GTO manual of text and tools originally published by the RAND Corporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and then adapted for teen pregnancy and STI prevention by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], (2) face-to-face training, and (3) ongoing, onsite technical assistance (TA). Important to GTO&#x02019;s capacity-building is asking practitioners to be active learners, setting the expectation, and giving them the opportunity to carry out for themselves the key programming practices GTO specifies. Although EQUIPS applies GTO to teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs, GTO is a generic set of supports that is able to build capacity for any type of program. For example, GTO has been applied to drug use prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], underage drinking prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and positive youth development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The GTO logic model shows the proposed mechanisms through which GTO works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The logic model was initially developed based on our observations of how community-based groups needed capacity-building to successfully carry out substance abuse prevention programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and then has been refined based on the research and theories described below. It begins with an implementation support intervention (i.e., GTO) designed to build capacity (i.e., knowledge, attitudes, and skills) to carry out a range of programming practices needed to implement an EBP mentioned above (beyond just program delivery). We define <italic>performance</italic> as the level of quality at which these practices are carried out. Consistent with social cognitive theories of behavioral change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and implementation science theories such as the Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research (for details, see Acosta et al. and Smelson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]), we theorize that exposure to GTO through training and TA leads to more capacity to perform these practices, which in turn can improve the performance of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Improved performance, in turn, improves program implementation, such as demonstrating program fidelity. EBPs delivered with high fidelity tend to produce positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Implementation support logic model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_446_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Previous efforts to evaluate implementation support</title><p id="Par14">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services have used implementation support interventions to help community-based organizations adopt and implement EBPs to prevent teen pregnancies and STIs. However, these efforts were not evaluated using rigorous research designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Research has evaluated implementation support interventions in other areas conducted in low-resourced, community-based settings. For example, in substance abuse prevention, the Communities That Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] interventions have shown improvements in EBP fidelity and outcomes in multi-site trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, neither tracked what programming was being implemented, or its fidelity, in the control communities. Rohrbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found that standard training plus implementation support (i.e., TA) yielded better fidelity to a substance abuse prevention EBP than standard training alone. That trial was not able to track TA usage or blind fidelity observers, however. With practitioners of drug prevention programs, GTO has been found to improve the capacity of individual practitioners and the performance of prevention programs in both quasi-experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, those studies involved mostly non-evidence-based programs of widely varying type and quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Contributions of the EQUIPS study</title><p id="Par15">EQUIPS builds upon previous governmental initiatives and implementation support research to date in two important ways. First, the design isolates the impacts of GTO by having both the experimental and control conditions receive training in the same EBP, while providing GTO only to experimental sites. In all four previous research studies on GTO, GTO was used at sites that had all different prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, those studies were limited to a generic measure of program performance that could be compared across different programs. Although we use that measure of performance in EQUIPS, the use of a single EBP allows us to go further and compare the experimental and control conditions with the same fidelity measure. Second, EQUIPS further empirically tests the GTO logic model&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] linkages from implementation support (i.e., GTO), to program performance and then to program fidelity, all in a single randomized controlled trial of a teen pregnancy and STI EBP. To our knowledge, there have been no randomized controlled trials that assess implementation support interventions in teen pregnancy and STI prevention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Design overview</title><p id="Par16">EQUIPS is a 2-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 16 Boys and Girls Clubs (BGCs) who received typical training to implement the Making Proud Choices (MPC) program (control group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with 16 BGCs who received the same MPC training, plus GTO tools, training, and TA (intervention group). We collaboratively decided upon MPC with the BGCs because of their need for teen pregnancy and STI prevention and MPC&#x02019;s evidence base and culturally appropriate curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. GTO is provided over a 2-year period, allowing all sites to deliver MPC twice. The trial assessed three sets of variables: quality of performance in carrying out key programming practices (e.g., goal setting, planning, evaluation), fidelity of MPC (e.g., adherence, classroom delivery, dosage), and the sexual health outcomes of participating middle school youth. In this paper, we report on GTO&#x02019;s impact on performance and fidelity and whether there is a relationship between amount of implementation support, performance, and fidelity. We chose these measures because they align with the GTO logic model, which specifies that implementation support improves performance, which in turn improves fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study sites</title><p id="Par17">Based on available study resources, power calculations showed that the study could accommodate <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 sites. Our power calculation for program performance was conducted under the assumptions, based on previous GTO research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], that the within-program correlation of scores between baseline and follow-up would be 0.5, while the score in an individual program&#x02019;s follow-up measurements will be 0.7. Thus, with 32 sites, we calculated that there would be 80&#x000a0;% power to detect medium-to-large effects (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7) in scores over time for programs in the intervention vs. control groups (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05), which is consistent with effects found in GTO studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Power for fidelity was calculated to be similar, especially given that large differences in curriculum adherence rates have been found between researcher- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and community-conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] studies.</p><p id="Par18">EQUIPS involves 32 BGC sites in Atlanta, Georgia (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) and multiple locations in Alabama (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16). These sites were chosen because teen pregnancy rates are generally higher in the Southeastern US and they had access to large numbers of youth. In Atlanta, the BGC club offered 16 sites out of 26 based on their demographics of those sites (i.e., those with sufficient numbers of middle school aged youth who could participate). In Alabama, all three BGCs we approached agreed to participate and again offered a combined 16 sites that had sufficient numbers of appropriate youth. BGCs provide youth programming that ranges from recreation in large common rooms and gyms to leadership, character education, health and wellness, and academic programs. A BGC is often made up of several sites (i.e., geographic locations). Although there is some variability across sites, each site has its own facility and a small number of staff and part-time volunteers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7&#x02013;10).</p><p id="Par19">Two to three staff from each site participated and provided consent for all site-level measures. The sites had similar staff demographics. The Alabama sites as a whole, and in the control and intervention groups, had largely similar demographic makeup (no significant differences). Two thirds of the staff were female; most were aged 50&#x02013;65 (50&#x000a0;%) or 26&#x02013;49 (44&#x000a0;%); most (88&#x000a0;%) had some college education or greater; and 81&#x000a0;% were African-American and 19&#x000a0;% were White.

Over eight, 1-h highly scripted class sessions called &#x0201c;modules,&#x0201d; MPC (1) provides information about abstinence, pregnancy and safe-sex (i.e., condoms); (2) strengthens attitudes of sexual responsibility and pride needed for abstinence and/or safer-sex decision making (e.g., condom use); and (3) teaches skills on how to remain abstinent or use safe-sex practices. The evidence for MPC comes from a rigorous RCT involving primarily African-American sixth and seventh graders from three middle schools serving low-income communities in Philadelphia where half of the youth received MPC and half did not. Immediately at post intervention, the youth that received MPC significantly improved, compared to the control youth, on eight of the 14 mediator measures (i.e., proximal outcome), mostly involving condom use and sexual knowledge. The youth that received MPC also had significantly higher frequency of condom use at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;month follow-ups compared to the control youth and significantly less frequent sex and unprotected sex at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months among those who were sexually active at the start of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. MPC is one of the most popular teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs in the USA.

</p><p id="Par24">Leading up to the intervention group&#x02019;s first MPC implementation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), TA providers delivered GTO training to participating BGC staff in multiple sessions, addressing two GTO steps per session up through step 6 (planning). Simultaneously, TA providers helped BGC staff complete each GTO step (e.g., completing tools) to guide the planning of the MPC program during bi-weekly meetings. Then BGC staff implemented MPC and facilitated the collection of fidelity and youth outcome data (described below). BGC sites then received training on evaluation and quality improvement (GTO steps 7&#x02013;9), along with feedback reports summarizing evaluation data from their sites, which were used in a TA-facilitated quality improvement process that resulted in a revised plan for the second implementation of MPC. The 2-year implementation followed the same process and collected the same data, supplemented by training on sustainability (GTO step 10). All BGC sites received $3000 a year to defray some costs of participating in the study. Chinman et al.

Although programs consist of individual people with varying abilities, ratings are made at the site level because programs operate as a unit. Each site was assessed twice by one of two interviewers. In the intervention group, the interviews were conducted each year after staff reviewed their evaluation data and made a quality improvement plan. In the control group, the interviews were conducted each year one month after MPC ended.</p><p id="Par28">The interview consists of 12 items that assess how well practices in eight domains key to program success (i.e., that align with eight GTO steps) are performed throughout MPC implementation: developing goals and desired outcomes, ensuring program fit, ensuring sufficient capacity, planning, process evaluation, outcome evaluation, continuous quality improvement, and sustainability. Each item is rated on a five-point scale from &#x0201c;highly faithful&#x0201d; to ideal practice (5) to &#x0201c;highly divergent&#x0201d; from ideal practice (1). All the items have specific criteria that guide the ratings. The measure yields a score for each domain and a total score.

We also tested whether the change from year 1 to 2 for the intervention group differed from the change from year 1 to 2 in the control group, a test of the moderating influence of year of implementation.

Treatment was again the only fixed effect. Adherence was treated dichotomously to isolate the effect of GTO on the two ends of the fidelity spectrum (not at all vs. full).

First, we used TA hours to predict program performance in intervention sites using a linear mixed effects regression model with TA hours as the fixed effect and site-level intercepts within state as the random effect.

We restricted the analyses to intervention sites because only those sites were intended to receive TA hours and the number of sites was not sufficient to test condition moderation of the effects of TA hours. Next, we examined whether average program performance scores predicted adherence across all sites. To do this, we fit a mixed effects logistic regression model at the activity level similar to the models used in the analysis of the adherence ratings, except here we controlled for a fixed effect of site-level average program performance score.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Type I error control</title><p id="Par42">Due to the multiple contrasts in many of the outcome analyses, we adjusted <italic>p</italic> values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] to control the false discovery rate (FDR) across the tests.

These are not just GTO steps, but represent important practices that need to be completed well for any EBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Regarding the adherence dimension of fidelity, in year 1, sites receiving GTO were observed to have fewer instances where they did not carry out an activity of the MPC program at all compared to sites without GTO. However, both groups of sites implemented MPC activities fully only a little more than half the time (55&#x02013;57&#x000a0;%). In year 2, the intervention group significantly improved their adherence, implementing MPC activities fully 92&#x000a0;% of the time, while the control group remained similar to year 1 (55&#x000a0;%). There was a similar pattern of results between years 1 and 2 for the four classroom delivery variables. None of the four variables (classroom control, facilitator enthusiasm, objectives met, and student interest) were significantly different between the two groups in year 1. However, in year 2, the intervention group had higher ratings on all four variables and significantly improved to a greater extent between years 1 and 2 compared to the control group on two. Dosage (i.e., attendance)&#x02014;was not different between the groups in either year.</p><p id="Par56">In addition to evaluating GTO impact, we also assessed empirical support for the GTO logic model. Models predicting performance from TA hours (a measure of implementation support) were not significant. It is possible the small sample size made it difficult to detect significant effects (e.g., the model predicting the total performance score from total TA hours was significant before adjustment, approaching significance after adjustment, FDR <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.16). Regarding the relationship between performance and adherence, higher total performance predicted greater adherence. The GTO logic model states that organizations demonstrating greater skill in carrying all the various tasks involved in running prevention programs will implement programs with greater fidelity, and these results support that relationship. This relationship is important because it suggests that using the GTO implementation support intervention to increase performance can be effective in improving fidelity, a key factor in achieving positive outcomes from EBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Overall, the second year showed more GTO impact and there are several potential reasons. It is possible that the control group did as well in year 1 because they also received support, inadvertently, by their participation in the study. For example, in order to collect fidelity and outcome data, the research staff did need to be in contact with the staff in the control group, which may have organized them in a way similar to what GTO provides (e.g., setting firm dates and locations for program delivery). We also documented intervention bleed as the control group did receive some TA hours, albeit significantly less than the intervention group. In addition to the inadvertent support, the MPC manual and training provide detailed guidance on how to deliver the program. The combination of intervention bleed and MPC structure may have made it difficult to detect many differences in the first year. In the second year, with the addition of GTO&#x02019;s quality improvement activities, which specifically identified areas of weakness and stimulated plans for improving those areas, the intervention group&#x02019;s performance and classroom delivery scores were notably higher and adherence scores were nearly perfect.</p><p id="Par58">These findings suggest that in typical community-based settings, manuals and training common to structured EBPs may be sufficient to yield low levels of performance and moderate levels of fidelity, but that more systematic implementation support is needed to achieve high levels of performance and fidelity. We believe these findings are generalizable to low-resourced, community-based settings such as Boys and Girls Clubs. However, we would expect that in organizations with greater resources and more staff, GTO could lead to even better findings. It should be noted that these results were achieved with about 65&#x000a0;h of GTO training and TA time, per site, over the 2-year intervention period. Although more research is needed about the return on investment from implementation support approaches, these findings suggest that using GTO on a large scale could be feasible. For example, the Office of Adolescent Health is funding 75 community-based organizations to implement evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs for 5&#x000a0;years. Grantees have been required to use GTO and are receiving TA from OAH staff at the same scope as described here. While it was beyond the scope of EQUIPS, the authors of this report are currently conducting a separate trial, with a very similar design, investigating the cost effectiveness of the GTO support.</p><p id="Par59">Fidelity results in EQUIPS are similar to CTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], PROSPER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and Rohrbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], who documented similarly high rates of adherence or superior fidelity compared to standard training. However, those studies differed in their investigation of what predicted fidelity. For example, PROSPER found some evidence that programs with better adherence had better team meetings, attitudes about prevention, and TA collaboration, although the sample size was small. In contrast, EQUIPS focused on the impact of implementation support and the degree to which improving performance of key programming activities improved fidelity. Future research needs to explore the relative contribution of various factors that can improve fidelity.</p><p id="Par60">There are some limitations that should be noted. First, this report does not present data on youth outcomes. Models of youth outcome data represent separate, though related, research questions that will be addressed in subsequent reports. Second, practitioners at the sites did not have the full experience in doing a needs assessment or searching for and choosing an EBP (GTO steps 1 and 3, respectively). Instead, research staff and club leaders collaboratively decided upon a single EBP (i.e., MPC) prior to the start of the study. This was done to better isolate the impacts of GTO and employ measures of fidelity (and eventually outcomes) that could be similarly compared across all sites. The GTO process was observed&#x02014;MPC was chosen specifically because data indicated that teen pregnancy rates are higher in the Southern US and among African-American populations, and it is a universal prevention program (i.e., good for all youth) with strong evidence of effectiveness. However, for the purposes of the study, we worked to achieve a consensus across all the sites&#x02019; leaders instead of having each site go through the program selection decision on their own. For all other GTO steps, each site individually carried out the related practices. Given the similarity among many universal teen pregnancy prevention programs, we believe GTO received a strong test in EQUIPS. Future studies should be conducted that better isolate the impact of program choice on implementation and outcomes.</p><p id="Par61">Third, we did not evaluate the sustainability of GTO beyond 2&#x000a0;years in this study. While this question needs to be investigated, we believe that community-based practitioners are better able to run programs using the GTO manual on their own (which includes a number of planning and evaluation tools) after receiving the capacity-building support from the GTO technical assistance staff.</p><p id="Par62">Fourth, while we did assess some organizational characteristics at baseline and found no differences between the study groups, it is possible that additional such characteristics that were not measured could have impacted the results. Future GTO studies could benefit from a more comprehensive assessment of such factors. To that end, the current GTO study mentioned above also includes CFIR-based qualitative interviews of representatives at all participating sites that will assess how various factors identified by CFIR impacts the use and effects of GTO.</p><p id="Par63">Finally, although 32 sites are substantial for an RCT, it is a modest sample for evaluating site-level outcomes. Smaller effects may have gone undetected. Future studies are needed in which the impact of implementation support is assessed, using a rigorous randomized design, on a scale that approximates the size of large federally or state funded initiatives such as the CDC&#x02019;s multi-state efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], or the US Department of Health and Human Services&#x02019; Personal Responsibility Education Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These initiatives are sufficiently large, but their non-experimental designs cannot determine causal impact of implementation support strategies. Only large randomized trials&#x02014;likely funded by a combination of sources&#x02014;will be able to shed light on the utility of implementation support at a large scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par64">These findings suggest that sites receiving the GTO implementation support intervention experienced a benefit related to their performance of key programming practices and level of fidelity. Also, this study suggests the quality with which sites perform those practices is related to the level of fidelity those sites achieve, a key link in the GTO logic model. The presence of such a link suggests that GTO (and perhaps other implementation support models like it) not only can help practitioners become more skilled in carrying out programs but also can yield a measurable improvement in the fidelity of specific EBPs. These findings are bolstered by a rigorous design in which we sought to isolate, and then similarly measure, the impacts of GTO over and above the training community-based sites typically receive after acquiring an EBP. Future publications will focus on the degree to which the site-level improvements lead to improved youth outcomes, the final link in the GTO logic model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Abbreviations</title><p id="Par65">BGC(s), Boys and Girls Club(s); EBP, evidence-based program; GTO, Getting To Outcomes; MPC, Making Proud Choices; STI, sexually transmitted infection; TA, technical assistance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>All the authors are funded by a grant from the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development: <italic>Enhancing Quality Interventions Promoting Healthy Sexuality</italic> (1R01HD069427-01).
