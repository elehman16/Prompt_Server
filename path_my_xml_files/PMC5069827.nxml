The mDOT-HuA study is a single centre, prospective, randomized, open label clinical trial. One-hundred individuals with SCA with haemoglobin SS genotype, aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, living in Dar es Salaam, able and willing to record and submit videos electronically will be included. Participants will be divided into two treatment arms; 50 in the standard monitoring (SM) arm will receive mobile phones and fixed dose HU therapy with standard monitoring; 50 in the mDOT arm will receive mobile phones, fixed dose HU therapy with standard monitoring and a mobile directly observed web based medication adherence monitoring system. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants achieving &#x02265;80&#x000a0;% HU adherence compared between the two arms as assessed through medication possession ratio at the end of 3&#x000a0;months of treatment. REDCap, an open source software application will be used to collect data using clinical research forms. The proportions of adherence in the two arms will be compared by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

It is associated with significant morbidity caused by pain crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers and irreversible organ damage. There is a high burden of SCA in Sub-Saharan Africa with high mortality rate especially in children under 5&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Developed countries account for less than 8&#x000a0;% of the disease burden due to interventions such as neonatal screening, pneumococcal vaccination, prophylactic penicillin treatment and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, thus reducing mortality and morbidity and increasing survival rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>HU, the only disease modifying therapy for SCA, has been demonstrated to be efficacious in reducing complications such as pain crisis and acute chest syndrome and improving survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HU works primarily by inducing fetal hemoglobin in patients with SCA. Other hematological parameters routinely affected by the use of HU are the mean corpuscular volume, which tends to increase, and the leukocyte and platelet counts, which are expected to decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The main clinical outcome of HU use is a reduction of approximately 50&#x000a0;% in the incidence of vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, a reduction in the number of transfusions received by the patient and an improvement in survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In spite of its significant benefits, HU is, unfortunately vastly underutilized and poorly adhered to because of barriers at the health care system, provider, treatment, socioeconomic, and patient level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies conducted in resource-rich settings to assess HU adherence and compliance have shown poor visit and medication adherence measured by pill count, provider reports and pharmacy refills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa HU use has been further limited due to additional barriers related to the relatively high cost of the drug, scarce availability and local challenges related to the monitoring of side effects. To date, there are no studies documenting adherence to HU in sub-Saharan Africa. The main critical gap in knowledge and research about HU adherence and safety is how to assess and tailor interventions according to individual level barriers to adherence and achieve effectiveness of HU in real world situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], especially where the environmental factors and adherence assessment techniques that may impact HU compliance are significantly different from those in the developed countries. Details of previous studies reporting HU adherence in SCA are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Previous studies reporting adherence to HU treatment in SCA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Author, Year</th><th>Study design</th><th>Sample size and population</th><th>Adherence assessment method</th><th>% adherence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Thornburg et al., 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</td><td>Single site, cross sectional</td><td>75 (3.5&#x02013;17.8&#x000a0;years)</td><td>Visit adherence, Morisky score, provider report, Pharmacy-refill</td><td>82, 84, 77, 49 respectively</td></tr><tr><td>Thornburg et al., 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</td><td>Multisite randomized controlled trial (Baby HUG)</td><td>153, 9&#x000a0;months&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;years</td><td>80&#x000a0;% of liquid medication taken by volume remaining at study visit</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Ware et al., 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</td><td>Multisite randomized controlled trial (HUG-KIDS)</td><td>53, 5&#x02013;15 years</td><td>Pill count</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>Kinney et al., 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</td><td>Multisite randomized controlled trial (HUG-KIDS)</td><td>84, 5&#x02013;15 y ears</td><td>Pill count</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Candrilli et al., (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</td><td>Retrospective insurance claims</td><td>312, mean age 21&#x000a0;years</td><td>Medication possession ratio</td><td>35</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>Directly observed therapy (DOT) has been shown to improve adherence in multiple clinical trials in diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. DOT is more than supervised pill swallowing; it is also a means to provide support and education. Universal DOT for tuberculosis is reported to be associated with a decrease in the acquisition and transmission of resistant tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. DOT for HIV had shown to have a significant effect on virology, immunologic, and adherence outcomes, although its efficacy was not supported when restricting analysis to randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. DOT for HIV shows greatest treatment effect when targeting individuals with greater risk of non-adherence and when delivering the intervention that maximizes participant convenience and provides enhanced adherence support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some recent meta analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of DOT in TB and HIV suggesting that there is a greater need for randomized clinical trials of these approaches.</p><p>The use of videophone technology may be a cost-effective alternative to in-home directly observed administration of medications, particularly when long term or life-long therapy are needed, as in the case of HU in SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Creary et al., 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. reported that electronic DOT is feasible and acceptable and can achieve high HU adherence in a pilot pediatric study in the United States. Further studies are, however, needed to confirm if electronic DOT can improve HU adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], especially in the developing countries.</p><p>In the study presented herein, we will evaluate the level of adherence, efficacy and safety of fixed dose HU with or without mDOT in adult HbSS patients at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Tanzania.

<italic>Safety</italic>: This is monitored through clinical and laboratory assessment by determining the frequency of fever, malaria and any cytopenia (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia etc. as indicated below in the HU holding and de-escalation criteria; monitoring will be captured at week 2, 6, 10 and at the end of 3&#x000a0;months of HU.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Adherence to follow-up clinics and blood tests</title><p>A therapeutic alliance between participants and study team and this will maximize scheduled study visit attendance. Since regular blood count is critical in HU therapy, an active follow-up for patients who fail to come for blood count.

If at the 2&#x000a0;week follow up the cytopenia has resolved and the investigators deem it was due to a transient infectious illness, HU will be restarted at the dose of 15&#x000a0;mg/Kg. If at the 2-week follow-up the cytopenia has resolved and the investigators deem it was due to HU, the subject will receive HU at the de-escalation dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/Kg for the remainder of the study. If at the 2&#x000a0;week follow up there is persistent cytopenia, HU will be stopped and not resumed for the duration of the study, but the subject will continue to undergo standard monitoring, regardless of his treatment arm allocation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>HU holding/de-escalation and stopping criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>HU holding and de-escalation criteria</th><th>HU stopping criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Absolute neutrophil count &#x0003c;1500/uL</td><td>Positive urine pregnancy test</td></tr><tr><td>Platelet count &#x0003c;95,000/uL</td><td>Any cytopenia that does not resolve after holding HU for 2&#x000a0;weeks</td></tr><tr><td>Hb &#x0003c;9&#x000a0;g/dL with absolute reticulocyte count &#x0003c;95,000/uL</td><td>Request of the subject or proxy (withdrawal of consent by the subject)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Investigator&#x02019;s discretion</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Subject is lost to follow-up</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

<italic>Sample size</italic>: A sample size of 50 patients per group provided an 80&#x000a0;% power to detect an estimated proportion with HU adherence of 0.35 in the control group versus 0.65 in the treatment group, assuming a two-sided type I error rate of 5&#x000a0;% and a 15&#x000a0;% dropout rate. The 0.35 proportion of adherence to HU is based on a study done by Candrilli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: The primary outcome of this study is adherence to HU as defined as MPR &#x02265;80 at the end of 3&#x000a0;months of HU treatment. The proportions of adherence in the two arms will be compared by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. A forward, stepwise logistic-regression procedure will be then performed to adjust raw adherence difference with use of covariates that will be found to be significant predictors of outcomes. Covariates will be entered into the logistic model at a <italic>P</italic> value of &#x02264;0.10.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Sub group analysis</italic></bold>: For data analysis, the study population will be categorized into three groups: the intention-to treat (ITT), the Per-Protocol (PP) and the safety populations. These categories will be defined as follows:</p><p>
<italic>ITT</italic>: All patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 supply of HU, and will be analyzed by randomized treatment group.</p><p>
<italic>PP</italic>: All ITT patients who complete the study, receive both supplies of HU, and have no major protocol violations that will impact the efficacy assessments. PP population will be documented prior to database lock.</p><p>
<italic>Safety</italic>: All patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 supply of HU. Safety population will be analyzed by actual treatment received.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are no published data on the adherence of HU in SCA in African settings and no set gold standard to assess the adherence, effectiveness and efficiency of this therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Lanzkron et al. conducted a systematic review of HU treatment in adults with SCA and reported that there was a relative increase in HbF from 45 to 20&#x000a0;%, relative reduction in crisis by 68 to 84&#x000a0;% and hospital admissions declined by 18 to 32&#x000a0;%, however lack of long term follow-up limited the conclusion on safety and toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Ware et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Thornburg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and Kinney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] conducted randomized control trials to address HU adherence in SCA using pill counts, provider report, and pharmacy refills and found that adherence was 94, 89 and 74&#x000a0;%, respectively by the three methods. And all these studies also address a need to conduct of further studies to address adherence to medications using different age groups and approach including DOT. The use of mDOT might have cost implications and patients might only adhere well to drug during observation and go back to the usual behaviors afterwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but with the widespread availability of smartphones and internet use in developing countries like Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] this technology may have the potential to overcome some of these barriers. mDOT-HuA study might shed more light on these challenges and provide further information on the post-treatment stage of HU use among individuals with SCA living in Sub Saharan Africa.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HU</term><def><p>Hydroxyurea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mDOT</term><def><p>Mobile directly observed therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDOT-HuA</term><def><p>Mobile directly observed therapy on adherence to Hydroxyurea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNH</term><def><p>Muhimbili National Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPR</term><def><p>Medication possession</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCA</term><def><p>Sickle cell anaemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SM</term><def><p>Standard monitoring</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p>Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Muhimbili National Hospital, Muhimbili University of health and Allied Sciences and University of Pittsburgh for collaboration in putting up together the study proposal and ethical clearance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>University of Pittsburgh, United States of America, Award number 9011142 (710111-1).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data sharing not applicable to this article as the study has not yet started.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed significantly to the manuscript and meet the criteria for authorship as follows, AM, PS, EMN, MTG and JM: study concept and design and funding; AM, MN, EMN, PS, BPM, JM: drafting of the initial manuscript and critical revision of manuscript.
