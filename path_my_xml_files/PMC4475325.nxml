Two formulations have been developed (SPIRIVA&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany): tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily, a dry powder inhaler; and tiotropium Respimat&#x000ae; 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (two puffs of 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) once daily. Respimat&#x000ae; was developed to provide a more efficient drug delivery system, with increased deposition in the lung to allow for a reduced nominal dose versus Handihaler&#x000ae;, a delivered dose independent of inspiratory effort and ease of co-ordination of actuation and inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that systemic exposure is similar for tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g via HandiHaler&#x000ae; and tiotropium 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g via Respimat&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; clinical studies have also shown that the Tiotropium Respimat&#x000ae; is non-inferior to HandiHaler&#x000ae; for lung function outcomes and rescue medication use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as exacerbation risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A reduction in mortality versus placebo was observed in the Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT&#x000ae;) study, a randomised, double-blind trial in which tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; was compared with placebo in almost 6000 patients over a period of 4&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this study, for the protocol-defined study period up to Day 1440, among patients for whom vital status information was available, 921 patients died: 14.4% in the tiotropium group, 16.3% in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76&#x02013;0.99) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In line with the findings from UPLIFT&#x000ae;, other meta-analyses and data reviews have also failed to find any increases in all-cause mortality in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, safety concerns were raised when a <italic>post-hoc</italic> pooled analysis of three 1-year and one 6-month placebo-controlled trials found that tiotropium Respimat&#x000ae; 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was associated with a higher number of fatal events than placebo, although the difference was not statistically significant. The difference was particularly found in patients with cardiac rhythm disorders at randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The contribution of a rhythm disorder to the fatal outcome was uncertain and a causal relationship with tiotropium Respimat&#x000ae; has not been established. Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the same clinical dataset by different authors have also described an increase in mortality associated with Respimat&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the TIOtropium Safety and Performance In Respimat&#x000ae; (TIOSPIR&#x02122;) study found no difference in mortality with tiotropium Respimat&#x000ae; versus HandiHaler&#x000ae; with respect to the risk of death, and causes of death were similar between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The debate surrounding potential differential effects of HandiHaler&#x000ae; and Respimat&#x000ae; on mortality associated with tiotropium has led to discussion and re-evaluation of previous clinical trials in COPD to understand the validity of the findings. Most recently, the generalisability of the results of the 4-year UPLIFT&#x000ae; trial comparing tiotropium with placebo was called into question, based on potential eligibility of a hospitalised patient population with COPD in New Zealand for UPLIFT&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In their evaluation of 100 patients who were prescribed tiotropium, the authors concluded that 38% (95% CI: 28.5&#x02013;48.3) would have been ineligible for UPLIFT&#x000ae; at the time of hospital discharge due to recent cardiovascular (CV) co-morbidity or moderate to severe renal impairment. While the interpretation of the findings from this study were challenged by the authors of UPLIFT&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it was recognised that analysis of outcomes of patients experiencing cardiac events during the 4-year UPLIFT&#x000ae; study could add valuable data to the debate on the potential effects of tiotropium on CV and overall mortality. It has recently been noted that, in addition to looking at overall mortality or composite CV endpoints (such as major adverse CV events [MACE]), specific cardiac outcomes (such as myocardial infarction [MI]) should also be considered, to avoid masking a potential treatment effect on a particular type of event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Patients experiencing specific recent cardiac events before the baseline of UPLIFT&#x000ae; were excluded from participation in the trial. Therefore, to evaluate tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; safety in patients with recent cardiac events, we conducted <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses of all-cause mortality and serious cardiac adverse events (cardiac SAEs), including cardiac deaths and death unknown, in patients who experienced cardiac arrhythmia, MI or cardiac failure during the conduct of the UPLIFT&#x000ae; study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Full details of the UPLIFT&#x000ae; methodology, including patient eligibility criteria, have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>UPLIFT&#x000ae; was a 4-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving patients with moderate to very severe COPD.

Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a trend to later onset of the first cardiac failure event with tiotropium compared with placebo (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).</p><p>Mean treatment duration following the first cardiac failure was 474.3&#x000a0;days (SD: 417.6) in the placebo arm and 447.0&#x000a0;days (SD: 399.4) in the tiotropium arm. Among those administered placebo who experienced cardiac failure during the study, 60.8% subsequently experienced an SAE and 23.7% experienced a cardiac SAE. In the tiotropium arm, 58.7% of patients subsequently experienced an SAE and 28.4% experienced a cardiac SAE (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Following a cardiac failure event, vital status FAEs occurred with similar frequency in both those who had received placebo (22.0%) and those on tiotropium (21.9%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). On-treatment FAEs were experienced by 16.7% of patients in the placebo arm and 19.4% of patients in the tiotropium arm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>Evaluation of events on treatment by MACE endpoints did not suggest an increase in events with tiotropium compared with placebo (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). For patients experiencing cardiac failure, the incidence of MACE was 12.4% in the placebo arm compared with 10.3% in the tiotropium arm. Fatal MACE affected 7.0% of patients receiving placebo and 7.1% of patients treated with tiotropium; the incidence of fatal MACE, including death unknown, was 8.6% and 7.1%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The UPLIFT&#x000ae; study confirmed the CV safety of tiotropium over 4&#x000a0;years for the population included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The extensive, long-term patient data generated from the UPLIFT&#x000ae; study have allowed us to investigate retrospectively the potential impact of tiotropium versus placebo on the safety of patients experiencing the types of cardiac events during the study that would have led to exclusion at baseline. The analysis of SAEs or FAEs, including cardiac deaths and death for unknown reasons, in patients after experiencing cardiac arrhythmia, MI or cardiac failure during the conduct of UPLIFT&#x000ae; does not indicate any increase in total or cardiac SAEs or mortality with tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; treatment compared with placebo.</p><p>The findings should ameliorate the concerns raised by Walker and colleagues regarding the generalisability of the results of the UPLIFT&#x000ae; trial, based on their analysis of a hospitalised population of patients with COPD in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although patients with unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute MI or severe heart failure requiring hospitalisation were excluded from UPLIFT&#x000ae; (in line with most long-term COPD trials designed to evaluate chronic benefit to risk of pharmacotherapy), but they were not required to withdraw from the study if such an event occurred. The majority of these patients remained in the trial, even though approximately 60% had an SAE and 20% had a cardiac SAE, with similar incidences in the tiotropium and placebo arms. Through the analysis of outcomes in these patients, we are able to show that tiotropium does not increase the risk of total or cardiac SAEs or mortality compared with placebo in patients who have previously experienced serious cardiac events.</p><p>It should also be noted that the hospitalised population described by Walker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] &#x02013; in which 38% would have been ineligible for UPLIFT&#x000ae; at the time of discharge due to recent CV co-morbidity or moderate to severe renal impairment &#x02013; may not be representative of the general COPD population. In a recent epidemiological analysis from the Netherlands (mean age 68&#x000a0;years), only 2.1% of patients starting treatment with tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; had a COPD-related hospitalisation in the preceding year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, in an analysis of an elderly Canadian population (aged &#x02265;66&#x000a0;years), only 9.8% were recently hospitalised for a respiratory condition and only 1.3% of patients were hospitalised for acute coronary syndrome, including MI, during the 6&#x000a0;months preceding the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Respective percentages were 0.2% for arrhythmias and 2.2% for heart failure. These findings suggest that the incidence of the conditions excluding patients from the initial inclusion in the UPLIFT&#x000ae; study is relatively low.</p><p>This analysis has strengths and weaknesses. One obvious weakness is that it is a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis with no hypothesis testing. However, the data from this analysis do not suggest a safety issue in patients with the respective cardiac conditions. Furthermore, a minority of patients dropped out due to the first cardiac event. In general, there was a trend towards fewer patients dropping out in the tiotropium group, limiting potential bias in favour of tiotropium. Strengths of the analysis are that it is derived from a randomised, double-blind study, which reduces the probability of bias in epidemiological analyses where effects arising from prognostic differences among patient groups are a major concern. Finally, the long, 4-year duration of UPLIFT&#x000ae; offered a unique opportunity to investigate the safety of tiotropium in patients with acute major cardiac events who remained in the study.</p><p>From this <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis of the UPLIFT&#x000ae; trial data, we conclude that tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; does not increase the risk of cardiac deaths, deaths unknown or other cardiac SAEs, following the occurrence of a cardiac event. The findings add to the body of data supporting the use of tiotropium HandiHaler&#x000ae; in patients with COPD, irrespective of pre-existing cardiac conditions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12931_2015_216_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
