Despite evidence that suggests that APAP works through multiple mechanisms in the central nervous system [<xref rid="pnx157-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the exact effects of this medication on neurologic activity in patients with OA are not yet characterized. Neuro-imaging measures showing the relationship between pain reduction in OA and changes in functional activities in the human brain may help elucidate the mechanism of action of APAP. Currently used self-reported pain measurements&#x02014;such as a visual analog scale, numerical rating scale (NRS), and pain relief score&#x02014;are subjective measurements that provide little understanding of the neurophysiologic processes underlying the pain associated with OA and therefore offer limited options for evaluating therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="pnx157-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps functional activity in the brain by indirect evaluation of changes in blood flow and oxygen levels in the capillary beds. Several fMRI neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different patterns of brain activity occur in acute and chronic pain [<xref rid="pnx157-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Acute pain has been shown to activate brain regions associated with nociceptive pain pathways, including the thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex [<xref rid="pnx157-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref>]. In clinical studies in patients with OA, painful mechanical stimulation of the affected knee joint has been associated with blood oxygen level&#x02013;dependent (BOLD) responses measured by fMRI in the brain regions commonly involved in acute pain [<xref rid="pnx157-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In pharmacologic investigations in healthy volunteers, analgesics such as ibuprofen-arginine, remifentanil, nalbuphine, naloxone, and naproxen have shown greater fMRI BOLD responses in pain-related brain regions compared with placebo [<xref rid="pnx157-B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref>]. One fMRI study in healthy volunteers receiving painful stimulation showed that APAP treatment was associated with reduced activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortices compared with placebo [<xref rid="pnx157-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. fMRI studies have also evaluated the placebo effect, showing that placebo can change brain activity in the thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex in healthy volunteers [<xref rid="pnx157-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These observations provide evidence that placebo alters the experience of pain through a different mechanism of action compared with active analgesics.</p><p>The present study aimed to correlate the efficacy of pain reduction with the intensity, location, and pattern of changes in BOLD signal in different regions of the brain using fMRI in response to noxious stimulation of the painful knee joint in subjects with OA after treatment with eight-hour extended-release (ER) APAP compared with placebo and no treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>Eligible subjects were men and women age 45&#x02009;years and older with a body mass index (BMI) of 17 to 35&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a diagnosis of OA based on radiologic and clinical findings as defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria affecting one or more knees for three or more months; if both knees were affected, the symptoms were required to be significantly worse in one knee. Exclusion criteria included women of childbearing potential or who were breastfeeding or any patient with a secondary cause of arthritis of the knee, lower extremity surgery (including arthroscopy) within six months before screening, prior injury to the index knee within 12&#x02009;months before screening, disease of the spine, contraindication to MRI, history of asthma, and smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day.</p><p>The safety population included all subjects who received at least one dose of a treatment. The intent-to-treat population included all subjects who received at least one dose of a treatment and had at least one postbaseline efficacy assessment, and the per-protocol population included all subjects who fully complied with all study procedures.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain). It was conducted in accordance with requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier: NCT01105936). All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind (for study drug and placebo), three-way crossover, phase IV study. After a screening visit, eligible subjects entered a washout period for OA pain medications for seven or more days (or five times the half-life, whichever was longer) before the first assessment and for the duration of the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to each of three study periods according to a randomization schedule generated by GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (Parsippany, NJ, USA) using SAS (v. 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA): a period of treatment with four consecutive doses of 1,330&#x02009;mg (2 &#x000d7; 665-mg caplets) ER-APAP (Panadol Extend; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, Warren, NJ, USA), another period of treatment with four consecutive doses of two caplets each of matched placebo, and another period during which no treatment was administered; the no-treatment period was given as the first or second study period only. Each treatment period was separated by a five- to 14-day washout period.</p><p>Subjects took the first of four doses of study medication under supervision at the clinic between 13:00 and 16:00&#x02009;hours at the beginning of each period. They self-administered the second and third doses of study medication away from the clinic eight and 16&#x02009;hours after the first dose and were given the fourth dose of study medication under supervision at the clinic approximately 24&#x02009;hours after the first dose. Subjects underwent fMRI no earlier than two hours and no later than five hours after taking the fourth dose of ER-APAP or placebo and at the end of the no-treatment period. While lying down within the MRI scanner (Achieva 3.0T; Philips Healthcare Imaging Systems, Andover, MA, USA), subjects underwent pressure stimulation tests manipulating the patellofemoral joint of the index knee. Pressure was exerted using a pneumatic hose on the kneecap with the knee in an extended position. The exerted pressure was increased until the subject rated the pain in the range of 5 to 8 on an 11-point verbal rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = extreme pain). The stimulus intensity used during the fMRI was established as the pressure that produced pain in the range of 5 to 8 when continuously applied over a period of 10&#x02009;seconds. The stimulus intensity was determined at the beginning of the session and was applied while the subject was in the scanner. A new stimulus intensity measurement was determined for each study session. Therefore, during fMRI assessment, the stimulus intensity applied reflected each subject&#x02019;s sensitivity to painful pressure in a basal situation before dosing.</p><p>Subjects rated their pain three times: before entering the scanner (prescan), after stimulation but before undergoing fMRI, and after fMRI (postscan). Functional MRI sequences consisted of gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (time of repetition [TR] 2,000&#x02009;ms; time of echo [TE] 35&#x02009;ms; pulse angle 90&#x000b0;) within a field of view of 24&#x02009;cm, with a 64 &#x000d7; 64-pixel matrix and a slice thickness of 4&#x02009;mm (interslice gap = 1&#x02013;1.5&#x02009;mm). Twenty-two to 24 interleaved slices, parallel to the anterior&#x02013;posterior commissure line, were acquired to cover the whole brain. The pain functional time series consisted of 180 consecutive image sets obtained over six minutes and 30&#x02009;seconds. Acquisitions were preceded by four dummy images, allowing the pain MRI signal to reach equilibrium. The block paradigm was characterized by alternating 11 baseline periods of 20&#x02009;seconds (plus a final baseline period of 30&#x02009;seconds) and 11 painful stimulation periods of 10&#x02009;seconds. Anatomical MRI examinations were also acquired for each individual, including a 22-slice two-dimensional inversion&#x02013;recovery sequence (TR 2,614&#x02009;ms; TE 22.8&#x02009;ms; inversion time 750&#x02009;ms) matching the functional acquisition and a three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient inversion&#x02013;recuperation prepared sequence with 130 contiguous slices (TR 11.8&#x02009;ms; TE 4.2&#x02009;ms; flip angle 15&#x000b0;; field of view 30&#x02009;cm; acquisition matrix 256 &#x000d7; 256 pixels; slice thickness 1.2&#x02009;mm). Subjects continued in the study until they completed the randomized treatment sequence, with a minimum of five days and a maximum of 14 days between periods. Within seven to 14 days of a subject completing the third study treatment, the investigator or a designee followed up with the subject to perform safety assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy Assessments and Measures</title><p>Subjects were evaluated for 1) treatment effect on pain intensity before pressure stimulation of the knee, 2) treatment effect on pain intensity after stimulation of the knee prescan and postscan, and 3) BOLD signal activation assessed by fMRI after treatment and stimulation of the knee. Pain intensity was measured using the 11-point NRS (ranging from 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain to 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;extreme pain or pain as bad as you can imagine).</p><p>Treatment effect before stimulation was measured as the difference in pain intensity before and after treatment within each period. Treatment comparisons for this effect were based on the differences of changes in pain intensity before and after treatment between the three treatment arms. Treatment effect after stimulation was measured as the difference between pain intensity before treatment, after stimulation, and pain intensity after treatment, after stimulation. Assessment of pain intensity after treatment, after stimulation, was performed before and after MRI scan.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety was assessed based on adverse events (AEs) reported by all subjects after treatment with study medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study as there were no existing data on BOLD response to stimuli in OA patients treated with ER-APAP. A sample size of 25 to 30 subjects was chosen based on a similar GlaxoSmithKline pain study using fMRI and was considered large enough to capture the effect of ER-APAP compared with placebo and no treatment.</p><p>Imaging data for the BOLD responses were processed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM5; The Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) run in MATLAB v. 7.0 (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) on a Microsoft Windows platform. Image preprocessing involved motion correction, spatial normalization, and smoothing using a Gaussian filter (full width, half-maximum, 8&#x02009;mm). Data were normalized to the standard SPM5&#x02013;echo planar imaging template and resliced to 2&#x02009;mm isotropic resolution in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. A repeated-measures paired one-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test (SPM model) was used for each cluster comparing any two treatments across the cohort of 25 subjects. A voxel threshold of a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.01 and a cluster-extent-based threshold of 50 or more contiguous voxels were used as criteria to consider a cluster significant. Although a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.01 represents a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold, this threshold was chosen in order to increase the sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. This was particularly important for this proof-of-principle study with a relatively small sample size and an expected relatively low power. On the other hand, cluster-extent-based thresholding of 50 or more contiguous voxels contributes to multiple comparisons correction [<xref rid="pnx157-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only treatment comparisons with a display threshold at a voxel <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.01 are presented.</p><p>Treatment effect on pain (change in pain intensity: pretreatment &#x02013; post-treatment), treatment effect on pressure stimulation before fMRI scan (change in pain intensity: pretreatment after stimulation &#x02013; post-treatment after stimulation before MRI scan), and treatment effect on pressure stimulation after MRI scan (change in pain intensity: pretreatment after stimulation &#x02013; post-treatment after stimulation after fMRI scan) were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in a mixed effects model, with treatment as a fixed effect and subjects as a random effect. Period and baseline pain intensity (NRS score at prescreening) were used as covariates. A <italic>t</italic> test (H<sub>0</sub>: least squares [LS] mean change&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) was performed for the mean change from baseline of pain intensity calculated across subjects within each treatment to determine if the effect of treatment was significant compared with baseline (pretreatment). Differences between treatment effects (changes in pain intensity before and after treatment or changes in pain intensity pretreatment after stimulation with post-treatment after stimulation) were compared by multiple comparisons in Proc Mixed (SAS v. 9.2) at a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05. All subjects who received treatment were included in the analysis and reporting of safety data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 33 subjects were screened and 31 were randomized, of which 30 were included in the safety population and 25 were evaluable and complied with all study procedures.

Six of the AEs observed were mild, and two were moderate in intensity (i.e., dental caries and bone pain). None of the AEs observed were related to treatment.

The results also demonstrate that ER-APAP had a significant effect in reducing pain from mechanical stimulation in the knee joint that was expressed more clearly before than after the MRI scan. There was a significant correlation between specific brain activity patterns and the efficacy of pain reduction. The effect of ER-APAP in reducing pain caused by mechanical stimulation was greater than that of placebo and no treatment, and that correlated with the reduction of the BOLD signal from fMRI in brain regions of pain pathways, such as the supramarginal gyrus and sensory cortex. The sensory cortex is the highest sensory center in the nociceptive pain pathways; therefore, the reduction of BOLD signal activation by ER-APAP in this region was not unexpected. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between changes in neurologic activity and APAP treatment in the supramarginal gyrus in patients with OA knee pain. The supramarginal gyrus is not only the part of the somatosensory association cortex involved in the perception and processing of speech and language [<xref rid="pnx157-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but it has also been shown to be involved in the prediction and perception of physical pain [<xref rid="pnx157-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It also interprets certain sensory data and is involved in the perception of space and limb location [<xref rid="pnx157-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the inter-relationship between supramarginal gyrus activity, nociceptive pain in OA patients, and APAP treatment is not fully understood, these results may provide insight into the potential mechanism of action of APAP in efferent pain pathways. A previous study in healthy volunteers showed reduced pain-related BOLD signal activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and prefrontal cortices during APAP treatment, suggesting that the inhibitory effects on these regions of the brain may also contribute to the antinociceptive effect of APAP [<xref rid="pnx157-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>BOLD signal changes also occurred in the thalamus region. There was a significant reduction in brain activation in this region with placebo treatment compared with ER-APAP. This result was somewhat unexpected, given the known pain-relieving actions of ER-APAP and the patterns of thalamic activation in response to pain signals, as the thalamus receives signals from the spinal cord and sends the signals to the sensory cortex for interpretation [<xref rid="pnx157-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref>]. Because no reduction of the BOLD signal in the thalamus region was reported when comparing ER-APAP with no treatment, the reduction of brain activity in the thalamus region when comparing placebo with ER-APAP may be the effect of the placebo alone. Reduced thalamic activity under placebo conditions is consistent with theories hypothesizing that afferent sensory pain transmission is inhibited by placebo [<xref rid="pnx157-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous fMRI studies have shown reduced activity in the thalamus during painful stimuli under blinded placebo conditions compared with control [<xref rid="pnx157-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pnx157-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The response to placebo in pain-related regions of the brain has been shown to vary with the degree of connectivity between the thalamus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [<xref rid="pnx157-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is interesting that subjects in the current study maintained BOLD signals at certain levels in only the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus and/or ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus but not the dorsal thalamic region. The clinical meaning of this observation is not completely clear. However, because the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus lies on the pathway between the corpus striatum and the motor areas of the frontal cortex, it might influence the activities of the motor cortex. The ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus has connections similar to those of the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus, with major input from the cerebellum and minor input from the red nucleus. Its projections pass to the motor and premotor regions of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, it is very possible that placebo treatment in this study reduces more motor activities compared with ER-APAP treatment. APAP may block pain signals not only from the spinal cord through the thalamus into the sensory cortex (afferent pathway), but also from the motor cortex to the motor neurons in the spinal cord and then to peripheral tissues via the thalamus (efferent pathway). Further studies would be necessary to support this hypothesis.</p><p>In most clinical efficacy studies, subjects given a placebo treatment will have perceived an actual improvement in their medical condition, such as pain. One study demonstrated that placebo can also have a surprisingly positive effect on patients who know that the given treatment is without active drug compared with patients who did not receive treatment [<xref rid="pnx157-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The current study found that, when compared with the no-treatment arm, placebo reduced BOLD signal activation in several brain regions, including the subgenual prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, insula, and sensory cortex. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown an association of placebo treatment with activation in these and other limbic brain regions, including the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, orbitofrontal and insular cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and brainstem periaqueductal gray matter [<xref rid="pnx157-B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;37</xref>]. The perception of pain requires the integration of sensory, cognitive, and affective information. Placebo analgesia likely results partly from afferent inhibition of a nociceptive signal, in addition to interactions of an affective&#x02013;cognitive network with input from both hemispheres [<xref rid="pnx157-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. High placebo response has been linked with activity of dopaminergic and mu-opioid systems in reward and motivation centers of the brain (nucleus accumbens), while anti-analgesic nocebo response has been linked with decreased activity of these same systems. This link between the limbic system and positive analgesic placebo response may arise from descending inhibition through the periaqueductal gray matter, inhibiting spinal nociceptive reflexes [<xref rid="pnx157-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], while the expectations of anti-analgesic nocebos act in the opposite way to block this effect [<xref rid="pnx157-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results presented in this study are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>The fMRI results presented in this study are based on a cluster-defining primary threshold (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>=<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.01) that represents a liberal approach as compared with more standard thresholds of 0.005 and 0.001. Such an approach bears the risk of inflated false-positive rates and may pose large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. Eklund et al. [<xref rid="pnx157-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] demonstrated that a cluster-defining threshold with a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.001 had much better family-wise error control than a cluster-defining threshold with a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.01. However, we chose the more liberal approach in order to increase sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals, considering the fact that this study was expected to have low power due to the relatively small sample size of 18 subjects. The overall goal of this proof-of-principle study was to explore as many regions of interest as possible that subsequently could be further validated and consolidated in a larger study with adequate sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ER-APAP was effective in reducing knee pain from OA, consistent with results of previous clinical trials. The reduction in pain intensity from mechanical stimulation with ER-APAP was associated with reduced BOLD signal activation in brain regions involved in nociceptive pain pathways, specifically in the sensory cortex and supramarginal gyrus. A reduction of BOLD signal activation with placebo compared with ER-APAP was observed in certain nuclei of the thalamus. In contrast, placebo reduced BOLD signal activation in several other brain regions when compared with no treatment, including the subgenual prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, insula, and sensory cortex. Most of these brain regions are either part of the limbic system or work closely with this system for emotional, cognitive, or psychological functions, suggesting a potential mechanism of the placebo effect in the brain. This study provides further evidence that changes in BOLD signal activation measured by fMRI are associated with pain reduction and could potentially be used as an objective end point for pain clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank James Otto and Kenneth Reed of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare for assistance with preparation of the manuscript and David Stevens for his contribution to the design of the study.
