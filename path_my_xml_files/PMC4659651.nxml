For example, people experiencing diurnal negative feelings, such as anxiety, irritability, or stress, often report poor sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], insomnia [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], shorter sleep duration [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], more frequent waking [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as more Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, shorter REM sleep latency and fewer Non-REM stages 3 and 4 (NREM3) [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, individuals experiencing feelings of well-being usually report better sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, how pre-sleep emotional states modulate the structure of sleep has received far less attention (see Kim and Dimsdale [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Deliens <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for reviews). In addition, the available studies often have methodological limitations and most of them neglect pre-sleep positive emotional states. Moreover, these studies have rarely considered the nature and intensity of the stressful events, or the delay between these events and the sleep period. In fact, psychological or physical stressors could have different impacts on sleep parameters [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In order to alleviate these limitations, several authors have applied procedures designed to control the nature of the stressful event and its occurrence before sleep. For example, in order to induce a negative state at bedtime, one method used feelings of apprehension about the day following the sleep period. Such feelings were induced by telling the participant that he would be evaluated the next day [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or by worrying him about some hard work [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In these conditions, consequent changes were observed, including a longer REM sleep latency, less REM during the last part of the night, a reduction in the percentage of NREM3 and an increase in Non-REM stage 2 (NREM2) sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another procedure consisted in exposing participants to a near-impossible task in order to make them feel bad about their own intellectual capacities. Depending on the study, REM sleep proved to be affected by this kind of procedure. Thus, its percentage during the night decreased and it was interspersed with more awakenings [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or REM sleep episodes were more frequent [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], or an increase in NREM2 and REM sleep and a decrease in NREM3 sleep at the beginning of the sleep period were reported [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Though these procedures seemed effective at inducing negative emotional states, the induction remained dependent on the experimenter&#x02019;s behavior [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>As an alternative, some authors have chosen to induce emotional states with emotional movies, which keep the participant blind to the aim of the procedure, reduce the involvement of the experimenter, and enable good control of the timing and efficiency of the induction [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Watching a negative movie just prior to the sleep period leads to more NREM2 sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a reduction in the percentage of REM sleep and more awakenings [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It can also increase REM density [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or change the dream content during the earlier part of the night [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Concerning positive movies, the scarce data suggest that positive emotional states prior to sleep can improve sleep problems [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but the details of this influence remain unexplored.</p><p>In order to investigate sleep architecture further following emotional events, autonomic nervous system (ANS) indicators could be of valuable interest. In particular, the sympathetic division of the ANS is strongly associated with central activations required by the processing of cognitive and emotional information (see Kreibig [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for a review). Among autonomic indicators, electrodermal activity (EDA), related to the activity of eccrine sweat glands exclusively under sympathetic control, has proved to vary very specifically through sleep stages in humans [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and cats [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], suggesting different levels of sympathetic activation during these stages. The frequency of electrodermal responses (EDRf) is high during NREM3 sleep, very low during REM sleep, and has medium values in NREM2 and NREM1 stages. EDA is known to be particularly relevant to the study of central arousal linked to attention, novelty and especially emotion. Thus, it has been widely used as a robust marker of emotional processes in awake states (see Critchley [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and Sequeira <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] for reviews). Moreover, EDA has been associated with cognitive processes during sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, there is only very sporadic research on sleep attempting to consider electrodermal variations as potential indicators of sleep processes related to pre-sleep emotional states. In a few studies, a higher EDR frequency has been proposed as a marker of pre-sleep anxiety or stress states, during NREM3 sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or of the bizarreness of dreams during REM sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these data strongly suggest that diurnal emotions can induce changes during the following sleep period, especially during REM and NREM3 sleep stages [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although there is evidence that a pre-sleep negative emotional state affects sleep parameters, there is no consensus about the pattern of such effects. This could be due to the variety of the inducing events or stimulations. Furthermore, there are no consistent data about the impact of pre-sleep positive emotional states on the sleep course. Finally, recording sympathetic indicators of emotional processing during the sleep period could improve the characterization of the impact of diurnal emotions on sleep organization.</p><p>Accordingly, the present research has a double aim: firstly, to identify the specific effects of pre-sleep emotional states on REM and NREM3 stages of the subsequent sleep period; secondly, to relate such states to the sympathetic activation during the same sleep period. In accordance with the literature, we postulate that pre-sleep emotional states will significantly impact the sleep architecture and sympathetic activation. In order to test these hypotheses, we developed and validated emotional and non-emotional movies as controlled pre-sleep emotional stimulations. Then, their effectiveness at eliciting pre-sleep emotional states was evaluated, before a normal period of sleep during which a polysomnogram and the EDA were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Materials and Method</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>Twelve healthy right-handed adults, all males and volunteers (age: 19&#x02013;22 years; mean &#x000b1; SD: 20.1 &#x000b1; 1.0), participated in the experiment. They were recruited by advertising mail sent to a student mailing list of Ashikaga Institute of Technology (Tochigi, Japan). This study was approved by the local human ethics studies committee of Ashikaga Institute of Technology and each participant provided his written informed consent before being included.</p><p>There was one full week between the participant&#x02019;s agreement and their first night in the laboratory. During this week, and for the full experimental period, participants were asked to maintain a normal sleep schedule (bedtime between 23:00 and 01:00, and waking up between 07:00 and 09:00), and to avoid napping. Compliance with these rules was monitored with a sleep diary and an actiwatch. They were also asked to avoid psychoactive substances (like caffeine). Participants did not complain about any physical or psychological health problems, as verified, during the first night, by two questionnaires: the Japanese version of the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) and the YG Personality Inventory (YGPI). Furthermore, participants did not report any current or previous sleep or psychiatric disorder, and did not take any medication from one week before the experimentation until its end.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Material</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Experimental environment</title><p>The sleep experimentation unit has two adjoining rooms. The experimenter room contained the recording equipment, which enabled the experimental procedure to be monitored. An infrared video camera, a microphone and an intercom were used to maintain visual and vocal contact with the participant who was installed in the other room. This was isolated, quiet and shielded, containing a bed, a projection screen (2.0 m wide x 1.4 m high), and a chair placed 2.0 m in front of the screen, where the participant was comfortably seated during the presentation of emotional stimulations.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Emotional and non-emotional movies were used to induce emotional states before sleep. To this end, a specific procedure was used to select video clips with the aim of obtaining three final validated movies corresponding to negative, neutral and positive valence, respectively.</p><p>In the first step, different videos were extracted from cinematographic movies, and a database of 63 pre-selected video clips was established (29 negative, 14 neutral, and 20 positive). The duration of each video clip varied between 1 and 4 minutes.</p><p>In the second step, the emotional impact of each of the 63 pre-selected extracts (mean duration: 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 minutes) was evaluated by Japanese students, with a methodology similar to that used by Schaefer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Their valence and activation values [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] were rated, and the Japanese version of the <italic>Positive And Negative Affect Scale</italic> (PANAS) [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was completed. In fact, three sets of 21 video clips were created, each comprising 9 or 10 negative, 4 or 5 neutral and 6 or 7 positive video clips. The order of the video clips in each set was randomized, with the condition that a clip never had the same valence as the preceding one. The sum duration per set was 42.1 &#x000b1; 1.3 min. Each set was evaluated by a group of 11 to 13 students, who were not involved in the main sleep experiment. For each video clip, participants were asked to imagine themselves in the scene, as if it was real. Then, the participant evaluated his emotional state using two Self-Assessment Manikin Scales (SAM), developed by Bradley and Lang [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to score the two main dimensions of emotion; valence (from 1, negative, to 9, positive) and arousal (from 1, low, to 9, high). The evaluation was completed by the PANAS, from which two subscores could be obtained: Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA). Each clip was followed by a 5-minute break in order to complete the questionnaires and limit the persistence of the effect of the previous clip. A 15-minute break was provided every 10 video clips (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. every hour) for relaxation, during which participants were free to do as they wished.</p><p>In the third step, the video clips with the highest scores in their respective categories (negative, neutral and positive) were compiled with specific software <italic>(Premiere Pro v5</italic>.<italic>5</italic>, <italic>Adobe)</italic> to create three movies of corresponding valence. Each movie lasted 20.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 minutes, started with the least arousing clip and ended with the most arousing one. A non-lyrical soundtrack was synchronized with the movie, matching the action and the emotion to reinforce the immersion [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The neutral movie was characterized by a mean valence of 5.2 &#x000b1; 0.3, and an arousal of 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.3.

All electrodes were connected to a headbox (San Ei Electrode Box) linked to a recording system (San Ei Biotop 6512) enabling the filtering (0.5 Hz-100 Hz pass band), sampling (256 Hz) and amplification of signals, continuously processed during emotional induction and the sleep period using the software Sleep Maister 1.2 (IAC, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>Electrodermal activity was recorded using the conductance technique (constant-voltage method, 0.5 V) at a sampling rate of 256 Hz, and low-pass filtered at 50 Hz.

Particular attention was paid to the control of the emotional induction procedure. Laboratory-made movies, that proved to be efficient at inducing congruent emotional states, were delivered just prior to an undisturbed recorded sleep period. Firstly, we found that both negative and positive emotional movies led to an increase in REM sleep. With a positive induction, the increase held during the whole night, while for a negative one, it was delayed and could be found only during the second half of the sleep period. Secondly, the valence of the pre-sleep movie also impacted the sympathetic activity during NREM3 sleep; for positive induction, a decrease in the sympathetic discharge was obtained contrasting with an increase for negative induction.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Effect of pre-sleep emotional states on sleep architecture</title><p>The present data support a modulation of sleep architecture according to the diurnal emotional experience. The interest of these data is reinforced by the fact that the reference nights showed a classic distribution of stages during the nocturnal sleep period [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover, in contrast with previous studies examining the influence of diurnal emotions on sleep course, the present study used standardized stimulations covering the three emotional valence expressions. The validity of this procedure was confirmed by data showing that each emotional stimulation induced an emotional state of similar valence before bedtime. Despite a previous work reporting an increase in NREM3 sleep following negative pre-sleep emotional states [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], no variation in this parameter was found in the present study. As mentioned by Talamini <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such differential results could be explained by the high level of emotional distress of their stimulations, requiring an increase in compensatory restoring responses during the NREM3.</p><p>From a more theoretical viewpoint, the reported results are coherent with the idea of a central role of REM sleep in cross-night adaptation to emotional information (see Gruber and Cassoff [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] for a review). It is worth noting that, despite a growing interest in this topic, the impact of pre-sleep negative emotions on REM sleep remains unclear, due to contradictory data, and that the impact of positive pre-sleep emotions has been largely ignored [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The clear increase in the REM sleep rate observed here could be related to the need to process emotional saliency, whether negative or positive, as an important dimension of stimuli underlying most behavioral adaptations [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Nevertheless, this increase contradicts some previous works using negative emotional movies that report perturbations (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. waking-up) [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], altered patterning [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], or no observed changes [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] in REM sleep. Some methodological differences between those studies and the current research could contribute to explaining the reported differences, such as the kind of population used (different gender ratio, cultural differences), the procedure (night to night comparison) or the movie type (a short single extract or a full movie). In fact, Baekeland <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], Talamini <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Goodenough <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Cluydts and Visser [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used movies of very short duration, while Werner <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] used full-length movies, longer than ours. If we consider the length of the movie as an analog of the exposure time to a stressor, animal studies could shed some light on this discrepancy. It is well known that in rat, stress increases REM sleep, and this effect can be influenced by different factors, notably the duration of the stressor (see Suchecki <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] for a review). In this vein, Marinesco <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] showed that when the stressor duration was short or long, the REM sleep increase usually obtained with a medium-length exposure could be reduced. In so far as the parallel between the stressor duration in animal and the movie duration in human is acceptable, this notion of an optimum stimulus duration to provoke an increase in REM sleep could partially explain the difference between previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the present data.</p><p>In addition, our data contrast with those studies emphasizing the impact of pre-sleep stress on REM sleep in human and showing a decrease in its duration or rate during the subsequent night [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These differences must be interpreted with regard to the fact that the procedures differed in several ways. Germain <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Vandekerckhove <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] induced a negative pre-sleep state by frustrating the participant and perturbing his self-esteem, which greatly differs from the type of emotional induction applied in the present study. In this context, and again on the basis of animal studies, an explanation could be that some part of the variations in REM sleep rate is linked to the possibility of controlling the stimulus. Sanford <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] showed that when mice could not avoid a stressor, a decrease in REM sleep occurred. However, when there was a possibility of avoiding the stressor, the reverse effect was found. In both the previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as the participant had no way of changing it, the situation could mimic an uncontrollable stressor. Consistent with animal studies, these authors obtained a decrease in the REM sleep rate. By contrast, the passive exposure to an emotional movie, as carried out in our study, can hardly be assimilated to an uncontrollable stressful situation.</p><p>Another important point is that the increase in REM sleep started earlier when the participant experienced a positive pre-sleep emotional state rather than a negative one. The REM sleep rate increased in both halves of the night following the positive movie, but only in the second half after the negative movie. This suggests that an inhibitory mechanism comes into play. In an adaptive perspective, it could be speculated that such a mechanism delays the increase in REM sleep, a particularly deep stage in which body reactivity is inhibited and the wake-up threshold is higher than in other sleep stages [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In a negative context, such a mechanism would preserve temporarily the possibility of reacting to an aversive stimulus. Later, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. in the last part of the night, it would be attenuated in order to allow REM sleep increase, required for the processing of emotional information [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Considering the same framework, following a positive emotional experience, no inhibition takes place as no negative event is expected, and the REM sleep increase can start earlier in the night. The observed increase in REM sleep following positive stimulations in the present study is clearly in favor of our proposal.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Effect of pre-sleep emotional states on sympathetic activity during sleep</title><p>The present data confirm the previously described EDA variations as a function of sleep stage [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]: EDRf was maximal during NREM3 sleep, became lower during NREM2 sleep, and attained its lowest values during REM sleep. Moreover, an increase in sympathetic activity during NREM3 sleep occurred after the negative movie, and a decrease after the positive one. This result supports the hypothesis that electrodermal discharges during sleep are influenced by pre-sleep emotional states [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. McDonald <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] proposed that, under a pre-sleep stressful condition, the increase in electrodermal activity during sleep can be a byproduct of a sleep inhibitory mechanism, which fits the notion that higher vigilance corresponds to higher sympathetic activity. In fact, from an adaptive point of view, a slighter sleep during a period of environmental threat has an important survival value. Thus, the increased frequency in EDR we observed following negative emotional induction could reflect a mechanism limiting the fall in vigilance during sleep. In the same vein, a positive pre-sleep emotional context could indicate a safe sleep environment, attested by a decrease in sympathetic activity and an increase in REM sleep in the first half of the night. The fact that such EDA variations took place during NREM3 and not during REM sleep could be related to the idea that the inhibitory somatic mechanism inherent in REM sleep is extended to the autonomic system during this sleep stage [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Thus, the mediation of central variations in activation through the sympathetic channel would be restricted to NREM sleep, as observed in the current study.</p><p>Given that, in adults, NREM3 sleep mainly occurs during the first part of the night and REM sleep in the second part [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], a common mechanism could underlie the higher sympathetic activity during the NREM3 stage and the delayed increase in REM sleep, both observed after negative induction. As suggested by several studies [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] associating stress stimulations, increases in norepinephrine and EDA or REM sleep variations, the noradrenergic system could be part of such a mechanism. In fact, in animal and in human, a high level of norepinephrine can inhibit the appearance of REM sleep [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and increase electrodermal activity [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Thus, following a negative emotional experience, the central noradrenergic system could be activated in order to maintain vigilance, as shown by EDA, and to shorten the episodes of inhibited reactivity, as suggested by the decrease in the REM sleep rate. The time needed for the noradrenergic system to recover its baseline would explain the observed difference between the two halves of the night to process negative information: initially, a central activation mediated by autonomic efferences and inhibiting mechanisms of REM sleep expression, followed by a reduction in such mechanisms, thus allowing the full expression of REM sleep.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>In spite of quite clear effects of pre-sleep emotional induction on sleep and sympathetic activity during the nocturnal rest period, some methodological points related to limitations and strengths of the study should be considered. Concerning limitations, though this study includes 120 nights of sleep recording, the number of participants remains low, which limits the statistical power of the data. Moreover, we focused on the sleep of young men to avoid physiological and behavioral variations in the menstrual cycle that may modulate central activation and emotional reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Thus, the present data cannot be extended to women or an older population. Though the diurnal activities of the participants were not fully controlled, particular attention was paid to this point, mainly through the analysis of the actiwatch and questionnaire measures, which did not reveal major specific or individual variations.</p><p>In contrast, and compared to most studies devoted to emotion-sleep interactions, the present research involved some advantageous methodological aspects. Firstly, unlike many other studies in the field of emotion, none of our participants was following a psychological cursus, which reinforces the value of the data obtained in so far as participants remained blind to the aims of the study. Secondly, in order to induce a particular emotional state, for the first time to our knowledge, three different movies, corresponding to negative, positive and neutral valence, were presented and validated as pre-sleep emotional stimulations. Though frustration or induced stress [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] offers the advantage of being more ecological or realistic in some respects, a movie-based procedure strongly limits experimenter-participant interaction and, hence, appears more reliable [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we also obtained robust results confirming that each valence induced the emotional congruent effect before the sleep period. Thirdly, the systematic recording of Ref nights enabled us to explore the potential persistence or recovery of induced emotional effects beyond Exp nights. In spite of the fact that the present results did not reveal any persistence, this methodological point could open interesting perspectives related to pathology, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. the persistence of highly arousing emotional experiences in the establishment of post-traumatic stress disorder [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Finally, in the same vein as two previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the present data analysis supported the idea that sleep is a dynamic process with differential implications for emotional processing in the first and second halves of the sleep period. Accordingly, these results confirm this orientation and could help to highlight the processes of emotion-sleep relationships in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data reported here support the role of diurnal emotional experiences in the REM sleep course and, for the first time with this type of induction, highlight the impact of a pre-sleep positive emotional state. The results also confirm that nocturnal sympathetic activity is modulated by pre-sleep emotional states. To explain these effects, we hypothesized two mechanisms. The first, related to emotional arousal, would increase REM sleep, likely to facilitate the processing of emotional experience and prepare the individual for potential emotional challenges taking place in the future. The second, related to emotional valence, would be temporarily activated in the case of a negative emotional experience, together with an activation of the sympathetic system, and would lead to a delayed REM sleep. Its function would be to adjust, during the first part of the night, the level of vigilance to potential threats from the environment, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. to preserve body reactivity and optimize adaptation. We can also suppose that the reported REM sleep changes could aim to modulate the post-sleep emotional reactivity during the following day. Thus, the impact of pre-sleep emotional states on post-sleep emotional reactivity could be a heuristic challenge in future studies.</p><p>Finally, according to our results, a negative pre-sleep emotional state could lead to an increase in sympathetic activity during the following sleep period and this increase is related to changes in the sleep course. These observations could help to understand sleep disturbances, such as secondary comorbid insomnia, which can occur notably in mental disorders, like anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The disturbances in these pathologies are thought to be linked to a difficulty in disengaging emotional and body arousal, which disrupts the initiation and course of sleep (see Baglioni <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] for a review). Accordingly, Kahn <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] suggested that there could be an interplay between concomitant emotional arousal and sleep problems, which maintain each other, creating a &#x0201c;vicious circle&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0142721.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142721.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In a complementary way, we also reported a decrease in sympathetic activity, induced by pre-sleep positive emotional states, during the early part of the night; this reveals the decrease in the arousal level and thus the possibility of breaking the hypothesized circle. In this way, modulating the arousal during the early sleep course by using pre-sleep positive stimulations could lead to adjusting sleep patterns impacted by diurnal emotions. Although only healthy participants were involved here, the present study opens new avenues for potential practices designed to alleviate sleep disturbances.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Hiroaki Arakawa for assisting in the experiment, and Carol Robins for revising English language.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0142721.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
