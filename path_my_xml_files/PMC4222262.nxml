Biological markers of nutrition (albumin, prealbumin) will be followed monthly and all patients will be assessed for body composition, walk function, muscle strength, postural stability and quality of life at baseline and during the eighth week (t<sub>+2</sub>), the sixteenth week (t<sub>+4</sub>) and the twenty-fourth week (t<sub>+6</sub>) of the 6-month adapted rehabilitation program.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The successful completion of this current trial may give precious clues in understanding PEW and encourage nephrologists to extend prescription of exercise programs as well as therapeutic and as preventive interventions in this high-risk population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The protocol for this study was registered with the France Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01813851?term=NCT01813851&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01813851</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>Protein-energy wasting</kwd><kwd>Nutritional supplementation</kwd><kwd>Intradialytic physical activity</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nowadays, more than two million people are treated worldwide by dialysis for end-stage renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Despite significant progress in dialysis techniques and in the treatment of associated comorbidities, hemodialysis (HD) patients experience an impairment of their quality of life and have a much higher risk of mortality compared to an age-matched population. A sedentary lifestyle and an altered nutritional status have been identified as major risk factors for adverse outcomes in dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Dialysis patients have decreased physical functioning (assessed by peak oxygen consumption (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2369-14-259-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>max</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), physical performance tests, and self-reported functioning), diminished muscle mass and altered muscle quality, and all of these features are associated with an increased mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These disturbances are directly related to renal failure and comorbidities, and also to adverse effects from medical treatments and from the dialysis itself. Dialysis induces notable metabolic changes: hypovolemia due to ultrafiltration, and rapid changes in electrolyte concentrations and systemic inflammation, which can all adversely affect physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, dialysis imposes immobilization over 12&#x02013;18 hours a week, thereby directly contributing to sedentary behavior that can further worsen the medical condition of HD patients. This vicious circle can finally lead to the development of disability, loss of independence, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For all these reasons dialysis patients have low levels of daily physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, it seems rational to promote programs for exercise training in this population.</p><p>In this vein, a large amount of literature published in the past 30 years has documented a myriad of potential benefits from exercise. Several include: increased maximal oxygen uptake capacity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M2" name="1471-2369-14-259-i2" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">&#x002d9;</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>max</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), improved blood-pressure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], decreased arterial stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], decreased systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], improved solute removal by dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], increased muscle mass, quality and force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and favorable psychological adaptations (e.g., higher perceived quality of life) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus there is a large body of evidence that the impact of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be &#x02013; for at least a significant part - counteracted by exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Along with this altered overall physical functioning, malnutrition is highly prevalent in the ESRD population, and is well-documented to be a strong predictor of mortality. Significant evidence comes from the data of large observational trials (USRDS, DOPPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) showing that malnourished dialysis patients have an increased risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this context, the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) has recommended the term &#x0201c;protein&#x02013;energy wasting&#x0201d; (PEW) to describe the loss of body protein mass and fuel reserves and have defined the diagnostic criteria for this state (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>ISRNM criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PEW in maintenance dialysis patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th colspan="2" align="left"><bold>Criteria*</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Serum chemistry:</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serum albumin &#x0003c; 3.8&#x02009;g per 100 ml<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serum prealbumin &#x0003c; 30 mg per 100 ml<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Serum cholesterol &#x0003c; 100&#x02009;mg per 100 ml<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Body mass:</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BMI &#x0003c; 23<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Unintentional weight loss over time: 5% over 3 months or 10% over 6 months<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total body fat percentage &#x0003c; 10%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Muscle mass:</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Muscle wasting: reduced muscle mass 5% over 3 months or 10% over 6 months<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Reduced mid-arm muscle circumference area (reduction &#x0003e; 10% in relation to 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of reference population)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Creatinine appearance<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Dietary intake:</italic><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Unintentional low dietary protein intake &#x0003c;0.80 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day-1 for at least 2 months<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">Unintentional low dietary energy intake &#x0003c;25 kcal.kg<sup>-1</sup>.day-1 for at least 2 months</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*At least three out of the four listed categories (and at least one test in each of the selected category) must be satisfied for the diagnosis of kidney disease related PEW.

However, to the best of our knowledge, until now no report exists about the prevalence and clinical outcomes of PEW (as defined by the ISRNM). It can be noted, however, that a large observational French study reported that 36% of HD patients had a prealbumine &#x0003c; 300 mg/dl, 20% had albumin &#x0003c; 35 g/l and 62% a diminished lean body mass (LBM) &#x0003c; 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms causing PEW are complex and multifactorial: low nutrient intake (sometimes due to dietary restriction), loss of nutrients into dialysate, abnormalities that stimulate protein degradation and/or decrease protein synthesis. On this last point, we can include the production of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative and carbonyl stress, endocrine disorders (hyperparathyroidism, hypogonadism, diabetes, decreased insuline/insuline like growth factor (IGF) signaling), acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, and anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further, low daily physical activity causes the loss of muscle mass and force and thereby directly contributes to worsen PEW. Traditional management of PEW according to international guidelines (coming from the EBPG working group on nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) consists of dietary counseling, oral nutritional supplements, enteral feeding, and in severe cases, the use of intradialytic or total parenteral nutrition. Several studies, however, have shown that these interventions are not always able to correct PEW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Simultaneously, considerable literature has pointed out the anabolic effects of physical activity. For example, both strength and endurance exercise induce transcriptional changes in genes (IGF, myostatin) favoring anabolic muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Morevover, histologic and computed tomography studies have clearly demonstrated a decrease in muscle atrophy and an improvement of the overall muscular structure and quality (increased proportion of type II, oxydative fibers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There is also some evidence that intradialytic exercise, combined with oral or parenteral nutrition, enhances amino acid uptake and protein accretion in the muscles of HD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Strong arguments exist for programming the adapted exercise training during the dialysis session rather than on non dialysis days, as there is better adherence by patients who feel safer doing exercise under medical monitoring, as a the counteraction to the inactivity due to the dialysis session, and due to a greater removal of uremic toxins (as shown for urea (KT/V) and phosphorous) by improved tissue mobilization. In addition, according to the large amount of published clinical trials, the risks of prescribing exercise even in this frail population are limited and the benefits largely prevail. Musculoskeletal injuries and cardio-vascular events are the most common risks of physical exercise. Both types of adverse events occur more frequently with high-intensity exercise than with submaximal exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this present trial, patients will be advised to exercise at a moderate level of perceived exertion and will be under continuous supervision by medical personnel. It should also be mentioned that European guidelines on nutrition in HD patients explicitly recommends regular physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In sum, there are strong arguments in the literature to prescribe exercise in HD combined with nutritional interventions in patients suffering from PEW in an attempt to enhance the anabolic effects of nutrition and hereby reverse this high-risk state.</p><sec><title>Specific aims</title><p>The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to analyze the impact of a progressive intra-dialytic exercise program combined with nutritional support following current guidelines on nutritional parameters defined for PEW and its potential to reverse PEW. In addition, this trial will study the effect of intradialytic exercise on functional performance (walking, postural control, and muscular strength), body composition and health-related quality of life in HD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial.

The exercise will be prescribed during the first two hours of dialysis session using an adapted cycle ergometer (&#x000ab; Reck moto-med letto &#x000bb;) that allows cycling in a supine position at different resistance levels. The cycle ergometer displays the number of revolutions per minute, the power developed and the distance virtually traveled. For the patient, these types of visual feedback are motivational factors that are recognized in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Further, it should be noted that this cycle ergometer also allows for passive motorized pedaling (i.e., the patient can pedal without effort).</p><p>The aim of this 6-month individualized program is to reach a 30 min duration of continuous cycling at a moderate exercise intensity, which corresponds to the level &#x0201c;3 &#x02013; moderate&#x0201d; on the Borg Rating Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (graduated from 0 to 10, where 0 = no effort at all, and 10 = most extreme effort imaginable). According to recommendations issued from a large scale meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the exercise will be initially performed at this intensity exercise perceived as moderate by the patient on the RPE scale (i.e., level 3). We deliberately chose this method based on the patient&#x02019;s rating perceptions rather than a method based on the heart rate assessment because many dialysis patients have automatic impairment or drug treatments that can interfere with the heart rate control. This method is readily accessible, reproducible and easy to use. Several exercise training intensity levels at 50% to 85% of the maximal oxygen consumption correspond consistently to ratings of 3&#x02013;7 levels on the Borg RPE scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>To estimate the targeted moderate exercise intensity, an exercise protocol with an increasing intensity on the cycle ergometer will be performed at the inclusion, before the rehabilitation program. During this first evaluation, after a warm-up of 5 minutes without resistance, the patient will pedal with a self-selected chosen cadence against an increasing resistance imposed by the cycle ergometer, until the patient reaches a level perceived as moderate, namely level 3 on the Borg RPE scale. A similar monthly assessment will be realized to update the intensity of cycling exercise. During these sessions, the patient will be regularly asked about level of shortness of breath, any feelings of fatigue and pain, with a visual analogue scale (0&#x02013;10 cm), in order to reduce the exercise intensity if necessary.</p><p>During a dialysis session, the cycling exercise will be performed in the first half of the session. After a 5 min warm-up without resistance, the patient will gradually reach the intensity corresponding to level 3 on the Borg RPE scale. Then the patient will be instructed to maintain this cycling exercise intensity for at least 10 minutes during the first month, 15 minutes during the second one, 20 minutes for the two next months in order to achieve the targeted exercise duration of 30 minutes in the two last months. The first target is to observe an evolution of their functional capacity/performance over time. Finally, a period of active recovery (pedaling without resistance) followed by a period of passive pedaling recovery will end the exercise session. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at the beginning and the end of the exercise session. Heart rate will be maintained below 70% of maximum heart rate during the cycling exercise. At the end of the dialysis session, the HD patient will be asked to estimate pain level, boredom level and mood as perceived during the session, with a visual analogue scale graduated from 0 to 10. Nephrologists, nurses, and a specialist in adapted physical activities will monitor the patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Similarly, at the end of each dialysis session, the &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; patient will be asked to estimate his pain level, boredom level and mood perceived during the session, with a visual analogue scale graduated from 0 to 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>All the measures listed below will be assessed at the baseline t<sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, and during the eighth week (t<sub>+2</sub>), the sixteenth week (t<sub>+4</sub>) and the twenty-fourth week (t<sub>+6</sub>) of the 6-month adapted rehabilitation program.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome of this study is the number of patients who are no longer in a state of protein energy wasting after 6 months of exercise training compared to the control group.

Serum albumine is measured by the bromcresol green method (normal range (38&#x02013;52 g/l), serum prealbumine is measured by the immune-turbidimetric method (normal range 300&#x02013;400 mg/l).</p></sec><sec><title>Body composition</title><p>Body-composition (overhydration, lean tissue index (LTI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and fat tissue index (FTI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) will be measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy using a Body Composition Monitor (BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) at month 2, 4 and 6 just before the midweek dialysis session.</p></sec><sec><title>Walk function</title><p>The walk function assessment will be performed using a 6 min-walk-test (6MWT). This test has been considered to be an appropriate test to assess a patient&#x02019;s functional and physiological response and cardiovascular fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

This SF-36 is a generic multidimensional instrument consisting of eight multi-item scales representing: (1) physical functioning (extent to which health limits physical activities, such as self-care, walking, and climbing stairs), (2) social functioning (extent to which physical health or emotional problems interfere with normal social activities), (3) role-functioning physical (extent to which physical health interferes with work or other dally activities), (4) role-functioning emotional (extent to which emotional problems interfere with work or other daily activities), (5) mental health (general mental health, including depression, anxiety, behavioral and emotional control, and general positive effect), (6) vitality (feeling energetic and full of pep rather than tired and worn out), (7) bodily pain (intensity of pain and effect of pain on normal work, both inside and outside the home), and (8) general health perceptions (personal evaluations of current health, health outlook, and resistance to illness).</p></sec><sec><title>Postural stability</title><p>Balance during a quiet stance will be tested after a rest period before the dialysis session. The postural test will consist of two conditions of quiet stance: stance on a firm surface with eyes open (EO) and stance on a firm surface with eyes closed (EC). Participants will stand quietly while barefoot, with the head in a straight-ahead position, their arms along the body. During conditions with eyes open, they will be instructed to look at a black spot (with a diameter 2 cm diameter) placed on a white wall in the front of them at a 2 m distance. For each condition, two trials will be performed. The duration of each trial will be 60 s followed by a rest period of 1 minute. During thee condition with EO, the subject&#x02019;s eyes will focus on a stationary eye-level visual target (a black spot with a 2 cm diameter) situated at a 2 m distance. For all data collection of postural sway, we will use a Kistler force plateform (model 9286BA) with subject weight normalization. Data will be sampled at 100 Hz and recorded online. The body sway will be quantified by displacement of the center of foot pressure (COP) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and in the medial-lateral direction (ML). For measuring all of the COP parameters, raw data will be filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth, zero-phase low-pass at 10 Hz. The COP parameters will then be the mean and standard deviation (SD) of COP position in AP and ML directions, SD of velocity in AP and ML directions, mean velocity and area (90% confidence ellipse) (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] for details of formulas).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated considering the number of patients who are no longer in a state of protein energy wasting after 6 months of exercise training compared to the control group. For a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power, it was estimated that 22 participants would be required in each group.</p><p>Results will be expressed as minimum to maximum or percentage of change, as applicable, and mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. To test the effects of Group (Exercise <italic>versus</italic> Control) on all outcome measures, univariate two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with the Group (&#x000d7;2) as between-subjects factor and Time (t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>+2</sub>, t<sub>+4</sub> and t<sub>+6</sub>) as the within subject factor, will be carried out for each aforesaid dependent variable. For each analysis, the level of significance was p &#x0003c; 0.05. Newman-Keuls comparisons will be used for post-hoc tests following significant effects. If the sphericity assumption in ANOVA is violated (Mauchly&#x02019;s test), corrected tests of significance will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In that case, the paired t-tests with corrected alpha level will be used as post-hoc comparisons. All the statistical analyses will be conducted using a SPSS software package.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first trial investigating the impact of intradialytic exercise combined with an individualized nutritional support on protein energy wasting. It is also the first trial to investigate the influence of exercise on postural balance, which is of special interest for fundamental and clinical purposes (i.e., the important issue of physical condition in dialysis patients). An improved postural balance signifies a decreased incidence of falls and fractures in this high-risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The main forces of this trial will be the randomized design and the individualized management of &#x0201c;real life&#x0201d; patients suffering from PEW. It can be argued that the nutritional support will not be the same in all patients as some will have only nutritional counseling and others ONC and a few IDPN. However, according to the literature the different nutrition methods have equivalent efficacy and the prescription of the type of nutritional support will follow actual guidelines. If this current clinical trial can highlight the expected effects of exercise to reverse PEW, at least for a part, it would be a strong argument for implementing an exercise program in this high-risk population and even in the whole dialysis population in order to prevent the occurrence of PEW.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Authors declare that there is no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>DH has conceived and designed the research protocol, DH and AP contributed in patients&#x02019; inclusion&#x02013;exclusion criteria and submission of the protocol to the ethics committee, while JM and TD have suggested important aspects for exercise protocol, functional measures and quality of life.
