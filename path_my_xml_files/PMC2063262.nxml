We studied the efficacy and safety of intravenous ibandronate (a new, potent bisphosphonate) in a multicentre study of 147 patients with severe cancer-associated hypercalcaemia which had been resistant to treatment with rehydration alone. Of 131 randomized patients who were eligible for evaluation, 45 were allocated to receive 2 mg ibandronate, 44 patients to receive 4 mg and 42 patients to receive 6 mg. Serum calcium values fell progressively in each group from day 2, reaching a nadir at day 5, and in some patients normocalcaemia was maintained for up to 36 days after treatment. The 2-mg dose was significantly less effective than the 4-mg or 6-mg dose in correcting hypercalcaemia, as the number of patients who achieved serum calcium values below 2.7 mM after treatment was 50% in the 2-mg group compared with 75.6% in the 4-mg group and 77.4% in the 6-mg group (P &#x0003c; 0.05; 2 mg vs others). In a logistic regression analysis, three factors were found to predict response; ibandronate dose (higher doses were more effective), severity of presenting hypercalcaemia (severe hypercalcaemia was associated with less complete response) and tumour type (patients with breast carcinoma and haematological tumours responded better than those with other tumours). Ibandronate was generally well tolerated and no serious drug-related adverse events were observed. We conclude that ibandronate is a safe, well tolerated and effective treatment for cancer-associated hypercalcaemia, which should prove a useful addition to the current range of therapies available to treat this condition.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="295" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="296" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="297" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="298" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="299" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00179-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="300" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
