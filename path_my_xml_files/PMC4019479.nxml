The study&#x02019;s primary objective was to determine whether abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir (ABC/3TC+ATV) was virologically non-inferior to tenofovir/emtricitabine + atazanavir/ritonavir (TDF/FTC+ATV/r) over 24 weeks in a population of virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study enrolled antiretroviral experienced, HIV-infected adults currently receiving a regimen of TDF/FTC+ATV/r for &#x02265;6 months with no history of virologic failure and whose HIV-1 RNA had been &#x02264;75 copies/mL on 2 consecutive measurements including screening. Patients were randomized 1&#x02236;2 to continue current treatment or simplify to ABC/3TC+ATV.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL at Week 24 by the Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm. Secondary endpoints included alternative measures of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and fasting lipids. Exploratory endpoints included inflammatory, coagulation, bone, and renal biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 24 weeks, ABC/3TC+ATV (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;199) was non-inferior to TDF/FTC+ATV/r (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;97) by both the primary analysis (87% in both groups) and all secondary efficacy analyses. Rates of grade 2&#x02013;4 AEs were similar between the two groups (40% vs 37%, respectively), but an excess of hyperbilirubinemia made the rate of grade 3&#x02013;4 laboratory abnormalities higher in the TDF/FTC+ATV/r group (30%) compared with the ABC/3TC+ATV group (13%). Lipid levels were stable except for HDL cholesterol, which increased significantly in the ABC/3TC+ATV group. Bone and renal biomarkers improved significantly between baseline and Week 24 in patients taking ABC/3TC+ATV, and the difference between groups was significant at Week 24. No significant changes occurred in any inflammatory or coagulation biomarker within or between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>After 24 weeks, simplification to ABC/3TC+ATV from TDF/FTC+ATV/r maintained viral suppression was well-tolerated, and led to improvements in bone and renal biomarkers and HDL cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01102972">NCT01102972</ext-link>

The main inclusion criteria included a requirement that enrolled patients were ART-experienced, HIV-1 infected and &#x02265;18 years of age and receiving a once-daily regimen of TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg)+ATV/r (300 mg/100 mg) for at least 6 months prior to the first day of Screening. TDF/FTC+ ATV/r must have been the subject&#x02019;s initial regimen or first or second switch regimen. Initial regimen was defined as the first regimen received by a previously antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve patient and any change of ART whether of a single drug or multiple drugs simultaneously was considered a regimen switch. Patients must not have switched due to virologic failure. If TDF/FTC+ ATV/r was the patient&#x02019;s first or second switch regimen, then the subject should have received any of the following prior regimens: any currently licensed non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) in combination with either TDF/FTC or zidovudine (ZDV)/3TC; a ritonavir-boosted PI in combination with TDF/FTC or ZDV/3TC. Alternative prior regimens not listed above were allowed on a case-by-case basis. Each patient must have been virologically suppressed (defined as HIV-1 RNA&#x02264;75 copies/mL) at two consecutive time points on TDF/FTC+ATV/r which had to include the Screening visit and one additional visit at least 28 days prior to Screening. The original protocol was amended on 07 September 2010 to define virologic suppression as HIV-1 RNA&#x02264;75 copies/mL; for patients enrolled prior to that date, the original protocol required suppression of HIV-1 RNA to &#x02264;50 copies/m.</p><p>The main patient exclusion criteria included having active CDC Clinical Category C disease, ongoing clinically relevant hepatitis and/or chronic hepatitis B infection (HBsAg+), being HLA-B*5701 positive, prior abacavir exposure, creatinine clearance &#x0003c;50 ml/min via the Cockroft-Gault method, and known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs. Patients were also deemed ineligible if enrolled in one or more investigational drug protocols within 30 days of screening, if they had been immunized within 30 days prior to first dose of any study drugs or had been treated with or had an anticipated need during the study for any medications which could interact with the study medications according to the product labeling. Exclusion criteria also included treatment with immune-modulating agents within the prior 90 days, immunization with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine, or undergoing treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (or having an expected need for the latter during the study). Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality at screening was generally exclusionary unless the investigator provided a compelling explanation, as was any other laboratory abnormality or medical condition detected at screening that the investigator determined would have precluded the patient&#x02019;s participation in the study. While a baseline genotype was not required for study entry, patients were deemed ineligible if they had known HIV genotyping results that indicated the presence of any mutation in the reverse transcriptase or protease regions that was associated with resistance to any study drug and included the following reverse transcriptase mutations: K65R, K70E, L74V, M184I/V, or Y115F, a combination of two or more thymidine analog mutations: M41L, D67N, K70R, K219Q or E that must include a change at either L210 or T215, or three or more of the following HIV-1 protease mutations associated with atazanavir resistance: D30, V32, M36, M46, I47, G48, I50, I54, A71, G73, V77, V82, I84, N88, and L90. There were no restrictions on screening CD4+ cell count. Females of child-bearing potential were eligible if they had negative pregnancy tests at screening and baseline and agreed to use &#x02265;1 protocol-prescribed method of contraception throughout the study.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The protocol (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096187.s002">Protocol S1</xref></bold>) was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) used by the 44 participating study sites.

Randomization (by parallel group, stratified, and centralized with a fixed block size of 3) and study drug provisioning were performed by GlaxoSmithKline&#x02019;s Randomization and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS), which uses interactive voice-response technology.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures and Assessments</title><p>Patients were evaluated at screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24 with routine chemistry, hematology, and immunology tests conducted at each assessment. The concentrations of specific biomarkers (bone alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, C-terminal telopeptide, osteocalcin, urine &#x003b2;2 microglobulin/creatinine ratio, high-sensitivity C reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6, and D-dimer) were evaluated at baseline and Week 24 only. Biomarker data was log-transformed prior to analysis and the change from baseline was assessed using geometric mean ratios with 95% confidence intervals. HIV-RNA concentrations were measured by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory toxicities were graded using the 2004 Division of AIDS Toxicity Grading Scale. All suspected ABC hypersensitivity events were reported as serious adverse events (SAEs). Glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula <xref rid="pone.0096187-Levey1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Smoking status and presence of diabetes were assessed at baseline and Week 24 for Framingham Risk Score calculation <xref rid="pone.0096187-DAgostino1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and treatment emergent changes in fasting total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were assessed using the Division of AIDS lipid toxicity grading system <xref rid="pone.0096187-ExpertPanelon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Viral genotypes and phenotypes were performed at Monogram Biosciences Inc.

Laboratory staff at Monogram and Quest performing assessments were blinded as to patient treatment assignment and sample labels included no information on assigned treatment regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study Populations</title><p>The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population consisted of all enrolled subjects randomized in the study, regardless of what treatment was actually received or the eventual outcome of study participation. A modified ITT population, ITT-Exposed, including all subjects who are in the ITT population and received at least one dose of study drug, was the primary population for efficacy analyses. The safety population consisted of all randomized subjects with the exception of those with documented evidence of not having consumed any investigational product. The virologic failure population for the virology analysis included all subjects who met the protocol virologic failure criterion which was defined as plasma HIV-RNA &#x02265;400 copies/mL on 2 consecutive occasions (confirmed virologic failure). The Observed dataset contains all data collected while subjects were in the study. No missing values were imputed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL at Week 24 by the Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm stratified by prior ART experience (TDF/FTC+ATV/r as initial regimen or as first/second switch regimen). The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) exposed population, which included all patients exposed to at least 1 dose of any study drug. A study responder at week 24 was defined as a patient who had achieved confirmed (2 consecutive) plasma HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL and remained suppressed (no confirmed viral rebound measurements) by week 24 as defined by TLOVR algorithm. All others, including those who did not complete week 24 assessments, were defined as study non-responders.</p><p>Secondary endpoints measured at Week 24 included the percentage of patients with HIV-RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL as measured by the missing/discontinuation equals failure (MD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;F) analysis and in the Observed dataset, the percentage of patients with HIV-RNA&#x0003c;400 copies/mL as measured by TLOVR, MD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;F and Observed analyses, the change from baseline in CD4+ cell count, time to virologic failure, detection of genotypic and phenotypic resistance at the time of virologic failure, change from baseline in fasting lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides), grade 2&#x02013;4 AEs, and all SAEs. There were two exploratory endpoints: (1) change from baseline in neurocognition scores, which will be discussed in a separate manuscript; and (2) change from baseline in eight cardiovascular/inflammation, bone, and renal biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>A total of 300 patients were planned for the study. Three hundred patients with a 2&#x02236;1 ratio would provide over 90% power to assess the non-inferiority of ABC/3TC+ATV over TDF/FTC-ATV/r at the 0.05 level of significance. This sample size calculation assumed a virologic response rate (proportions of patients with HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL) of 89% in both treatment groups and a non-inferiority margin of 12%. Non-inferiority was defined as a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) that excluded differences as large as 12% in the direction of inferiority of ABC/3TC+ATV group. The non-inferiority margin of 12% is standard in such non-inferiority trials of ART and is accepted by the FDA. To establish non-inferiority, the 2-sided 95% CI should lie entirely to the right of the value of &#x02212;12%.</p><p>All the statistical comparisons were based on 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

Confirmed virologic failure &#x0003e;400 copies/mL occurred in 1% of patients in both groups. The mean increase in CD4+ cell count from baseline to Week 24 was significantly larger for ABC/3TC+ATV (+48 cells/&#x000b5;L) than TDF/FTC+ATV/r (+8 cells/&#x000b5;L).</p><p>There were few grade 2&#x02013;4 treatment-related AEs in either group, but patients treated with TDF/FTC+ATV/r had significantly more treatment-emergent or worsening grade 2&#x02013;4 and grade 3&#x02013;4 laboratory abnormalities than patients taking ABC/3TC+ATV &#x02013; largely driven by a higher rate of hyperbilirubinemia in the RTV-containing group.

This study evaluated the ability to maintain virologic suppression following RTV discontinuation in an ART-experienced population with HIV-RNA&#x0003c;75 c/mL and currently receiving RTV-containing therapy. The efficacy and tolerability of ABC/3TC+ATV demonstrated in this study complement those of the ARIES trial, which enrolled treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients to receive 36 weeks of ABC/3TC+ATV/r before randomizing 419 patients with HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL to maintain or discontinue RTV <xref rid="pone.0096187-Squires1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Twenty-four weeks after randomization in that study, viral suppression was maintained in 93% (195/210) of patients taking ABC/3TC+ATV and 89% (184/209) taking ATC/3TC+ATV/r (by TLOVR). Other data were reported only after 48 weeks on randomized therapy. Virologic failure was uncommon (2% overall), but 7 of 8 patients meeting the criteria for virologic failure were taking ATV/r. CD4+ cell responses were robust and similar between treatment groups. Few adverse events were reported after randomization: in the group discontinuing RTV, the rate of hyperbilirubinemia decreased from 14% to 4%. Fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides increased while patients were taking ATV/r, and values returned only partway to baseline when RTV was discontinued. Median HDL cholesterol improved from 38 mg/dl at baseline to 48 mg/dl at Week 84 regardless of randomized treatment.</p><p>Likewise, in the InduMA study, 252 antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve patients received 2 NRTIs plus ATV/r for 26 to 30 weeks <xref rid="pone.0096187-Ghosn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Patients with confirmed HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL were randomized to switch to unboosted ATV (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;87) or maintain ATV/r (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;85); NRTI backbones were not changed (approximately 52% ABC/3TC and 32% lamivudine/zidovudine). After 48 weeks on randomized therapy (no data were reported at 24 weeks), there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA&#x0003c;50 copies/mL (78% ATV and 75% ATV/r in an ITT non-completion&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;failure analysis). Virologic failure rates were higher than in our study (13% ATV; 7% ATV/r), but only a few patients had HIV-1 RNA &#x0003e;400 copies/L (5% ATV; 1% ATV/r). CD4+ cell counts continued to increase from randomization to the end of the 48-week maintenance phase, with no difference between the ATV (+92 cells/&#x000b5;L) and ATV/r (+100 cells/&#x000b5;L) groups. During the maintenance phase, the prevalence of hyperbilirubinemia decreased from 32% to 16% in the ATV group and from 32% to 28% in the ATV/r group. Fasting lipids favored ATV, with significant improvements in total cholesterol and triglycerides compared with ATV/r over 48 weeks on randomized therapy.

The study enrolled therapy-experienced patients who achieved viral suppression and had not experienced prior virologic failure leading to selection of drug resistance mutations; extrapolating these findings to other patient populations may be inappropriate. Plasma concentrations of ATV in the absence of RTV boosting are lower, and therefore this regimen may be more susceptible to patient adherence issues. Additionally, this simplification treatment strategy is restricted to certain NRTI backbones such as ABC/3TC that can be used in combination with unboosted ATV. Lastly, 24 week data are presented and the efficacy and safety of this simplification strategy needs to be evaluated over a longer period of time (this study continues to 48 weeks and follow-up results will be forthcoming).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Over 24 weeks, simplification of TDF/FTC+ATV/r to ABC/3TC+ATV maintained viral suppression, was well-tolerated, and led to improvements in CD4+ cell count, bone biomarkers, renal biomarkers, and HDL cholesterol without causing increases in other fasting lipid levels or in cardiovascular biomarkers of inflammation and thrombogenesis. This study continues through 48 weeks to provide longer-term data regarding the efficacy and safety of this ART simplification strategy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096187.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
