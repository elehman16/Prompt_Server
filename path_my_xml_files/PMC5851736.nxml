Nitroglycerin is a nitrate used for vasodilation in patients with hypertension and ischemic heart disease.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Sorption of nitroglycerin into the administration set can increase the risk of cardiovascular instability due to the administration of an inadequate dosage. In previous studies, the possibility of nitroglycerin sorption into administration set tubes composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PU), or polyolefin (PO) has been discussed.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Park et al<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> showed PO administration set prohibited drug sorption when compared to the PVC and PU administration set; however, these were in vitro studies. Altavela et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> also revealed that patients who received intravenous nitroglycerin through a PVC administration set had the same clinical response as patients given the drug through a polyethylene set. There is a paucity of in vivo studies focused on the plasma concentration and efficacy of drugs comparing PO, PU, and PVC administration sets. As individual variation among patients can affect sensitivity to drugs, and this could in turn influence therapeutic outcomes, we cannot ascertain whether drug sorption into the administration set contributes to differences in a drug's effect. Moreover, the clinical environment is different from that of a laboratory in terms of the total length of the intravenous set, means of connecting the set, and drug infusion rate. The present study aimed to explore the effect of the composition of the administration set on the plasma concentration and effect of nitroglycerin on patients.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Chemicals</title><p>We used 3 different types of administration sets with tubes composed of PVC, PU, and PO. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT) was used as the plasticizer for the PVC tube. All tubes had a length of 100&#x0200a;cm, and were manufactured and supplied by Polyscientech Co., Ltd (Anseong, Gyeonggi, Korea). An independent experimenter diluted nitroglycerin (Bayer Pharma AG, Leverkusen, Germany) with 90&#x0200a;mL of normal saline to obtain a final concentration of 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Patients</title><p>The Severance Hospital Institutional Review Board provided ethics approval for this study; we obtained written informed consent from all study participants. All volunteers were men, aged 19 to 50 years, with a BMI of 18.5 to 25&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. A complete medical history of all participants was obtained, and all of them underwent comprehensive physical screening and examination, EKG (electrocardiography), and laboratory tests. Exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of abnormalities of the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, endocrinal, hepatic, hematologic, or gastrointestinal system or any other significant disease state that could affect pharmacokinetics (PK); drug addiction, including opioids, narcotics, or any other drugs, affecting the central nervous system; chronic use of any medication; and hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin or any other nitrate drugs. Nine volunteers were recruited to take part in the present study. The present study was a randomized, open-labeled, 3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;3 crossover study; therefore, 3 volunteers each were randomly allocated to groups A, B, and C. In group A, a PVC-based tube was used in period I, and PU- and PO-based tubes were used in periods II and III, respectively. In group B, PU-, PO-, and PVC-based tubes were used in periods I, II, and III, respectively, and in group C, PO-, PVC-, and PU-based tubes were used in periods I, II, and III, respectively.</p><sec><label>2.2.1</label><title>Period I</title><p>On day 1, all volunteers fasted for 4&#x0200a;hours before arriving at the hospital. Water intake was restricted for an hour before and after the administration of nitroglycerin. Patients were subjected to EKG, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and pulse oximetry. A 23-gauge intravenous catheter was inserted into the forearm vein. Blood pressure was determined using an upper-arm sphygmomanometer at an interval of 5&#x0200a;minutes. The 100-cm-long administration set tube was connected to the catheter. Following predosing blood sample collection, nitroglycerin (100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL) was infused via PVC (group A)-, PU (group B)-, or PO (group C)-based tubes at the rate of 12&#x0200a;mL/hour for 30&#x0200a;minutes by using an infusion pump. Blood samples were collected at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30&#x0200a;minutes after administration was initiated and at 3, 6, and 10&#x0200a;minutes after drug administration completed. A blood sample of 5&#x0200a;mL was transferred to an EDTA-containing tube and centrifuged within an hour after collection. The centrifuged plasma samples were placed on ice until they were transported to the laboratory for storage at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. The plasma concentration of nitroglycerin was obtained from the laboratory within a month. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before administration and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30&#x0200a;minutes after drug administration was initiated and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32&#x0200a;minutes after drug administration was completed.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2.2</label><title>Periods II and III</title><p>As there was a washout interval, period II was started 5 days or more after period I was concluded.

The analytical column was a Kinetex C18 (100&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;4.6&#x0200a;mm, 2.6&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), and the mobile phase comprised solvent A (0.025&#x0200a;mM ammonium chloride) and solvent B (methanol). The separation method used was a gradient method. The organic solvent used was initially of low concentration (5% Solvent B), which was increased (95% Solvent B), and then decreased to the initial concentration (5% Solvent B). The total analysis time was 15 minutes; the flow rate was 550&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L/min. The working solutions of nitroglycerin were prepared at human plasma concentrations of 0.1 &#x02013; 50.0&#x0200a;ng/mL. The sample was prepared as follows: an aliquot of 500&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L of human plasma was transferred to a polypropylene tube; 1000&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L of acetonitrile and the internal standard solution were added; and the mixture was vortex-mixed for a minute. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000&#x0200a;rpm for 10&#x0200a;minutes, and the supernatant was separated. A sample (15&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L) of the supernatant was then injected into an LC-MS/MS system. The concentrations of nitroglycerin were calculated from the calibration curve. The calibration standards showed acceptable linearity (correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.99) over a concentration range of 0.1 to 50.0&#x0200a;ng/mL, determined by a 1/<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup> weighted least-squares linear regression analysis.

The sorption of a number of drugs from solutions by plastic bags was investigated.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The developing drug carriers that facilitate the sustained and long-term release of drugs and improve the pharmacological bioavailability is an important issue.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> The material of an administration set can also influence on the effect of the drug.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>We performed a preliminary study to explore the effect of the materials used in different drug administration sets&#x02014;namely, PVC, PU, and PO&#x02014;on the PK and pharmacodynamic profile of nitroglycerin by comparing the plasma concentration and efficacy of nitroglycerin in the same subject. The <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and the effect of nitroglycerin on blood pressure decreased when PVC- and PU-based administration sets were used compared to those when the PO-based administration sets were used.

Thus, clinical studies such as the present study were required.</p><p>Our results showed that the mean plasma concentration of nitroglycerin in the PO administration set group over time was higher than those in the PU or PVC administration set group. These findings are in agreement with those of prior studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> suggesting that the tube material influences the nitroglycerin concentration due to drug sorption. This phenomenon can be explained by several theories. First, partitioning of drugs between the polymer and contact media is related to their hydrophobicity.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Equilibrium of a drug between the tube material and the injectable media is affected by its partition coefficient, which is a major factor in drug sorption in the administration set. Drug sorption is also affected by the structure-based polarity and molecular weight of the polymers used in administration sets.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Additionally, plasticizers may leach from a PVC-based tube, and the leaching of chemicals from the administration set can lead to a decrease in drug concentration.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>We also observed that the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>last</sub> of the PO group were higher than those of PVC and PU groups. These results indicated that the PO-based administration set could minimize the sorption of nitroglycerin into the tube. The possible explanation is that PO has a lower partition coefficient than does PVC or PU; therefore, a multicomponent polymer matrix (polyethylene elastomer, polypropylene elastomer, polybutadiene blend) of PO tubes can be equilibrated with reduced drug loss compared to PVC- and PU-based administration sets.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the present study, we noted that there were significant differences in lowering mean arterial pressure among the 3 types of tubes. The PO-based tube showed a more significant hypotensive effect than PU- and PVC-based tubes. The nitroglycerin acting on peripheral veins decreases venous return, resulting in a decrease in end-diastolic volume and pressure by the LaPlace relationship, and thus a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The nitroglycerin also acts as a vasodilator of peripheral arteries. The decrease in mean arterial pressure would be expected to result in a further decrease in myocardial wall tension and an improvement in ventricular function.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The administration of nitroglycerin intravenously through the PO-based tube may therefore allow more precise control of dosage and help avoid reduction in efficacy.</p><p>In this study, nitroglycerin was diluted to 100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL and infused at a rate of 12&#x0200a;mL/hour (20&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/min) through a 100-cm tube, as per a recommended guideline for nitroglycerin infusion.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Moreover, several studies revealed that as flow rate decreased or tube length increased, the amount of drug absorbed increased proportionately.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Thus, caution should be exercised when applying our result to a different clinical setting.</p><p>There are several limitations to the present study. First, we did not measure the concentration of nitroglycerin in the tube. It is reasonable to assume, however, that sorption of nitroglycerin into the tube caused the difference in plasma nitroglycerin concentration and arterial pressure, according to the types of materials used in the tubes, as several in vitro studies on sorption of nitroglycerin into the tube have been carried out.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> A sampling of drug from the administration set can also interfere in measuring the plasma concentration and the effect of the drug. Second, we had a small sample size (9 volunteers). This study is preliminary; thus, further investigation with a larger sample size should be conducted in future. Third, we did not estimate the terminal elimination rate constant (&#x003bb;<sub>z</sub>), elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>), or plasma drug clearance, because most of the samples collected after infusion of nitroglycerin were determined to be below the limit of quantification.</p><p>In conclusion, healthy volunteers administered intravenous nitroglycerin via a PO-based tube had higher plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin and more significant reductions in blood pressure than those who received nitroglycerin through PVC- or PU-based tubes. This result suggests that the sorption of nitroglycerin is less in the PO-based tube than in the PVC- or PU-based tube, indicating that the tube materials used for drug administration may play a critical role in drug efficacy and safety.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEs = adverse events, EKG = electrocardiography, HPLC = high-performance liquid chromatography, MAP = mean arterial pressure, PK = pharmacokinetics, PO = polyolefin, PU = polyurethane, PVC = polyvinyl chloride.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al Salloum</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Saunier</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Aymes-Chodur</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
