These data have supported a favorable benefit/risk profile of denosumab over time. We observed maintenance of the effect of denosumab on bone turnover that was associated with low fracture incidence, progressive and significant increases in bone mineral density (BMD) at all sites measured, and a well-maintained safety profile with exposure for up to 6&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Bone turnover and BMD are pharmacologically modifiable risk factors for fracture in patients with osteoporosis. Data from the FREEDOM study demonstrated that gains in BMD with denosumab treatment for up to 3&#x000a0;years were associated with increased estimated bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which can account for much of the effect of denosumab in reducing fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is of considerable scientific and clinical interest to extend these observations.</p><p>The Extension study, which will ultimately result in up to 10&#x000a0;years of denosumab exposure, offers an opportunity to evaluate how safety and efficacy assessments trend over time in an aging population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Here, we report the year-by-year safety and efficacy of continued denosumab therapy through the fifth year of the Extension to the denosumab phase 3 pivotal fracture study, FREEDOM, for a total of up to 8&#x000a0;years of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The FREEDOM pivotal study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00089791) and the Extension designs (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00523341) have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and are summarized in Online Resource Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. Briefly, postmenopausal women aged 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;years with a lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-score less than &#x02212;2.5 at either site but &#x02212;4.0 or greater at both sites were eligible to enroll in FREEDOM. Participants were randomized to receive placebo or 60&#x000a0;mg denosumab (Prolia&#x000ae;; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) subcutaneously (s.c.) every 6&#x000a0;months for 3&#x000a0;years. All participants were instructed to take calcium (&#x02265;1&#x000a0;g) and vitamin D (&#x02265;400&#x000a0;IU) daily. All women who completed the FREEDOM study (i.e., completed their 3-year visit) in either the denosumab or placebo arm, did not discontinue investigational product, and did not miss &#x0003e;1 dose of investigational product were eligible to enter the Extension where all participants are scheduled to receive open-label 60&#x000a0;mg denosumab s.c. every 6&#x000a0;months (&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;month) with daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The study is ongoing with preplanned data analyses performed at intervals as part of continuing pharmacovigilance. The data reported here include the first 5&#x000a0;years of the Extension and represent up to 8&#x000a0;years of denosumab exposure for women who received 3&#x000a0;years of denosumab in FREEDOM and continued in the Extension (long-term group), and up to 5&#x000a0;years of denosumab exposure for women who received 3&#x000a0;years of placebo in FREEDOM and transitioned to denosumab in the Extension (cross-over group).</p><p>The study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or ethics committee for each institutional site and all participants provided written informed consent. Representatives of the sponsor, Amgen Inc., designed the study with investigators, and statistical analyses were conducted according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Study visits were scheduled at the Extension baseline (corresponding to the end of the FREEDOM parent study) and every 6&#x000a0;months for 7&#x000a0;years during the Extension.</p><p>Concentrations of serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx; Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S, Herlev, Denmark) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP; Orion Diagnostica Oy, Espoo, Finland) were measured by PPD (PPD Development, Richmond, VA, USA) and LabCorp (LabCorp Burlington, Burlington, NC, USA), respectively, using fasting (overnight), predose morning serum samples collected from a subset of women who participated in the FREEDOM bone turnover marker (BTM) substudy and consented to continue in the Extension. At year 2 of the Extension, the protocol was amended to increase the number of participants in the substudy. Evaluation of these additional participants began at year 3 of the Extension. After the publication of data from the first 2&#x000a0;years of the Extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], additional P1NP samples from the second year were identified in storage by the central laboratory. P1NP levels were measured in these samples, and the data are included in the current analysis. Consistent with previous reports, undetectable values were imputed using the corresponding assay&#x02019;s established lower limit of quantification (CTx, 0.049&#x000a0;ng/mL; P1NP, 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>BMD measurements were performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and hip in all women and at the 1/3 radius in a subset of women at the Extension baseline and Extension years 1, 2, 3, and 5. All DXA scans were centrally read by BioClinica (previously known as Synarc Inc.).</p><p>Vertebral fractures were also identified by a central facility (BioClinica) using the Genant semiquantitative grading scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] from thoracic and lumbar lateral radiographs obtained at the Extension baseline and Extension years 2, 3, and 5. Prevalent vertebral fractures at Extension baseline and new vertebral fractures were defined as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Clinical vertebral and nonvertebral fractures required confirmation by diagnostic imaging or a radiologist&#x02019;s report. High-force trauma or pathological clinical vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were excluded, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In this report, hip fractures were defined as those at the femoral neck or intertrochanteric region; previously, subtrochanteric fractures were also included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Every 3&#x000a0;months, participants were queried about adverse events (AEs), the occurrence of a clinical fracture, and concomitant medications by the study site staff. Potential events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) were reviewed by an independent, blinded, external adjudication committee, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. During year 3 of the Extension, an adjudication process was initiated to review potential events of atypical femoral fracture (AFF). Available X-ray images of femoral fractures that occurred were reviewed by a panel at the central radiographic vendor site (BioClinica); femoral fractures that occurred prior to year 3 were retrospectively reviewed. The major criteria established by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research 2010 Task Force for AFF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were used for adjudication by this committee: fracture location (subtrochanteric, including the femur diaphysis); fracture type (non-comminuted, simple transverse, or short oblique); no or minimal trauma; and the absence of any evidence of malignancy, prosthesis, pins, or other hardware at or near the fracture site prior to the fracture event.

Key secondary objectives include evaluation of the effects on BTMs and BMD, and the incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. The protocol specifies that all endpoints will be analyzed according to the original randomized treatment group assignments in FREEDOM.</p><p>Safety analyses included participants who received &#x02265;1 dose of investigational product in the Extension and were based on the original randomized treatment assignments in FREEDOM. Therefore, in the current safety analyses, seven of the original placebo-group subjects who received one incorrect dose of denosumab in FREEDOM and were previously summarized in the denosumab group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] were included in the FREEDOM placebo group. For consistency with previous reports of the FREEDOM Extension data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities v13.0 was used to code and report AEs for this publication. Descriptive analyses of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) included exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates. Within each yearly or cumulative interval, the exposure-adjusted subject incidence was calculated as the number of subjects who experienced a particular AE divided by the total exposure time within the interval. A subject who experienced repeated episodes of the same AE within the yearly or cumulative interval of interest was counted only once for that interval. For example, a subject who experienced a common cold during years 1 and 3 was counted once in year 1 and once in year 3 for those yearly intervals, but only once for the 5-year cumulative interval.</p><p>Analyses of BTMs included participants who received &#x02265;1 dose of investigational product in the Extension and had observed values at the time points of interest. Results are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. Analyses of BMD percentage change from either FREEDOM or Extension baseline required observed values at the respective baseline and the time points of interest, and were conducted using a repeated measures model as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Least squares means with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were calculated and reported. In addition, BMD gains between consecutive DXA evaluations during the Extension were assessed.</p><p>Cumulative and yearly crude subject incidence of new vertebral fractures and Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative and yearly subject incidence of nonvertebral fractures were calculated.</p><p>Fracture and safety data from the FREEDOM parent study have been summarized to allow comparison with the Extension results.

These data address important considerations in interpreting the safety and efficacy of a new therapeutic class of treatment for long-term use in a chronic condition in an aging population. The study design incorporates a long-term treatment group to characterize the effects of up to 10&#x000a0;years of exposure, and a cross-over treatment cohort to further characterize and confirm assessments of efficacy and safety findings from extended denosumab administration, with a 3-year delay.</p><p>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of denosumab. The year-by-year results for FREEDOM and its Extension, presented here for the first time, demonstrate that the safety profile of denosumab has remained consistent over 8&#x000a0;years of treatment. Notably, in this aging population, the subject incidence of AEs such as serious infection, cellulitis, and eczema remained low with no evidence of increased frequency through 8&#x000a0;years of denosumab exposure, as did infrequent events. Bone safety events of ONJ and AFF were observed, and the rates remained low. Through Extension year 5, eight events of ONJ and two events of AFF were confirmed by adjudicators. The cumulative exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates during the Extension (years 1&#x02013;5), including both the long-term and cross-over groups, were 4.2 per 10,000 subject-years for ONJ and 1.0 per 10,000 subject-years for AFF.</p><p>Denosumab&#x02019;s mechanism of action, which prevents the generation, proliferation, and survival of osteoclasts, results in a marked reduction of bone resorption during most of the dosing period, though the pharmacodynamic profile shows some release of inhibition toward the end of the dosing interval. The BTMs described in the study were measured at the end of the dosing intervals when the effect of denosumab has been shown to wane, and undetectable values were imputed at the lower limit of detection, which may overestimate levels. Thus, reported levels of serum CTx may not fully reflect the maximal antiresorptive effect that occurs during much of the dosing interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bone formation markers also are reduced. This turnover pattern was associated with a finding that is different from other antiresorptive therapies to date, namely a continuous progressive and significant increase in BMD. In both groups, markers of bone resorption remained low and BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck continued to increase at each time point measured over the course of the Extension. BMD also continued to increase at the 1/3 radius in both the long-term and cross-over groups. These gains are noteworthy, as the radius has been shown to be minimally responsive to most osteoporosis treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The overall effect of 5&#x000a0;years of denosumab treatment on BMD was similar between the two groups. Furthermore, the effects on BMD in the long-term group were consistent with the 8-year gains reported in the lumbar spine and proximal femur in the phase 2 denosumab dose-ranging extension study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The clinical significance of the BMD increases is supported by the associated sustained effects on fracture rates in both the long-term and cross-over groups during the Extension. The exact mechanism(s) underlying this pattern of BMD increases throughout the skeleton remains to be fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Hypotheses based on previous observations may help to explain the progressive gains in BMD without apparent therapeutic plateau and the low fracture incidence over time. As is known to occur with other antiresorptives, the early increase in BMD is at least partly due to the closing of the remodeling space and the subsequent secondary mineralization of bone apposed during the formation phase of existing remodeling units. However, such effects would be self-limited, and resultant BMD and mass gains would be expected to approach a plateau after 2 to 4&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With denosumab, this plateau in BMD has not been observed. Denosumab has been shown to decrease cortical porosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, transient increases in parathyroid hormone following dosing have been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most recently, modeling-based bone formation was observed in the femoral neck of ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys treated with denosumab for 16&#x000a0;months at a dose that fully inhibited remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. That observation, which remains to be reproduced in humans, raises the possibility that denosumab does not prevent modeling and that ongoing modeling-based bone formation in a setting of maximally reduced resorption could contribute to the continued increases in bone mass. This is of particular clinical relevance because gains in BMD and mass, resulting from modeling in areas of high biomechanical stresses, could improve bone strength and reduce fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>A significant limitation of this study is the lack of an ongoing placebo group, and these analyses cannot substitute for the results of a randomized placebo-controlled study. The placebo phase was terminated with the end of the core trial for ethical reasons. The previously reported <italic>virtual twin</italic> modeling approach addressed this limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as does the comparison of baseline characteristics of the Extension participants with the original study population. A per-protocol, post-hoc analysis of the rates of nonvertebral fractures through Extension year 4, limited to individuals who entered the Extension, has also been performed and is the subject of a separate report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Subject attrition is also an important consideration in interpretation of safety and efficacy results from long-term follow-up studies. A series of analyses were recently presented that compared FREEDOM and Extension populations at baseline and in the Extension to assess potential selection bias that might influence long-term treatment fracture outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Increasing age and incident fracture were not deterrents to continued study participation, suggesting that safety and efficacy outcomes reflected denosumab treatment effect.</p><p>In conclusion, data from this ongoing long-term Extension study showed that continued treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis with denosumab for up to 8&#x000a0;years resulted in sustained reduction of bone turnover, continued gains in BMD at each time point measured, and continued low yearly fracture incidence. Furthermore, the women in the cross-over group responded to 5&#x000a0;years of denosumab treatment similarly to the women in the long-term group during their first 5&#x000a0;years of denosumab treatment. The overall safety profile of denosumab in this ongoing study remains consistent over time, indicating a favorable balance between benefit and risk through 8&#x000a0;years of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="198_2015_3234_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 390 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="Fig5" content-type="local-data"><media id="MO5" xlink:href="198_2015_3234_Fig5_ESM.jpg"><label>Fig. S1</label><caption><p>(JPEG 1895 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM2"><media xlink:href="198_2015_3234_MOESM2_ESM.eps"><caption><p>High resolution image (EPS 873 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="Fig6" content-type="local-data"><media id="MO6" xlink:href="198_2015_3234_Fig6_ESM.jpg"><label>Fig. S2</label><caption><p>(JPEG 2007 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM3"><media xlink:href="198_2015_3234_MOESM3_ESM.eps"><caption><p>High resolution image (EPS 1762 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Lisa Humphries, Ph.D., of Amgen Inc. provided medical writing assistance.
