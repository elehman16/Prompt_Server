The lack of integration between different care providers impedes guideline-based treatment. This constitutes substantial challenges for the health care system and also causes considerable direct and indirect costs. To face these challenges, the aim of this project is the implementation and evaluation of a guideline-based stepped care model for depressed patients with six treatment options of varying intensity and setting, including low-intensity treatments using innovative technologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is a randomized controlled intervention trial of a consecutive sample of depressive patients from primary care assessed with a prospective survey at four time-standardized measurement points within one year. A cluster randomization at the level of participating primary care units divides the general practitioners into two groups. In the intervention group patients (n = 660) are treated within the stepped care approach in a multiprofessional network consisting of general practitioners, psychotherapists, psychiatrists and inpatient care facilities, whereas patients in the control condition (n = 200) receive routine care. The main research question concerns the effectiveness of the stepped-care model from baseline to t3 (12 months). Primary outcome is the change in depressive symptoms measured by the PHQ-9; secondary outcomes include response, remission and relapse, functional quality of life (SF-12 and EQ-5D-3 L), other clinical and psychosocial variables, direct and indirect costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Furthermore feasibility and acceptance of the overall model as well as of the separate treatment components are assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This stepped care model integrates all primary and secondary health care providers involved in the treatment of depression; it elaborates innovative and evidence-based treatment elements, follows a stratified approach and is implemented in routine care as opposed to standardized conditions. In case of positive results, its sustainable implementation as a collaborative care model may significantly improve the health care situation of depressive patients as well as the interaction and care delivery of different care providers on various levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01731717">NCT01731717</ext-link> (date of registration: 24 June 2013).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Stepped care</kwd><kwd>Collaborative care</kwd><kwd>Complex intervention</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Secondary care</kwd><kwd>Low intensity treatments</kwd><kwd>e-Mental health</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Depression is one of the most widespread mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and involves a high degree of personal suffering, a high burden of disease and serious impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus it constitutes a substantial challenge for the health care system and causes considerable direct and indirect costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Detailed estimations predict a further increase in depression-related disease burden in the next 20&#x000a0;years; depression will represent the second most important factor for impairment and premature mortality after cardiovascular diseases in highly economically developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Health care is confronted with several central areas of concern in the diagnosis and treatment of depression:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Depression often remains undetected or is diagnosed late: Especially in the primary care setting, the current detection rate of 50% to 68% needs to be optimized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with depression often do not receive evidence-based treatments or the treatment is initiated only after a long delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Adults in urban areas have to wait 12.5&#x000a0;weeks on average for a first diagnostic contact, while in rural areas the waiting time for psychological treatments comprises up to 17&#x000a0;weeks, according to a national survey conducted by the German federal psychotherapist association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Depressive patients on waiting lists suffer from a high burden of disease for many months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>The initiation of treatment for patients with depression is often carried out with a rather unsystematic selection related to the type, the intensity of treatment and the adequate allocation of resources. This may increase the risk of undersupply on the one hand and oversupply on the other hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this respect, especially low-intensity treatment options (e.g. structured self-help approaches) systematically integrated into the health care system are missing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>When treatments are initiated, an integrated care spanning different sections of the health care system is complicated due to the fragmentation of health services and the absence of an appropriate interface management (e.g. between primary and secondary care and between out- and inpatient care) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>In order to overcome these deficits it is necessary to develop, implement and evaluate guideline-oriented and evidence-based models of care that include 1) better detection rates of depression, 2) the prompt offer and access to evidence-based treatments, 3) a systematic treatment selection with the option of choosing between different levels of treatment intensity to initiate a tailored and efficient treatment and 4) multi-professional cooperation of the providers across different health care sectors in order to ensure an integrated pathway through the health care system.</p><p>Stepped care is a promising approach for improved depression care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], a concept recommended in national and international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Stepped care is based on treating patients with the most adequate treatment of lowest intensity while continuously monitoring their treatment progress. If clinically necessary, patients are stepped up to a more intensive intervention form. The treatment level is adjusted gradually whenever indicated until a satisfactory health status is achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Katon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] first demonstrated in the 1990s the effectiveness of several comprehensive models to improve the treatment of patients with depression in primary care: They found that a stepped care model consisting of psychoeducation and a higher frequency of psychiatric consultations led to increased medication compliance and reduced depressive symptoms in comparison to routine care, suggesting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Van&#x02019;t Veer-Tazelaar et al. showed how a stepped care model (watchful waiting, bibliotherapy, short term psychotherapy and medication) for elderly patients with subclinical depression reduced the risk for the occurrence of a clinical depression by approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Taking these promising results into account, we developed and implemented an extended stepped care model into routine care integrating the following aspects:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Implementation of a guideline-oriented and evidence-based stepped care model within a multi-professional network across different health care sectors consisting of general practitioners, psychiatrists and psychotherapists in out- and inpatient care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Systematic screening and structured diagnostic procedures in primary care as the basis for an appropriate delivery of different interventions following a stepped care approach.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients are treated within this network with the goal of delivering a prompt and appropriate evidence-based treatment with an improved information exchange between the involved providers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients receive the treatment step which they are most likely to benefit from (as opposed to every patient receiving the least intense step first and being stepped up only if this step is not effective enough).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Introduction of evidence-based treatment options with different levels of intensity which are not yet available in German routine care.

It aims at the improvement of the city&#x02019;s population&#x02019;s mental health by implementing new integrated health care networks based on evidence for effective treatment methods and by evaluating selected innovations and complex interventions in the region of Hamburg. The overall project is organized in 11 sub-projects. While the first five sub-projects (1&#x02013;5) facilitate mental health across different areas of disease by improving information and education, fostering occupational health or strengthening the participation of sufferers and their family members, five illness-specific health networks have been conceived (sub-projects 6&#x02013;10). A general accompanying sub-project (11) ensures the quality of the interventions in all sub-projects and conducts evaluative and health-economic investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This article describes the study protocol of the health network depression (sub-project 7).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>Primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effectiveness of a complex intervention (stepped care model, SCM) assessed through the reduction in depression severity within a network of general practitioners (GP), psychiatrists and psychotherapists in routine care.</p><p>Secondary objectives are to examine the effectiveness of SCM in terms of response, remission and health-related quality of life as well as to examine its cost-effectiveness. Further objectives are the evaluation of the process quality and of patients&#x02019; and practitioners&#x02019; satisfaction with SCM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is designed as a randomized controlled intervention trial of a consecutive sample of depressive patients from primary care assessed with a prospective multiple time point survey. GPs are divided into two groups by undertaking a cluster randomization on the level of the participating primary care units. Patients recruited by GPs in the intervention group (IG) are treated within the stepped care approach (SCM, see section <italic>Intervention</italic>). Patients recruited by GPs in the control group (CG) receive treatment as usual (TAU). Both patient groups are compared with respect to their treatment response within a one-year period. The scientific approach is primarily quantitative with additional qualitative analyses regarding feasibility and acceptance of the SCM by patients as well as by out- and inpatient care providers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary hypothesis</title><p>The trial evaluates the primary hypothesis that the SCM condition (IG) outperforms the TAU condition (CG) regarding the primary outcome parameter (PHQ-9), i.e. that stepped care is more effective than treatment as usual in depressive symptom reduction after 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomization</title><p>Cluster-randomization is performed in order to allocate confounding variables in equal parts to both study conditions and thus to control for potential bias in order to guarantee internal validity. In this study, cluster-randomization is undertaken at the level of the participating GP practices, which are allocated to either IG or CG in a 3:1 ratio. The process of randomization is conducted by a computer program by minimization based on the GP&#x02019;s practice size (single practice vs. group practice), the location of the practice within Hamburg classified into the two categories (central vs. peripheral) and income level of the practice&#x02019;s local district classified into three categories (low, middle and high). Criteria for selection of clustering variables are relevance and availability. We assume that each GP in the 49 participating practices is able to recruit 15&#x02013;25 patients. A total of 36 practices is randomized into the IG and 13 practices into the CG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the responsible local Ethics Committee in Hamburg and will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population and recruitment</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Patients</title><p>The recruitment of the patients in the IG and CG is carried out by the participating GPs and comprises three guideline-recommended steps of screening and assessment as displayed in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: First, by applying a 2-item-checklist (<italic>risk-checklist</italic>) the GP systematically identifies those patients with diffuse somatic symptoms and/or with chronic somatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], i.e. patients at high risk for depression. For this group of patients, the GP continues the screening procedure by using a further guideline-based 2-item-checklist (<italic>main-symptom-checklist</italic>) assessing the main symptoms of depression. A positive answer in at least one of these questions leads to the third screening step, an assessment with the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): Patients with a score of five or more points meet the study&#x02019;s basic inclusion criterion and are informed about the study. After giving informed consent, patients receive their baseline questionnaire.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Patients with insufficient knowledge of the German language or a health situation that does not allow questionnaire completion are excluded. Neither somatic nor mental comorbidities are exclusion criteria. However, if a mental disorder other than depression is the main treatment focus patients are also excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>We aim to gain a sample size that permits a small to moderate effect size between SCM and TAU to be detected with a statistical power of 80%. A small to moderate effect size is defined as eta<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0344 (or f&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.175 according to Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). We expect a reduction of the error variance of approximately 20% by including initial symptom severity (PHQ-9 at t0) as a covariate (which can be expected to be uncorrelated to the study conditions due to randomization). This leads to an adjusted effect size of eta<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.042 (f&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.209). In this respect and based on &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 a sample of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;92 patients in each study condition is required for our main analysis. As we presume a drop-out rate of 20% in the IG an initial sample of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;110 patients is needed in this group to answer the main research question. In order to run further separate analyses for each of the six treatment options within the SCM (and assuming an equal distribution of patients onto each option) we include 6*110 patients in the intervention group. As for the control group, a larger rate of drop-out has to be expected (approximately 50%, due to less personal involvement), a total of N&#x02009;=&#x02009;200 patients is to be recruited in this study condition. Therefore, a total of N&#x02009;=&#x02009;860 depressive patients are to be included in the study.</p><p>For the primary endpoint changes in PHQ-9 to baseline after 12&#x000a0;months we assume a small to moderate effect size defined as Cohen's d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4 and set the significance level to 0.05 (two-sided). With these settings a sample size of 100 patients in each group is required to achieve a power of 80%. 2 &#x000d7; 100 patients need to be included if the randomization occurs at the patient level. With an assumed intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.05 and 20 included patients per cluster on average a design effect of 1.95 is calculated, increasing the sample size to 200 patients and 10 practices per group.</p><p>We decide to recruit the threefold number of patients in the intervention group because we would like to obtain detailed knowledge about the six treatment options. And so we assume to have a sufficient number of patients in each of the treatment options. This approach results in 860 patients and 40 practices to recruit with a 3:1 allocation to the intervention and the control group, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Treatment condition</title><p>The SCM is embedded in a multiprofessional network (see below) and consists of the following components:</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Diagnostic process and treatment selection</title><p>GPs of the intervention group continue the diagnostic process with a paper-pencil ICD-10-checklist to determine depression type and severity.

Treatment interventions are allocated with consideration to depression severity and patient preference following guideline recommendations.

Personal guidance is limited in its scope and is carried out by the GP who gives an initial introduction to the intervention, hands out the book and monitors the progress of patients in this step.</p><p>In Internet-based self-management, the GP informs the patient about the program and the procedures and provides the patient with a personal license to register to the software. The program deprexis&#x000ae; is a certified medical product based on a cognitive-behavioral approach that allows patients to work independently and at their own pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The program consists of 12 interactive simulated conversations including detailed psycho-education and exercises. It focuses on behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring. For each patient, the program is tailored individually in terms of level of detail, language and personal relevance.

It includes a patient workbook as well as a therapist manual and will be evaluated in two conditions (delivery with vs. without additional motivating letters from the psychotherapist after each session). It comprises 8 to 12 telephone contacts (20 to 40&#x000a0;minutes) which are carried out weekly and - at a later treatment stage - biweekly. This 3-month structured program also follows a cognitive behavioral approach with the main focus on behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring. As the level of guidance and intensity in telephone-based psychotherapy is higher than in bibliotherapy and Internet-based self-management, it can also be carried out with patients suffering from moderate depression, especially if they decline step 3 (psychotherapeutic or pharmacological treatment).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Step 3 and Step 4</title><p>Psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy (as stand-alone and as combination treatment) are conducted by health care providers in outpatient care (psychotherapy: psychologists or physicians licensed as psychotherapists; pharmacotherapy: psychiatrists or GPs) from routine care who undergo initial training and take part in four quality circles per year (see next section).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Monitoring</title><p>Depression severity is systematically monitored by the responsible care provider within defined time intervals in order to ensure that a potential under- or oversupply is detected as quickly as possible. During monitoring patients fill out the PHQ-9 which is checked by the provider. Additionally, the care provider (GP, psychiatrist or psychotherapist) completes a monitoring sheet. This checklist assesses treatment-related information and is designed to facilitate decisions regarding further treatment (continuing current treatment, stepping up or down, treatment termination).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Multiprofessional network</title><p>A necessary framework for the SCM is its integration in a network consisting of the relevant care providers involved in the treatment of depressive patients, i.e. GPs, psychotherapist, psychiatrists and inpatient care facilities.

Additionally, articles in professional journals advertising the study were published and professionals were contacted via telephone.</p><p>The main focus of the network is facilitation and enhancement of information exchange and communication between all network care providers of the network in order to increase the quality of patients&#x02019; health care. Another important aspect is the prompt referral to a secondary care provider like psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Information exchange about available treatment capacities in secondary care is enhanced using an online tool specifically developed for this project. Psychotherapists and psychiatrists indicate whether they currently have an available treatment capacity which implies that the psychiatrist or psychotherapist is able to offer the patient a first contact within the next three weeks. This way, GPs are able to make a reservation for their patients online and refer them into secondary treatment without delay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Training and quality standards</title><p>Previous to the implementation of the SCM, participating care providers obtain training regarding the recommendations of the German National Clinical Practice Guideline for unipolar depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the rationale and the treatment concept of the SCM and the specific interventions. Each GP is additionally visited by the study team at least once in his or her practice to review the diagnostic routines in the everyday routine care. The psychotherapist for the telephone-based treatment receives special training and weekly supervision. Within the network, guideline-based quality standards are defined (e.g. type and frequency of monitoring). To ensure that these standards are met and to promote the cooperation and information exchange between the participating care providers, quarter-yearly quality circles take place. For the conception of the initial training and quality circles we could integrate experiences from former projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Intervention for the control group</title><p>Patients in the control condition receive treatment as usual by their GP and within the regular German health care system.

The model&#x02019;s aim is to offer adequate and integrated care by providing six different intervention options of varying intensity levels and by implementing the recommendations of the German National Clinical Practice Guideline for unipolar depression.</p><p>A strength of the study is that the stepped-care model under investigation integrates the professional providers of primary and secondary care involved in the treatment of depression (GPs, psychiatrists and psychotherapists in out- and inpatient units) within one network in order to optimize treatment paths. Evaluating new innovative treatment elements and implementing the SCM in routine care - as opposed to standardized &#x0201c;ideal&#x0201d; conditions - are two further important characteristics of this study. The evaluation of the former aspect investigates whether these innovative treatments could represent worthwhile expansions to the German health care system for patients with depression. The latter aspect addresses the question of generalizability and transferability of findings to routine care.</p><p>Implementing the complex intervention of SCM into everyday clinical practice (with all its restrictions concerning time, resources, motivation etc.) cannot be carried out in as standardized a manner as it would be in settings more prone to research. However, process variables are assessed in order to ensure treatment adherence to SCM within our study. A further limitation is that we will not be able to make inferences about the effectiveness of specific elements of stepped care, as our design refers to the effectiveness of stepped care as a complex intervention.</p><p>In contrast to other studies, the SCM examined here follows a <italic>stratified</italic> stepped-care approach taking into account patients&#x02019; needs and preferences which may be clinically more adequate than the more stringent model of stepped care which begins with the least intensive treatment for each patient regardless of symptom severity. Together with the systematic monitoring aimed at ensuring an adequate treatment modality and dose, these innovative aspects can provide important findings about how stepped care should be designed to gain sizeable effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>BW and MH conceptualized the study, obtained funding and are responsible for its conduct and overall supervision.
