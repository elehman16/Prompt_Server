This trial was designed to study the effects of this treatment on pharyngeal stability evaluated by critical closing pressure in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This single-centre, randomized, crossover, double-blind study compared active manipulation and sham manipulation of the SPG. Randomization was computer-generated. Patients each received one active manipulation and one sham manipulation at an interval of 21&#x000a0;days and were evaluated 30&#x000a0;min and 48&#x000a0;h after each session administered by a qualified osteopath. Neither the patients, nor the investigator performing the evaluations were informed about the order of the two techniques (double-blind). The primary endpoint was the percentage of responding patients presenting increased pharyngeal stability defined by a variation of critical closing pressure (Pcrit) of at least &#x02212;4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at 30&#x000a0;min. Secondary endpoints were the variation of Pcrit in absolute values, sleepiness and snoring. Others endpoints were lacrimation (Schirmer&#x02019;s test), induced pain, sensations experienced during OMT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Ten patients were included and nine (57 [50; 58] years, comprising 7 men, with an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 31.0 [25.5; 33.2]/h; (values are median [quartiles])) were analysed. Seven patients were analysed for the primary endpoint and nine patients were analysed for secondary endpoints. Five patients responded after active manipulation versus no patients after sham manipulation (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0209). Active manipulation induced more intense pain (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0089), increased lacrimation (ns) and more tactile, nociceptive and gustatory sensations (13 versus 1) compared to sham manipulation.

Severe OSAS is responsible for accidents related to excessive daytime sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and cardiovascular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], cognitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and metabolic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] consequences. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the reference treatment, and mandibular advancement devices, the most frequent alternative treatment in patients not supporting CPAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], prevent obstructive events by modifying upper airway anatomy, to enlarge and maintain an open airway. However, although obstructive apnoeas often have an anatomical origin (excessively narrow upper airways, macroglossia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], more than 50% of patients experience obstructive apnoeas with no major anatomical abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This suggests that functional abnormalities of the upper airways also contribute to the pathophysiology of OSAS. The maintenance of upper airway patency throughout the respiratory cycle is dependent of upper airways dilator muscles, which are mainly innervated by the hypoglossal nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In OSAS patients, these muscles comprise a smaller proportion of type I muscle fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and present reduced metabolic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, alteration of the neural control of upper aiways are also present in OSA patients: peripheral sensory neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], hypoglossal motor neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and abnormal respiratory-related cortical adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have been reported. These abnormalities may contribute to obstructive events during sleep by promoting upper airways unstability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This probably explains why &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; treatment, such as pharyngeal muscle retraining which acts via a combination of increased strength of the genioglossus, the main dilator muscle of the upper airways, and neuromodulating adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], has been shown to effectively reduce the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is an autonomic nervous system ganglion that relays mixed cranial nerves innervating the upper airways. The SPG is situated in the pterygopalatine fossa, posterior to the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus and inferior to the junction of the body of the sphenoid, the greater wing and pterygoid process of the sphenoid, lateral to the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, and medial to the pterygomaxillary fissure. It receives parasympathetic and sympathetic sensory afferents via fibres derived from the accessory branch of the facial nerve (VIIb) and the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2). It distributes these fibres to the nasal mucosa, lacrimal glands, nasopharynx and soft palate, including some of the upper airway dilator muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It could therefore play an important role in control of upper airway stability, by modulating nasal congestion, and/or upper airways muscles tone throughout the respiratory cycle. The SPG is targeted in the treatment of cluster headache, based on the fact that parasympathetic hyperactivity plays an important role in its physiopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Postganglionic parasympathetic blockade of the SPG by local anaesthesia or implanted stimulation alleviates pain and nasal congestion in cluster headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Intraoral myofascial therapy of the SPG is widely used in osteopathic practice, for the management of nasal obstruction, chronic rhinitis and snoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is possible that this therapy allows to obtain muscle relaxation and to relieve pain in patients with temporomandibular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Clinical experience and upublished observations also suggest reduction of snoring (reflecting upper airway instability during sleep) after osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) of the SPG. On the basis of the above reasoning, weakly supported by unpublished reports from practitionners, it seemed interesting to test the hypothesis that OMT of the SPG could improve upper airway stability in OSAS patients. We designed a randomized, crossover, double-blind, controlled (active manipulation vs. sham manipulation) proof-of-concept trial, in which the primary endpoint was determination of upper airway critical closing pressure in awake subjects (Pcrit; defined as the negative pressure beyond which the upper airways collapse, and recognized as an index of upper airway collapsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). This study was retrospectively registered in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrial.gov">clinicaltrial.gov</ext-link> registry on 1st September 2010 under reference NCT01193738.

The osteopath wore gloves and was seated next to the patient on the opposite side to the first SPG to be treated. One of the osteopath&#x02019;s hands was placed with the palm open in contact with the patient&#x02019;s vertex to stabilize the patient&#x02019;s head. The patient was asked to open the mouth and shift the mandible laterally towards the side of the SPG to be treated. The osteopath then applied pressure to the SPG with the fifth finger of his free hand in the patient&#x02019;s mouth, ascending along the alveolar process of the maxilla to reach the pterygoid process. The osteopath then ascended his finger cephalically and medially towards the SPG, and then immobilized his hand until relaxation of the external pterygoid muscle (about 15&#x000a0;s) before advancing medially and cephalically into the pterygopalatine fossa as far as the SPG. The osteopath then exerted light pressure on the SPG with the pulp of his fifth finger until release of the tissues. He then performed contralateral SPG release according to the same technique.

The pressure/flow relationship was established to measure the critical closing pressure, Pcrit, defined as the negative pressure inducing upper airway collapse (absence of flow). Pcrit was determined while awake, according to the method validated by Su et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, the patient was installed in the supine position with the head resting in a neutral position on a flat pillow. The position of the head was maintained with a foam collar. A nasal mask was applied and connected to a circuit allowing the generation of increasing negative pressures. Flow and pressure in the mask were measured through a mouthpiece and a pneumotachograph (Hans Rudolph Model 4700; Hans Rudolph, Inc., Kansas City, MO). Pcrit was then estimated by linear regression by reporting pressure and flow values at each imposed pressure phase.

<italic>Evaluation of lacrimation induced by</italic> AM and SM was performed using Schirmer&#x02019;s test according to a validated method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] during administration of AM and SM. Schirmer&#x02019;s test consists of placing a calibrated strip of blotting paper in the lower conjunctival fornix of both eyes to absorb tears, and then measuring the length of moistened blotting paper. Strips of blotting paper were placed immediately before the first osteopathic manipulation of the SPG (AM or SM) and the duration of pressure applied to the SPG was measured.

The allocation concealment was secured as follows. A research nurse not participating in the study itself was responsible for the random sequence generation and for treatment allocation. After the physician responsible for the clinical investigation (&#x0201c;investigator&#x0201d;) had confirmed the eligibility and collected baseline data of a given patient during visit 1, the research nurse provided the osteopath performing the AM and SM maneuver with this patient&#x02019;s allocation, outside the knowledge of the investigator. The osteopath was himself ignorant of the randomization list as a whole. The investigator was not present when the osteopath performed the maneuvers, and was therefore blinded to the allocation when subsequently analyzing the data. As a result, both the patient and the investigator analyzing the data were blinded to the allocation. The osteopath was not involved in any manner in the data analysis. At the end of the study and to check a possible de-blindind, the participants were asked to indicate which of the two manipulations they believed was the active one.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size and statistical methods</title><p id="Par28">The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients considered as responders, as follows.

More generally, this is the first study to demonstrate the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment on this endpoint.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="Par44">In the absence of any possibility to blind the osteopath performing the maneuver, we adopted a strategy derived from the &#x0201c;PROBE&#x0201d; concept (Prospective, Randomized, Open, Blinded, End-Point) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], consisting of assessment of the endpoints by an investigator blinded to the nature of the intervention. However, in contrast to the PROBE design, we kept the patients blind to the treatment received. To this aim, particular attention was paid to the sham technique (same position of the patient and the osteopath, same instructions, same position of the osteopath&#x02019;s hand, same duration). A significant difference was observed between AM and SM in terms of the pain induced by the intervention, but in the end, debriefing showed that 3 patients could not decide which manipulation was the active one and that the 6 who thought that they had identified the active manipulation were wrong. We therefore believe that the blinding of the patients was successful (without deblinding) and, as a result, that this randomized crossover controlled trial can be considered double-blind (patients and endpoint allocators). It complies with current guidelines (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We acknoledge that ideally the study should have been triple-blinded (Osteopath, Investigator, Patient), but due to the nature of the intervention (manual therapy), it was not possible to blind the Osteopath. Although triple-blind could not be achieved, we submit that the design of the study constitutes its major strong point. Of note, based on the clinical experience of osteopaths performing SPG manipulation, a difference was also expected in terms of the lacrimation induced by the two interventions. However, only a non-significant trend towards a difference in lacrimation was observed (more marked lacrimation after AM).</p><p id="Par45">Pcrit was used as the primary endpoint. Pcrit is a validated index of upper airway collapsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which has already been used in studies on OSAS, either during sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] or in awake patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in pathophysiology studies or to evaluate the efficacy of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In our study, we decided to evaluate Pcrit in awake patients for obvious practical reasons. Consequently, the results of this study cannot be extrapolated to sleep and further studies therefore need to be conducted in sleeping patients. Nevertheless, the choice of Pcrit in awake patients as the primary efficacy endpoint of osteopathic manipulation of the SPG in the context of a pilot study appears to be justified in view of the known abnormalities of upper airway stability in awake patients with OSAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and the known abnormalities of ventilatory control (see introduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Pcrit measured in awake patients has been shown to be correlated with the contractile and metabolic properties of upper airway muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]: it therefore appears reasonable to consider that Pcrit could constitute a relevant index to test the effect of an intervention with a presumed neuromodulation mechanism. The cut-off of &#x02212;4&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O used to define responding patients in this study is consistent with various data reported in the literature. For example, a study conducted in 54 OSAS patients showed that a&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;3.0&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O variation of Pcrit during sleep was sufficient to confirm improvement of upper airway stability in response to a therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A -4&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O variation of Pcrit in awake patients corresponds to a sufficient increase of upper airway stability to avoid the obstructive events on inspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], as, at each inspiration, the diaphragm produces a negative pressure that tends to close the upper airways and generate obstructive events when it is not counterbalanced by contraction of upper airway dilator muscles, mainly genioglossus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Increased diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and greater stability of the upper airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] are therefore observed during inspiration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Clinical and pathophysiological considerations</title><p id="Par46">A significantly higher proportion of patients experienced a&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O improvement of Pcrit at 30&#x000a0;min after AM than after SM, reflecting a significant effect of AM on upper airway stability. However, the difference in relative variation of Pcrit between AM and SM was not significant due to a lack of power induced by the marked interindividual variability, as a total of 66 subjects would have been necessary under two-sided conditions, with a power of 90% and a type I error of 0.05 to demonstrate a significant difference between the two groups on the basis of the values observed. Future studies will therefore need to determine the characteristics of responding patients.</p><p id="Par47">In several patients, AM unblocked the nose and induced a series of sensory and somatosensory sensations, not observed after SM, suggesting autonomic neuromodulation, possibly via postganglionic parasympathetic blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as similar features have been described during implanted electrical stimulation of the SPG, used for the treatment of cluster headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. One patient in our study reported resolution of latent headache present for 6 months, thereby supporting the hypothesis of a similar type of neuromodulation mechanism induced by osteopathic manipulation of the SPG. The target of action of OMT could prove to be the proximal pharynx, as several patients reported easier nose breathing after AM, and the proximal pharynx corresponds to the zone of distribution of nerve fibres derived from the SPG. It could be useful to measure nasal obstruction by nasal peak flow meter in a subsequent study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par48">Despite the small sample size, this study identified a possible effect of a single osteopathic manipulation of the SPG on upper airway stability in awake patients, but does not justify any conclusions concerning the efficacy of this intervention in the treatment of OSAS. These preliminary results need to be confirmed by studies based on larger sample sizes and comprising evaluation of the apnoea-hypopnoea index. The choice to study the effect of a single osteopathic technique and to apply identical treatment to all patients allowed us to precisely identify the effects of this technique by minimizing possible biases. We are aware that this approach does not constitute the classical approach in osteopathic manipulative treatment, in which treatment is generally adapted to the patient&#x02019;s needs and a combination of several techniques is usually proposed. This study suggests that osteopathic manipulation of the SPG induces a neuromodulation effect and improves the stability of the pharynx, but the mechanism of action and the duration of the effects produced cannot be more precisely defined. Although inhibition of postganglionic parasympathetic activity by osteopathic manipulation of the SPG appears likely, especially in view of resolution of blocked nose, modulation of sympathetic activity cannot be excluded in view of the increased lacrimation observed in some patients. The duration of the effect of OMT could not be determined in the present study. Nevertheless, a free interval of 3 weeks appeared to be sufficient to ensure the absence of a carryover effect. Finally, this study suggest the existence of responding patients, but their precise profile could not be identified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">This study validates the feasibility of randomized, double-blind, controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy of osteopathic manipulation of the SPG in OSAS patients, particularly by validation of a sham osteopathic manipulation technique. These results provide the proof of concept of a significant effect of osteopathic manipulation of the SPG on upper airway stability in OSAS patients. Certain elements (relief of nasal obstruction, lacrimation, somatosensory sensations) suggest a neuromodulation mechanism of action of osteopathic manipulation of the SPG on the pharyngeal region. These data must be confirmed by a study on a larger sample size of patients, based on a more specific efficacy endpoint of OSAS, such as the apnoea-hypopnoea index.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
