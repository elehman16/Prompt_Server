manipulation, based on passive motion analysis (MBPMA) and general mobilization, on
cervical lordosis, forward head posture (FHP), and cervical ROM in university students
with problems in cervical posture and range of motion (ROM). [Subjects] The Subjects were
40 university students in their 20s who displayed problems in cervical posture and ROM;
they were divided into an MBPMA group (n=20) and a mobilization group (n=20). [Methods]
Each group underwent MBPMA or mobilization three times a week for four weeks. The effects
of MBPMA and mobilization on cervical lordosis, FHP, and cervical ROM were analyzed by
radiography. [Results] MBPMA was effective in increasing the cervical lordosis, cervical
extension ROM (CER), and ranges of flexion and extension motion (RFEM) and in decreasing
FHP. Mobilization was effective in increasing CER and decreasing FHP. [Conclusion] MBPMA
can be utilized as an effective method for decreasing FHP and improving cervical lordosis
and cervical ROM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Manipulation</kwd><kwd>Motion analysis</kwd><kwd>Cervical ROM</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>VDT (Visual Display Terminal) syndrome refers to all complex health problems occurring in
persons who use smartphones or computers for prolonged periods. A person with VDT syndrome
has a misaligned posture called Forward Head Posture (FHP) in which the head sits too far
forward on the trunk<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cervical extension
range of motion (ROM) is adversely affected by FHP, and this has a great effect on daily
living. The upper cervical spine in people with FHP experiences hyperextension, but other
areas of the cervical spine show increased flexion, thereby limiting extension<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some research shows that a larger cervical
extension ROM reduces the FHP and increases the endurance of the deep neck flexor<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies have therefore focused on
how to increase cervical ROM. For example, spinal manipulative therapy<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, the activator technique<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, the diversified technique<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and sustained natural apophyseal glides (SNAGS)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> have been reported as effective methods for
improving cervical ROM. The limitation of extension in the cervical ROM can adversely affect
daily living due to headache and dizziness, and SNAGS were reported to be effective in
increasing extension ROM<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
studies of the existing manual therapies for increasing cervical ROM have not analyzed
passive motion in individual subjects.</p><p>The aim of the present study was therefore to use cervical joint manipulation based on
passive motion analysis to determine the effects on cervical lordosis, FHP, and cervical ROM
of university students with abnormal posture and range of motion (ROM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 200 university students attending D University in South
Korea. Of them, 80 students who had a problem with their cervical posture and ROM were
selected through visual inspection and underwent radiography, allowing selection of 40
subjects who complained of chronic cervical pain and whose cervical lordosis angle was less
than 21&#x000b0;<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, FHP was over 15&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and extension ROM and flexion ROM were
below 70&#x000b0; and 35&#x000b0;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> respectively. These
40 subjects were randomly grouped into two manipulation groups: a passive motion analysis
(MBPMA) group as the experimental group and a general mobilization group as the control
group. Patients with a history of surgical treatment of their cervical spine, rheumatoid
disease, neck pain accompanying pressure fractures, and nervous system problems found in
analyses of their cervical spine were excluded. This study was approved by the university&#x02019;s
institutional review board, and the subjects were safely protected during all of the
processes of the experiment. All of the subjects understood the purpose of this study and
provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean age of the MBPMA group (10 males
and 10 females) was 22.4&#x000b1;2.3&#x02005;years, and their mean height and weight were 168.0&#x000b1;3.6&#x02005;cm and
58.9&#x000b1;6.3&#x02005;kg, respectively, while the values for the mobilization group (10 males and 10
females) were 23.1&#x000b1;3.1&#x02005;years, 167.9&#x000b1;3.6&#x02005;cm, and 59.1&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;kg, respectively. No statistically
significant difference was determined between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05), confirming that
the two groups were homogenous.</p><p>In this study, the absolute rotation angle (ARA) was chosen as the cervical lordosis
measurement method used to determine changes in cervical lordosis, FHP, and anterior weight
bearing (AWB)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> to determine cervical
ROM. Cervical extension ROM (CER), cervical flexion ROM (CFR), and ranges of flexion and
extension motion (RFEM)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> were imaged and
measured via the lateral view of the cervical spine. The images were obtained using X-ray
equipment (MDXP-40, Anyang, South Korea) by the same radiographer from a distance of 1&#x02005;m.
The film size was 14&#x000d7;14 inches.</p><p>The MBPMA group had a 10-min manipulation session three times a week for four weeks. The
characteristics of the manipulation received by the experimental group were aimed at
increasing flexion, extension, and side bending ROM by checking the cervical facet joint ROM
via passive motion analysis. In the passive motion analysis group, subjects lay down on the
table in the supine position, and the 7th cervical vertebra (C7) was placed on the table
while the other segments above C7 were placed off the table. A therapist held the occipital
region of the subject in one hand and the C6 spinous processes (SP) in the other hand using
the radial side of the 2nd metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and pushed the occipital region
down slowly to check the mobility of the C5 and C6 joints. This method was used to check the
extension ROM of each joint in the cervical spine by holding the C5, C4, and C2 SPs. For
joints whose extension ROM mobility was decreased, extension ROM of right facet joint was
accurately inspected by the therapist by holding the occipital region in one hand after
right (Rt.) rotation of the head and neck of the subject by about 15&#x000b0; and holding the right
articular pillar in the centrum below the joints. The same method was also used to check
left (Lt.) facet mobility. After inspection, manipulation was applied by accurately locating
the joints whose extension ROM was restricted. For example, manipulation was applied while
performing extension with Rt. side bending at Rt. C4&#x02013;5 to close only Rt. C4&#x02013;5 of the subject
as much as possible in order to increase ROM in the Rt. C4&#x02013;5 facet. Here, the movement of
joints other than Rt. C4&#x02013;5 were avoided as much as possible. In order to increase flexion
ROM, flexion with Rt. side bending of the subject, in the same supine position, was induced
to occur at the C5&#x02013;6 joints to check the open ROM in the Lt. C5&#x02013;6 facets, and manipulation
was applied by checking mobility while preventing movement of the other surrounding
joints.</p><p>This method allowed inspection of the ROM of many left and right joints in the cervical
spine to be performed and manipulation to be applied. In order to increase side bending ROM,
flexion with Rt. side bending of the subject, in the same supine position, was induced to
occur at the C5&#x02013;6 joints to check the open ROM in the Lt. C5&#x02013;6 facets, and manipulation was
applied by checking mobility while preventing movement of other surrounding joints. Using
this method, ROM of many left and right joints in the cervical spine was inspected and
manipulation was applied. The control group received 15-min cervical mobilization sessions
three times a week for four weeks.</p><p>The experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). After the general characteristics of the subjects were determined, paired t-tests were
used to compare the changes in ARA, AWB, CER, CFR, and RFEM between before and after the
experiment in each group. The differences between the 2 groups were tested using independent
t-tests. The statistical significance level, &#x003b1;, was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The ARA, AWB, CER, and RFEM were higher in the MBPMA group after the experiment, while the

treatment, which included passive motion analysis, was more effective than mobilization. The
mobility of the cervical right and left facet joints of the subjects in the MBPMA group was
inspected in the supine position, and the joints that had restriction in ROM were accurately
located; manipulation was then applied while movement in the surrounding joints was
prevented. Future studies should examine the immediate effects of MBPMA, as well as focus on
the application of MBPMA to lateral flexion and rotations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hickey</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><name><surname>Rondeau</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Corrent</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Reliability of the cervical range of motion device and
