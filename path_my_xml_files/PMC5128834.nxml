Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders are common among women who have recently given birth<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which is a population subgroup of substantial size. These disorders have a significant impact on the well-being of women at a pivotal time in the life of the mother, baby and wider family.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is an associated burden on the public sector; for example, women with postnatal depression (PND) have higher use of health and other services than their non-depressed counterparts, not limited to greater use of mental health services.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref></p><p>Research on the cost-effectiveness of interventions to prevent the development of postnatal distress, depression and anxiety has shown mixed results. A programme of structured midwife-led care was found to improve postnatal mental health without increasing costs;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> counselling and support for women at high risk of PND<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and peer support<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> were found to reduce symptoms or duration of depression but at a higher cost; and postnatal support worker home visits<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> were found to increase costs with no associated improvement in mental health. Preventive approaches that address the woman's relationship with her spouse or partner have shown some promise in terms of clinical effectiveness;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> however, there has been little research into the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.</p><p><italic>What Were We Thinking</italic> (<italic>WWWT</italic>) is a psychoeducational intervention that targets the parental partner relationship, management of infant behaviour and parental fatigue. A community-based before and after controlled study found that <italic>WWWT</italic> reduced postnatal mental health problems among women with no history of psychiatric disorders.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The Sleep, Parenting and Relationships in a Community Setting (SPARCS) trial was subsequently conducted to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of <italic>WWWT</italic> for the prevention of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders in women at 6&#x02005;months postpartum.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The intervention was delivered soon after birth to first-time parents (FTPs) in the setting of Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) in Victoria, Australia. MCHCs are a publicly funded universal service for families of children up to school age, with the goal to &#x02018;promote healthy outcomes for children and their families&#x02019; (ref. <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, p. <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). High participation rates are a stated policy objective in pursuance of this goal; more than 90% of families with recent births in Victoria attend MCHCs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> One element of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service is FTP group sessions, which focus on parent&#x02013;child interactions, parenting confidence, emotional well-being and support for FTPs.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Public sector decision-makers have made a commitment to using evidence to inform modifications to the MCH service model.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A complexity of developing appropriate evidence is that in Victoria, early childhood service costs (including MCHCs) fall under the Department of Education and Training (formerly the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development). This means that funding of MCHCs is shared between the Department of Education and Training and Local Governments, rather than sitting within health, despite the clear health focus of the MCH service.</p><p>Economic evaluation provides decision-makers with evidence on how best to allocate limited resources by comparing the alternatives in terms of costs and outcomes. In cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA), outcomes are expressed in natural or clinical units, such as symptom improvement or life years saved. In cost-utility analyses (CUA), outcomes are expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which take into account differences in life span and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). QALYs are generally preferred in health economic evaluations as they facilitate allocative decisions between interventions with different outcomes,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and there are data to guide what might be considered cost-effective in terms of QALYs. However, studies in prevention of postnatal mental health problems often use condition-specific clinical end points, such as cost per month of PND averted.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is not clear what societies would be willing to pay for prevention in terms of these clinical end points. One US study found individuals were willing to pay &#x0223c;9% of their monthly household income for treatment of depression,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and a German study found that people were willing to pay personally for prevention of depression;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> however, neither informs us of societal-level willingness-to-pay (WTP) for prevention of depression. Although not an official threshold, US$50&#x02005;000 per QALY (approximately $A55&#x02005;000 in 2014) is often used as a guide, which could vary with factors such as budget constraints or special consideration of certain populations or diseases.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Other thresholds have been proposed, and vary considerably;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> one study found that Australian WTP for one QALY gain was approximately $A75&#x02005;000,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> while in the UK, a threshold of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000&#x02013;30&#x02005;000 (approximately $A41&#x02005;000&#x02013;61&#x02005;000) per QALY gained is used,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> although Claxton <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> suggest it should be lower, approximately $A31&#x02005;000 (figures adjusted to 2014 terms).</p><p>This paper describes the results of an economic evaluation of <italic>WWWT</italic> conducted alongside the SPARCS trial. The protocols for the clinical study<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and economic evaluation<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> have been published previously, as have the trial results.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This paper presents the results of a CEA and a CUA, and discusses the implications of these results for decision-makers seeking cost-effective interventions for the prevention of postnatal mental health problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The economic evaluation took a public sector perspective (incorporating healthcare, early childhood and social service costs), plus the participant's out-of-pocket (OOP) costs. The time horizon of 6&#x02005;months mirrored the trial follow-up period. No discounting was necessary due to the duration of the follow-up period. Ethical approval was provided by the Southern Health (now Monash Health) Human Research Ethics Committee (11388B) and the Education and Policy Research Committee, Victorian Government Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (now Department of Education and Training) (2012 001472), and the study was registered with the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (CF12/1022-20122000474). Data were collected from participants via computer-assisted telephone interview at baseline (6&#x02005;weeks postpartum) and follow-up (26&#x02005;weeks postpartum).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Sample and setting</title><p>The trial was conducted in Victoria, Australia, with MCHCs as the unit of cluster randomisation.

The cost of delivering the intervention to participants was based on the hourly rate of MCH services. In the base case, it was assumed that MCH nurses would need retraining after 3&#x02005;years, and that six families would attend each FTP group session on average.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>For CEA, the outcome was 30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> For CUA, the outcome was QALYs, with HRQoL measured using the three-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L), and calculated using Australian weights derived using the time trade off approach.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> QALYs were calculated as a linear change in HRQoL over time between baseline and follow-up.</p><p>The EQ-5D is a multiattribute utility instrument<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> that assesses HRQoL over five domains of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. A score of one reflects full health, and zero, death. It is the most frequently used HRQoL measure when estimating QALYs,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and has been used in the postnatal context.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;40</xref> Petrou <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> found, among women at 6&#x02005;months postpartum, an average EQ-5D score of 0.861 (95% CI 0.844 to 0.877), and a statistically significant correlation with PND risk.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Analysis</title><p>Costs and outcomes were adjusted using regression modelling to account for relevant sociodemographic, prognostic and clinical characteristics, including those differing between groups, with the effect of the intervention captured by the inclusion of the trial arm as a variable. All regression models included baseline measures of the participant's psychological well-being and psychiatric history and a measure of the baby's crying behaviour, to account for differences in baseline risks for postnatal mental health problems, plus the baby's age at baseline to account for timing of data points. In addition, the cost model included factors that might influence utilisation of health and other services: level of education, health care card status (a health care card provides access to concessions on pharmaceuticals and medical services for low-income earners and those receiving government benefits) and relative socioeconomic disadvantage of the participant's area of residence.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The outcome models included baseline EQ-5D-3L score to account for baseline HRQoL, plus other factors which might influence quality of life: perceived quality of the intimate partner relationship and level of support, and a measure of adverse life events (for further details regarding measures used in the study, see ref. <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Analyses were performed in STATA V.13 using a generalised linear regression model (GLM) for cost, to allow for the non-normal distribution of costs without requiring transformation of the cost variable,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> a linear regression model for QALYs and a logit model for the binary clinical outcome (presence or absence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders). The specifications of the GLM model for costs were informed by a modified Parks test, resulting in a log link and gamma family,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> while the distribution of QALYs fitted with the assumption of normality in the linear regression model. Since these regression models included different explanatory variables than those included in the clinical evaluation,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the results may differ slightly. Cluster-robust SEs were used to account for randomisation at the level of the MCHC, rather than the individual.</p><p>The main analysis was conducted on participants for whom complete data were collected, and repeated with imputation of missing data. Characteristics of those with missing data were compared with the complete cases using two-sample t-tests and Pearson's &#x003c7;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> tests. Missing values for cost, outcomes and two characteristics (adverse life events and levels of support) used in regression analyses were imputed using the &#x02018;mi impute chained&#x02019; command in STATA with V.30 imputations. Predictive mean matching was used for continuous variables, with logistic regression for binary and ordered logistic regression for ordinal variables, using an imputation model that included characteristics associated with missingness of data as well as the variables in the analytic model.</p><p>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compares the control and intervention groups by dividing the difference in cost by the difference in outcome (each calculated using average marginal effects from the relevant regression model). Uncertainty surrounding the ICER was estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> (resampling with replacement from the original data to produce replicates of the sample), resampling clusters rather than individuals. The distribution of the resulting 2000 estimates of the ICER on the cost-effectiveness plane<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> depicts the joint uncertainty surrounding costs and outcomes. Estimates in the lower right quadrant of a cost-effectiveness plane suggest that the intervention is more effective and less costly, while estimates in the upper right quadrant suggest it is more effective but costlier. Estimates in this quadrant require further analysis to determine if the decision-maker would be willing to allocate the extra expenditure for the extra benefit. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> is used for that purpose, to display the probability that the intervention is cost-effective at a given societal WTP threshold (ie, the proportion of the bootstrapped estimates that fall below the threshold) over a range of thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Scenario analyses</title><p>Cost per QALY was re-estimated under alternative scenarios to explore the results&#x02019; sensitivity to particular assumptions or parameters. (1) Using only variables collected at baseline to adjust cost and outcomes; that is, excluding support and adverse life event variables from the regression models, which were collected at follow-up. (2) Assuming that MCH nurses would require retraining in the intervention after 1&#x02005;year (instead of 3&#x02005;years as in the base case). (3) Assuming that the average number of families per session would be 5 or 7 (rather than 6 as in the base case). (4) Limiting the cost analysis to the health sector, the early childhood sector or combined public sector without participant OOP costs. (5) To test the sensitivity of the results to variation in costs and outcomes, for a worst-case scenario, incremental costs were assumed to be at the upper end of the 95% CI and incremental outcomes at the lower end for each individual, while for a best-case scenario, the reverse assumptions were applied. (6) To test the sensitivity of the results to the specifications of the models, linear regression was used for all three models.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>EQ-5D-3L scores across clinical states</title><p>We also explored the usefulness of the EQ-5D-3L for discriminating between clinical states in postnatal mental health, using the Mann-Whitney U test to investigate whether EQ-5D-3L scores differed significantly between participants with and without major depressive disorder, and those with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression. The Mann-Whitney U test<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> was used because the EQ-5D-3L scores were (as expected) non-normally distributed, with a skew to the upper limit of 1, and so would not meet the assumptions for a two-sample t-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline</title><p>Cluster randomisation resulted in the allocation of 196 participants across 24 MCHCs to the control arm and 204 participants across 24 MCHCs to the intervention arm (although one MCHC in the control arm did not recruit any participants).
