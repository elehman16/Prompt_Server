An especially interesting issue is the possible impact of postmenopausal lack of sex hormone production and replacement therapy on a vessel's immune-inflammatory condition [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Increased levels of those markers are signs of a chronic immune-inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and others [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In current literature, the immune-inflammatory theory of atherosclerosis is widely discussed. Heat shock proteins 60 (HSP60) and their role in the development of the atheromatous plaque are especially underlined. They are intracellular molecules and signaling intercellular proteins, and have the ability to initiate cytokine secretion and expression of cells&#x02019; adhesion molecules. The production of heat shock proteins (also called &#x02018;stress proteins&#x02019;) is stimulated by a sudden increase in intracellular temperature, and by any other kind of cellular stress such as oxidative stress, viral infection, exposure to some chemical substances (e.g. ethanol), cytokines, and heavy metal ions; which all lead to the dysfunction of endothelial cells. The presence of human native HSP60 on a vessel's endothelial surface might lead to an autoimmune reaction, depending on antibody or complement cytotoxic reactions [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The exposure of the host's HSP60 on the endothelial cells and macrophage surfaces causes these cells to be damaged by anti-HSP60 immunoglobulins [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Antibodies of HSP60 are present in small concentration in the blood of healthy individuals; the physiological reaction remains unclear [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>It has been proven that monoclonal antibodies specific for HSP60 and antibodies against the HSP60 &#x02013; a family isolated from human serum have a cytotoxic impact on the endothelium [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that antibodies against HSP60 might play a role in vessel damage and atherosclerosis etiopathogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>HSP60 expression might also be secondary to the inflammatory process when the cytokine expression in the endothelium and in leukocytes leads to a HSP expression in the vessel wall. HSP60 were once considered as intracellular molecules, but these proteins can be released from live cells to the extracellular space through a mechanism which is still unclear [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Extracellular HSP60 are signaling molecules and influence several inflammatory reactions.</p><p>These proteins might have an impact on atherosclerosis development acting as target autoantigens for reactive T cells that damage their own HSP60 [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Having knowledge about the beneficial influence of estrogens on healthy endothelial cells as well as the inflammatory theory of atherosclerosis, we carried out the study aimed to illustrate the influence of three different forms of hormonal protocols on the behavior of antibodies against HSP60 in healthy postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms, and compared these results to the control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Series description, inclusion criteria</title><p>The study was carried out on 90 women hospitalized or treated in the outpatient clinic at the Endocrinological Gynecology Department, Jagiellonian University between 2007 and 2012.

The study was done for a period of 6 months, during which there were no lifestyle changes, only observation of whether or not quality of life improved (measured by the Green Scale). No other drugs due to chronic illnesses were taken. Three groups of 30 randomized patients were formed.

The immunological response to human heat shock proteins should therefore be further explored [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Our original study is one of the few papers investigating the influence of different forms of hormonal therapy on the behavior of antibodies against HSP60 in healthy postmenopausal women.
