(WBV) on static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and the disability of patients with
chronic lower back pain. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were of 40 patients, who were
randomly assigned to WBV and control groups. Twenty-five minutes of lumbar stability
training and 5 minutes of WBV were conducted for the WBV group, and 30 minutes of lumbar
stability training was conducted for the control group. The training was conducted three
times per week for a total of 6 weeks. Static balance, spinal curvature, pain, and
disability were measured before and after the intervention. [Results] After the
intervention, the WBV group showed a significant differences in static balance, spinal
curvature, pain, and disability. The control group presented significant differences in
pain, and disability. In the comparison of the two groups, the WBV group showed more
significant improvements in the fall index and pain. [Conclusion] WBV can be recommended
for the improvement of the balance ability and pain of chronic lower back pain
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Whole body vibration</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) not only induces a decline in balance but also lowers proprioception by
inducing instability in the lumbar region, which is followed by weakening of the deep lumbar
muscles or repetitive trauma, collectively lowering neuromuscular control capacity and
coordination of the muscles. In order to resolve the problems of lower back pain, motor
control of the lumbopelvic region needs to be recovered<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Particularly, as the loss of prioprioception induces neuromuscular
functional dysfunction and spinal segment instability, the treatment approach for the
recovery of proprioception elicits posture control ability and improvements in the quality
of life of patients with LBP through improvement of muscular control, coordination of
muscles, and the recovery of stability in the spinal segments<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies have recommend a treatment method using WBV exercise
as a method of improving pain, functional dysfunction, and the proprioception of patients
with LBP<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. WBV is a convenient and safe
method of directly stimulating the muscles and tendons, and can be applied in to various
positions for pain alleviation and functional recovery of patients with chronic LBP<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>WBV has been reported to improve bone density, lower muscular pain and functional
dysfunction<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and improve muscle
strength<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the study of WBV is
insufficient as previous studies only examined pain, functional dysfunction, and improvement
in muscle strength. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the changes in
balance ability, lumbar curvature, pain, and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) of patients
with LBP after the application of WBV during lumbar stability training, to examine the
effects of WBV on patients with chronic LBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subject were 40 patients with LBP working in a business located in C city. Those who
fully comprehended the procedure of this study and voluntarily agreed to participate were
selected as subjects. This study was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. Those with over 12 weeks of continuous LBP and without acute
neurologic symptoms were selected. Those with tissue damage such as acute herniated nucleus
pulposus, inflammation, or others, those suffering from heart disease, and those who were
pregnant were excluded.</p><p>For the delivery of low frequency WBV, a Galileo 2000 (Novotec, Pforzheim, Germany) was
used. It delivers vibration to both lower extremities. The range of the vibration frequency
is 1&#x02013;50 Hz and amplitude of the frequency can be controlled without restriction. In the
present study, a frequency of 18&#x02005;Hz, as in a previous study<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, was applied for 5 minutes. The subjects were positioned so that
there was slight flexion of the knee joints and lumbar lordosis while they stood comfortably
on the platform of the vibration device.</p><p>Lumbar stability training was conducted to elicit independent contractions and muscular
reinforcement of the deep abdominal muscles, contraction of the deep abdominal muscles which
contribute to lumbar stability in certain positions, and global muscles which perform using
a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU). The lumbar stability training comprised static and
dynamic stability training methods<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In static lumbar stability training, movements to maintain contraction of the transversus
abdominis (TrA) were sufficiently performed as measured by a PBU. The subjects were educated
how to perform proper contraction of TrA, and maintain the stability of the lumbar region
during the exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The training was
executed in the prone and supine positions.</p><p>For the supine position, the PBU was placed under the lumbar spine and the pressure was
inflated to 40 mmHg after checking that subjects could comfortably breathe while holding the
position. The pressure was gradually increased in 2-mmHg steps from 40 to 48 mmHg. For the
prone position, PBU was placed under the navel and the pressure was increased to 70 mmHg.
Then, the pressure was reduced to 60 mmHg by drawing in the abdomen under the navel toward
the lumbar region. The training time was at least 10 seconds, and 5 seconds of rest was
given between each maneuver in the two positions. Each maneuver was repeated in twice for
each stage and repeated was a total of 10 times.</p><p>Dynamic stability training was performed using the movements of the upper and lower
extremities in the side-lying and supine positions. The PBU inflated to 50 mmHg after
placing it under the side, and sunjects lowered the pressure to 40 mmHg by drawing in the
abdomen to the lumbar region. Then, 3 sets of motions were preformed, counting 4 times of
hip joint abduction and adduction as 1 set. Five seconds rest was given between sets, and a
1-minute rest between the positions<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The training was supervised by an
experimenter to ensure the tasks were performed correctly.</p><p>For pain assessment, a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used in order to assess the
pain of subjects. VAS is an assessment method which has high reproducibility, high validity
(r=0.77), and reliability (r=0.99), express the intensity of their pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Korean Oswestry disability index (KODI) was used for the disability index. The KODI is
an assessment tool that was developed as a self-administrated survey by Fairbank et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> to measure the functional dysfunction of
patients with LBP and it has been revised to create many versions. The discomfort and levels
of disability sensed by the patients in the 10 sections of pain intensity, personal care,
lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sexual life, social life, and traveling are
indicated on a scale of 0&#x02013;5 points. Then, the total sum of the responses was divided by the
maximum possible value and converted to a percentage (%) by multiplying by 100%. Higher
scores signify higher levels of functional dysfunction. The test-retest reliability of KODI
has been presented to be high (r=0.92).</p><p>Thoracic and lumbar spinal curvature assessment were measured using 3D tomography
(Backmapper, Formetric, Diers, 2011, German). For the measurement, the subjects were
instructed to show their back to the camera after removing their tops and lowering their
underwear so that the sacrum could be partially seen. Then, they were instructed to relax
their body by standing with their feet apart at shoulder width with their arms hanging
naturally by their sides. The experimenter attached stickers to the C7, sacrum apex, left
posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), right PSIS, and the right and left scapula inferior
angles, which were identified by direct palpation, in order to mark the anatomical points
for the analysis. The measurement was completed in 0.04 seconds, and lumbar lordosis and
thoracic kyphosis were automatically computed.</p><p>Static balance assessment was measured using a Tetrax (Sunlight Medical, Ramat Gan, 2012,
Israel), which performs diagnosis and examinations of posturography. The assessment of the
vestibular organ, visual sense, somatic-sensory, and the central nervous system was
performed, and the fall index was computed by calculating the average. Postural sway was of
the center of pressure (COP) was measured by pressure sensors with subjects standing on the
platform. A low fall index signifies fair balance ability.</p><p>SPSS version 18.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used
for the general characteristics of the subjects and the paired t-test was conducted for
within-group comparisons of the vibration and control groups between before and after the
intervention. For comparison of the groups, the independent t-test was carried out. Level of
significance was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were 12 males and 8 females in the vibration group and 9 males and 11 females in the
control group. The average age of the vibration group was 32.80 and that of the control
group was 30.95. Weight, height and BMI of the vibration group were 70.76&#x02005;kg, 170.10&#x02005;cm, and
24.37&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively and those of the control group were 66.61&#x02005;kg,
168.43&#x02005;cm, and 23.33&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. There were no significant differences in
the general characteristics between groups. Significant differences were found after the
intervention in the WBV group for the fall index, spinal balance, lordosis angle, VAS score,
and ODI score (p&#x0003c;0.01), and for spinal balance, VAS scale, and ODI score in the control
group (p&#x0003c;0.01). In the comparison of the groups, more significant improvements were found
in the WBV group for the fall index and VAS score compared to the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05)

with chronic LBP in this study. WBV was reported to activate mechanotransduction similar to
exercise in a previous study<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
subjects who suffer from loss of proprioception and balance ability, the application of WBV
has been reported to increase the muscle strength around the lumbar region by activating the
mechanoreceptors of contractile and non-contractile tissues in the lumbo-pelvic region and
to assist the recovery of proprioception through the improvement of muscle coordination<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study also suggested that
vibration stimulation in the standing position has a positive effect on postural balance
ability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. After applying diverse
vibration stimulation (10, 60, 120&#x02005;Hz) to healthy elderly females, there was improvement in
proprioception of their knee joints<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and the application of WBV to healthy elderly persons was reported to have enhanced their
balance ability and reduced their fall index scores<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Richardson et al.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that lumbar stability training reduced pain and the
disability index scores and enhanced the balance ability through activating the deep abdomen
muscles strength and enhancing the coordination of the muscles. There was a statistically
significant change in the balance index after lumbar stability training in this study,
similar to the results of previous studies. As noted above, previous studies have reported
that lumbar stability training and WBV improve the balance ability and helps the recovery of
proprioception, muscle strength, and muscle coordination.</p><p>Due to the limitation of function by pain, a flat back is induced in patients with LBP, and
reducting of lumbar lordosis. Arokoski et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that lumbar stability training for patients with LBP
changes the lumbar structure by fostering the lumbar stability and the activation of the
deep abdomen muscles. Furthermore it reduces pain, which restricts in function, and ODI. The
results of this study are similar to the findings of previous studies, showing significant
increases in lumbar lordosis after the intervention in both the vibration and control
group.</p><p>The application of WBV in this study was effective at alleviating the pain of patients with
chronic LBP. WBV stimulates receptors Pacinian corpuscle and Meissner corpuscles which
endure the vibration and stimulates interneurons within the spinal cord by delivering
signals through myelinated fiber A-beta fiber. Also, it suppresses the pain transmitted by
C-fiber or A-delta fiber<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. WBV reduces
pain and ODI score through recovery of functional dysfunction caused by back pain with the
activation of muscular contractions through stimulation of the somato-sensory system,
thereby restoring nerve roots control ability<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stability training has been reported to reduce pain and ODI
scores through positive effects on functional movement by fostering stability of the spinal
segments and recovery of nerve root control ability, improving postural balance, and
recovering a flexibility of posture and movement<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, lumbar stability training in this study was also
effective at decreasing pain and ODI scores, and it was more effective at alleviating pain
when cinducted with WBV compared to sole application of lumbar stability training.
Furthermore, Rittweger et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that a combination of the Mckenzie Exercise and vibration treatment for 12 weeks was
effective at alleviating pain and recovering the function of patients with chronic LBP. The
results of this study show there were a significant decreases in pain and ODI scores after
the administration of lumbar stability training and WBV for patients with chronic LBP, and
these results are in agreement with the results of previous studies.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the inability to generalize the results due to small the
number of subjects partcipating in this study and the absence of data on the WBV
administration times that optimize the treatment effect. Lastly, there was no control of the
subjects except during the intervention periods. The verification of the effects of WBV
should be carried out in future studies after addressing the limitations of this study.</p><p>In conclusion, for positive effects on static balance and pain of patients with chronic
LBP, WBV should be applied together with lumbar stability training for more significant
effects than the application of lumbar stability training alone. Therefore, we suggest the
combination of lumbar stability training and WBV to enhance in balance ability and decrease
the lumbar pain of patients with chronic LBP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hodges</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hides</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic Exercise for Lumbopelvic Stabilization: A Motor Control
