To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-use IgE immunoadsorber column (IgEnio). IgEnio is based on a recombinant, IgE-specific antibody fragment and can be used for the specific extracorporeal desorption of IgE.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To study safety and efficacy of IgEnio regarding the selective depletion of IgE in a randomized, open-label, controlled pilot trial in patients with allergic asthma and to investigate if IgEnio can bind IgE-Omalizumab immune complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifteen subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) or to the control group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5). Immunoadsorption was done by veno-venous approach, processing the twofold calculated plasma volume during each treatment. A minimum average IgE-depletion of 50% after the last cycle in the intention-to-treat population was defined as primary endpoint. Safety of the treatment was studied as secondary endpoint. In addition, possible changes in allergen-specific sensitivity were investigated, as well as clinical effects by peak flow measurement and symptom-recording. The depletion of IgE-Omalizumab immune complexes was studied <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02096237" id="ir0005">NCT02096237</ext-link>) and conducted from December 2013 to July 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>IgE immunoadsorption with IgEnio selectively depleted 86.2% (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.1% SD) of IgE until the end of the last cycle (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).

Asthma represents one of the most severe manifestations of allergy because of its chronic course, strong impact on quality of life and severe, life-threatening symptoms (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Holgate, 2012</xref>). Sensitization to airborne allergens from indoor allergen sources such as house dust mite, pets, mold and cockroach is a causative factor for asthma (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 1985</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Pollart et al., 1989</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Konradsen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, severe exacerbations are frequently observed after seasonal exposure to allergens from birch, grass, cypress and ragweed pollen (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Pollart et al., 1988</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Suphioglu et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000e4;ppi et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Midoro-Horiuti et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In allergic asthma, symptoms are caused by allergen-induced cross-linking of IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and basophils and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Holgate, 2012</xref>). IgE may also play a major role in T cell activation through IgE-facilitated allergen presentation (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Mudde et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">van der Heijden et al., 1993</xref>). T cell-derived cytokines such as IL-5 (Interleukin 5) and IL-13 contribute to mucus secretion and eosinophilic infiltration, respectively, both of which are involved in airway remodeling (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Holgate, 2012</xref>). Since IgE antibodies play a central role in allergic asthma, several therapeutic strategies targeting IgE or the underlying Th2 (T helper 2 cell) immune response have evolved or are currently in clinical evaluation (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Holgate, 2014</xref>). These strategies target cytokines which are involved in Th2-driven allergic asthma (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Wenzel et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bel et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Ortega et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gauvreau et al., 2014</xref>) or focus directly on IgE antibodies (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">O'Byrne and Tworek, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Molimard et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Humbert et al., 2014</xref>). Omalizumab, a therapeutic anti-IgE antibody preventing IgE from binding to its high-affinity receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI), is effective for the treatment of severe allergic asthma. According to clinical studies, it reduces exacerbations and the need for steroids (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Molimard et al., 2010</xref>). One major drawback of injected Omalizumab is that its applicability is limited by a weight-dependent maximum level of total IgE up to which it can be administered, i.e., 1500&#x000a0;U/ml within the EU (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">EMA, 2015</xref>) and 700&#x000a0;U/ml in the US (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2015</xref>), respectively. This precludes many polysensitized patients with severe symptoms from anti-IgE treatment. In the present study, we report results from a clinical trial where an IgE-immunoadsorber, termed IgEnio, was used to treat subjects suffering from allergic asthma. Efficacy of IgE-depletion and safety of the treatment were studied as primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. In addition, several immunological and clinical parameters were assessed to investigate possible effects of the treatment on IgE-driven mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Description of the Medical Device IgEnio</title><p>IgEnio (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) is a single-use, IgE-specific immunoadsorber column based on a single-chain variable fragment, ScFv12 (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lupinek et al., 2009</xref>) (BM10, Biomay, Vienna, Austria), for the selective removal of IgE from plasma of allergic patients by extracorporeal immunoadsorption.

Diagnosis of allergic asthma was established by patient's history, measurement of allergen-specific IgE, skin prick testing (SPT) and by bronchial provocation with methacholine. Asthma-severity was graded according to guidelines of the German Medical Association (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bundes&#x000e4;rztekammer, 2009</xref>) that are based on GINA-guidelines (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">GINA, 2007</xref>), the British Thoracic Society guidelines on the management of asthma (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">BTS, 2010</xref>) and guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">NHLBI, 2007</xref>).

Control visits were scheduled two weeks after the last treatment of each cycle, the final visit was planned for the 5th week after the last cycle. Subjects allocated to the control group were seen accordingly, but with 2 visits only in those weeks that corresponded to treatment weeks.

At screening, control- and follow-up visits, all patients were subjected to clinical examinations including lung function assessment, titrated skin prick testing, urine- and blood-collection. For the complete study duration, patients recorded results from daily peak flow measurements (Vitalograph peak-flow-meter, North Buckinghamshire, UK), symptom severity (general well-being graded by visual analogue scale [VAS]; eye-, nose- and lung-specific symptoms: severe, moderate, mild or no symptoms) and eventual adjustments of previously prescribed medication in patient diaries.

Separated plasma was conducted by a COM.TEC plasma pump from the centrifugal separation chamber directly to the IgE-adsorber where adsorption of IgE occurred. The processed plasma was thereafter passed through a particle filter as second safety barrier against accidental particle infusion, and reunified with the blood cells in the bubble catcher of the cell separator's return line. From there, it was returned to the patient by a second peripheral venous access at the opposite arm as used for blood collection. At the end of treatment residual blood in the blood lines and the adsorber was displaced by 0.9% saline and re-infused to the patient.</p><p>Since this clinical trial was conducted as a pre-CE study, apheresis treatments were performed using clinical samples of IgEnio.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Measurement of Total and Allergen-specific IgE</title><p>All serum samples were tested by ImmunoCAP (Thermo Fisher/Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for levels of total IgE and for IgE specific to defined seasonal (birch, ash, timothy grass, mugwort, <italic>Alternaria</italic>) and perennial allergen sources (<italic>Aspergillus</italic>, house dust mite, cat, dog).

In a serum sample with moderately elevated total IgE-level (serum 1, 263&#x000a0;U/ml), addition of an equal amount of Omalizumab as related to the IgE-level did not interfere with IgE-depletion by IgEnio adsorber material <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a and <xref rid="t0045" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>).

This is in line with results from previous <italic>in vitro</italic> tests and indicates that subjects with even higher total IgE-levels can be treated with IgEnio. No relevant changes of IgE-levels were noted in the control group.</p><p>Since desorption with the single-use columns was done by peripheral venous access, treatment with IgEnio was convenient, safe and well-tolerated. In total, 81 treatments were performed by veno-venous access in highly sensitive patients suffering from allergic asthma and other allergic co-morbidities such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and life-threatening food allergies. Most adverse events were subclinical deviations of laboratory parameters that resolved without any treatment. Mild respiratory AEs such as dyspnea, cough or wheezing occurred at similar frequencies in both groups. Skin reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, rash and one case of angioedema were observed in the apheresis group, but rapidly resolved under antihistamines and steroids, respectively. Likewise, the only SAE likely related to the treatment, i.e., an asthma attack at the end of the first apheresis in one patient, resolved under medication and the patient was discharged on the same day. The remaining 8 treatments were well tolerated by this patient.</p><p>Even though aphereses required 3.5&#x000a0;h on average, compliance of patients was high, as indicated by the absence of drop-outs during the treatment phase.</p><p>Although the study was designed to investigate efficacy, specificity and safety of IgE-desorption by IgEnio, data on immunological and clinical effects were also collected. The trial was conducted from end of February until mid-July 2014, covering birch and grass flowering seasons. Usually, strong increases of allergen-specific IgE, basophil- and skin-sensitivity are observed in birch and grass pollen allergic patients after seasonal exposure (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, pollen allergen-specific basophil-sensitivity declined in the apheresis group and skin-sensitivity did not increase after the pollen season. This may be explained by the fact that, due to removal of the newly synthesized IgE, cells were not loaded with the latter. Effects of IgE immunoadsorption on basophil-sensitivity appeared earlier than those on skin-sensitivity which may be due to the shorter life-span of basophils as compared to mast cells. Immunological effects observed were paralleled by clinical effects: improvement in peak flow was detected in the treated group already after the first cycle of immunoadsorption that was not reversed even during the peak of the birch pollen season (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). Likewise, steady improvement in lung symptoms was recorded for the apheresis group, in contrast to worsening in the control group after day 40, when the highest birch pollen counts were reported (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c). After the onset of the grass pollen season, the 3rd cycle of immunoadsorption was performed and thus, all patients of the apheresis group had been subjected to two cycles already before being exposed to grass pollen. Shortly after start of the grass season, around day 70, the control group deteriorated in general and lung-associated symptoms and in peak flow measurements, whereas the treated group remained stable or even showed improvement (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a&#x02013;c).</p><p>A limitation of our study was that, due to the uneven distribution of allergic co-morbidities (i.e., rhinitis, dermatitis) in the study groups and due to the low number of study participants, effects of the treatment on co-morbidities could not be investigated. The effects of treatment with IgEnio on clinical endpoints will be assessed in follow-up studies. Likewise, effects of long-term treatment will be analyzed in future studies.</p><p>Based on these results, two treatment scenarios emerge: first, we suggest IgE immunoadsorption with IgEnio in patients with pollen-induced asthma attacks, initiated shortly before and continued during the pollen season. This treatment can be prescribed regardless of total IgE-levels due to the high binding-capacity of IgEnio. Since treatment with IgEnio was well tolerated, we think that it also can be applied in patients suffering from severe and uncontrolled asthma. Accordingly, the second clinical application suggested by our data concerns polysensitized allergic patients who are not eligible for Omalizumab treatment due to IgE-levels beyond the current limits of the drug (1500&#x000a0;U/ml in the EU (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">EMA, 2015</xref>) and 700&#x000a0;U/ml in the US (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">FDA, 2015</xref>)). Among our study population, 3 treated subjects had pre-treatment levels exceeding these limits (Table E1, online repository, patient 002: 4344&#x000a0;U/ml, patient 006: 797&#x000a0;U/ml, patient 017: 764&#x000a0;U/ml). In such patients, IgE-levels could be reduced by immunoadsorption in a first step, followed by administration of Omalizumab. An equivalent strategy already was successfully applied in a child suffering from severe asthma (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kerzel et al., 2011</xref>), in patients with severe atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Zink et al., 2016</xref>) and in a case of life-threatening food allergy (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Dahdah et al., 2015</xref>). However, reduction of total IgE-levels in these patients was achieved either by plasma exchange (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Kerzel et al., 2011</xref>), a very cumbersome and unspecific treatment, by using an adsorber non-specifically removing antibodies of all isotypes (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Zink et al., 2016</xref>) or by an IgE-specific adsorber that also reduced IgG, IgM and IgA by approximately 40% (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Dahdah et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, IgE-depletion with IgEnio would facilitate Omalizumab administration after fewer desorptions and without alteration of other plasma components than IgE which would allow to use IgEnio also in children.</p><p>In addition, results from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that IgEnio also depletes IgE in presence of Omalizumab (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="t0045" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>). This observation indicates that IgEnio may also be used in Omalizumab-treated patients with extremely elevated IgE-levels in order to remove potentially harmful immune complexes. Other treatment scenarios to be studied include application in polysensitized patients, in atopic dermatitis (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Kasperkiewicz et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Kasperkiewicz et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Reich et al., 2016</xref>) and in the context of allergen-specific immunotherapy.</p><p>In summary, we provide evidence that IgE immunoadsorption with IgEnio is a treatment strategy for patients with severe pollen-induced asthma attacks and for allergic patients with high serum total IgE-levels. Additional clinical investigations with a higher number of participants are planned to confirm these results and to further improve treatment efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Funding Sources</title><p>Sponsor of this study was <funding-source id="gts0005">Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH</funding-source> (Bad Homburg, Germany and in part by grants F4605, F4611 and F4613 of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)), providing funding for planning and conduction of the trial and for immunological and <italic>in vitro</italic> safety analyses.
