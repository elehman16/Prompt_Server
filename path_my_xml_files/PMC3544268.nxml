Non-US data were used only in the absence of relevant US data. The model included only a single hospitalization for congestive heart failure and stroke, so the costs applied to these health states do not include rehospitalization. To estimate hospitalization costs for symptomatic AF/AFL, it was assumed that 27% of patients on dronedarone plus standard of care and 31% of patients on standard of care alone were hospitalized, based on results for the overall ATHENA population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ceor-5-019">13</xref> Costs based on the average readmission for symptomatic AF/AFL ($9061) were applied per 1-month cycle and were reapplied on re-entry to this health state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ceor-5-019">21</xref> In the ATHENA trial, 10% of patients were treated for arrhythmia with cardioversion, so this was used to guide cost application in this model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ceor-5-019">Table 4</xref>).

Firstly, the model extrapolates ATHENA data beyond the trial period and in doing so assumes that there is no change in the effect of dronedarone over this period, which was further tested by sensitivity analyses. Secondly, considering the transition states, it was assumed that after 21 months (the mean duration of the ATHENA trial) the probabilities of health state transitions would revert to those in the standard of care arm. Symptomatic patients developing permanent AF/AFL in ATHENA (15.2% of patients) were assumed to have discontinued dronedarone and were not included in the model, which only provides an assessment of dronedarone&#x02019;s cost-effectiveness in paroxysmal/persistent AF/AFL. Thirdly, because of the limited number of strokes and congestive heart failure recurrences in the ATHENA trial, only first occurrences of stroke and congestive heart failure were included in the model. Fourthly, it was assumed that AF-related costs applied to patients with symptomatic AF/AFL and that these were driven solely by hospitalization. When applying the utility reduction, based on patient-level data from ATHENA, it was assumed that 70% of patients with AF/AFL detected by ECG were symptomatic. Finally, it was assumed that acute coronary syndrome-related monitoring costs were incorporated into the costs of treating and monitoring AF/AFL.</p></sec><sec><title>Utility weights</title><p>In the absence of US data, EuroHeart Survey data on the quality of life of patients with AF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ceor-5-019">23</xref> were converted to utility values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ceor-5-019">24</xref> as detailed in an assessment of dronedarone&#x02019;s cost-effectiveness in Canada, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ceor-5-019">25</xref> Utility reductions, based on non-AF patient data,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ceor-5-019">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ceor-5-019">27</xref> were applied until death for stroke and congestive heart failure and for 1 year in patients with acute coronary syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ceor-5-019">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ceor-5-019">29</xref> If stroke or congestive heart failure was present at baseline, the utility reduction was made once at the start of the model.

One-off utility reductions of 0.1 were applied for skin, gastrointestinal, and cardiac AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity and subgroup analyses</title><p>One-way sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate the robustness of the cost-effectiveness estimates. The sensitivity analyses were used to assess the impacts of: discounting, the proportion of patients in the health states (&#x000b1;20%), changes in the utility of health states, lifetime treatment on dronedarone, and the risk of developing permanent AF/AFL (10%&#x02013;20%). The impacts of age, gender, and risk of stroke (indicated by the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ceor-5-019">30</xref> [Congestive heart failure, history of Hypertension, Age &#x02265; 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, and past history of Stroke or transient ischemic attack]) were assessed by subgroup analysis. The model allowed for probabilistic sensitivity analysis with the following distributional assumptions: risk of developing permanent AF = &#x003b2;, health state specific costs = normal, health state specific utility reductions = normal, and transition probabilities = empirical.</p><p>An additional sensitivity analysis was undertaken to investigate the impact of 3-monthly ECG monitoring costs on the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Base-case</title><p>The base-case model compared dronedarone added to standard of care with standard of care alone. Total treatment costs for dronedarone (at $7.56 per day) were estimated at $3270 based on the average in-trial treatment duration of 21 months. These costs were partially offset by a reduction in other health care costs (for congestive heart failure, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and symptomatic AF/AFL, as observed in the ATHENA trial), resulting in an incremental lifetime cost of $2200 for dronedarone plus standard of care versus standard of care alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ceor-5-019">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>The addition of dronedarone also provided 0.13 life years gained (LYG) and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained over standard of care alone. This gain was derived from a reduction in the probability of events associated with both short- and long-term mortality risks. The lifetime cost-effectiveness of dronedarone was $16,930/LYG, and $19,520/QALY gained. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at higher risk of stroke (CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 6) had lower costs/QALY gained ($9580) than patients at lower risk (CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores of 0 and 3 costing $26,450 and $16,000, respectively). Costs/QALY gained were also marginally lower in males than females ($17,280 versus $18,270, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>The model estimates were analyzed to assess how the costs per QALY gained compared with widely used thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, based on 1000 second-order simulations of 10,000 patients each, showed that 50% of the simulations fell below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY and 85% fell below $50,000/QALY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ceor-5-019">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The base-case results (&#x0003c;$30,000 per QALY gained) were found to be generally stable across the scenarios evaluated in the one-way sensitivity analysis. This analysis also demonstrated that the cost/QALY was highest in scenarios assuming lifetime therapy with dronedarone, no cardiovascular mortality benefit, no cost associated with AF recurrence on standard of care, and when discounting of 5% was compared with 0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ceor-5-019">Figure 4</xref>). The analyses also indicated that cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to changes in the risk of developing permanent AF/AFL within the tested range, with costs/QALY of $17,640 at 10% and $19,310 at 20% risk. Furthermore, the costs/QALY were not greatly altered by the addition of 3-monthly ECG monitoring costs ($115, that were increased by 20% in the sensitivity analysis to $138), being $21,950 and $23,310 respectively in comparison to the base-case cost/QALY of $19,520. However, the cost-effectiveness estimate was sensitive to whether or not dronedarone reduced cardiovascular mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ceor-5-019">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The US lifetime model used in this study indicates that, from a health care payer&#x02019;s perspective, dronedarone is a cost-effective treatment option to manage paroxysmal/persistent AF/AFL in the US.

The use of data from this large trial permits greater precision than the use of data from either a smaller study or the collection of data from multiple published studies.

In AFFIRM, all-cause mortality was numerically higher in the rhythm control arm than in the rate control arm (23.8% versus 21.3% at 5 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.08).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ceor-5-019">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ceor-5-019">39</xref> Thus, in the AFFIRM health economic analysis there was a low probability that rhythm control was more effective in terms of LYG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ceor-5-019">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ceor-5-019">40</xref> In ATHENA, the dronedarone treatment arm had numerically lower all-cause mortality than the control group (5.0% versus 6.0%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.18) and a statistically significantly lower cardiovascular mortality rate (2.7% versus 3.9%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ceor-5-019">13</xref> As expected, our model projected higher LYG with dronedarone therapy, consistent with the ATHENA results, but the model results are sensitive to assumptions about the magnitude of the survival benefit.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The findings of this study should be considered in the context of certain limitations that are consequential of basing the cost-effectiveness model on clinical trial data. It is well recognized that discontinuation rates are higher in routine clinical practice than in clinical trials. Also, given that dronedarone is relatively new to the market, it is not possible to accurately assess how trial-based efficacy data compare with the effectiveness of dronedarone in the real-world setting. Another possible limitation of using trial data is that the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in these trials provide a restriction not present in clinical practice. For example, to be included in the ATHENA trial patients were required to be over 75-years old or over 70-years old with one or more additional cardiovascular risk factor. Also, the ATHENA trial excluded patients with unstable hemodynamic conditions; New York Heart Association class IV congestive heart failure; acute myocarditis; bradycardia with a heart rate of &#x0003c;50 beats per minute or a PR interval of &#x0003e;0.28 seconds; previous clinically significant sinus-node disease (if not currently treated with a pacemaker); planned major surgery; any (non-cardiac) severe illness that limited life expectancy; limited kidney function; or who were in need of prohibited concomitant medication (other class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs). For this reason, external sources of mortality data were used as model parameters.</p><p>The multinational nature of the ATHENA trial may also impact the applicability of some of the results of this trial to the US population. For example, approximately 20% of the patients enrolled in ATHENA were from Russia, and mortality rates in these patients may differ considerably from those in the US. To compensate for this limitation, US-specific data were used for noncardiac mortality data, and the characteristics of the subgroup of ATHENA patients from the US (27% of the ATHENA cohort) were used in this study rather than data from all of the patients enrolled in ATHENA.</p><p>This model did not include hospital readmissions or additional costs for subsequent events after baseline, for stroke, or congestive heart failure in the assessment of cost-effectiveness. Our estimates of cost-efficiency can therefore be considered conservative, as rehospitalization of US AF/AFL patients occurs frequently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ceor-5-019">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ceor-5-019">41</xref> There is also some evidence that AF readmissions are more costly than the initial admission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ceor-5-019">42</xref> Additionally, the model also used the lower range of commonly reported 1-month stroke fatality rates.</p><p>Certain assumptions made in the model may not be representative of clinical practice; for example, that there is no change in health state transition probability over the 21-month period of dronedarone treatment. It should also be noted that cardiovascular mortality was only one of several mortality risks in the cost-effectiveness model and the model&#x02019;s sensitivity to the assumed reduction in all-cause mortality with dronedarone is uncertain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the results of a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ATHENA), this lifetime cost-effectiveness model demonstrates that dronedarone is a cost-effective treatment option to manage paroxysmal/persistent AF/AFL in US patients with similar characteristics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ceor-5-019"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was supported by Sanofi&#x02013;Aventis Inc.
