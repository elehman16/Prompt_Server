The process that converts and integrates initially fragile memories into a stable engram is referred to as memory consolidation (Dudai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>; Squire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2015</xref>). Foremost, consolidation involves changes at the synaptic level. According to the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis (Frey and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>; and see Redondo and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref> for a reformulation and review), the encoding of new information triggers synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) that results in neurochemical and structural alterations. Together, this creates the potential for a long-lasting synaptic change. The memory trace, however, is only stabilized and stored in long-term memory if these cellular events are accompanied by the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs; Moncada and Viola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>; Bekinschtein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Ballarini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Moncada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>). This cascade of events critically depends on the influx of catecholamines, such as dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), into the hippocampus (or other task-relevant brain regions; Ballarini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>). Blockade of the catecholaminergic transmitter system after encoding was shown to prevent long-term memory stabilization (Moncada and Viola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>; Rossato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>; Moncada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>) but not immediate memory (Bethus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Facilitation of catecholamine signaling, on the other hand, was found to enhance memory persistence (Moncada and Viola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>; Rossato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>; Moncada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2011</xref>; McNamara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>). Evidence for the role of the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis in long-term memory formation, however, mostly stems from evidence in rodents (but see Wetzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1981</xref>; Izquierdo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). Therefore, we investigated if catecholamine modulation after encoding facilitated long-term memory stabilization in humans.</p><p>After initial synaptic modifications (mostly investigated) in the hippocampus, memories increasingly depend on neocortical structures as consolidation progresses (Marr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1970</xref>; Frankland and Bontempi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>; Takashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>; Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2008</xref>; Lesburgu&#x000e8;res et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). Typically, successful retrieval of consolidated memories involves the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, the angular gyrus, and posterior representational regions that code for specific features of the task material at hand (Rugg and Vilberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>; Wagner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>; King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that catecholamine modulation would not only foster synaptic but also subsequent systems consolidation.</p><p>A stimulant that blocks both DA and NE reuptake (Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2001</xref>; Hannestad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>) and thereby increases catecholamine availability in the synaptic cleft is methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin&#x000ae;). MPH is widely prescribed to alleviate symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Faraone and Buitelaar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>; Wigal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>) and is used by healthy individuals to improve academic performance (Greely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>; Smith and Farah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>). Aside from its enhancing effects in multiple cognitive domains (see Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014b</xref> for a review), few studies have investigated the effects of MPH on memory (Wetzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1981</xref>; Izquierdo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014a</xref>). For example, MPH given before encoding was found to facilitate the delayed but not the immediate recall of word lists (Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014a</xref>). However, MPH likely boosted attention at encoding, making it difficult to delineate its effects on post-encoding consolidation. Thus, we asked if catecholamine modulation by MPH after encoding would promote the synaptic and subsequent systems consolidation of associative memories.</p><p>The present study spanned across 2&#x000a0;days that were 72&#x000a0;h apart (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). After studying object-location associations on day 1 (comparable to van Buuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>), subjects received a single, oral dose of either MPH or placebo and were tested immediately for their initial memory (immediate recall test). Based on the pharmacological profile of MPH (Swanson and Volkow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>), we expected a drug effect on brain function after the immediate recall test, during early consolidation, affecting memory 3&#x000a0;days later. Up-regulation of catecholaminergic signaling should then foster LTP and PRP release and promote synaptic and subsequent systems consolidation (Frey and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>; Frankland and Bontempi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>). Long-term associative memory was tested again after about 72&#x000a0;h (day 4) during the delayed recall test while subjects were scanned using functional MRI.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study timeline and associative memory task. <bold>a</bold> Day 1 took place in the behavioral laboratory where subjects arrived at &#x0223c;10&#x000a0;a.m. They then studied and retrieved object-location associations and received 20&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate or placebo (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0). Peak drug effects were expected after the immediate recall test, during the waiting period (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0223c;110&#x000a0;min), where subjects were allowed to relax and watched nature documentaries. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and mood (PANAS) were assessed at three times throughout day 1. On day 4, subjects were tested for all object-location associations inside the MR scanner (delayed recall test). <bold>b</bold> During study trials (behavioral lab, day 1), object-location associations were learned. First, subjects viewed the grid with all objects placed at their correct locations for 1.5&#x000a0;min (not depicted in figure). This was followed by five study cycles, each containing study trials for all object-location associations. A trial started with the presentation of an empty grid and the object, surrounded by a red frame (here in <italic>black</italic>), at the bottom of the screen (cue, 3&#x000a0;s). As the frame turned green (here in <italic>grey</italic>), a cursor (marked as <italic>black square</italic>) appeared randomly at one of the four sides of the grid and the subject was required to indicate the correct object-location association (response, 2&#x000a0;s; exemplary cursor trajectory is marked as <italic>dashed line</italic>). If the correct object-location was selected, the object was shown in that location. If an incorrect object-location was selected (as illustrated), the cursor turned red (here <italic>black</italic>) and the object was shown in its correct location (feedback, 3&#x000a0;s). <bold>c</bold> During the immediate, as well as the delayed recall test, subjects were tested for their memory of all object-location associations. The trial started with the presentation of the empty grid and the object, surrounded by a black frame, at the bottom of the screen (cue, 3&#x000a0;s). As the frame turned green (here in <italic>grey</italic>), the cursor appeared randomly at one of the four sides of the grid, and the subject was required, indicating the correct object-location association (response, 2.5&#x000a0;s). The figure shows an example of a correct answer, and the cursor trajectory is marked as a <italic>dashed line</italic>. After responding, the cursor turned grey for the remaining response period (not shown), and no feedback was provided. The next trial started after a variable inter-trial interval (ITI; mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x000a0;s, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;s)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="213_2016_4502_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>We expected that MPH during early consolidation would stabilize initially fragile memories that would otherwise decay and enhance long-term associative memory performance in the MPH compared to the placebo group. This should be paralleled by increased engagement of neocortical regions during correct memory retrieval in MPH relative to placebo subjects, including medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate regions, the angular gyrus, and posterior representational areas. Additionally, the effects of catecholaminergic drugs on cognitive performance were previously shown to depend on individual working memory capacity which serves as a proxy for baseline catecholamine synthesis capacity (Cools et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Landau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). While task performance in subjects with low working memory capacity typically benefits from the administration of catecholaminergic stimulants (Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>; Gibbs and D&#x02019;Esposito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>), it can have detrimental effects in subjects with high working memory capacity (Kimberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). Thus, we stratified our behavioral and neuronal effects with working memory capacity to take into account individual differences in baseline catecholamine synthesis capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixty healthy males (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;23&#x000a0;years, age range&#x02009;=&#x02009;18&#x02013;31&#x000a0;years) volunteered for this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation.

Day 1 took place in the behavioral laboratory where subjects studied and retrieved 64 object-location associations (<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Associative memory task</xref>) and received either 20&#x000a0;mg MPH or placebo. They were again tested for all object-location associations during a delayed recall test inside the MR scanner about 72&#x000a0;h later (day 4; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).</p><p>Subjects arrived at &#x0223c;10&#x000a0;a.m. on day 1. They were tested in the behavioral laboratory in groups of maximum three, but seated in separated cubicles so that interactions were minimized. First, we asked if subjects had refrained from alcohol, other drugs, and medication within the 24&#x000a0;h prior to the start of day 1, and if they had undergone a medical examination since the intake procedure. Next, we asked if subjects had consumed caffeinated drinks or had smoked in the morning. No subject had to be excluded because of these restrictions. Furthermore, subjects were instructed to have a light breakfast 1&#x000a0;h before arrival. If they had not done so, they were offered a small snack consisting of breakfast cookies and water. Subjects subsequently completed a set of questionnaires, including the Behavioural Inhibition Scale/Behavioural Activation Scale (BIS/BAS; Carver and White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (Patton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1995</xref>), and the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (DuPaul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1998</xref>) to assess baseline levels of impulsivity and ADHD symptoms, respectively. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; Watson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>) was used to assess the current mood (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;45&#x000a0;min before drug intake).

On day 1, subjects were instructed to memorize the locations of 64 different objects (Hemera Photo-Object database, Hemera Technologies) that were placed on an 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8 grid (see also van Buuren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>). A trackball (Orbit Optical Trackball, Kensington) was used to perform the task and subjects first completed a short practice round for familiarization. Following this, the study phase of the associative memory task started and subjects viewed the grid with all objects placed at their correct locations for 1.5&#x000a0;min. They then completed five study cycles that each contained 64 trials to study all object-location associations. A trial started with the presentation of the empty grid and an object presented at the bottom of the screen, surrounded by a red frame (3&#x000a0;s; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As soon as the frame turned green, a cursor appeared randomly at one of the four sides of the grid (this random start position was implemented to avoid motor preparation), and the correct object-location had to be indicated by scrolling to and clicking on the respective location on the grid (2&#x000a0;s). After responding, feedback was provided on screen for 3&#x000a0;s plus the remaining response period. If the incorrect location was selected, the frame turned red and the object was displayed at the correct location. If the correct card was selected, the object was shown at that location. After each learning cycle, subjects received a short break of 30&#x000a0;s, indicated by a fixation cross presented on the computer screen and the next study cycle started. The study phase took &#x0223c;45&#x000a0;min. Object-location pairings were randomized across subjects and the presentation order was randomized within study cycles.</p><p>The immediate recall test (day 1) took place shortly after the study phase, immediately following the drug intake (<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>, Procedure). Subjects were tested for their memory of all 64 object-location associations. Again, a trial started with the presentation of the empty grid and an object placed at the bottom of the computer screen, surrounded by a black frame (3&#x000a0;s; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). As the frame turned green, a cursor appeared randomly at one of the four sides of the grid and subjects had to indicate the correct location of the object by scrolling to and clicking on the grid location (2.5&#x000a0;s). After responding, no feedback was provided, but the cursor turned grey for the remaining response time and the next trial started after a variable delay of 2.5&#x02013;7.5&#x000a0;s (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x000a0;s) during which an asterisk was presented on the screen. A short break of 30&#x000a0;s was given every 16 trials. Trial presentation was randomized across subjects and the immediate test lasted &#x0223c;15&#x000a0;min.</p><p>The delayed recall test (day 4, inside the MR scanner) was identical to the immediate recall test (day 1), only the order of the trials was again randomized. An identical trackball was in-house adapted for MR compatibility and placed on the subjects&#x02019; belly during scanning. Subjects again received a short practice before the beginning of the task. The entire associative memory task was programmed and presented with presentation (Version 16.4, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurobs.com/">www.neurobs.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Working memory capacity</title><p>Previously, baseline catecholamine synthesis capacity was shown to correlate with individual working memory capacity (Cools et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Landau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>) which is regarded as a stable, trait-like measure (Ilkowska and Engle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>; Engle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>). We assessed working memory capacity using the Dutch version of the Listening Span Task (Daneman and Carpenter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1980</xref>). In this task, subjects listened to sets of 1&#x02013;7 sentences (that is, 3 sets per working memory level 1&#x02013;7). For each sentence, a written factual verification question had to be answered. After the last sentence of each set, subjects were asked to turn the page and retrieve the final words of each sentence in the order in which they were presented. The listening span, or working memory capacity, represents the maximum number of sentences that were answered correctly (i.e., correct factual verification <italic>and</italic> correctly retrieved final word for all sentences in a set) on at least 2 out of 3 sets per working memory level. The maximum score was 7. If 1 set (out of 3) was answered correctly on the next highest working memory level, then this was scored with 0.5 points extra. The task was completed at the end of day 4 (&#x0223c;25&#x000a0;min, outside the MR scanner) since we wanted to avoid any interfering effects of other tasks on associative memory encoding and consolidation during day 1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study medication, randomization, and un-blinding procedure</title><p>Subjects orally received one capsule of either 20&#x000a0;mg MPH (Ritalin&#x000ae;) or placebo (lactose product) after the study phase of the associative memory task (<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Study procedure</xref>). The assignment to MPH and placebo groups was randomized in groups of 10 subjects and the subjects, as well as the research team were blind to the randomization.

These measures were each analyzed using a mixed ANOVA with time (1&#x02013;3) as a within-, and drug (MPH, placebo) as a between-subjects factor. Memory performance was defined as the number of correct responses in the associative memory task (<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>, <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Associative memory task</xref>) for the study cycles (1&#x02013;5, day 1), the immediate recall test (day 1), and for the delayed recall test (day 4). Performance and corresponding reaction times (RTs) for correct responses from the study phase were analyzed using mixed ANOVAs with Study Cycle (1&#x02013;5) as a within-, and Drug (MPH, placebo) as a between-subjects factor. Memory performance for correct responses from the recall tests were analyzed using a time (immediate, delayed)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;drug (MPH, placebo) mixed ANOVA. For the delayed recall test, only object-location associations that were retrieved correctly at both the immediate and the delayed recall test were regarded as &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; (see also fMRI analyses below). Corresponding RTs were analyzed using two independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests, since immediate and delayed recall tests were performed in the behavioral laboratory and inside the MR scanner, respectively, and are thus not directly comparable. Subjects displayed very few responses that were incorrect at the immediate but correct at the delayed recall test (&#x0201c;forgotten-remember responses&#x0201d;; mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM: 2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25 trials) and few trials without any responses (&#x0201c;misses&#x0201d;; study, 2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5 trials; immediate recall test, 1.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2 trials; delayed recall test, 3.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4 trials). These trials were excluded from the behavioral analysis, and were collapsed in a regressor of no interest for fMRI analyses of the delayed recall test on day 4 (see below). For all ANOVAs, we applied Greenhouse-Geisser correction whenever the assumption of sphericity was violated and significant interactions were followed up using independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests. Alpha was set to 0.05 throughout. Additionally, we expected the effects of MPH administration on physiological and behavioral outcome measures to be affected by individual working memory capacity. We therefore repeated the above analyses with working memory capacity (mean centered) as a covariate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Imaging parameters</title><p>Imaging data were acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Skyra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil. We obtained 364&#x000a0;T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted BOLD images during the delayed recall test (day 4).

First, echoes from the four different echo times were combined into single volumes. We used 32 scans that were acquired before the start of the delayed recall test (&#x0223c;1&#x000a0;min) to determine the optimal weighting of echo times for each voxel. This was done by calculating the contrast-to-noise ratio for each echo per scan. Images from multiple echo times were then combined by performing motion correction on the first echo, estimating iterative rigid body realignment to minimize the residual sum of squares between the first echo of the first scan and all remaining scans. The estimated parameters were then applied to all other echoes, realigning all echoes to the first echo of the first scan. Finally, the calculated optimal echo time weightings were used to combine the four echo images into a single image. The structural scan was co-registered to the mean functional scan. Next, using unified segmentation (Ashburner and Friston <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>), the structural scan was segmented and the normalization parameters were estimated using these normalization parameters. All images (functional and structural) were spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template and smoothed with a 3D Gaussian kernel (8&#x000a0;mm full-width at half maximum, FWHM).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>fMRI activation analysis</title><p>To investigate differential activation of MPH and placebo groups during memory retrieval (delayed recall test, day 4), we sorted trials based on individual memory performance and grouped them in three regressors: First, correct trials were defined as object-location associations that were correctly remembered at both the immediate recall test (day 1) and the delayed recall test (day 4). Second, incorrect trials were defined as object-location associations that were incorrectly remembered at the delayed recall test (day 4). Third, object-location associations that were correctly remembered at the delayed recall test (day 4) but incorrectly remembered at the immediate recall test (day 1) were collapsed together with misses (trials without any response) into a regressor of no interest. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response for all trials was modeled with these separate task regressors, time-locked to the onset of the trials. All events were estimated as a boxcar function with the duration of one trial (5.5&#x000a0;s) and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Regressors for correct and incorrect responses were parametrically modulated with RTs. In addition, the six realignment parameters were included in the design matrix, and a high-pass filter with a cut-off at 128&#x000a0;s was applied. General activation during the delayed test was assessed with a one-sample <italic>t</italic> test of the contrast correct&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;incorrect. Retrieval-related brain activity was compared between groups using an independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test (correct&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;incorrect).

Contrary to what we expected, MPH administration after learning did not facilitate long-term associative memory compared to placebo. Also, there was no significant group difference in activation during delayed memory retrieval after 72&#x000a0;h. However, we found that the effect of drug administration on subsequent retrieval-related activation and connectivity was dependent on individual variations in working memory capacity.</p><p>We expected that the up-regulation of catecholaminergic signaling during early consolidation would stabilize initially fragile memories that would otherwise decay and thus lead to enhanced long-term associative memory performance following MPH compared to placebo administration. This would provide evidence for a synaptic tagging and capture mechanism in humans. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find increased associative memory performance for the MPH relative to the placebo group after 72&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There are several possible explanations for this null finding. First, MPH administration might have been efficient but was masked by other experimental factors. For instance, receiving a pill, even if it only was a placebo, could have been sufficiently arousing to facilitate the release of endogenous catecholamines and to foster synaptic consolidation. Second, the dosage of 20&#x000a0;mg MPH might not have been sufficient to facilitate catecholaminergic signaling in order to augment synaptic consolidation after learning. Although we chose the absolute dose of 20&#x000a0;mg MPH in accordance with previous studies (Izquierdo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>), the average relative body-weight-adjusted dose of 0.27&#x000a0;mg/kg MPH was rather low, compared to the dose typically used to investigate the effects of MPH on brain function (&#x0223c;0.8&#x000a0;mg/kg; Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2001</xref>). Nevertheless, MPH administration affected heart rate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) but did not significantly affect blood pressure or mood (see also Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2002</xref>). Third, the timing of drug administration was perhaps not optimal to facilitate synaptic consolidation, and catecholamine levels could have peaked earlier (e.g., after the first study cycle) or later (Izquierdo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). Further research is needed to clarify these points.</p><p>Next, we hypothesized that synaptic consolidation would pave the way for the subsequent neocortical stabilization of memory traces (Frey and Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>; Frankland and Bontempi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2005</xref>; Lesburgu&#x000e8;res et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>). As expected, results revealed stronger activation in the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, the angular gyrus, and posterior representational regions but also in the hippocampus, during correct relative to incorrect memory retrieval after 72&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, we did not find increased engagement of neocortical regions in subjects who received MPH compared to placebo. Notably, there was no disengagement of the hippocampus during the delayed retrieval which is probably due to the spatial associative nature of our task (Burgess et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; D&#x000fc;zel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>; Mayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>).</p><p>Although catecholamine administration during early consolidation did not foster long-term associative memory performance, we found that the effects of MPH on retrieval-related neuronal processes were dependent on individual variations in working memory capacity, a proxy measure for baseline catecholamine synthesis capacity (Cools et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Landau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>). Subjects who received placebo showed increased activation in the left lateral occipital and fusiform regions but decreased connectivity between the left lateral occipital cortex and the right hippocampus at <italic>lower</italic> working memory capacity during correct over incorrect retrieval (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Conversely, for subjects who received MPH, increased activation in the right postcentral gyrus was associated with <italic>higher</italic> working memory capacity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Behaviorally, we did not find an interaction between working memory capacity and associative memory performance.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that inter-individual differences in drug response can be explained by working memory capacity (Kimberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>; van der Schaaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). While cognitive performance in subjects with low working memory capacity typically benefits from administration of catecholaminergic stimulants (Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>; Gibbs and D&#x02019;Esposito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>), they can have detrimental effects in subjects with high working memory capacity (Kimberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). This speaks for an inverted u-shaped relationship (Williams and Goldman-Rakic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1995</xref>; Cools and D&#x02019;Esposito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). Here, we suggest that subjects with low working memory capacity fall on the left-hand side of the inverted u-shaped curve, and subjects that score high are located in the middle (i.e., optimal baseline catecholamine synthesis capacity). Although higher working memory capacity was not associated with better long-term memory performance, it was related to enhanced connectivity between the left lateral occipital cortex and the hippocampus but decreased activation in lateral occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus during correct memory retrieval in subjects who received placebo. Presumably, increased cross-talk reflects better integration of mnemonic features into a conjunctive, episodic-like memory representation and memory stabilization within an extended hippocampal-neocortical network. This might indicate more efficient neuronal processing (Gibbs and D&#x02019;Esposito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>; Rypma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). Therefore, subjects with high working memory capacity might already display optimal grounds for synaptic and subsequent systems consolidation. Furthermore, an additional dose of MPH should be detrimental rather than beneficial for neuronal processing in subjects with already optimal baseline catecholamine levels. Indeed, for subjects who received MPH, higher working memory capacity was associated with increased activation in the right postcentral gyrus. Our results thus imply that MPH administration affected the consolidation of long-term memory traces depending on baseline catecholamine levels. This lead to differential retrieval processes for correct, associative memories after 72&#x000a0;h. One possible limitation is that our between-subject design might have reduced the sensitivity of our baseline-dependent analysis. A follow-up study may employ a within-subject manipulation to disentangle the effects of MPH from subject-specific variance.</p><p>Overall, we did not find evidence for increased long-term associative memory performance in MPH compared to placebo subjects, and groups did not show differential activation during memory retrieval after 72&#x000a0;h. However, these results do not preclude the presence of a synaptic tagging and capture mechanism in humans. Most importantly, we found that MPH administration after learning affected long-term retrieval-related neural processes depending on individual differences in catecholamine synthesis capacity at baseline.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Isabella C.
