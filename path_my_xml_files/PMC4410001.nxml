Both treatments are used routinely, but there is little evidence to demonstrate superiority of either treatment. If CSII treatment reduces the risk of long-term complications or is associated with an improved quality of life (QoL), the additional cost of this therapy may be compensated for by a reduction in long-term health expenditure. If there is no demonstrable difference between treatments, health-care resources may be better invested elsewhere. This study aims to address this gap in knowledge.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Fifteen centres, selected to represent a population with a broad demographic, will recruit 316 patients, newly diagnosed with TID, aged between 7&#x000a0;months and 15&#x000a0;years. Exclusion criteria include additional pathologies or treatments likely to affect glycaemic control and a first-degree relative with TID. Randomisation to CSII or MDI is stratified for age, gender and recruiting centre. The randomised treatment starts within 15&#x000a0;days of diagnosis. Patients will be trained to adjust their insulin dose according to carbohydrate intake and blood glucose level.</p><p>Study visits coincide with routine clinic appointments at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months when data relating to routine clinical assessments, adverse events and concomitant medications are collected. Health utilities questionnaires are completed at each visit and a diabetes-specific QoL questionnaire (PedsQL) at diagnosis, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p>The primary outcome is glycaemic control (HbA1c) at 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcome measures include QoL, insulin use, growth and weight gain, adverse events and a health economics appraisal.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first adequately powered RCT comparing CSII and MDI in a non-selected population, treated according to standard practice guidelines.

The incidence of childhood TID in Europe is increasing by 3% to 4% a year, with the greatest increases being seen in patients aged less than 5&#x000a0;years. It is predicted that the European incidence of childhood TID will increase from 15,000 in 2005 to 24,400 in 2020, with a doubling in numbers in children aged less than 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The psychosocial and financial cost of TID for patients, the National Health Service (NHS) and society is considerable and is likely to increase. While the prevention and cure of TID remains elusive, it is essential that insulin therapies are used in the most effective and efficient manner.</p><p>The optimal treatment for TID would be compatible with the best possible quality of life (QoL) for patients, minimise the risk of acute and long-term complications, and represent good value for money to the NHS. The risk of developing long-term complications is strongly related to the duration of TID and glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is also convincing evidence that intensive insulin regimes, in the form of multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) or insulin pumps, confer an additional benefit in the reduction in risk of long-term complications, over and above improvements in glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These methods of insulin therapy are now standard practice in the NHS, although the use of CSII is less prevalent than in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, there is very little evidence to indicate whether one treatment is superior to the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The additional cost of insulin pump therapy is estimated to be &#x000a3;1,700 per annum per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. If this therapy is associated with an improvement in glycaemic control or other measures of health and well-being, the additional cost of this therapy may be offset by a reduction in the complications of TID. On the other hand, if there is no significant difference between CSII and MDI, this investment may be more appropriately directed to other interventions and resources.</p><p>In observational studies, glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and QoL or treatment satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are reported to improve following the introduction of CSII and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia is reported to fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For these reasons the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends insulin pump therapy as a treatment option for patients aged less than 12&#x000a0;years from diagnosis of TID, and for those aged 12&#x000a0;years and above with inadequate glycaemic control on MDI or disabling hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Approximately 19% of paediatric patients with TID living in England and Wales are treated with CSII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>However, when patients are assigned to treatment with either MDI or CSII in the context of a randomised controlled trial (RCT), the beneficial effect of CSII therapy is less convincing. A Cochrane review reporting data from seven paediatric RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] concluded that HbA1c was 0.2% lower in patients treated with CSII compared with those treated with MDI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40% to 0.10%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Six paediatric RCTs, including three studies included in the Cochrane review, were included in a recent meta-analysis that also concluded that CSII had a favourable effect on HbA1c of 0.24% (95% CI: &#x02212;0.41 to &#x02212;0.07; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and required lower doses of insulin than MDI (insulin dose 0.22 units per kg per day lower, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.14; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of severe hypoglycaemic events or diabetic ketoacidosis. A meta-analysis of QoL was not undertaken in this meta-analysis or the Cochrane review, because the tools used to measure QoL differed between studies.</p><p>Although trial evidence suggests a favourable effect of CSII, it is important to note that there are a number of weaknesses in most studies reported to date. Studies that recruit patients with established TID treated with MDI, may show an improvement with insulin pump therapy for two reasons: (1) selection bias, since patients with good glycaemic control who are satisfied with MDI therapy are less likely to be approached or agree to participate in these studies and (2) increased contact with diabetes health-care professionals because at the start of insulin pump therapy patients receive an intensive period of education. Insulin analogues have been reported to improve glycaemic control in paediatric practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] though only one study uses analogue insulin for the treatment of all patients using MDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The number of patients recruited to studies is generally small, between 16 and 72, and these studies are probably underpowered. Children aged less than 5&#x000a0;years are over-represented. Furthermore, there are only two multi-centre studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], one 2-centre study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] of the ten RCTs are single-centre. The observation period is 3.5&#x000a0;months in some studies, and may be too brief for patients to acquire the skills required to use CSII to its full potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In other studies the observation period (4 to 6&#x000a0;months) may be too brief to show patient fatigue in the use of this intensive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>To date no RCT has been delivered in the NHS setting, where health-care services, lifestyle and diet differ from those in which CSII and MDI have been studied previously, and no study has investigated the health economics of CSII.</p><p>The SCIPI (<bold>S</bold>ub<bold>C</bold>utaneous <bold>I</bold>nsulin: <bold>P</bold>umps or <bold>I</bold>njections?) study will address these gaps in the current knowledge base, generating data that are generalisable to the population of children and young people with TID, treated within the NHS according to current treatment guidelines. In doing so, we aim to make a valuable contribution to the debate regarding the optimal use of health-care resources for these young patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Liverpool East Research Ethics Committee, reference 10/H1002/80 and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p><p>Local approvals have been obtained from Alder Hey Children&#x02019;s Hospital; Birmingham Children&#x02019;s Hospital; Doncaster Royal Infirmary; East Surrey Hospital; Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust; Mid Staffordshire Hospital; Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital; Oxford Children&#x02019;s Hospital; Queen&#x02019;s Medical Centre, Nottingham; Royal Blackburn Hospital; Royal Preston Hospital; Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle Upon Tyne; Sheffield Children&#x02019;s Hospital; Southampton General Hospital and University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.

For both treatment arms the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin is calculated from body weight: 0.5 units per kg of body weight per day in pre-pubertal patients and 0.7 units per kg of body weight per day in pubertal subjects. Patients randomised to treatment with MDI administer 50% of the TDD as insulin glargine (a long-acting insulin analogue) once daily.

The health economics analysis will adopt the perspective of the NHS, and consider costs associated with both treatment arms, CSII (insulin purchase, maintenance and use of disposables) and MDI: insulin use, contact with health professionals and costs associated with adverse events including investigations, procedures, treatments and hospitalisations. Time spent with diabetes health-care practitioners (nurses, medical staff, dieticians and psychologists) will be collected prospectively. Participants&#x02019; use of other services will be collected by means of a health resource use questionnaire prior to the start of randomised treatment (for the previous 3&#x000a0;months) then at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month study visits.</p><p>Unit cost data will be obtained from reference sources, including routine hospital data (NHS reference costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) and nationally published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

QALYs will be calculated as the area under the utility-time curve over 12&#x000a0;months. Cost-effectiveness will be determined by the ratio of the differences between treatment groups in mean costs to QALYs. Uncertainty in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be addressed through the application of bootstrapping and the estimation of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A regression analysis of cost and QALYs, with age, baseline HbA1c, utility, cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and other covariates as deemed appropriate, will be conducted to improve precision in the cost utility estimate while conserving any correlation between costs and benefits. Estimates of ICERs will be compared with the &#x000a3;20,000 to &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY threshold of cost-effectiveness set by NICE. An exploratory analysis in which trial results will be extrapolated to estimate lifetime costs and benefits and to capture long-term micro- and macrovascular complications, will be accomplished by using the CORE diabetes model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study critically aims to compare the benefits and disadvantages of insulin delivery by MDI and CSII for children and young people. In developing this study protocol, we have considered carefully the strengths and weaknesses of previous studies. We have elected to recruit patients with newly diagnosed TID, and excluded those with affected first-degree relatives, to minimise the bias that is likely to result from a patient&#x02019;s or family&#x02019;s previous experience of success or failure of one treatment arm. To ensure that the data generated in this study are generalisable to the population of children and young people with TID, treated in the NHS we have: (1) selected centres with diverse patient demographics, and demonstrated that the characteristics of the population of patients who consent to participate do not differ from those who decline; (2) stated a requirement that patient management is directed by local clinicians according to standard clinical practice and (3) designed study visits to coincide with national guidelines for the timing of clinic visits, thereby eliminating additional patient support and education that would result from a more intensive visit schedule and maximising concordance with the study protocol. A wide range of benefits and disadvantages of MDI and CSII have been reported previously in observational trials and RCTs. In selecting glycaemic control as the primary outcome, we have chosen a parameter that can be robustly measured and may be related to long-term outcomes and costs to patients and health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While QoL is undoubtedly important, we are concerned that the paediatric diabetes QoL questionnaires validated to date may not be sufficiently sensitive to identify the ways in which these modes of insulin delivery impact QoL differently. For this reason QoL is a secondary outcome measure.</p><p>In delivering the study we face a number of challenges. Patients have to be recruited shortly after the diagnosis of TID, at a time when they and their families may feel overwhelmed by the diagnosis and unable to consider participation in a clinical trial. Treatment at the time of diagnosis is determined by local practice, and in most centres patients will be treated with MDI. Some patients and families develop a strong preference for this treatment and are reluctant to consider CSII therapy. To try to address this preference, we have made a short film in which patients treated with MDI and CSII share their experiences of their treatment and participation in the study. Screening log data has shown that patients who are approached soon after diagnosis are more likely to consent to participate in the study, than those approached later. We speculate that this may be because patients are less likely to have developed a preference for MDI and are more open to the possibility of treatment with CSII. We have used this information to develop a recruitment strategy that includes an early approach to families. For some centres, this will be their first experience of CSII therapy from the time of diagnosis. There are logistical challenges in educating and supporting patients and families in establishing CSII therapy within the time constraints of the study protocol.</p><p>The SCIPI study will be the first RCT of MDI and CSII, delivered in an unselected population and adequately powered to detect a difference in glycaemic control. The protocol has been developed carefully to ensure that the clinical outcomes are meaningful for patients treated in the NHS. We have also addressed the needs of national and local policymakers, by including a range of outcomes important to the development of clinical guidelines, including a robust health economics appraisal. For these reasons we believe this study will make a valuable contribution to the care of children and young people with TID.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Liverpool East Research Ethics Committee, reference 10/H1002/80, and was registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, reference 2010-023792-25 on 4 November 2010.
