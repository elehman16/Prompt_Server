Nowadays, MTA has been commercially available in both white and grey forms (white MTA=WMTA, grey MTA=GMTA). The major difference between GMTA and WMTA are the presence of the higher amount of aluminum, magnesium, and iron in the former material.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] MTA basically consists of calcium, silica, and bismuth oxide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] After hydration MTA releases calcium hydroxide that is the reason of the high pH value of the material.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Several animal studies have evaluated either white or grey MTA as pulp capping agents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] However, only one animal investigation compared both forms of MTA and reported no histologic difference between the materials as pulp capping agents in terms of calcified bridge formation and pulp inflammatory response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Results of that study illustrated that pulp formed calcified bridge in response to both GMTA and WMTA as pulp capping materials after 1 and 2 weeks. Human studies that evaluate MTA either by case series or clinical trial investigations have shown favorable histologic results when the material used for pulp capping.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>Some human histologic investigations have used either WMTA or GMTA and compared them with calcium hydroxide (CH) as pulp capping agents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] However, so far, no published investigation has compared GMTA, WMTA, and CH at the same time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare both forms of MTA (GMTA and WMTA) with CH as pulp capping materials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethic Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (protocol no. 10/60/5860). Ninety sound intact mandibular and maxillary first and second premolar teeth from 40 volunteers that were candidate for extraction because of orthodontic reasons were used in this study. Each volunteer or his/her parents received and signed a consent form, in which the nature of the procedure and the possible discomforts and risks had been fully explained. Inclusion criteria were consisted of health volunteers over 18 years of age, who accepted the terms of the study, having sound intact teeth, without history of trauma, with no periodontal disease involvement, having at least three premolar teeth that need extraction for orthodontic reasons. Exclusion criteria were the presence of clinical of radiographic signs of pulp or peridontal involvement, tooth anomaly, and no response to vitality tests cold, warm, or electric pulp tester. For volunteers who were under 18 years of age, the terms and nature of the study was also described to one of their parents and asked them to sign the consent form. All teeth were examined clinically and radiographically to be sure about the absence of proximal caries and periapical lesion as well as the maturity of the root apex.</p><p>For each patient after administrating local anesthesia with 3% perilocaine with 0.03 Ul felypressin (Prilonest 3%, DFL Industria, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) the tooth was washed with 0.2% chlorhexidine prior to cavity preparation. Then a classic class V cavity was prepared at the buccal aspect of the crown and at the final part of the cavity preparation a standard small exposure was intentionally prepared as closely as possible to a size between 0.5 to 1 mm. Homeostasis was achieved by placing a cotton pellet that was moistened with normal saline over the exposure area. In case of uncontrolled bleeding, a cotton pellet moistened with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite was used for 1 min. After that, the exposure area was randomly capped with either Dycal (Dentsply DeTrey, GmbH, Konstanz, Germany), Tooth-coloured ProRoot MTA (Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK, USA) or grey ProRoot MTA (Dentsply). After placing MTA, a wet cotton palette was placed over MTA, after 10 min the cotton pellet was removed and the cavity was resorted with amalgam. For randomization, each volunteer received a sealed opaque envelope in which the type of the capping material and maxillary or mandibular teeth had been written by another person so that for volunteers who needed to extract at least three premolar teeth all of the capping materials were used. Finally, the cavities were restored with amalgam (Sinalloy, Shahid Faghihi, Tehran, Iran). All cavity preparation and tooth restoration procedures were performed by one of the authors (A. E). At 30, 60, and 90 days, ten teeth that were capped with one of the capping materials were extracted (30 teeth at each time interval). The extraction was performed as atraumatically as possible. After extraction the apical 3 mm of the root apex of each tooth was cut by a new unused high-speed diamond fissure bur with copious of water spray for increasing the amount of formalin penetration. Then teeth were stored in 10% formalin for at least 2 weeks prior to histologic processing.</p><p>After histopathological processing and H and E staining, the specimens were observed by an oral pathologist who was unaware of the type of the capping materials and the time interval under an optical microscope (Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany). The presence and thickness of complete calcified bridge, and pulp inflammation were evaluated. Pulp inflammation was determined at the coronal pulp by taking three central sections, beneath the capping material/calcified bridge. Pulp inflammation were graded and calculated based on criteria that used in a previously published study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] with slight modification: 1 &#x02013; no inflammation; 2 &#x02013; minimal inflammation (scattered chronic inflammatory cells beneath the calcified bridge or capping area); 3 &#x02013; moderate inflammation (obvious number of chronic inflammatory cells without sign of necrosis); 4 &#x02013; severe inflammation: (abscess formation, necrosis and presence of polymorphonuclear cells). Dentine bridge thickness was measured to be 10-&#x003bc;m accuracy using the Adobe Photoshop software CS (Adobe Systems Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). One way ANOVA, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The patients aged between 14&#x02013;21 years, which consist of 25 female and 15 male individuals.

The results of their study showed the presence of inflammatory cells at the pulp of some of Dycal samples after 2 months that was in corroboration with the results of the present study [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>Previous human investigations on pulp capping agents used intact maxillary and mandibular third molars or premolars that were candidate for extraction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In this study, intact permanent mandibular and maxillary premolar teeth that were candidate for extraction because of orthodontic reasons were used. Most previous clinical trials that compared MTA and Dycal as pulp capping agents used intact teeth that might not show the real clinical condition in which the teeth have caries and pulp may have chronic or acute inflammation prior to the treatment. Ethical concerns are the major reasons that prevent investigators to pulp cap the teeth with caries. Because when histologic evaluation is going to be performed, the teeth should be extracted prior to tissue processing.</p><p>A previous animal investigation that compared WMTA and GMTA as pulp capping agents showed similar pulpal response and presence of calcified bridge at 1 and 2 weeks intervals after pulp capping.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Nair <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] have stated that the results of animal studies are not conclusive on human teeth and therefore clinical trials should be performed on volunteers for determining clinical application of a pulp capping material. The results of this study were in corroboration with a previous animal investigation on comparing WMTA with GMTA as pulp capping agents that showed no histologic difference when pulp capped with either of the materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The presence of inflammatory cells in pulps capped with either types of GMTA or WMTA in this study may be the result of cavity restoration with amalgam. Although excellent sealing ability of MTA has been confirmed, it may not completely prevent microleakage of the bacteria from the oral cavity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Similar to the present study, several previous animal studies used amalgam as permanent restoration over MTA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In addition, in the current study poor quality of calcified bridge formed beneath Dycal as pulp capping material was in corroboration with the previous investigations compared Dycal with either types of GMTA or WMTA despite using various materials for coronal restorations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>The application of the capping material at the exposure site is very important for the practitioners. MTA needs wet environment following use as pulp capping material, whereas, placing Dycal at the exposure site as hard setting calcium hydroxide agent is very difficult. Therefore, in addition to the histologic superiority of MTA as pulp capping material, the material is easier to use in comparison to Dycal for pulp capping. A previously published article confirmed this easier clinical application.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, based on the results of this study both types of GMTA and WMTA can be suggested as the material of choice for pulp capping and no significant difference was found between them in terms of calcified bridge formation and thickness as well as pulpal inflammatory response.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was financially supported by Research Committee of Kerman Medical University.</p></ack><fn-group><fn
