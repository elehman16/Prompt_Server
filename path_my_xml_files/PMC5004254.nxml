Calcium, vitamin D and exercise are recommended for prevention of osteoporosis, and bisphosphonates (BPs) are prescribed in women with osteoporosis. BPs may also be prescribed for women with low bone mass, but are more controversial due to the potential for adverse effects with long-term use. A bone loading exercise program (high-impact weight bearing and resistance training) promotes bone strength by preserving bone mineral density (BMD), improving bone structure, and by promoting bone formation at sites of mechanical stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The sample for this study will be 309 women with low bone mass who are within 5&#x000a0;years post-menopause. Subjects are stratified by exercise history (&#x02265;2 high intensity exercise sessions per week; &#x0003c; 2 sessions per week) and randomized to a control or one of two treatment groups: 1) calcium&#x02009;+&#x02009;vitamin D (CaD) alone (Control); 2) a BP plus CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a bone loading exercise program plus CaD (Exercise). After 12&#x000a0;months of treatment, changes in bone structure, BMD, and bone turnover will be compared in the 3 groups. Primary outcomes for the study are bone structure measures (Bone Strength Index [BSI] at the tibia and Hip Structural Analysis [HSA] scores). Secondary outcomes are BMD at the hip and spine and serum biomarkers of bone formation (alkaline phosphase, AlkphaseB) and resorption (Serum N-terminal telopeptide, NTx). Our central hypothesis is that improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either Control or Risedronate groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our research aims to decrease the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving bone strength in women with low bone mass (pre-osteoporotic) during their first 5&#x000a0;years&#x02019; post-menopause, a time of rapid and significant bone loss.

According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), 9.9 million Americans have osteoporosis, an additional 43.1 million have low bone mass or osteopenia, and 80&#x000a0;% of Americans with osteoporosis or low bone mass are women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Osteoporotic fractures are an enormous medical and personal burden for these women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 1-year mortality rate after an osteoporotic hip fracture is approximately 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and increased mortality from hip fractures extends to 10&#x000a0;years after the fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The economic impact of osteoporotic fractures is large and growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From 2000 to 2011, there were 4.9 million hospitalizations for these fractures, and annual costs for hospitalization was greater than 5.1 billion dollars. The number of hospitalizations and hospital costs were greater for osteoporosis than for myocardial infarction, stroke, or breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our research aims to decrease the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving bone strength and preserving BMD in women with low bone mass during their first 5&#x000a0;years&#x02019; post-menopause, a time of rapid and significant bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This paper presents the study protocol for a prospective, stratified, randomized controlled trial that is federally&#x02013;funded and currently in progress. This study compares changes after 12&#x000a0;months in bone structure, BMD, and bone turnover in post-menopausal women with low bone mass stratified by exercise history and randomized to one control or two treatment groups (<italic>n</italic> =103 per group): 1) calcium&#x02009;+&#x02009;vitamin D (CaD) alone (Control); 2) A bisphosphonate (BP) plus CaD (Risedronate); or 3) a bone loading exercise program plus CaD (Exercise). Improving bone strength and preventing further loss of bone is critical in postmenopausal women with low bone mass as it is difficult to build significant bone without the influence of estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Preventative treatments are especially important during the first 5 years&#x02019; post-menopause because women are more likely to have bone loss during this time. Recker et al. (2000) reported that women lose more than 5&#x000a0;% of spine BMD in the 5&#x000a0;years after the last menses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Calcium and vitamin D supplements (CaD), exercise, and BPs are all used to address bone health in women. There is strong evidence that adequate CaD through dietary intake and/or supplementation is necessary to maintain bone health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although CaD is more effective than no treatment, it frequently is not enough to prevent progression of bone loss or to prevent osteoporosis. BPs such as risedronate are the medications of choice for treatment of osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and studies have reported that use of risedronate attenuates the bone loss associated with menopause in osteoporotic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The best predictor of fracture is bone strength, and strength is determined by bone structure as well as BMD. While BPs are effective in improving bone density by inhibiting bone resorption, findings on the effectiveness of BPs in improving bone structure are inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, after 5&#x000a0;years of BPs, rare safety concerns such as atypical femur fractures become more common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Researchers have suggested that long-term use of BPs can result in severe suppression of bone turnover with significant accumulation of micro-damage in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This micro-damage can lead to increased risk of atypical hip and femur fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to concerns about their long-term use, providers frequently discontinue prescriptions for BPs after 3 to 5 years of treatment in patients who are at modest risk of fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Exercise programs combining resistance and high-impact weight bearing exercises can improve bone structure and increase bone formation at sites of mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] as well as maintain BMD in postmenopausal women. Participation in exercises improves the ratio of bone formation to resorption and improves bone structure by stimulating increased formation of trabecular and cortical structure at sites of stress, increasing thickness of cortical tissue, improving trabecular bone geometry and microarchitecture, and reorganizing bone collagen. Collagen reorganization as a result of exercise maintains bone strength, even when BMD is decreased by as much as 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Participation in exercises is not associated with severe suppression of bone turnover, and furthermore, exercise is associated with many other positive effects for postmenopausal women, including increased insulin sensitivity, improved functional ability and decreased risk of falls and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If an effective exercise program could substitute for or delay the use of BPs in post-menopausal women with low bone mass, not only would bone health improve throughout the lifespan, but women would also benefit from the many other positive effects of exercise.</p><p>Our long-term goal is to contribute to the development of clinical practice guidelines for the promotion of bone health in postmenopausal women with low bone mass. Clinical management pathways for women who are at risk for other chronic illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes include trials of lifestyle modifications prior to prescriptions for medications. With the potential for adverse effects with long-term use of BPs, the significant consequences of progression to osteoporosis, and the potential bone strength benefits of exercise, studies should be conducted to determine if prescriptions for exercises are warranted prior to prescriptions for medications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

All subjects are permitted to continue their usual physical activity during the study. However, prior to randomization, subjects are stratified by exercise history (&#x02265;2 high intensity exercise sessions per week; &#x0003c; 2 sessions per week) to ensure equal distribution among the three groups. Exercise history will be categorized using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), an instrument used for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity. Subjects are then randomized to a control or one of two treatment groups (<italic>n</italic> =103 per group): 1) calcium&#x02009;+&#x02009;vitamin D (CaD) alone (Control); 2) BP plus CaD (Risedronate); and 3) a bone loading exercise program plus CaD (Exercise). Treatments are 12&#x000a0;months in duration. Primary outcomes for the study are bone structure measures (Bone Strength Index [BSI] at the tibia [pQCT] and Hip Structural Analysis [HSA] scores). Secondary outcomes are BMD at the hip and spine (DXA) and serum biomarkers of bone formation (AlkphaseB) and bone resorption (Serum NTx). Our central hypothesis is that improvements in bone strength will be greater in subjects randomized to the Exercise group compared to subjects in either the Control or Risedronate groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size</title><p>A power analysis for sample size was conducted based on the primary aim of the study.</p><p>Our hypothesis states that at 12&#x000a0;months, there will be significantly greater improvements in BSI at the 4&#x000a0;% tibial site in subjects in the Exercise group compared to subjects in the Control or Risedronate groups. Assuming a significance level of 0.05, three time points, and an estimate of 0.5 for the correlation between time points, 164 participants (82 per group) would be needed to have 80&#x000a0;% power. Since this study will involve three groups, a total of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;246 will be needed (82*3), which will be randomized and evenly allocated across three groups. In order to account for a realistic amount of attrition (20&#x000a0;%), 309 participants will be recruited for this study so that at least 246 should be retained if 20&#x000a0;% of participants do not complete the study. Kemmler et al. (2002) observed a 15&#x000a0;% attrition rate over 14&#x000a0;months in an exercise study, so we expect there to be well under 20&#x000a0;% attrition in this intent-to-treat analysis study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment and eligibility</title><p>Recruitment of subjects will focus on the Omaha, NE and Lincoln, NE areas as well as Council Bluffs, IA.

Prescreening forms include evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ). Subjects who meet study criteria during the prescreening interview are scheduled for BMD (DXA) testing at the hip and spine and blood work (serum 25[OH]D, parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium, creatinine, and thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]) to screen for eligibility for the study.</p><p>Prior to BMD testing and blood work, and after the consent process for screening, medical and physical activity histories are collected. If BMD testing identifies a subject as having low bone mass, the subject is at low risk of fracture via the Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX), all laboratory tests are within normal limits, and the individual would like to participate, a letter is sent to the subject&#x02019;s primary care provider requesting approval for the subject to participate in the main study. After consenting to participate in the study, bone structure at the tibia is tested using peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) (Stratec XCT 3000). Each subject is stratified by exercise history and randomized to one of the three groups, using computer-generated random numbers allocated by our statistician. The subject and research team member learn the subject&#x02019;s group assignment when the subject opens a sealed, opaque envelope after consenting to enrollment.

Hip Structural Analysis (HSA) measures are obtained from DXA results. Critical issues in obtaining DXA and HSA results are the importance of using the same densitometer over time and proper positioning of the hip.

In addition to their current intake of supplements, subjects who have serum D levels at 30&#x000a0;ng/ml or greater will be prescribed 1000&#x000a0;IU daily; subjects with levels of 20&#x02013;29&#x000a0;ng/ml will be prescribed 2000&#x000a0;IU daily; and subjects with levels of 10&#x02013;19&#x000a0;ng/ml will be prescribed 3000&#x000a0;IU daily. Subject&#x02019;s combined intake of vitamin D supplements (usual intake as well supplements prescribed for the study) will be limited to 4000&#x000a0;IU of vitamin D daily.

Exercises developed for this study include high-impact, weight-bearing exercises consisting of jogging using a weighted vest and resistance exercises. One Repetition Maximum (1RM) testing will be used to evaluate if resistance provided by weight machines is at a therapeutic level. Settings or weight loads for machines will be increased based on: a) subject&#x02019;s performance during the 1RM testing; and b) performance relative to volitional fatigue. The goal is to progress to a resistance of 70 to 85&#x000a0;% of 1 RM or which results in volitional fatigue at 8&#x02013;12 repetitions.

Currently, women with low bone mass are encouraged to increase their intake of calcium and vitamin D, and to increase their physical activity, and providers may also prescribe BPs for these women. Short-term use of BPs is relatively safe and is the standard of care for women diagnosed with osteoporosis. Numerous studies have documented the effectiveness of the BP &#x0201c;risedronate&#x0201d; in prevention of bone loss and fractures. The NOF recommends that BPs be prescribed for all patients with vertebral or hip fractures, femoral neck or spine T-scores of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;-2.5 (dx of osteoporosis), and a 10-year high risk probability of fracture based on results of the FRAX tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with BPs in women with low bone mass who do not meet these criteria is controversial. Even though prescriptions for BPs may not be indicated for all women with low bone mass, preventative treatment with BPs has been approved by the FDA and BPs are commonly prescribed for these women. Experts across the world warn that many women unnecessarily are prescribed BPs to prevent bone loss and fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. While short-term use of BPs is relatively safe for most women, the safety of long-term use of BPs (greater than 5 years) is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In 2005, reports of atypical femur fractures began to surface in women taking the BP alendronate for 5 to 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Atypical fractures are believed to occur because long-term use of BPs can result in a severe suppression of bone turnover with significant accumulation of micro-damage in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This micro-damage can lead to increased fracture risk. When BPs accumulate in bones long-term, they cause bones to be &#x0201c;harder&#x0201d; but not necessarily &#x0201c;tougher&#x0201d;. In a recent study, long-term use of BPs was associated with a 20&#x000a0;% reduction in bone &#x0201c;toughness&#x0201d; (that is, the ability to endure bending pressure without breaking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Discontinuation of BPs after 5 years of treatment is becoming a common practice, particularly for patients at low risk of fracture. More research is needed to examine a weakening of the mechanical properties of bone as a possible side effect of BPs. The proposed research addresses concerns about long-term use of BPs by determining whether an exercise regimen with appropriate loading characteristics could replace or delay use of BPs in at-risk women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Critical need for measures of bone structure and turnover as well as BMD</title><p>Stronger bones are less likely to fracture. However, because BMD is only one measure of bone strength, an increase in BMD explains less than half of the observed reduction in fractures. Bones are strengthened by restoring normal architecture of bone and decreasing bone turnover as well as by increasing BMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, to better understand the impact of exercise on bone strength, outcomes in the proposed study will include bone structure as well as BMD.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Bone structure</title><p>Compared to premenopausal women, both cortical thickness and trabecular bone volume in postmenopausal women are substantially reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Uusi-Rasi (2003) investigated the effects of weight bearing jumping exercises on BMD and bone structure in 164 postmenopausal women. Findings were that subjects who exercised had no improvement in BMD but did have improved bone structure (BSI) at some of the most heavily loaded sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Heinonen (2012) reported that an 18&#x000a0;month high-impact exercise intervention strengthened the femoral neck in premenopausal women by enhancing the structural properties as measured by HSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Bone turnover</title><p>Biomarkers of bone turnover predict rapidity of bone loss in women, may predict risk of fracture independently of bone density, and may help determine adequacy of patient adherence to treatments for bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. One remodeling cycle of resorption and formation takes up to six months with approximately 5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% of total bone mass replaced per year. Menopause results in a brief period (~5&#x000a0;years) of accelerated turnover with resorption far exceeding formation. Increased resorption will result in bone loss. With exercise, there is new bone formation in areas of mechanical strain resulting in bones with greater bending strength in those regions. While weakening mechanical properties of bone (such as decreased bending strength) are possible with long-term use of BPs (&#x0003e;5&#x000a0;years), long-term participation in targeted exercise training continually improves mechanical properties of bone over time. This provides the rationale for the comprehensive examination of bone (bone structure, BMD, and bone turnover) proposed in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Summary</title><p>Our research aims to decrease the risk of osteoporotic fractures by improving bone strength and preserving BMD in women with low bone mass during their first 5&#x000a0;years post-menopause, a time of rapid and significant bone loss. Our study compares effectiveness of bone-loading exercises with either risedronate or CaD alone. It is important to understand the specific effects of each treatment for maintaining bone health in women over the long-term. Bone-loading exercise programs for post-menopausal women with low bone mass may more effectively improve bone strength (structure, turnover, BMD) than either risedronate or CaD alone. Prescribing exercise programs and delaying use of BPs can prevent adverse effects from long-term use of BPs and provide the opportunity for later use when they may be critically needed. Results of this study could be used in developing a clinical management pathway for women with low bone mass at their peak period of bone loss that would involve lifestyle modifications such as exercises prior to medications such as BPs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12905_2016_339_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Bone-Loading Exercise Program.
