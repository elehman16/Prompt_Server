Di'ao Xinxuekang (XXK) capsule and Compound Danshen (CDS) tablet have been approved for treating angina pectoris for more than 20 years in China. We compare the anti-anginal effectiveness of XXK capsule and CDS tablet in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina. A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority trial was conducted in 4 study sites. 733 patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina were included in the full analysis set. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients who were angina-free and the proportion of patients with normal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings during 20 weeks treatment. Compared with CDS, XXK significantly increased the proportion of angina-free patients, but no significant difference was noted in the proportion of patients with normal ECG recordings. Weekly angina frequency and nitroglycerin use were significantly reduced with XXK versus CDS at week 20. Moreover, XXK also improved the quality of life of angina patients as measured by the SAQ score and <italic>Xueyu Zheng</italic> (a type of TCM syndrome) score. We demonstrate that XXK capsule is more effective for attenuating anginal symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with symptomatic chronic stable angina, compared with CDS tablet.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Nearly 58% of patients with coronary artery disease were suffering from chronic stable angina<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

The effect was evident in the greater increase in angina-free patients, greater reductions in weekly angina frequency and average weekly nitroglycerin consumption rate, as well as greater improvements in health-related quality of life as compared with the control group. In addition, the rates of AEs were similar in both treatment groups. Most AEs were mild and not considered related to study medication.</p><p>Patients without anginal symptoms may have a better prognosis than those with symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> on management of chronic stable angina recommend that for most patients, the treatment goal should be complete, or nearly complete, elimination of anginal chest pain. Thus, the performance measure for symptom relief and frequency, as assessed by clinicians or patients, could be an important, patient-centered outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The outcome measures used in our study were all patient-centered and clinically meaningful, focusing on absence of anginal symptoms (angina-free), weekly angina frequency, weekly nitroglycerin use, changes in SAQ score and <italic>Xueyu Zheng</italic> score, and the effectiveness of XXK has been well demonstrated. In a recent observational study, patients who experienced weekly angina &#x02265; 1 were proven to have poorer function and quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In our study, the consistent findings of an increased proportion of angina-free patients at each visit in the XXK group may indicate the potential value of XXK in symptomatic treatment of stable angina. As a critical prognostic indicator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, the weekly angina frequency in the XXK group was significantly reduced compared with baseline (reduced by 1.1&#x02013;4.94 episodes per week from week 2 to week 20), which is similar or even higher than that observed in other antianginal trials using conventional agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. For example, in the IMAGE study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, the standardized therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine reduced angina frequency from a mean of 5 to 7 attacks to an average of 3 to 4 attacks at the end of the study (week 10). In INITIATIVE study (4 months)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, the number of angina attacks was decreased by 2.3&#x02013;2.7 attacks with both ivabradine and atenolol, and the reduction in nitroglycerin use (1.4&#x02013;1.2 uses per week) was also comparable to the reduction of 1.44 uses per week observed in our study.</p><p>Another important finding in this study was the effectiveness of XXK capsule in improving quality of life as assessed by SAQ questionnaire. Our results showed an incremental benefit in the XXK group from week 8 to week 20 in all of the 5 domains as well as the likelihood of a clinically significant improvement from baseline on the basis of the SAQ analyses, while other studies only demonstrated benefits in one or two domains, even when compared with placebo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Additionally, the superiority of XXK over CDS was also manifested as a greater improvement in the <italic>Xueyu Zheng</italic>, which is considered as a patient-centered outcome particularly in the view of TCM.</p><p>As a head-to-head comparative effectiveness research (CER), XXK capsule showed a superior effect than CDS tablet, the results perhaps due to their different active ingredients and pharmacological mechanism. Dioscin, as the active ingredient of XXK capsule protects cardiac cells from ischemia/reperfusion injury by preventing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through modulation of the mPTP opening and the regulation of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bax and Bcl-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. While CDS Tablet protect cardiomyocytes against myocardial ischemia and inhibits apoptosis via the Akt-eNOS signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Moreover, it may have extensive effects on four metabolites (hypoxanthine, xanthine, inosine and allantoin) in the pathway of purine metabolism which contribute to a decrease of oxygen-free radical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p><p>However, there are several limitations in our study. Firstly, although the association between angina symptoms and mortality has been investigated previously with use of the SAQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, other measures used in our study such as free of angina, weekly use of nitroglycerin and <italic>Xueyu Zheng</italic> score have not been directly associated with mortality yet. Secondly, the majority of participants were women both in XXK group (69.13%) and CDS group (70.57%), which also potentially limits the generalizability of our results.

The QSAP includes three dimensions (attack frequency, severity, and duration of angina) and comprises questions investigating patient anginal symptoms during a 2-week period (Details can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Appendix 1</xref>). It was administered by two experienced clinicians from each study site at each visit.</p><p>Effectiveness analyses for the primary end-point (angina-free) were also conducted in subgroups stratified by sex, age, angina severity, concomitant disease, weekly-angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, disease duration, concomitant medication, and prior treatment.</p><p>Another primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with normal ECG recordings. The &#x0201c;normal ECG&#x0201d; in our trial is defined as including (1) normal sinus rhythm (each P wave is followed by a QRS and P wave rate 60&#x02013;100&#x02005;bpm with &#x0003c;10% variation); (2) normal P waves (height &#x0003c; 2.5&#x02005;mm in lead II and width &#x0003c; 0.11&#x02005;s in lead II); (3) normal PR interval (0.12 to 0.20&#x02005;s); (4) normal QRS complex (&#x0003c;0.12&#x02005;s duration, no pathological Q waves and no evidence of left or right ventricular hypertrophy); (5) normal QT interval (0.42&#x02005;s); (6) normal ST segment without any elevation or depression; (7) normal T wave; and (8) normal U wave. A standard 12-lead ECG was performed and the findings were interpreted by two ECG specialists from each study site at baseline, week 8 and week 12, respectively.</p><p>The secondary effectiveness measures included the changes from baseline in self-reported weekly angina frequency over the 20-week intervention period and average weekly nitroglycerin consumption rate at week 8 and week 20. Throughout the study, patients were asked to record the occurrence of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin use on diary cards, and the study staff at each clinical site reviewed the patient diary cards with the patient at each scheduled visit to ensure accuracy.</p><p>Other important secondary outcome measures were the changes from baseline in 5 dimensions of the SAQ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and the proportions of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 8 and week 20.
