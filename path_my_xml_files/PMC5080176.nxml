training in the elderly. We evaluated the clinical neuropsychological basis of 2
contractile types, and determined the usefulness of a movement-related cortical potential
(MRCP) from an electroencephalography (EEG). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 11
females and 11 males aged between 65 and 70&#x02005;years. The subjects were randomly assigned
into a group that performed an eccentric contraction exercise (experimental group I, n=11)
and a group that performed a concentric contraction exercise (experimental group II,
n=11). We measured activities of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis
in the non-dominant lower extremity by using surface electromyography (EMG), and measured
brain activity using EEG before conducting an intervention. An intervention was conducted
40 minutes per session, once a day, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. [Results] After the
intervention, activity in C4, the Cz area and rectus femoris were significantly different.
[Conclusion] Our results demonstrate that MRCP from an EEG has the advantage of being
non-invasive and cost-effective. Nonetheless, prospective studies are needed to reveal the
specific mechanism underlying eccentric contraction exercise, which can provide baseline
data for research related to aging and neural plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Eccentric contraction</kwd><kwd>Movement related cortical potential</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aging affects all species, particularly in terms of the quality and activities of life.
Nonetheless, questions about aging remain unanswered<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isaac et al. reported that the loss of muscle strength and power
that are related to human aging are partially caused by a change in the skeletal muscle
structure and a volume reduction in skeletal muscle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clearly, aging decreases
the cross sectional area of the skeletal muscles and the volume of the contractile tissue on
the cross sectional area. Such changes alter muscle function, such as the characteristics of
motor unit firing, the aerobic capacity of the skeletal muscles, decreasing the function and
productivity of power<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, aging
changes the nervous system. For example, aging leads to broad and quantitative changes in
both white and gray matter. Such changes can occur in the sensorimotor area of the
brain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A decrease in nervous system function commonly leads to a change in the contractile ability
of the skeletal muscles; however, eccentric contraction is less affected than concentric
contraction<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Voluntary eccentric contraction and concentric contraction show a
unique activation pattern in the brain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Because of the differences in the muscular actions of these 2 contraction types, various
exercise programs for patients have used in clinical care. However, the mechanisms that
regulate these 2 contraction types are still unclear<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise programs that successfully improved the functional
ability and muscle strength of elderly patients using resistance training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, muscle adaptation through
eccentric contraction training can be beneficial for preventing damage due to intense
exercise<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and the functional loss of
skeletal muscles due to aging<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various tools have been used to investigate the effect of resistance training on the
nervous system and the regulatory mechanisms of contraction types. In particular, the
cortical potential related to movement measuring activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex
has been used as electrophysiological evidence for distinguishing hypofunction of the
nervous system<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) using
electroencephalography (EEG) describes the brain potential from an EEG that is related to
voluntary movement<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A MRCP can record
the activity of the cerebral cortex that is related to active movement and voluntary
impulse<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Notably, the techniques for
measuring a MRCP are cost-effective in the clinic<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, here we investigated the activity of the cerebral cortex
after resistance training based on 2 contractile types in the elderly. We also evaluated the
clinical neuropsychological basis of 2 contractile types and the usefulness of an MRCP from
an EEG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study received the approval of the Bioethics Committee of the Sehan University Center

findings. The subjects consistently had no training for muscle strength for a year and had
not consistently taken medicine. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a group
performing an eccentric contraction (n=11) or a group performing a concentric contraction
(n=11). Experimental group I performed the eccentric contraction exercise and experimental
group II performed the concentric contraction exercise. The subjects understood the purpose
of this study and voluntarily agreed to participate, as documented with the written informed
consent of each subject.</p><p>We measured activities of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis in the
non-dominant lower extremity by using a surface EMG, and measured brain activity by using an
EEG before conducting an intervention. The intervention was performed 40 minutes per
session, once a day, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. We used the MP 150 System (Biopac System
Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) and EEG100C (Biopac System Inc.) to measure MRCP based on voluntary
contraction of knee extensor muscles on the non-dominant side. The sampling rate for signal
collection was set to 200&#x02005;Hz, and the frequency band filter was set at 1 to 35&#x02005;Hz. The
Acqknowledge 3.8 software program (Biopac System Inc.) was used to analyze the PP (positive
potential) of the MRCP in the collected signal.</p><p>The one-rep-max (1RM) for the concentric contraction training group was measured based on
the maximum weight that the subjects could maintain from flexing their knee at a 90-degree
angle to extending their knee at a 180-degree angle for 5 seconds. The 1RM for the eccentric
contraction training group was measured based on the maximum weight that the subjects could
maintain from extending their knee at a 180-degree angle to flexing their knee at a
90-degree angle for 5 seconds. The measurement was performed in triplicate, and sufficient
resting time was provided to prevent muscle fatigue in the subjects. The MP 150 System
(Biopac System Inc.) was used as a surface EMG, the sampling rate for signal collection was
200&#x02005;Hz, and the frequency band filter was set to 1 to 35&#x02005;Hz. The Acqknowledge 4.2.2 software
program (Biopac System Inc.) was used to analyze the collected signal. The rectus femoris is
located at the center of the anterior surface of the thigh, and approximately half the
distance between the knee and iliac spine. The 2 active electrodes were placed 2&#x02005;cm apart
and parallel to the muscle fiber. The electrodes for the vastus medialis oblique were placed
with 2&#x02005;cm spacing and at an oblique angle (55 degrees), 2&#x02005;cm medially from the superior rim
of the patella. The vastus lateralis activity was measured using 2 active electrodes that
were placed 2&#x02005;cm apart and were approximately 3 to 5&#x02005;cm above the patella at an oblique
angle just from lateral to mid line. During extension of the knee the muscles was palpated.
Standing posture as a standards action was set in an EMG signal, and the root mean square
(RMS) was measured for 10 seconds. The RMS was collected during the maximal voluntary
isometric contraction of the knee extensor in a sitting posture using the manual muscle test
as suggested by Kendall<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and are
expressed as percentages. The RMS was normalized as %MVIC (maximum voluntary isometric
contraction). All of the measurements were performed in triplicate and the mean value was
used. Each measurement was taken repeatedly after a sufficient interval of resting time to
prevent muscle fatigue.</p><p>Measuring the posture of a cerebral cortex neuron was similar to measuring the posture of
the 1RM. signals of the brain waves that were collected sequentially and repeated 30 times
with a 30% 1RM weight. An assistant aided the subjects in performing either a concentric
contraction or an eccentric contraction. Next, among signals of collected EMGs, we selected
and averaged the brain wave signal at 2 seconds before initiating an EMG signal starting
action and the signal a second after initiating an EMG signal starting action. The MP 150
System (Biopac, USA) and EEG100C (Biopac, USA) were used, and the sampling rate for signal
collection was set to 200&#x02005;Hz with a frequency band filter of 1 to 35&#x02005;Hz. Active electrodes
were placed in CZ, C3, C4, and FZ based on the International 10&#x02013;20 System, and CZ was placed
at the central part of the scalp of motor area. An electrode for C3 and C4 was placed on the
left and right scalp of the M1 area. The FZ electrode was placed at the central part of the
prefrontal cortex. The ground electrode and reference electrode (i.e., A1 and A2,
respectively) were placed in the mastoid process. The Acqknowledge 4.2.2 software program
(Biopac System Inc.) was used to analyze the negative potential (NP) of the MRCP in the
collected signals, and Brain MAP-3D Software (Laxtha, Korea) was used to analyze the brain
mapping of brain wave before and after conducting the intervention. The NP from the channel
attached in each area was averaged per group. Amplitudes of these values were expressed in
colors and overlapped with the standardized three-dimensional scalp image. Weight for
training was set to 70% of the 1RM to determine the exercise weight of the subjects based on
the measured 1RM. The eccentric contraction group maintained a full extension of the knee
extensor muscles of the non-dominant side for a second on the NK table and then flexed their
knee for 5 seconds, adjusting to the metronome. When the subject in the eccentric
contraction group returned to the starting position, an assistant instructed them to flex
their knee joints passively. The concentric contraction group flexed their knee extensor
muscle of the non-dominant knee joint at a 90-degree angle for a second on the NK table and
then fully extended their knee for 5 seconds, adjusting to metronome. When the subject in
this group returned to the starting position, an assistant instructed them to extend their
knee joints passively. The intervention was performed 10 times per set for 3 sets, three
times a week for 4 weeks. Two weeks later, 1RM was re-measured and training began again for
2 weeks, increasing the weight for training to 70% of the increased weight. The subjects
rested for 5 minutes after each set to prevent muscle fatigue, and another exercise training
was performed 48 hours after the session.</p><p>SPSS version 18.0 was used to analyze data, and Shapiro-Wilk test was used to analyze data

that is associated with a decrease in physical ability is related to broad neurochemical and
neurophysiological changes<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pellicciari
et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that normal aging is
associated with hypoexcitability of inhibitor circuits that exist in the cerebral cortex and
the loss of synapse connection. Lee et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that morphological changes in the peripheral nervous
system, namely, abnormal myelination or loss of axons, results in functional changes,
including the loss of sensory receptors and a decrease of innervated tissues. However,
despite such changes, progressive resistance exercise can drive changes in musculoskeletal
system and accompanying changes in the nervous system in older adults<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smith et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized that the improvement of competence after training both
hands for a short period of time appeared to decrease reaction times, namely because of a
decrease in the latency of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and amplitude, These results
indicate that the activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex increase after training. We
note that active and voluntary movements are needed to generate effective cortical
activation. Yang et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated
differences in the activities of spinal neurons based on muscle contraction types and
cerebral cortical neuron potential, and reported that the peak values in Cz, C3 and Fz
during eccentric contraction are higher than those during concentric contraction. Falvo et
al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> insisted that MRCP after
intervention, but not before, has an earlier onset (by as much as 28%) in 11 normal subjects
who had been trained with resistance exercise of the knee extensor muscles for 3 weeks.
Moreover, neural adaptation in cortex increased. That is, C4 and Cz in the motor area had a
higher positive potential (PP) mean value after performing an eccentric contraction
exercise. Eccentric resistance training resulted in higher activities in the primary motor
area, and thus contributes to an increase in the excitability of the cerebral cortex. These
results suggest that sensory feedback occurs more during an eccentric contraction compared
to a concentric contraction as a result of having plans in the cerebral cortex about
additional movements or have to deal with problems specific to eccentric contraction<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, increasing voluntary muscle
strength occurs through 2 main mechanisms, neural adaptation and myohypertrophia, and
increasing muscle strength requires changes to the nervous system at the beginning of a
training program.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> Many advanced
meta-analysis that Gault and Willems performed showed that eccentric contraction training,
but not concentric contraction training, could improve muscle strength in both the young and
old when performing reinforcement training of a single joint through concentric, eccentric,
and isokinetic contraction<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, Gault and Willems suggest that knee extensor muscles are an important factor in
the elderly. Roige et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested
that the average conservation rate of an eccentric contraction is 21.6%, and ranges from 2%
to 48%, based on their comparison of studies of concentric contraction and eccentric
contraction in the elderly. These studies support the clinical significance of low intensity
eccentric contraction exercise in the elderly, indicating that it could be useful for early
and rehabilitative resistance training. LaStayo et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> suggest that the neural adaptation of eccentric resistance exercise
at a high intensity is beneficial for muscle strengthening or injury prevention in athletes,
and that this approach has many advantages for the rehabilitation of the elderly. Our
results support the research of others, showing that an increase in the muscle activity of
the rectus femoris after eccentric contraction training. The muscle activities of the vastus
medilis and vastus lateralis increased in both eccentric and concentric training groups,
with no meaningful difference between them. The most significant effect of exercise occurred
in the rectus femoris because it takes a neutral posture in the ankle joint and a training
posture in the hip joint, and thus has the greatest load.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that a MRCP based on an EEG has the advantage in
rehabilitative research of being both non-invasive and cost-effective. We found that
eccentric contraction was associated with overall higher neural activity, and there was a
statically meaningful difference for the activity in C4, Cz, and the primary motor area.
Similar to previous studies, we found more complex and higher activity in cerebral cortex
after eccentric contraction training. We found that eccentric contraction in older adults is
a more effective exercise through stimulation of the nervous system and musculoskeletal
system, supporting the use of eccentric contraction training for preventing falls and
rehabilitation exercise training in the elderly. However, we did not control for the daily
life activities of all of the subjects. Moreover, the results of our study need to be
verified using a longer experimental period. Furthermore, prospective studies are needed to
clarify the mechanism of eccentric contraction exercise, which will be useful for research
related to aging and neural plasticity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Aging muscle</article-title>. <source>Am J Clin
