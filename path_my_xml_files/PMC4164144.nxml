The aim of this study is to investigate the emetic effects and mechanisms involving serotonin and dopamine of needleless transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) at Neiguan (PC6) and Jianshi (PC5) on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancers. Seventy-two patients with chemotherapy were randomly divided into sham-TEA group (sham-TEA, <italic>n</italic> = 34) and TEA group (<italic>n</italic> = 38).

(1) In the acute phase, the conventional antiemetic therapy using Ondansetron effectively reduced nausea and vomiting; the addition of TEA did not show any additive effects. In the delayed phase, however, TEA significantly increased the rate of complete control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and reduced the nausea score (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), compared with sham-TEA. (2) TEA significantly reduced serum levels of 5-HT and dopamine in comparison with sham-TEA. Those results demonstrate that needleless transcutaneous electroacupuncture at PC6 using a watch-size digital stimulator improves emesis and reduces nausea in the delayed phase of chemotherapy in patients with cancers. This antiemetic effect is possibly mediated via mechanisms involving serotonin and dopamine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Chemotherapy is an important component of comprehensive treatments for cancers. Nausea and vomiting are one of the major complications of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) lead to a variety of adverse clinical consequences, including noncompliance with therapy, undermining of the efficacy of therapy, and unwillingness or even refusal of therapy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Antiemetics include 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists, glucocorticoids, dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepine class of drugs, antipsychotic drugs, and marijuana. Among them, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists are most widely used [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Introduction of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists in the early 1990s represents major advance in the management of acute CINV. Common adverse events of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists include mild headache, transient increase in hepatic transaminase level, and constipation [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The major problems with the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist are (1) lack of efficacy in treating delayed emesis and (2) lack of efficacy in treating nausea in both acute and delayed phases [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to the functional living index, nausea was reported to have a stronger negative impact on patients' daily life than vomiting [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Neither clinical evidence nor the ratio of cost/effectiveness justifies the use of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist beyond 24 hours after chemotherapy for prevention of delayed emesis. Therefore, the outcome of the treatment for CINV is unsatisfactory and there is still an urgent need for the development of novel therapies for CINV, especially delayed CINV.</p><p>Acupuncture has been used to treat nausea and vomiting in China for thousands of years. The most commonly used acupoints for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms are Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), and Jianshi (PC5). A large number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) can effectively reduce nausea and vomiting under various conditions, such as postsurgery [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], pregnancy [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and motion sickness [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dundee et al. reported that acupuncture treatment might also significantly reduce CINV [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Acupuncture and EA are performed by acupuncturists or doctors due to the insertion of needles into the acupoints and therefore the patient can receive the treatment only in clinics or hospitals. To make the therapy readily available at patient's home, a needleless self-administrated method of transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) was proposed in this study.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the emetic effects and mechanisms involving serotonin and dopamine of the proposed needleless TEA at PC6 and PC5 on CINV in patients with cancers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Population</title><p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethical committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria scheduled for CINV from July 2011 to September 2012 in Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of TCM were divided into two groups: sham-TEA (17 female, 17 male) and TEA group (12 females, 26 males). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ages 18&#x02013;80 years with confirmed diagnosis of cancer; (2) either being naive to chemotherapy or having received only moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy; (3) being scheduled to receive one cycle of moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (&#x02265;50&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin, &#x0003e;1500&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> cyclophosphamide, and &#x0003e;250&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> Carmustine); (3) Karnofsky's score &#x02265;60; (4) white blood cell &#x02265;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and adequate hepatorenal function, aspartate aminotransferase &#x0003c;100&#x02009;IU/l, alanine aminotransferase &#x0003c;100&#x02009;IU/l, and creatinine clearance &#x02265;60&#x02009;mL/min; and (5) being scheduled to stay at hospital for chemotherapy.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the following: (1) receiving concurrent radiotherapy of the upper abdomen or cranium; (2) vomiting or &#x02265;grade 2 nausea (the National Cancer Institute&#x02014;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE)) not clear to me; (3) severe uncontrolled complications; (4) unstable metastases in the brain; (5) uncontrolled pleural effusion or ascites; (6) gastrointestinal obstruction; (7) unwillingness or inability to accept acupuncture treatment, such as wrist disability or hematonosis; (8) contraindications to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists; (9) history of convulsions or seizure disorder; and (10) inability to understand or cooperate with study procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Treatment Regimens</title><p>At the beginning of the study, patients who met all entry criteria were assigned to either TEA or sham-TGEA group according to a computer generated randomization schedule. The patients in the TEA group were treated with TEA at acupoints PC 6 and PC 5, whereas the patients in the sham-TEA group were treated with the same electrical stimulation at sham-points (neither on acupoints nor on any meridians). Sham-point 1 was at the lateral end of the transverse cubital crease, 2&#x02009;cun (50&#x02009;mm) from the bicipital muscle of arm; sham-point 2 was at medial end of the transverse cubital crease, condylus medialis humeri. The treatment was given twice daily each lasting one hr using a special watch-size stimulator (SNM-FDC01, Ningbo MaiDa Medical Device Inc., Ningbo, China) with the following parameters: monophasic, rectangular-wave pulses with pulse width of 0.3&#x02009;ms, frequency of 20&#x02009;Hz, and amplitude of up to 10&#x02009;mA (individually adjusted according to the tolerance of the subject). The stimulation was delivered intermittently with on-time of 0.1&#x02009;s and off-time of 0.4&#x02009;ms. This set of parameters was previously used in animals to exert antiemetic [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and analgesic effects [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Both groups received granisetron (3&#x02009;mg iv bid) during the three-day treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Clinical Efficacy</title><p>Nausea and vomiting were noted starting from administration of moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy up to 3 days. Patients recorded the date and time of episodes of emesis and the degree of nausea in diaries. The definition of an emetic episode was as follows: one episode of vomiting or a sequence of episodes in very close succession not relieved by a period of at least one min relaxation; any number of retching episodes in any given 5 min period; or an episode of retching lasting &#x0003c;5&#x02009;min combined with vomiting not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 1&#x02009;min [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nausea was classified into four grades (0: none; 1: mild; 2: moderate; and 3: severe). Any use of rescue medications was recorded, including drug name, dose, and time of administration. Rescue medication was administered for an emetic event or nausea upon request of the patient. The patients' diaries were checked daily by research staff for accuracy and completion.</p><p>Clinical efficacy was assessed as follows: (1) the proportion of patients with complete response (CR): no emesis and no rescue medications during the acute phase (0&#x02013;24&#x02009;h) after chemotherapy; (2) the proportion of patients with CR during the delayed phase (24&#x02013;72&#x02009;h) after chemotherapy; (3) the proportion of patients with complete control (CC): no emetic episode, no rescue medication, and no more than mild nausea during the delayed phase (24&#x02013;72&#x02009;h) after chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that TEA at PC6 and PC5 reduced nausea and vomiting in the delayed phase of chemotherapy in patients with cancers. This antiemetic effect was possibly mediated via mechanisms involving serotonin and dopamine.</p><p>Various methods of acupuncture have been applied for treating CINV, such as manual acupuncture, acupressure, electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and pharmacopuncture. Dundee et al. were the first ones who reported the antiemetic effect of acupuncture on CINV [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently it was reported that acupressure also exerted an antiemetic effect on CINV in patients with breast cancers [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Auricular acupuncture was applied to treat CINV in children with cancers who underwent chemotherapy and shown to be effective but not different from sham stimulation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A recent review on pharmacopuncture (medications delivered via the acupoints) analyzed 22 studies involving about 2500 patients but failed to provide a confirmative conclusion due to high risk of bias and clinical heterogeneity [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although acupuncture and its variations are promising in treating CINV, no definitive conclusions could be made from studies reported in the literature due to poor study design and high risk of bias. In a recent systematic review of acupuncture in cancer care, a total of 2,151 publications were screened; it was concluded that acupuncture was an adequate complementary therapy for CINV but additional studies were needed [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a needleless method of TEA was introduced and a placebo controlled clinical trial was designed to investigate the antiemetic effect of TEA on CINV in patients with cancers. A special set of parameters was used based on a previous study in our lab with gastric electrical stimulation showing an antiemetic effect in dogs treated with cisplatin and an analgesic effect in rats with gastric hypersensitivity [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using these special settings we found that TEA was able to significantly improve delayed emesis and nausea during the second day of the treatment. No significant effect was noted in the acute phase, attributed to the fact that Ondansetron effectively controlled emesis during the first day of the chemotherapy. Previously, acupuncture and electroacupuncture were shown to improve gastric motility and symptoms of upper abdomen, such as nausea and vomiting. In canine study we found that electroacupuncture at PC6 reduced vasopressin-induced nausea and vomiting mediated via the vagal mechanism [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ouyang et al. reported that electroacupuncture at points PC6 and ST36 significantly accelerated gastric emptying in dogs also mediated via the vagal mechanism [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Clinically, there is evidence that acupuncture at PC6 and ST36 improved dyspeptic symptoms including nausea and vomiting and accelerates solid gastric emptying in patients [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These findings seem to suggest that electroacupuncture or TEA is capable of improving nausea and vomiting of different causes.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study investigating and demonstrating the antiemetic mechanisms of TEA involving 5-HT and dopamine. Serotonin and dopamine are two main neurotransmitters known to induce CINV. Many drugs of chemotherapy can cause emesis and nausea via upregulation of 5-HT and dopamine, and antagonists of serotonin and dopamine are commonly used in CINV [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and antagonists of serotonin are more common than antagonists of dopamine in treatment of CINV. Ondansetron, a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist, was used in this study as the primary antiemetic. It effectively reduced the number of vomiting times to an average level of 1. Interestingly, TEA was found to reduce circulating 5-HT in comparison with sham-TEA. Exact mechanisms involved in the reduction of 5-HT with TEA deserve further investigation. In gastrointestinal motility study, electroacupuncture was found to accelerate gastric emptying mediated via the 5-HT mechanism [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was reported that electroacupuncture on the lumbar and hindlimb segments decreased the dopamine and serotonin levels which were increased by restraining stress in the dorsal raphe nucleus, indicating that electroacupuncture applied to the lumbar and hindlimb segments has an antistress effect via mediation of the levels of serotonin and dopamine [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, different subtypes of 5-HT receptors are believed to be involved in the antiemetic effect and the prokinetic effect of acupuncture. The prokinetic effect of acupuncture is believed to involve 5-HT<sub>4</sub> mechanism, whereas the antiemetic effect of acupuncture is believed to involve 5-HT<sub>3</sub> mechanisms [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, a reduction in circulating dopamine was also noted after the treatment of TEA. This reduction might also play a role in the antiemetic effect of TEA. The mechanism involving dopamine was reported in the effect of acupuncture on drug addiction [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; it was, however, first reported in this study regarding the effect of acupuncture on CINV.</p><p>Traditional acupuncture or electroacupuncture treatment needs to be done in clinics and needle should be pierced into points. In this study, TEA did not require the insertion of any needles and the patient's activity was not restricted. So TEA seems to be more attractive than acupuncture or electroacupuncture and will be well received by patients. In this study, the compliance of the therapy was 100%; none of the patients quitted the study. Typically, acupuncture or electroacupuncture is performed a few times weekly due to required visits to doctor's office. This substantially reduces the efficacy and consistency of the therapy. With the TEA method, the treatment can be self-administrated at home and thus could be performed daily or a few times daily, which would greatly increase the efficacy of the therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, a needleless method of transcutaneous electroacupuncture is proposed in this study. The needleless TEA is effective in reducing delayed nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy, possibly mediated via the downregulation of serotonin and dopamine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This paper was supported by Zhejiang Province Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2012ZB048) and Science Technology Department of Zhejiang Province (2012C33038).</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contribution</title><p>Xing Zhang and Hai-feng Jin are cofirst authors; they contributed equally to the work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lohr</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</article-title><source><italic>Cancer Journal</italic></source><year>2008</year><volume>14</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>85</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-47249165621</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmoll</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Aapro</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative activity of antiemetic drugs</article-title><source><italic>Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology</italic></source><year>2007</year><volume>61</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>162</fpage><lpage>175</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-33846088469</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17208005</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>NCCN</collab><source><italic>Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology</italic></source><year>2010</year><publisher-name>National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Antiemesis</publisher-name><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nccn.org">http://www.nccn.org</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hesketh</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</article-title><source><italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic></source><year>2008</year><volume>358</volume><issue>23</issue><fpage>2432</fpage><lpage>2494</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other">2-s2.0-44849134443</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geling</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Eichler</surname><given-names>H-G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Should 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists be administered beyond 24 hours after chemotherapy to prevent delayed emesis?
