Inhalation medication is an essential therapy for patients with asthma. Inadequate patient instruction and poor patient inhaler technique have a significant impact on asthma control. Effective treatment and disease management requires adherence to inhalation therapies; poor adherence and technique pose a challenge to nurses, clinicians and patients. Despite the prevalence of asthma and the presence of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines for the management of asthma, inhaler technique remains poor.</p><p>This paper reports on a study that examined the benefits of a nurse&#x02010;led programme to educate asthma patients on correct inhaler technique, specifically a Diskus inhaler. The study presents the impact of the education on patient compliance and adherence with inhaler use.</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0006"><title>Background</title><p>Incorrect inhaler technique is associated with poor asthma control (Crompton <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Patients may receive treatment, but without proper education and training in inhaler technique, the therapeutic benefit is below optimal (Lavorini <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Clinical benefits depend on the patient's ability to use the device correctly and adherence to prescribed frequency. Real&#x02010;life observational studies that have evaluated patient inhalation techniques have shown frequent improper use of inhalers (Webb <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>, Restrepo &#x00026; Gardner <xref rid="nop210-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).</p><p>Management of Asthma becomes suboptimal due to poor adherence to evidence&#x02010;based guidelines and underdiagnosis (Ramsey <xref rid="nop210-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Patient benefit and therapeutic outcomes depend on the ability of the patient to use the device and on their adherence to the dosing regimen (Dolovich <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>, Lavorini <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>, Restrepo <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence suggesting that patient errors in the use of inhaler devices are common; many inhalers are difficult to use. (Van Beerendonk <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Although there have been numerous studies on education in inhaler technique for both the educator and the patient, it has been demonstrated that patients are consistently using incorrect technique and this has negative outcomes on their medical condition.</p><p>Patients are reporting that they have not been taught how to use their inhaler by anyone, least of all a healthcare provider. Sestini <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref rid="nop210-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), reported that primary care physicians are not familiar with relevant features of currently available inhalers. It has been shown that adherence is poor in patients with asthma (Takemura <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Non&#x02010;adherence and non&#x02010;compliance to treatment regimens are a constant challenge to nurses and other health professionals. Compliance or adherence to prescribed treatment is not easily attained and is affected by a multitude of issues relating to the patient, the doctor and the nurse.</p><p>Simple instructions in asthma self&#x02010;management improve adherence with inhaler devices, but despite this, improvements can decrease over time &#x02013; even with return clinic visits (Rau <xref rid="nop210-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>, Lasmar <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The problem of adherence is compounded when more than one inhaler is required. For example, when two medications are prescribed, approximately 50% of patients are adherent to only one (Corden <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>, Schlenk <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>).</p><p>The National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care (NCCPC) (<xref rid="nop210-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) states that while there are many causes of non&#x02010;adherence, they can be summarized into two overlapping categories: intentional and unintentional non&#x02010;adherence:
<list list-type="bullet" id="nop210-list-0001"><list-item><p>
<italic>Intentional non&#x02010;adherence</italic> is when the patient decides not to follow the recommendations. Refusing to take medication for fear of adverse effects constitutes intentional non&#x02010;adherence (Rau <xref rid="nop210-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Unintentional non&#x02010;adherence</italic> occurs when the patients agree to the treatment, but are prevented from doing so by reasons beyond their control. Examples include poor comprehension and/or poor recall of instructions, a difficulty in administration of their treatment, or simply forgetting to take their medication.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Health promotion and primary prevention of disease by nurses has evolved into an essential and critical aspect of their role and is practised across many therapeutic areas (Benson &#x00026; Latter <xref rid="nop210-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>, Cutler <xref rid="nop210-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0007"><title>The study</title><p>The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a nurse&#x02010;led education programme in promoting compliance with inhaler use in asthma patients.</p><sec id="nop210-sec-0008"><title>Design</title><p>A single&#x02010;centre, quasi&#x02010;experimental, pre&#x02010;test and post&#x02010;test design was used. The study was conducted in the respiratory clinic of an Irish teaching hospital. Convenience sampling was applied to select patients. Despite the limited time window and resources available for the study, the researcher used the largest sample available. As there was also a risk of bias with non&#x02010;probability convenience sampling, the researcher ensured homogeneity of the sample by using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify suitable participants. The inclusion criteria for entry into the study included patients:
<list list-type="bullet" id="nop210-list-0002"><list-item><p>With a clinical diagnosis of asthma,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Willing to provide voluntary informed consent,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age 18&#x000a0;years or older at time of consent,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Able and willing to take inhaled asthma medication.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The sample included ten men (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>10) with a mean age of 42&#x000b7;3 (<sc>sd</sc> 13&#x000b7;5)&#x000a0;years and eleven women (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>11) with a mean age of 39&#x000b7;7 (<sc>sd</sc> 15&#x000b7;5)&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0009"><title>Method</title><p>Through the use of a newly developed and validated Inhaler Proficiency Schedule (IPS) (Mac Hale &#x00026; Cowman <xref rid="nop210-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>), (Appendix 1), participants were assessed for competence with inhaler use. The elements of the IPS included ten steps in best practice in using the Diskus device. A nurse&#x02010;led intervention education programme was then implemented. Measurements with the IPS were recorded at baseline (month 1), month 3 and finally month 6 after the education intervention (the follow&#x02010;up visit), to examine the sustainability of the change. The researchers also used a questionnaire to record participants&#x02019; behaviour in relation to their inhaler use on a Patient Reported Behaviour questionnaire (PRB) (Mac Hale &#x00026; Cowman <xref rid="nop210-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012a</xref>, <xref rid="nop210-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">b</xref>), (Appendix 2). The PRB to be completed by participants comprised a series of specific questions in relation to their condition, confidence level with self&#x02010;administration of their inhaler and adherence to prescribed frequency of use.</p><p>The IPS and the PRB were adapted and developed by the researchers and were based on a comprehensive literature search, clinical experience and observation. For the purpose of this study and in consideration of the patient cohort, as respondents, the researchers concentrated on content and face validity. Face validity refers to the &#x02018;obviousness&#x02019; of a test, i.e. the degree to which the purpose of the test is apparent to those taking it. (Bornstein <xref rid="nop210-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Tests wherein the purpose is clear, even to na&#x000ef;ve respondents, are said to have high face validity (Nevo <xref rid="nop210-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>).</p><p>The IPS developed was validated by the Professor/Consultant in Respiratory Medicine and Clinical Nurse Specialist in Respiratory Nursing. The PRB Questionnaire was adapted from questionnaires used in previous studies and was validated by the Professor/Consultant in Respiratory Medicine and Clinical Nurse Specialist in Respiratory Nursing.</p><p>At each of the three study visits, the participants were asked to demonstrate how they used their inhaler. This was measured and recorded against the IPS checklist. This tool allowed the researcher to record specific observations made the participant demonstrated the use of his/her inhaler. Any errors in technique were identified on the IPS and corrective education was provided individually to the respondent, by the researchers, as required.</p><p>Inhaler technique data and patient reported behaviour data were collected (in the period January 2011&#x02013;January 2012) at baseline, month 3 and month 6 by the same research nurse using the IPS and the PRB tools. The PRB was completed by each participant at each visit. Additional data collected at baseline included age, gender, diagnosis, previous Diskus inhaler use, previous inhaler technique instruction and whether the patient had an exacerbation in the past year (an exacerbation in this study having been defined as the worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring either steroid and/or antibiotic use, or one hospitalization for asthma).</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0010"><title>Nurse&#x02010;led intervention</title><p>A nurse&#x02010;led intervention included the provision of an education programme to study participants.

A Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) was developed and given to each participant prior to obtaining written consent. Participants were assured of confidentiality and were informed of the option to withdraw at any time. Following the informed consent process where consent was freely given, these participants were recruited to this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0011"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty&#x02010;one participants aged between 20&#x02013;67&#x000a0;years, with a mean age of 40&#x000b7;95&#x000a0;years, were enrolled in the study.

A total of 17 participants who attended all three data collection points were included in the study.</p><p>Through the use of a ten&#x02010;step Inhaler Proficiency Schedule, it is notable that on initial assessment, only two steps were correctly completed by all participants and these were linked to the opening and closing of the inhaler device. No one critical step was successfully completed by all participants at the first visit. This was an unexpected finding, particularly given the mean age of asthma diagnosis for participants was 17.3 years.</p><p>Participants who had previous use of Diskus inhalers performed poorly on their initial visit. This concurs with the literature, which shows that experience of a device does not automatically guarantee good technique (Lavorini <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The data also show that once educated in inhaler use, the IPS scores of the prior&#x02010;experience Diskus users improved to similar levels as the new&#x02010;to&#x02010;experience Diskus group. It is important to note that education was retained during the 3&#x02010;month gap between training at visit 1 and 2 and the follow&#x02010;up third visit, with participants demonstrating sustained competence with inhaler technique. This is consistent with study findings of Giraud <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. (<xref rid="nop210-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), that education intervention results in good inhaler technique. However, the data also show that participants are capable of performing some steps incorrectly, even though they performed them correctly on a previous assessment. This is also in keeping with the literature, which reports that immediately after face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face instruction, participants are sometimes observed making mistakes in the use of their inhaler (Brocklebank &#x00026; Ram <xref rid="nop210-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).</p><p>The four most common errors identified among study participants in using the Inhaler Proficiency Schedule were: incorrect inhaler positioning, no exhalation before breathing in, no breath hold and no slow exhalation after breath hold. These results are reflected in the published literature (Lavorini <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In this study, some participants expressed pleasure that errors were identified in their technique as they felt that correction of same would lead to an improvement in their condition and quality of life.</p><p>The Patient Reported Behaviour (PRB) questionnaire was designed to capture intentional and unintentional non&#x02010;adherence and was completed at each visit. All questions relating to non&#x02010;adherence improved as the study progressed and again this is reflected in the literature (Takemura <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>. <xref rid="nop210-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).</p><p>Three questions of the PRB related to participant confidence in using their inhaler correctly, taking it at the right time and using the prescribed number of puffs and the effectiveness of their inhaler. The results at visit 1 showed that 88% of participants expressed no concern or difficulties with using their inhaler, while 64% of the participants believed they were using their inhaler correctly. However, the IPS data from visit 1 showed that only 14% of participants actually took their inhaler correctly. However, following inhaler technique education, the participants became aware that they had scored themselves incorrectly and also expressed surprise that they had been taking their inhaler incorrectly; the participants were more receptive to education as a result. This suggests that there is a large theory&#x02013;practice gap that needs to be narrowed and ideally eliminated.</p><p>Three PRB questions also focused on compliance, including participant carelessness and forgetfulness in use of their inhaler and ceasing to use their inhaler. The study shows increasing levels of compliance over time. This could also be because the participants gained more insight into the benefits of a &#x02018;preventer&#x02019; inhaler and therefore continued using it, understanding that it would continue to keep them well. Previously they would have assumed that they did not need medication when they felt well. One participant reported that they had not linked the terminology of &#x02018;preventer&#x02019; with the fact that the medication was designed to prevent an asthma event from occurring.</p><p>The overall results from the study confirmed the research question that a nurse&#x02010;led education programme can promote compliance with inhaler use in patients with asthma. This study has shown that inhaler technique education has improved participant inhaler technique, participant confidence levels in relation to self&#x02010;administration of their inhaler and participant adherence to prescribed frequency of use. As well as nurses, the findings of the study have implications for other professionals including medical doctors and pharmacists. It is suggested that when medicine is being prescribed, dispensed and administered, professionals have a responsibility to maximize patients&#x02019; education and understanding.</p><sec id="nop210-sec-0015"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study was completed in the fulfilment of a Masters in Science (Research); this placed time constraints on data collection and hence limited the sample size. It also limited the follow&#x02010;up period. It would have been very useful to assess whether or not correct inhaler technique and compliance were sustained over a longer time frame and what impact continued\discontinued education would have on the results. Other limitations include the familiarity that grew between the researcher and the participants over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study confirms that patients do not use their inhalers to optimal effect. Inhaler education at time of first introduction, with regular reinforcement at points of contact with healthcare professionals, is essential. Patients are not convinced that they need to adhere to inhaler regimens when they are symptom free. Structured evaluation of technique is a priority when reviewing an asthma patient using an inhaler.</p><p>This study demonstrates that repeated inhaler technique education seems to improve both intentional and unintentional non&#x02010;adherence to inhaled medication regimens in asthma. In this small study, the patients newly prescribed to the Diskus inhaler, who were educated from the outset and regularly over 6&#x000a0;months, maintained good technique. Participants who had previously been prescribed the Diskus, when provided with repeated inhaler technique education, showed significant improvements in technique. All participants showed significant improvement in compliance and adherence.</p><p>Participant confidence levels in their inhaler technique were high from the beginning, although with hindsight the participants discovered this confidence was misplaced. With education, they were better able to more correctly state their confidence levels on subsequent visits. The findings of this study and the published literature indicate that there are significant implications for the role of nurses, pharmacists and the Health Service in the delivery of patient education. Nurses have a responsibility to continually question their practice and to provide the highest quality evidence&#x02010;based care to their patients.</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0018"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No conflict of interest has been declared by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="nop210-sec-0019"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors have agreed on the final version and meet at least one of the following criteria [recommended by the ICMJE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html">http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html</ext-link>)]:
