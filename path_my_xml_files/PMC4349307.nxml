SMT19969 is a novel, non-absorbable antibiotic currently under development for the treatment of CDI. Here we report the results from a Phase I study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of SMT19969 in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic assessments included blood and faecal sampling. The effect of food on systemic exposure and analysis of the gut microbiota were also included.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-six healthy male subjects were enrolled. Following single oral doses of up to 2,000&#x000a0;mg in the fasted state, plasma concentrations of SMT19969 were generally below the lower limit of quantification. In the fed state levels ranged from 0.102 to 0.296&#x000a0;ng/mL after single dosing and after repeat dosing at Day 10 from 0.105 to 0.305&#x000a0;ng/mL. Following single and multiple oral doses of SMT19969, mean daily faecal concentrations increased with increasing dose level and were significantly above the typical MIC range for <italic>C. difficile</italic> (0.06-0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL). At 200&#x000a0;mg BID, mean (&#x000b1; SD) faecal concentrations of 1,466 (&#x000b1;547) &#x003bc;g/g and 1,364 (&#x000b1;446) &#x003bc;g/g were determined on days 5 and 10 of dosing respectively. No notable metabolites were detected in faeces. Overall, all doses of SMT19969 were well tolerated both as single oral doses or BID oral doses for 10&#x000a0;days. The majority (88%) of adverse events (AEs) were classified as gastrointestinal disorders and were mild in severity, resolving without treatment. The gut microbiota was analysed in the multiple dose groups with minimal changes observed in the bacterial groups analysed except for total clostridia which were reduced to below the limit of detection by day 4 of dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Oral administration of SMT19969 was considered safe and well tolerated and was associated with negligible plasma concentrations after single and multiple doses. In addition, minimal disruption of normal gut microbiota was noted, confirming the highly selective spectrum of the compound. These results support the further clinical development of SMT19969 as an oral therapy for CDI.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10858225">ISRCTN10858225</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SMT19969</kwd><kwd>Phase 1</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>CDI</kwd><kwd>CDAD</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) is a leading cause of diarrhoea particularly in hospitals and other health care settings. The disease is primarily associated with prior antibiotic use causing a disruption to normal gut microbiota allowing <italic>C. difficile</italic> to proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with symptoms ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to more serious manifestations including pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, sepsis, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent years have seen a rise in the severity and incidence of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is partly due to the emergence of hyper-virulent strains of the bacteria such as the BI/NAP1/027 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A particular concern is recurrence of infection which occurs in approximately 25% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with each recurrent episode associated with increased risk of further recurrence and disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Until recently treatment options for CDI were mainly limited to oral metronidazole and vancomycin, neither of which are optimal particularly in the treatment of recurrent infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both agents can cause further disruption to the gut microbiota during therapy, which may promote recurrent episodes of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Vancomycin achieves faecal concentrations sufficient to inhibit even Gram-negative organisms, such as <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Metronidazole is highly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a spectrum of activity encompassing normal anaerobic bowel microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and both agents are associated with acquisition or overgrowth of organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Fidaxomicin, a minimally absorbed macrocyclic antibiotic with a narrower spectrum of activity, has recently been approved in the United States and Europe, and extends the treatment options for CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, additional antibiotics are still needed that reduce rates of recurrent disease, particularly those associated with infection due to hyper-virulent strains, and to preserve use of vancomycin for the treatment of serious systemic Gram-positive infections.</p><p>SMT19969 (2, 2&#x02032; bis(4-pyridyl) 3H, 3&#x02032;H 5,5&#x02032; bibenzimidazole) is a novel antibiotic currently under development for the treatment of CDI. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have reported <italic>C. difficile</italic> MIC<sub>90</sub> values of 0.125&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and 0.25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SMT19969 displays targeted activity against <italic>C. difficile</italic> with little or no activity against both Gram-negative and most Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Preclinical animal studies have reported negligible systemic exposure and a favourable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the hamster model of CDI, oral administration of SMT19969 has been shown to be superior to vancomycin, conferring significant protection from initial infection and recurrent disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The objective of the study described here was to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SMT19969 in healthy volunteers following single and multiple oral doses. In addition, faecal samples were analysed for changes in gut microbiota composition following repeat oral administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study drugs</title><p>The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) was manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices and supplied by Cambridge Major Laboratories (Weert, Netherlands) along with batch numbers, TSE statements and Certificates of Analysis.

Safety and tolerability were assessed through adverse event monitoring and clinical laboratory evaluations as described below. The secondary objectives were to determine the single and multiple oral dose PK of SMT19969, to assess the effect of food on the systemic exposure of SMT19969, to assess the effect of multiple oral doses of SMT19969 on gut microbiota (via assessment of faecal samples) and to determine concentrations of SMT19969 in faecal samples. In addition, exploratory work was carried out on selected faecal samples to look for potential metabolites of SMT19969. Sampling time points and methodology for secondary objectives are described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Part 1</title><p>Forty male subjects were studied in six groups (A to F) with each group receiving a single ascending oral dose of SMT19969 or placebo. Groups A and B consisted of four subjects (three receiving SMT19969 and one placebo), while each of Groups C to F had eight subjects with six receiving SMT19969 and two given placebo. Each subject in Groups A to D and Group F participated in one treatment period (TP) only whilst subjects in Group E (food effect) participated in two treatment periods. Subjects were required to be in residency from Day &#x02212;1 (the day prior to first dose administration) and to remain for not less than 72&#x000a0;hours after each dosing occasion, apart from Group E TP2 in which subjects were required to remain resident until 24&#x000a0;hours post dose (Day 2). There was a minimum of at least 7&#x000a0;days between completion of dosing in one group and start of dosing in the next group to allow a satisfactory review of the safety and PK data from lower dose levels prior to progression to the next higher dose level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].Six single oral dose levels of SMT19969 (2 to 2000&#x000a0;mg) or placebo were studied (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>In Part 1, the dose was administrated following an overnight fast on the morning of Day 1 except Group E TP 2, with dosing occurring 30&#x000a0;minutes after a high-fat breakfast [total energy content 895 Kcal; total fat content 61&#x000a0;g (61% of total calories); total protein 41&#x000a0;g (18% of total calories); total carbohydrate 46&#x000a0;g (19% of total calories)] on the morning of Day 1. Group E subjects received the same treatment (single oral dose of SMT19969 or placebo) in both TPs. All subjects in Part 1 returned for a post study visit 5 to 7&#x000a0;days after their final dose for the following safety assessments: Adverse event recording, blood pressure and pulse rate, oral body temperature, 12 lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations and physical examination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Part 2</title><p>Sixteen male subjects were randomized to two groups (G and H). In each group six subjects received SMT19969 and two were given placebo. Subjects were required to be in residency 2&#x000a0;days before first dose administration (Day &#x02212;2) and to remain until Day 12 (48&#x000a0;hours post final dose). Two oral dose levels of 200 and 500&#x000a0;mg BID of SMT19969 or placebo were studied in Groups G and H respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For Part 2, subjects received a twice daily (BID) oral dose of SMT19969 or placebo from Days 1 to 9 (12&#x000a0;hour interval), and a final single oral dose on the morning of Day 10. The morning doses were given 30&#x000a0;minutes after a light breakfast and the second daily doses were administered 50&#x000a0;minutes following an evening meal. All subjects in Part 2 returned for a post-study visit 5 to 7&#x000a0;days post final dose for the following safety assessments: Adverse event recording, blood pressure and pulse rate, oral body temperature, 12 lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations and physical examination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Inclusion criteria were that subjects were healthy males between 18 and 55&#x000a0;years of age with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 32&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were excluded if they or their partners were unwilling to use appropriate contraception, or had received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14&#x000a0;days, or had used any non-prescribed systemic medication within 7&#x000a0;days (with the exception of paracetamol &#x02264;2&#x000a0;g/day), or herbal supplements within 28&#x000a0;days. Subjects were also excluded if they had irregular bowel habits or had a positive faecal occult blood (FOB) at Screening and Day &#x02212;1 (Groups C to F) or Screening and Day &#x02212;2 (Part 2). Further exclusion criteria included cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption &#x0003e;28 units per week, tobacco consumption &#x0003e;15 cigarettes per day or a clinically significant illness within 4&#x000a0;weeks of enrolment. All subjects underwent study-specific screening within 28&#x000a0;days prior to the first dose administration. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Subject&#x02019;s race was recorded as either American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White or Other. Where the race identify was recorded as Other, then additional specific information was noted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>The treatment randomisation was produced by the Statistics Department at Covance CRU using a computer-generated pseudo-random permutation procedure. Two subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo for Groups B-H whereas for Group A sentinel dosing was used. Subjects were dosed in numerical order according to the treatment randomisation. Subjects were enrolled by blinded clinical staff, whilst subjects were assigned to interventions by unblind pharmacy staff who prepared the unit doses for the subjects and kept a copy of the master treatment randomisation. Unit doses were given to the participants in a blinded manner by the clinical staff. The Investigator, clinical staff and data management staff remained blinded until database lock. To enable the Investigator to break the code, if required for safety reasons, individual sealed envelopes containing the treatment code for each subject were kept in the Covance CRU pharmacy. If it was necessary to break the code during the study, the date, time and reason would have been recorded in the subject&#x02019;s source data and on the individual envelope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Blood and faecal sampling</title><p>Approximately 2&#x000a0;mL of blood was collected at specific time points for each subject for quantification of SMT19969. In Part 1 blood was collected pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24&#x000a0;hours post-dose. In Part 2 blood was collected on Day 1 pre-am dose and at 2, 4, 8 and 12&#x000a0;hours post dose; Days 2 to 9 pre-am dose and Day 10 pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48&#x000a0;hours post dose.</p><p>The following pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero up to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>0-tlast</sub>), maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-compartmental procedures and actual sampling times post dose used in the computation of PK parameters. Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was defined as 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL. Due to the low levels and limited number of samples in which SMT19969 was detected, PK analysis conducted on &#x02018;worst case&#x02019; scenario with plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification (BLQ) from the time of pre-dose sampling (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) up to the time of the first quantifiable concentration set to a value of zero. The first BLQ value after a quantifiable level was replaced with the value of LLOQ (0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL). After this time point, BLQ plasma concentrations were set to zero. In Part 1 Groups C to F, faecal samples voided 0&#x02013;72 hours post dose were pooled each 24-hour interval and analysed for concentration of SMT19969. During Part 2, all faecal samples voided whilst resident in the CRU were collected and stored in a freezer within 15&#x000a0;minutes of voiding pending analysis. Analysis of faecal and plasma samples was performed by CLE (Harrogate UK). Concentrations of SMT19969 in plasma samples were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) following sample preparation by protein precipitation and on-line solid phase extraction. Faecal samples were homogenised (1:19 faeces: water/acetonitrile/methanesulfonic acid [60:40:1&#x000a0;v/v/v]) with concentrations of SMT19969 determined by LC-MS/MS. The faecal LLOQ was 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/g.</p><p>Day 5 and Day 10 faecal samples from three subjects in Group G and three pre-dose samples from Group C (as a negative control) were analysed for the presence of metabolites using accurate mass LC-MS (Thermo LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer). Data were interrogated for the presence of metabolites based on accurate masses of potential metabolites using Metworks software (version 1.2) in conjunction with Xcalibur 2.0.7.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Gut microbiota analysis</title><p>Pharmacodynamic measurements were performed on faecal samples in Part 2. Aliquots of the first faecal sample of the day voided on Days &#x02212;1, 4 and 9 were stored at -70&#x000b0;C pending analysis of gut microbiota. All anaerobic culture and manipulations were performed in an Anaerobic Workstation (Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK) at 37&#x000b0;C. A portion of each faecal sample (1&#x000a0;g) was diluted in 10&#x000a0;ml pre-reduced PBS to produce a 10% w/v faecal slurry.</p><p>For enumeration of <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores a 2&#x000a0;ml aliquot was removed which was treated with an equal volume of 96% ethanol and left for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature.

All AEs considered possibly or likely due to study drug were mild and no dose dependent relationship between SMT19969 and incidence or severity of AEs was noted. No clinically significant findings from blood pressure, body temperature, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory evaluations (serum biochemistry, urinalysis and haematology), faecal occult blood or physical examination were observed.</p><p>Oral administration was associated with negligible systemic exposure. Although this increased following administration with food, the levels achieved were low and no more than approximately three fold above the limit of quantification with the highest recorded C<sub>max</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.305&#x000a0;ng/mL. The increase in systemic exposure of SMT19969 when administered with food is not likely to be of clinical significance. Following dosing at 200&#x000a0;mg BID, Day 5 and Day 10, achieved mean (&#x000b1; SD) faecal concentrations were 1,466 (&#x000b1;547) &#x003bc;g/g and 1,364 (&#x000b1;446) &#x003bc;g/g, respectively, which were significantly above the MIC for <italic>C. difficile.</italic></p><p>The highly selective spectrum of activity of SMT19969 was confirmed by analysis of faecal samples obtained following repeat administration of SMT19969. With the exception of total clostridia, minimal disruption to the gut microbiota was observed. Notably, bacteroides, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, which have been associated with colonisation resistance, were largely unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].These data indicate that SMT19969, unlike vancomycin and metronidazole, may not cause ongoing collateral damage to the gut microbiota during CDI therapy, allowing for natural restoration of colonisation resistance to be initiated during treatment. Such attributes may be expected to result in reduced rates of recurrent infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this first in man study has shown oral administration of SMT19969 in healthy volunteers to be safe and well tolerated, to be associated with negligible oral bioavailability and to cause minimal disruption to gut microbiota. These results support continued clinical development of SMT19969 to further assess safety and efficacy as an oral therapy for CDI.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>MHW has received: consulting fees from Actelion, Astellas, Astra-Zeneca, Cerexa, Cubist, Durata, Merck, Nabriva, Novacta, Novartis, Optimer, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi-Pasteur, Summit, The Medicines Company and VH Squared; lecture fees from Abbott, Astra-Zeneca, Astellas and Pfizer; grant support from Abbott, Actelion, Astellas, bioMerieux, Cubist, Da Volterra, European Tissue Symposium, Merck and Summit (including for the current study); and a lecture fee from Alere paid to his department.
