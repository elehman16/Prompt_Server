Secondary outcomes: patient Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score; patient goals of care; patient, companion and surgeon satisfaction; video helpfulness; medical decision maker designation; and the frequency patients watch the video. Intent-to-treat analysis will be used to assess the impact of video assignment on outcomes.

</p><p>Advance care planning (ACP) is a process by which individuals contemplate future health states, clarify and discuss their goals and express goals-informed wishes for those health states &#x02013;&#x000a0;if illness may render that person unable to make decisions for him or herself in the future.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evidence supports that ACP discussions may decrease healthcare use, while increasing patient satisfaction, use of hospice and palliative care&#x000a0;and compliance with a patient's end-of-life wishes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;13</xref> For family members, ACP may also decrease anxiety, depression and stress, while increasing satisfaction with the quality of care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 14 15</xref> ACP is appropriate throughout multiple stages of illness and has not been associated with harm in previous studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Finally, the landmark 2014 Institute of Medicine report <italic>Dying in America</italic> advocates for increased ACP to explore patient wishes before they become acutely ill.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>As patients with advanced cancer undergoing major surgery often experience conditions that may increase their risk for both complications during surgery and postoperative outcomes (eg, functional decline, frailty, comorbidities and polypharmacy),<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref> it is likely beneficial for them to initiate ACP prior to surgery. A recent systematic review of palliative care interventions for surgical populations<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> highlighted five studies that explored ACP interventions in surgical populations.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;28</xref> These interventions involved further training or activation of surgical providers (ie, surgeons, anaesthesiologists and/or nurses) to have an ACP conversation with the patient prior to surgery and/or involvement of a palliative care specialist specifically to discuss ACP with the patient prior to surgery. These interventions found improved concordance and decreased decisional conflict between patients and surrogates about goals of care,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25 27</xref> improved documentation regarding power of attorney<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and were deemed helpful by study participants;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> none of these trials documented harms to patients or family members.</p><p>Verbal communication is the predominant modality for ACP between patients and providers<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and was the communication modality used in the above ACP interventions in surgical populations.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;28</xref> Yet, there are multiple barriers to optimal verbal communication in the patient-doctor relationship. Most importantly, verbal communication about ACP is inherently inconsistent and subjective, as standardising these conversations is challenging to impossible.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;34</xref> Conversations may also inaccurately convey the burden and outcomes of medical interventions, particularly when the patient has no previous knowledge or experience of aggressive medical treatments (ie, intubation, artificial ventilation, artificial nutrition) and/or settings (ie, an intensive care unit).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> While ACP innately requires verbal communication between patients and providers, such communication can be facilitated or enhanced through educational tools, such as a video. Video ACP tools have inherently stable content and thus may be a more objective, simple to understand and realistic modality through which to educate and activate patients about ACP.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> Thirteen randomised controlled trials in varying populations support that video-based ACP tools can empower patients and families to have ACP-related discussions,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;50</xref> though none of these studies was completed in surgical populations.</p><p>This investigation builds on the paucity of research concerning video ACP tools in surgical populations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Towards this goal, a randomised controlled clinical trial was initiated (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT02489799).</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this study is to evaluate whether, compared with a control video, an ACP video developed for patients and families pursuing aggressive surgical treatment for cancer impacts the patient centredness and ACP of the patient-surgeon conversation during the audio-recorded presurgical consent visit. The trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which supports comparative effectiveness research to help patients and other stakeholders make informed medical decisions.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> In light of this funding, the primary aim was selected based on 2&#x02009;years of intense engagement with patients and family members, as well as other key stakeholders including surgeons, anaesthesiologists, surgical nurses, surgical intensive care unit&#x000a0;(SICU) nurses, palliative care clinicians and health services researchers. We hypothesise that patients who view the intervention video will engage in a&#x000a0;more patient-centred communication with their surgeons, as compared with patients who view the control video (Hypothesis 1).</p><p>Our secondary aims explore multiple other patient and companion outcomes. Of note, accompanying family members or friends (ie, &#x02018;companions&#x02019;) are often present during the audio-recording of the presurgical visit. Our secondary outcomes include the following: how the ACP intervention video may impact mood-related outcomes, such as patient anxiety and depression; helpfulness of the video (from patient and companion perspectives); the patient's stated goals of care; satisfaction with the presurgical consent visit (from patient, companion and surgeon perspectives, as well as from consensus perspectives); whether the patient designates a medical decision maker and discusses his/her wishes with this designated person; and the frequency with which patients watch the video outside of the site of recruitment. We will measure the patient's level of anxiety and depression during two separate presurgical visits, as well as 1&#x02009;week after surgery and 1&#x02009;month after surgery. We hypothesise that patients who view the intervention video will be less anxious and depressed across all visits, as compared with patients who view the control video (Hypothesis 2). We hypothesise that patients will find the intervention video more helpful than the control video (Hypothesis 3). We also hypothesise that that patients will watch the intervention video more often than the control video (Hypothesis 4).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a two-arm, randomised superiority trial of an ACP video developed for patients undergoing major surgery for advanced cancer at a single, academic, inner city, tertiary care hospital.

These nine surgeons were chosen as they had sufficient cancer patient populations and were willing to be in the trial. All surgeons were comfortable with the ACP video and were shown both intervention and control videos prior to when data collection from their clinics commenced. In preparation for the study, surgeons described variations in their practice regarding presurgical visits and agreed on a single format to uniformly use for study patients; this format is composed of at least two visits with the surgeon prior to the actual surgery. Based on sample size calculations, explained in the Design justification section below, we aimed to recruit 90 patients for the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligible patients must be undergoing major surgery such that, due to the surgery itself and/or the patient's underlying medical conditions, the surgeon plans to postoperatively admit the patient to SICU. Major surgery is defined as &#x02018;surgery involving a risk to the life of the patient; specifically, an operation on an organ within the cranium, chest, abdomen or pelvic cavity.&#x02019;<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Study patients must also be scheduled for non-emergent surgery such that they have at least a day to review the video prior to signing surgical consent. Potential study patients must also meet the following inclusion criteria: plan to undergo surgery with one of the study surgeons, able to give informed consent and able to speak English. Patients will be excluded if they are younger than 18 years old or have visual or hearing impairments such that they are unable to view and/or hear the study videos.</p><p>Many patients are accompanied to the surgeon's clinic by a family member or friend (ie, a &#x02018;companion&#x02019;). There is no screening of companions for eligibility to participate. If eligible patients have a companion present during the audio-recording, these individuals are orally consented prior to the recording. Companions under the age of 18 years cannot participate in the audio-recording unless consented by parent/guardian. The oncological surgeons (n=9) and any of their clinic staff or trainees also provide written consent to be audio-recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Patients are recruited out of the nine surgical oncology clinics.

Patients are stratified by surgeon through a computer algorithm written in R,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> which performed a block randomisation with a block size of six. We are adopting a stratified approach to randomisation as we hypothesise that individual differences in surgeon demeanour may also impact study outcomes. We do not anticipate surgeons to recruit an equal number of patients given differences in practice type and volume; however, each surgeon was encouraged to recruit at least three patients to allow for clustering by surgeon in our analysis. The surgeons, patients, companions, principal investigator, coders and data analysts are blinded to the randomisation assignment; however, the recruitment staff cannot be blinded as they show the video and provide a video link to study patients.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Trial enrolment diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016257f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Study arms</title><p>Patients are randomly assigned to one of two arms: intervention video or control video.

</p></sec><sec id="s2q2"><title>Intent-to-treat</title><p>Our study will use an intent-to-treat approach in which all data from study patients in both intervention and control arms are used, regardless of the level of adherence to the study arms. We have also designed the study to minimise the possibility of both patient crossovers between intervention groups, as well as to reduce the chance that patients may see the video to which they are not randomised.</p></sec><sec id="s2q3"><title>Evaluation of hypotheses overview</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be calculated to summarise patients' characteristics and other baseline variables. Comparability of the intervention arm and the control arm will be assessed with regard to preintervention sociodemographic and health status measures derived from medical record abstraction. While randomisation should account for such differences, a two-sample t-test/Mann-Whitney test will be performed to investigate the difference in two means or medians for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test will be used to investigate the difference in proportions for binary or categorical variables. We will therefrom identify and determine possible necessary adjustment for some baseline attributes. Historically, patient gender, age, race, education and health status have been identified as important attributes and are usually adjusted for in the model. Surgeon attributes will be examined similarly.</p><p>Further statistical analyses will explore the association between intervention assignment and each of the outcomes. Based on the type of the data, summary univariate (descriptive) statistics (mean, SD, median, IQR, max, min, count, percentage) of all outcomes stratified by intervention assignment will be provided. Descriptive time trend plots (multiple visits) stratified by intervention assignment will be presented for outcomes that are measured at multiple visits. These plots will allow for the visual comparison of change patterns before and after the intervention in the two arms. Differences in outcomes between two arms at each visit will be tested by two-sample t-test/Mann-Whitney test or Fisher's exact test/&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, based on the data types of the outcomes.</p><p>For the primary outcome and some of the secondary outcomes, the descriptive statistical analyses will be followed by regression analyses, using mixed effects generalised linear models with link functions chosen that are specific to the data types of the outcomes. The data will have a two-level structure, being defined by individual patient nested within surgeons. To address the potential unmeasured influence of surgeon-level attributes on patient-level outcomes, we will model the variable &#x02018;surgeon&#x02019; as a random intercept. In most cases, the parameter of interest is the coefficient of the arm indicator, to be estimated as the intervention effect. All standard errors will be computed using the robust method.</p></sec><sec id="s2q4"><title>Hypothesis 1</title><p>Specifically, the primary outcome, patient&#x000a0;centredness of patient-surgeon conversations during a presurgical consent visit as measured through RIAS, is a continuous variable. Therefore, mixed effects linear regression models will be used, adjusting for relevant covariates, with inclusion of a random intercept for surgeon to account for the correlation of outcome values from patients of the same surgeon.</p></sec><sec id="s2q5"><title>Hypothesis 2</title><p>The secondary outcome HADS consists of two subscales, symptoms of anxiety and symptoms of depression. Subscale scores range from 0, indicating no distress, to 21, indicating maximum distress; a score higher than&#x000a0;7 indicates clinically meaningful anxiety or depression.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> We will therefore consider these two outcomes as two binary variables indicating the absence or presence of clinically meaningful anxiety or depression. HADS will be measured at all four visits. To examine the effect of the intervention on these two outcomes, mixed effects logistic regression models will be used, adjusting for baseline scores and other relevant covariates, with inclusion of a surgeon random intercept. This model will be used to assess the difference in HADS subscale scores between the two arms at V2&#x000a0;and V3 and then at V4. To assess the robustness of our estimates, an alternative model with the inclusion of interaction terms between arm indicator and visit indicator will be used to estimate the difference in differences from baseline to later visits between the two arms. This will provide us information on the changes in HADS scores across visits within each arm as well as how the change patterns differ between the two arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2q6"><title>Hypothesis 3</title><p>The secondary outcome Video Helpfulnes<italic>s</italic> will be measured at V2, and it&#x000a0;will be summarised into two categories, helpful versus not helpful. A mixed effects logistic regression, adjusting for relevant covariates, with a surgeon random intercept will be used to compare the helpfulness of the intervention video and the control video.</p></sec><sec id="s2q7"><title>Hypothesis 4</title><p>The frequencies the intervention video and control video are watched by patients outside of the medical clinic (ie, the extent to which patients choose to watch the video on their own time outside of direct interaction with the study staff) will be presented for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2q8"><title>Other outcomes and hypotheses</title><p>Goals of Care (Iowa Goals of Care) has two questions. The first asks patients to check their current medical goals relating to their surgery. The second asks patients to list and rank the top three goals. Goals of care data are to be collected at all four visits. We will stratify the data by intervention assignment, and we will then calculate frequencies and percentages of goals of care chosen and being ranked as top three goals at each visit to assess the changes in goals of care across visits and differences between the two arms.</p><p>Patient and Surgeon Satisfaction will be measured at the end of V2. The satisfaction score, as the sum of the scores of six questions (all in a Likert scale), ranges from 6 to 30, with a higher score indicating higher level of satisfaction. The intervention effects on patient satisfaction score and surgeon satisfaction score (surgeon's perception of patient's satisfaction level) will be examined separately by mixed effects linear regression models, adjusting for relevant covariates, with inclusion of a random intercept for surgeon. Future analyses will also explore whether discrepancy exists among patients', companions' and surgeons' perception.</p><p>Medical Decision Maker Designation will be measured at baseline and V4. It is an ordered categorical variable consisting of four possible answer options: (1) No, I don't have a medical decision maker; (2) Yes, I have a medical decision maker, but we have not specifically talked about this (what medical decisions they should make for me); (3) Yes, I have a medical decision maker, and our talk about this (what medical decisions they should make for me) was over 6&#x02009;months ago; and (4) Yes, I have a medical decision maker, and our talk this (what medical decisions they should make for me) was within the last 6&#x02009;months. We will construct a binary variable indicating whether there is an upward change in medical decision maker designation from V1 to V4. A mixed effects logistic regression, adjusting for baseline value and other relevant covariates, with a surgeon random intercept will be used to examine the difference in change patterns between the two arms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Data monitoring</title><sec id="s2r1"><title>Data security</title><p>During the data collection period, only the study team has access to the REDCap site that links the IDs to study patients.

The risk to participants is low.</p><p>The current study examines how ACP might be incorporated into surgical settings. As patients undergoing major surgery are at risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality, it is appropriate for these patients to initiate ACP prior to surgery. While the surgical consent process involves an explanation of the risks and benefits of the surgery, previous research<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> suggests that surgeons may have difficulty discussing detailed ACP wishes. Using an ACP video, this study hopes to empower patients to have more meaningful presurgical contemplation and conversation with both family members and their surgical team concerning their goals and wishes prior to major surgery.</p><p>If effective, the ACP video could be easily disseminated among patients, family members, surgery clinics and/or other pertinent stakeholders. Timing of when the patient watches the video in relation to their surgery and/or their visit(s) with the surgeon can be determined in future studies or per individual decision by the patient or surgeon. In planning this study, participant surgeons noted practice variations within general &#x02018;standard-of-care&#x02019; including that some surgeons routinely met with patients at least twice before the day of surgery, while others would meet only once. For the purpose of this study, participant surgeons agreed on the above-described standardised format of two presurgery visits and, therefore, timing of when the patient watched the video was standardised to be immediately after the surgeon recommended that the patient be scheduled for surgery.</p><p>In keeping with the principles of patient-centred outcomes research, both the intervention video and the resulting randomised control trial to assess its impact have been designed with extensive input from patients, family members, surgeons, health researchers and other stakeholders. This trial is also overseen by a readily available patient/family co-investigator who communicates at least monthly with the study team and reviews study progress as well as participates in data evaluation. Thus, the current investigation is patient&#x000a0;centred in outcomes and&#x000a0;in facilitation and data analysis.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Potential contributions of this study</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to explore the impact of a video ACP tool on surgeon, patient and family communication prior to major surgery. A strength of this study is that the intervention video and resulting randomised control trial were both developed based on input from patients, companions, surgeons, health services researchers and other stakeholders. Ultimately, the results of this randomised controlled trial may demonstrate that easy-to-disseminate videos may activate patients and improve the patient&#x000a0;centredness of surgeon-patient interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations regarding the study should be noted. First, the intervention video was initially conceptualised for a pancreatic cancer surgical population, potentially creating an issue for the generalisability of the video to a wider surgical population. Although the video was initially developed for the pancreatic cancer setting, the severity of pancreatic cancer surgery is analogous to other high-mortality/high-morbidity cancer surgeries. Moreover, the video itself does not specifically discuss cancer or pancreatic cancer. Thus, the intervention video should be relevant to a range of surgical patients and their families and is being evaluated among a group of patients with diverse cancer diagnoses.</p><p>Second, the selected outcomes and timeframe of the study may not be able to fully capture the effect of the intervention as the impact of the surgery and video may persist beyond the 1&#x02009;month timeframe of the study. In order to mitigate this concern, data for multiple patient-centred outcomes are&#x000a0;collected, many of which have been previously validated and used in surgical settings. These outcomes enable multi-faceted evaluation of the intervention. Additionally, results will be examined at several timepoints, including both preoperatively (V1, V2) and postoperatively (V3, V4). Yet, as other studies have shown benefit of ACP discussions as far as 12 months after hospitalisation and patient death,<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> we might also hypothesise further benefits of the intervention to be apparent just before and after patient death, which is outside of the current trial timeframe.</p><p>Third, surgeon-level factors will likely influence study outcomes. As all surgeons were privy to a general overview of the study and were provided with the opportunity to watch the intervention and control videos prior to agreeing to participate, the surgeons who ultimately decided to participate in the study may be biased in their pre-existing support for ACP. It is also possible that surgeons may have their own unconscious selection biases when referring patients to the study.</p><p>Fourth, one of the participating surgeons was featured in the intervention video. It is therefore possible that patients of this surgeon who are randomised to watch this video might surmise they are in the intervention group, which might impact their outcomes. In order to best account for these potential sources of bias, study randomisation is nested within surgeon site of recruitment. Further, the analysis plan's designation of the surgeon as a random intercept should address the potential unmeasured influence of surgeon-level attributes on patient-level outcomes.</p><p>A final limitation of the study is that it cannot control for the effect of a patient's medical course on study outcomes. Both presurgical factors such as diagnosis&#x000a0;and postsurgical factors such as surgical course or change in prognosis might contribute to anxiety and depression, as well as to a patient's goals of care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e321" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016257.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e323" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016257.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> RAA is the study principal investigator and she directed all study activities and coordinated between team members.
