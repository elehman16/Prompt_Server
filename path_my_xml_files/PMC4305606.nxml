basic element of a healthy and pleasant life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining stability is most important in moving the body forward
through repeated use of the legs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
muscles of the hip joint are responsible for stabilizing the pelvic and lumbar regions and
play an important role in kinematic control during walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The increased incidence of a sedentary lifestyle and the lack of exercise among modern
people has resulted in an increased incidence of back pain, and a habitual sedentary
lifestyle decreases abdominal muscle strength and increases the degree of body
imbalance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. An excessive biomechanical
load on the lumbar area can induce pain in the lumbar region, due to abdominal muscle
atrophy and weakening, and spinal joint instability, and decrease joint endurance,
flexibility, and range of motion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar
muscle weakness and imbalance are major factors in reduced exercise performance, and
strengthening the muscles in the lumbar region reportedly facilitates efficient functioning
of the upper and lower body<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Back pain decreases an individual&#x02019;s walking speed and pain-related gait disturbances
typically appear association with in back pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The walking characteristics of patients with back pain include
decreased walking speed and an asymmetrical gait posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. To prevent and treat these conditions, strength training and
stabilization exercises are performed, including mat, ball, and sling exercises, and
plyometric and circuit training. Ultimately, the purpose of stabilization exercises is to
recover movement control and balance by increasing spinal and pelvic stability during
functional posture and movement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To increase the exercise performance rate, an exercise that can easily be performed by
anyone is needed. Walking is a simple exercise with a low probability of injury that
requires no special technique and can be performed by anyone<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, walking is a representative aerobic exercise, and
improper walking form with body imbalance may cause pain. Therefore, in this study, we
investigated the effects of running in place accompanied by the abdominal maneuver, a basic
stabilization exercise, on gait characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 30 male and female college students who were randomly assigned to
either the training group (TG) (male, 2; female, 13), which performed a walking in place
exercise, or the control group (CG) (male, 2; female, 13), which did not perform the walking
in place exercise. The selection criteria included people with no spinal abnormality, lumbar
pain, or neurological disorders, who did not drink before the experiment, and who were
neither overweight nor taking medicine. People who regularly performed weight training or
other exercises were excluded, because these exercises may affect gait characteristics. This
study was approved by the Korea Nazarene University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board and the
subjects were safely protected throughout the experiment. All of the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided their written informed consent prior to participating in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The mean age, height, and weight of the TG participants in this study were 21.5&#x000b1;0.5&#x02005;years,
162.4&#x000b1;7.1&#x02005;cm, and 55.4&#x000b1;6.7&#x02005;kg, respectively, while those of the CG participants were
20.5&#x000b1;0.8&#x02005;years, 163.3&#x000b1;4.9&#x02005;cm, and 57.6&#x000b1;9.2&#x02005;kg, respectively. Sex data were analyzed using
the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, while age, height, and weight data were analyzed using the
independent t-test. There were no intergroup differences (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>To maintain posture during the running in place exercise, the students were placed at the
very center of a marked 30-cm square space. The waist was straightened and subjects&#x02019; the
gaze was directed to the front. The jaw was withdrawn to maintain the cervical spine in the
neutral position and the transverses abdominis and multifidus muscles were contracted using
the abdominal drawing-in maneuver to maintain the waist and pelvis in the neutral position.
The participants&#x02019; feet were positioned 10&#x02005;cm apart and one knee was bent 90&#x000b0; and elevated to
reach the hip joint; the elbow opposite to the elevated leg was bent 90&#x000b0; and elevated to eye
level. Participants ran with arms and legs crossed in the sagittal plane, and the procedure
was repeated for a set number of times. While exercising, the subjects were advised to
maintain their posture with minimum deviation in all directions (left and right or to and
fro) within the restricted space. A total of three exercise sets were performed, and each
set consisted of 20 times running in place, a 15-s rest, 20 times running in place, a 15-s
rest, 30 times running in place, a 20-s rest, 30 times running in place, a 20-s rest, and 30
times running in place. The rest between sets was 3&#x02005;min long and one performance time was
defined as when both feet touched the ground. Each participant made 17 running motions every
10 s. To apply the optimal exercise intensity setting for the students and to increase the
load during the total 6-week exercise program, two sets were performed in the first and
second week, and three sets were performed in the third to sixth weeks. A 5-min light
stretching exercise was performed before and after the exercise sets. One 30-min round of
exercise was performed three times a week for 6 weeks. The CG participants did not perform
any particular exercise and they were assessed twice at the beginning and end of the
exercise intervention.</p><p>Gait analysis was performed using the OptoGait gait analysis system (Microgate Italy,
Bolzano-Bozen, Italy), a device consisting of an optical detection system. The transmitter
bar has 96 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that communicate in the infrared spectrum, the
receiver bar, which is positioned opposite it, has the same number of LEDs. The transmitter
and receiver bars of the OptoGait were installed on both sides of a treadmill. Communication
between the bars is blocked by the subjects&#x02019; movements during walking, and the interference
is used to derive the step length difference (SLD), stance phase difference (STPD), swing
phase difference (SWPD), single support difference (SSD), and step time difference (STD) are
evaluated. Using a data capture rate of 1,000 transmissions/receptions per second, running,
a series of jumping tests, or the time on the ground or in the air can be accurately
measured. From these basic data, the software analyzes the data measured in real time in a
series of movements. The data collected by the OptoGait uses the differences in gait
variables between the left and right legs; the smaller the difference, the greater the
stability and balancing ability.</p><p>The collected data were statistically processed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). The paired t-test was used to test the significance of the differences between before
and after the experiment in each group, and the independent t-test was used to test the
significance of the differences between the two groups. All data are shown as means and
standard deviation, and the significance level, &#x003b1;, was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>When pre- and post-intervention values of TG and CG were compared, SLD, SWPD, SSD, and STD

During functional movements, it enables the body to
assume a new posture with smooth movement of the center in preparation for the movement of
the arms and legs against gravity<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, when there is a problem in the lumbar region, the walking speed decreases and an
asymmetric gait posture develops<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>,
suggesting that stability of the body center has a large impact on limb movement. Judge et

strengthening exercises, stretching, and balance exercises improve muscle strength and
walking speed. Brill et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that the walking time and number of steps after exercise improved by 3.9% and 13.6% in
elderly individuals, respectively. The abdominal drawing-in method effectively stabilizes
muscles in the lumbar region, including the transversus abdominis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and running in

characteristics of the left and right legs in TG compared with those in the CG, which
suggests that the combination of dynamic lumbar stabilization exercises and upper and lower
extremity movements improved subjects&#x02019; stability and balancing ability. Panjabi<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the importance of lumbar
stabilization exercise in correcting a disturbed gait, and Topp et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> asserted that a muscle strengthening program effectively
improves stable walking speed and balancing capability. In addition, approximately 80% of
the time used for walking is occupied by the body being supported on one foot. The
alternating style of one-foot standing seems to be an important factor in balancing the
trunk, and Grabiner et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that trunk muscle strength is an important factor in gait stability.</p><p>In conclusion, running in place accompanied by the abdominal drawing-in technique helps
lumbar stabilization, strengthens and activates the muscles around the pelvis and hip
joints, and seems to have a positive effect on gait symmetry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Evaluation of gait stability using medio-lateral
