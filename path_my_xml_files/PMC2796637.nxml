After 14 hours' fasting, participants received a single dose of 2 &#x000d7; 200 mg ibuprofen acid tablets (standard ibuprofen), 2 &#x000d7; 256 mg ibuprofen sodium dihydrate tablets (sodium ibuprofen; each equivalent to 200 mg ibuprofen acid) and 2 &#x000d7; 200 mg ibuprofen acid incorporating 60 mg poloxamer 407 (ibuprofen/poloxamer). A washout period of 2-7 days separated consecutive dosing days. On each of the 3 treatment days, blood samples were collected post dose for pharmacokinetic analyses and any adverse events recorded.

Although ibuprofen is a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 forms, its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects are achieved principally through COX-2 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>With most analgesics, including ibuprofen, the initial rise in plasma concentration following oral administration is a key factor in determining the time to onset of pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Ibuprofen is rapidly absorbed, and both peak plasma concentrations and maximal analgesic onset are achieved within 1.5-2 hours of oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Key pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that there is a linear dose-response relationship between the amount of drug administered and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) following single doses of ibuprofen (200-800 mg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is also a significant correlation between plasma ibuprofen levels and the resultant degree of pain relief, particularly 1 hour after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>For orally administered standard ibuprofen formulations, it is desirable to have a formulation with a rapid rate of absorption because this is required for rapid pain relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is well documented that ibuprofen salts, such as ibuprofen lysine and ibuprofen arginate, are more rapidly absorbed than formulations of free ibuprofen acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Another ibuprofen salt, sodium ibuprofen dihydrate (ibuprofen sodium), manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, was recently shown to be bioequivalent to the lysine and arginate salt forms. Several studies have shown that faster-absorbed formulations lead to faster onset of analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare International (Hull, UK) has also developed ibuprofen formulations that are expected to be absorbed faster than standard ibuprofen acid. The first is a sodium ibuprofen formulation containing 256 mg of ibuprofen sodium dihydrate per tablet (equivalent to 200 mg ibuprofen acid). The second test ibuprofen formulation contains 200 mg ibuprofen acid plus 60 mg of the surfactant poloxamer 407 (from the poloxamer family of polymeric non-ionic surface active agents) to increase the rate of dissolution of the tablet and therefore enable more rapid absorption. Poloxamers have been used previously to enhance dissolution and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, including ibuprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this phase I study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of a single dose (2 tablets) of each of the two test formulations with those of standard ibuprofen (2 &#x000d7; 200 mg tablets) in healthy volunteers, in order to add to the growing body of evidence for the faster absorption rates of alternative ibuprofen formulations.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as referenced in EU Directive 2001/20/EC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and complies with International Conference on Harmonisation, Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol, together with participant information and consent documents, were reviewed and approved by South East Wales Local Research Ethics Committee.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy male and female volunteers 18-50 years of age (mean 27.2 years) and with a body mass index (BMI) of 20-27 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(mean 24.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were included in the study.

Participants reporting frequent dyspepsia, smoking in the previous 6 months and those with a history of drug misuse (including alcohol) were excluded from the study. Participants who had ingested a prescribed drug at any time within the 14 days preceding study enrolment (excluding hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy) or an over-the-counter (OTC) preparation within 7 days preceding enrolment were also excluded, as were those who had donated blood in the 12 weeks preceding enrolment.</p><p>Further exclusion criteria included: known risk factors for AIDS or known HIV positive status, a positive viral serology screen; those with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at screening; women of childbearing potential, who were pregnant or lactating, seeking pregnancy or failing to take adequate contraceptive precautions; those unable in the opinion of the investigator to comply fully with the study requirements; those previously randomised into the study; previous randomisation in the study or participation in a clinical trial in the previous 12 weeks; citizens of the United States of America and participants of any nationality who were not resident in the UK at the time of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomised, 3-way crossover, open-label, single-centre, pharmacokinetic study to compare the rate of absorption (assessed from pharmacokinetic parameters) of one standard and two test formulations of ibuprofen given in single doses.</p><p>Participants received a single dose of 2 &#x000d7; 200 mg ibuprofen acid tablets (standard ibuprofen; Nurofen<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>[Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare, UK]), 2 &#x000d7; 256 mg ibuprofen sodium dihydrate tablets (sodium ibuprofen; each equivalent to 200 mg ibuprofen acid) and 2 &#x000d7; 200 mg ibuprofen acid tablets each incorporating 60 mg poloxamer 407 (ibuprofen/poloxamer). A washout period of 2-7 days separated consecutive dosing days.</p><p>Participants attended an initial screening visit followed by three treatment visits, each of which required the participants to stay overnight and fast for 14 hours. A post-study follow-up visit occurred 2-7 days after the final treatment visit.</p><p>Alcohol consumption was limited to two units/day in the 7 days before the screening visit and participants were required not to drink alcohol from 48 hours before admission to the end of each treatment visit (i.e. until after the 12-hour blood sample). Caffeine intake was prohibited during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>A serum pregnancy test was conducted at the initial screening visit and at each treatment visit if appropriate. A urine sample was collected at each of the five visits for (1) urinalysis at the screening and post-study follow-up visits and (2) for drugs of misuse and alcohol at the pre-study visit and at each treatment visit. Haematology and biochemistry assessments were conducted at the screening visit and the post-study visit. On the three treatment days, blood samples (5 ml) were collected from all participants at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours post dose for pharmacokinetic analyses. More frequent sampling was conducted in the first hour to obtain accurate pharmacokinetic data during the initial absorption phase.</p><p>Safety was assessed in terms of the overall number of participants with adverse events. Adverse events were recorded in the case report forms by the investigator or designee after asking participants "Have you experienced any symptoms or complaints?" before dosing, at 4 and 12 hours post dose, prior to the subject leaving the unit, and again when the subject returned to the unit for their next visit. Spontaneously reported adverse events were also recorded, and laboratory values and vital signs were monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma ibuprofen determination</title><p>Plasma ibuprofen determinations were performed by Simbec Research Limited using a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry procedure (LC-MS) in negative ion mode.

Therefore, using the method of Diletti <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a sample size of 20 subjects was considered sufficient to detect a 20% difference between the test and reference formulations with a power of 80% and alpha of 5%, based upon a test versus reference ratio of 1.05. Since the main parameter of interest in this study was T<sub>max</sub>, the sample size calculation was also based on T<sub>max</sub>. The within-subject standard deviation for T<sub>max </sub>in the previous studies was found to be approximately 70 minutes. In order to detect a difference of 40 minutes in T<sub>max </sub>between the test and reference formulations, it was calculated that a sample size of 20 subjects would be required to give a power of 85%. Furthermore, the sample size of this study was in line with that used in similar published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>T<sub>max </sub>was analysed using a Wilcoxon matched pairs test.

Three individuals reported a total of four adverse events, three of which were considered mild and one moderate, but none was considered to be related to the study drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study showed that the T<sub>max </sub>for the sodium ibuprofen formulation was less than half that of the standard ibuprofen acid formulation, suggesting that the rate of absorption of sodium ibuprofen was twice as fast as that of standard ibuprofen tablets. As expected, this increased rate of absorption was accompanied by an increase in the peak plasma concentration of ibuprofen. Furthermore, the CI of the ratio of the sodium ibuprofen/standard ibuprofen tablets for C<sub>max </sub>was outside the 80-125% limit specified in the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) guidelines for bioavailability and bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The fact that the sodium ibuprofen formulation was not bioequivalent with the standard ibuprofen acid formulation was expected given the faster absorption of ibuprofen from the sodium formulation. This is likely to be due to faster dissolution and more rapid availability of ibuprofen particles for absorption, as suggested by Sorgel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The literature suggests that the addition of poloxamer 407 to the ibuprofen acid formulation might have resulted in a faster absorption of ibuprofen than from standard ibuprofen formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although the time to reach the peak plasma concentration was, on average, 20 minutes faster with the ibuprofen/poloxamer tablets, this difference failed to achieve statistical significance. As it had been anticipated that the difference in T<sub>max </sub>between the ibuprofen acid and ibuprofen/poloxamer formulations would be 40 minutes, the study was not sufficiently powered (i.e. 31% only) for the observed difference to be statistically significant. The CI of the ratio of the ibuprofen/poloxamer to the standard ibuprofen tablets for C<sub>max </sub>was within the 80-125% limit specified in the CPMP guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and FDA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As the CI of the ratio of the ibuprofen/poloxamer to the standard ibuprofen tablets for AUC also fell within this limit, the ibuprofen/poloxamer and standard ibuprofen formulations can be considered bioequivalent.</p><p>The differences between the sodium ibuprofen formulation and the standard ibuprofen formulation would not be expected to result in adverse clinical consequences in terms of either safety or efficacy. In support of this, there were no clinically significant safety findings in the present study.</p><p>The data from this study show that the overall amount of drug to which the participants were exposed was the same for the three formulations. However, because of the faster absorption of ibuprofen from the sodium ibuprofen formulation compared with the standard formulation, it is expected that an OTC dose of two 256 mg sodium ibuprofen tablets may provide faster onset of analgesia without compromising safety or duration of analgesia. Previous studies have demonstrated that the median time to meaningful pain relief for ibuprofen arginate was half that of the standard ibuprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because the T<sub>max </sub>for sodium ibuprofen in this study (median: 35 min) was found to be similar to ibuprofen arginate (mean: 33.6 min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it can be expected that sodium ibuprofen would induce analgesic effects with a similar onset of action as ibuprofen arginate. Such a formulation would be a valuable addition to the OTC choice currently available to individuals with acute pain. To this extent, a clinical trial was conducted to explore this and data are published separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sodium ibuprofen formulation is equivalent to standard ibuprofen in terms of extent of absorption, but its rate of absorption, as measured by T<sub>max</sub>, is significantly faster (i.e. it was absorbed twice as fast as standard ibuprofen) and C<sub>max </sub>is significantly higher. However, the ibuprofen/poloxamer formulation was bioequivalent to the standard ibuprofen formulation. Therefore, it is expected that an OTC dose of two 256 mg sodium ibuprofen tablets may provide faster onset of analgesic benefit, without compromising safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was funded by Reckitt Benckiser Group plc.
