Patients requiring intubation or re-intubation and mechanical ventilation in the ICU with an expected ventilation duration of more than 24 h and nonpregnant patients were eligible. Exclusion criterion was patients who had a previous tracheal injury. Eligible patients were orally intubated with an endotracheal tube allowing suction above the cuff (internal diameter = 7.5 Mallinckrodt<sup>&#x02122;</sup> TaperGuard Evac oral tracheal tube, Covidien, MA, USA). The main objective was to compare the effect of CSSS to ISSS on tracheal mucosa damage by fiber-optic bronchoscopy. This study did not evaluate potential lesions secondary to the cuff of the endotracheal tube on tracheal mucosa. Accordingly, only the tracheal zone in front of the subglottic suctioning port was explored. Secondary end points included the mean daily volume of suctioned secretions, the mean daily number of difficulties (defined as a failure to aspirate resolved with rinse of the suction lumen of the endotracheal tube) or impossibility to aspirate (impossibility to aspirate not resolved despite rinsing), the incidence of VAP, and the occurrence of postextubation laryngeal edema.</p><p>Approval of the Committee for Protection of People in Biomedical Research of Rennes (date of acceptance: October 5, 2010) and written informed consent from each participant or next of kin were obtained. The patients were randomized to receive CSSS at &#x02212;20 mmHg or ISSS (suction at &#x02212;100 mmHg during 15 &#x000b1; 3 s and no suction during 8 &#x000b1; 3 s) with an automatic suctioning unit (Intermittent suction unit, Ohio Medical, IL, USA). Randomization was computer generated with a 1:1 ratio.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Evaluation of tracheal injury and management of the endotracheal tube</title><p>The degree of tracheal mucosa damage was determined using fiber-optic bronchoscopy after intubation (T0) and before extubating (T1). The occurrence (no injury observed at T0 but present at T1) or the worsening (injury observed at T0 exacerbating at T1) was studied. Bronchoscopy was performed through the endotracheal tube and allowed a visualization of the tracheal mucosa in front of the suctioning port as previously described.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The severity was graded into five categories (no injury, erythema, edema, ulceration, or necrosis). Fiber-optic bronchoscope was performed by three trained pulmonologists blinded of the study arm, with suctioning being stopped at the moment of the bronchoscopy. The exact position of the endotracheal tube and the pressure of the cuff were checked daily and maintained between 20 and 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O to avoid inadvertent mobilization and under- or overinflation cuff, respectively. If a tracheostomy was required, the bronchoscopy was performed before its realization.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>The following parameters were collected: age, sex, severity assessed according to the Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score during the 24 h following intubation, reasons for ICU hospitalization, and intubation.

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Qualitative variables were compared between the two groups with the Chi-square of the Fisher's exact test when needed, and continuous variables were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate.

Postextubation laryngeal edema was not observed in the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>In our study, the global incidence of mucosa tracheal damage when subglottic secretion drainage was applied with the TaperGuard Evac oral tracheal tube was 23%, but the modality of suction (continuous vs. intermittent) did not influence the occurrence of tracheal mucosa injuries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which has evaluated continuous versus intermittent subglottic suctioning in human. Continuous suctioning was associated with more frequent impossibility to aspirate and lower volume of suctioned secretions. Postextubation laryngeal edema was not observed. This result has been largely confirmed in larger studies, but the absence of postextubation laryngeal edema does not signify that tracheal injuries induced by suctioning are not present.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In a prospective randomized study realized in sheep, Berra <italic>et al</italic>. showed that CSSS at &#x02264;20 mmHg with a 8 mm Hi-Lo Evac Mallinckrodt endotracheal tube-induced macroscopic tracheal injuries in all animals, notably necrosis and/or hemorrhage in the area of the subglottic port of the endotracheal tube.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nevertheless, despite efforts to mimic human's tracheal orientation, it cannot be excluded that the tracheal anatomy of sheep favored a tight contact between the subglottic port and tracheal mucosa, and our results do not support this observation in humans.</p><p>In critically ill patients, it has been reported an incidence of 40% of postextubation laryngeal edema with continuous suctioning but representing only two of the five patients who were extubated.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Since this publication, postextubation edema associated with continuous subglottic suctioning has been reported ranging from 2.9% to 10.1% in larger populations but did not differ from control groups without suctioning.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] With regard to the high frequency of suction dysfunction (19/40 ICU patients), fiber-optic bronchoscope examination revealed that, in 85% of cases, dysfunction was attributed to an obstruction of the subglottic port related to suctioned mucosa raising concerns about the safety of the method.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Two observations of tracheoesophageal fistula in severe trauma patients intubated with a Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo Evac and suspected to be in relation to the site of subglottic suctioning have been reported.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the same way, a recent report performed in six patients intubated with a 8 mm Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo Evac endotracheal tube in which an intermittent suctioning at &#x02212;125 mmHg during 15 s was applied, showed on computed tomography-scan an entrapment of the tracheal mucosa into the subglottic port of the tube.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, intermittent suctioning provided a significant 3-fold increase in volume of suctioned secretions, and this observation may be related to a lower rate obstruction of the subglottic port. Although this point cannot be proved because not specifically explored, this hypothesis is likely and reinforced by the higher rate of impossibility to aspirate in the continuous suctioning group. This finding may be interesting in clinical practice because the more secretions are removed; the less will pass the endotracheal cuff.</p><p>The incidence of tracheal mucosa damage we observed was lower than expected. This can be explained by the utilization of the latest generation of TaperGuard endotracheal tube used in our study in comparison to older studies. Indeed, in the latest generation, the subglottic port was closer to the cuff and the suction lumen larger to limit tracheal mucosa injury and obstruction, respectively. As the number of patients included was also lower than calculated, a lack of statistical power cannot be ruled out to explain our negative result on mucosal damage. In fact, with an incidence of tracheal of 23%, to test the hypothesis that the absolute difference between groups observed for the primary endpoint was real, a total of 212 participants would be needed to show a statistical difference with an 80% power. Finally, the -100 mmHg applied in the intermittent group may appear too high, but it was the level of aspiration recommended by the manufacturer, and at least two studies have used such aspiration level.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Our results suggest that intermittent suctioning did not reduce mucosal damage as compared with continuous suctioning.
