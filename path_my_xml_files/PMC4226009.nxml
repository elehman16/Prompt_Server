<italic>Publication of statistical analysis plans</italic>
</bold></title><p>The review and publication of study protocols by medical journals are increasingly becoming an accepted means for promoting good quality research and maximising transparency. Since 1997 <italic>The Lancet</italic> has actively invited investigators to submit their protocols to the journal for peer review, offering a provisional commitment to publish the principal results where their criteria are satisfied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since 2001, following a call from Chalmers and Altman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], <italic>BioMed Central</italic> has been inviting trialists and other researchers to publish their full protocols online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>The British Medical Journal</italic>, while not offering peer review or publication as yet, has required authors to submit trial protocols with their manuscripts since January 2005, making them available to editors and reviewers as additional documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. More recently, calls have been made for the publication of other key trial documentation. Chan, for instance, has argued the case for public access to regulatory agency submissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In an editorial for <italic>Critical Care and Resuscitation</italic>, Finfer and Bellomo suggested the publication of statistical analysis plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The plans for the NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycaemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation) and RENAL (Randomised Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level of Replacement Therapy) studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were published in the same issue.</p><p>A statistical analysis plan (SAP) is defined within the International Conference on Harmonisation&#x02019;s guidance on the statistical principles for clinical trials (ICH E9) as &#x02018;a document that contains a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the analysis described in the protocol, and includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. According to ICH E9, the statistical analysis plan should be pre-specified, completed after the protocol has been finalised but reviewed and possibly updated as a result of a blind review of the data carried out after the completion of data collection. It is suggested that details of the primary analysis should be clearly distinguished from those of supporting analyses and that the methods for handling missing data, outliers and multiplicity be described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. While the statistical analysis plan is clearly an important document, at present it is rarely made available to people outside of the study.</p><p>There are many reasons why study-specific statistical analysis plans should be published in full, with electronic journals offering the greatest potential for this to be commonplace. Due to space constraints, the paper providing the principal results often contains only a very limited description of the analyses that were planned or carried out. If the study protocol is published, further information is likely to be available. However, this is often insufficient to enable full replication of the analyses. The statistical analysis plan complements both the protocol and the principal paper by providing a systematic and comprehensive description of the planned analyses, taking into consideration any relevant methodological or clinical developments that may have arisen since the study&#x02019;s inception. Its publication enables any changes to the original plan to be laid out, increasing the scientific rigour and transparency with which the principal analyses are currently reported.</p><p>Maximum transparency regarding what decisions were made <italic>a priori</italic> could be achieved by publishing the statistical analysis plan, which has been approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), before the results of a study are known. The final analyses reported may differ from those planned, allowing for <italic>post</italic>-<italic>hoc</italic> analysis where it is indicated (as Finfer and Bellomo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have noted), reporting alternative methods if statistical models do not converge, and omitting planned analyses that are superseded, redundant, or no longer of interest. Assessment of the validity of the analyses, reporting and consequent interpretation would also be made easier by the increased visibility of selective or misreporting. This may, in turn, encourage more balanced, accurate and complete reporting of results and ultimately help to raise the standard of trial analyses. Peer review has particular advantages, as it encourages dialogue, the quality of which is likely to be improved by the level of detail given. Knowledge of this added scrutiny should, in turn, act to promote the quality of the submitted plan. This process would be especially valuable if the research is anticipated to generate debate or if it might have a large impact on clinical practice.</p><p>The benefits of publication go beyond those specific to the study. Making statistical analysis plans accessible will help future statisticians and other researchers design and analyse better studies. This is because each study throws up different issues, often more complex than the standard textbook ones. Publishing details of the ways in which different groups choose to address these helps to generate discussion and could also promote greater communication and collaboration between methodologists, applied statisticians and researchers.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>The PACE trial</italic>
</bold></title><p>The rationale for the trial is outlined in the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and main clinical paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To be brief, chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by chronic disabling fatigue in the absence of an alternative diagnosis, present in 0.2 to 2.6% of the population. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, UK) recommends two treatments: cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET), but patient organisations recommend a third treatment: adaptive pacing therapy (APT). A definitive randomised trial was therefore needed to compare all three treatments with specialist medical care (SSMC) and to compare the established treatments (CBT, GET) against the new treatment (APT).</p><p>The objective of this paper was to make public and report in detail the planned analyses for the principal papers of the PACE (Pacing, graded Activity, and Cognitive behaviour therapy; a randomised Evaluation) trial, using the template statistical analysis plan developed by the Mental Health and Neuroscience (MH&#x00026;N) Clinical Trials Unit based at the Institute of Psychiatry. These planned analyses were written with a view to publication and are reproduced almost as they were approved by the Trial Steering Committee (Version 1.2 dated 2 May 2010) prior to database lock. The changes from the original document were editorial clarifications suggested by reviewers and editors for which we are most grateful; these changes in no way alter the strategy for analysis. The SAP supplements the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the main clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and health economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] papers and the authors&#x02019; reply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] to a selection of correspondence published by the Lancet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They also provide an illustration of the planned analyses of a complex intervention trial taking into account the impact of clustering by care providers, where multiple care providers are present for each patient in some but not all arms of the trial. Details of the statistical aspects of multiple therapist-per-patient designs are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Introduction</italic>
</bold></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Purpose and scope of statistical analysis strategy</bold>&#x02009;This document details the presentation and analysis strategy for the principal paper(s) reporting results from the PACE Trial. It is intended that the results reported in these papers will follow the strategy set out here; subsequent papers of a more exploratory nature will not be bound by this strategy but will be expected to follow the broad principles laid down for the principal papers. The principles are not intended to curtail exploratory analysis or to prohibit sensible statistical and reporting practices, but they are intended to establish the strategy that will be followed, as closely as possible, when analysing and reporting the trial. Reference was made to the published trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], ICH Guidance on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (E9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], CPMP points to consider on multiplicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and CONSORT guidelines for the reporting of harms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and for non-pharmacological treatment trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Analysis strategy group</bold>&#x02009;The Statistical Analysis Strategy was developed by the PACE Analysis Strategy Group whose members were:</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Michael Sharpe (Chair, Principal Investigator)</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Rebecca Walwyn, Laura Potts, Tony Johnson and Kim Goldsmith (Statisticians)</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Paul McCrone (Health Economist)</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Peter White and Trudie Chalder (Principal Investigators)</p><p>&#x02013;&#x02009;Julia DeCesare and Hannah Baber (Trial Managers)</p></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Convention</italic>
</bold></title><p>Throughout this Statistical Analysis Strategy the four individual randomised interventions are referred to as APT (adaptive pacing therapy <italic>plus</italic> standardised specialist medical care), CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy <italic>plus</italic> standardised specialist medical care), GET (graded exercise therapy <italic>plus</italic> standardised specialist medical care), and SSMC (standardised specialist medical care <italic>alone</italic>).</p><p>Unless stated otherwise &#x02018;intervention&#x02019; refers to the four randomised interventions (group), and &#x02018;therapy&#x02019; refers to APT, CBT, or GET. &#x02018;Treatment&#x02019; is used more generally and embraces all forms including drugs.</p><p>The anchoring date for visits and assessments is randomisation; thus 24&#x000a0;weeks refers to 24&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Trial design and objectives</italic>
</bold></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Study objectives</bold>&#x02009;The PACE trial aims to answer the questions set out below under primary objectives, secondary objectives, and health economics objectives.</p><p><bold>Primary objectives</bold>:</p><p>1. Is APT more effective than SSMC in reducing (i) fatigue or (ii) disability up to 52&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation?</p><p>2. Is CBT more effective than SSMC in reducing (i) fatigue or (ii) disability up to 52&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation?</p><p>3. Is GET more effective than SSMC in reducing (i) fatigue or (ii) disability up to 52&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation?</p><p>4. Is CBT more effective than APT in reducing (i) fatigue or (ii) disability up to 52&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation?</p><p>5. Is GET more effective than APT in reducing (i) fatigue or (ii) disability up to 52&#x000a0;weeks from randomisation?</p><p><bold>Secondary objectives</bold>:</p><p>1. Is the pattern of results relating to the primary objectives replicated with the outcome as the participants&#x02019; self-rated clinical global impression change rating?</p><p>2. Do different interventions have differential effects on the two primary outcomes (that is, fatigue versus disability)?</p><p>3. Are the differences across interventions in the primary outcomes associated with similar differences in secondary outcomes?</p><p>Health economics objectives</p><p>The primary health economics objectives are as indicated below:</p><p>1. To compare care costs (including the costs falling to health service agencies, other agencies and also those borne by patients and their carers) and lost-employment costs up to 52&#x000a0;weeks for (i) CBT versus APT; (ii) GET versus APT; (iii) SSMC versus APT; (iv) CBT versus SSMC; (v) GET versus SSMC; and (vi) CBT versus GET.</p><p>2. To assess the relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of APT, CBT, GET, and SSMC (with costs based on health, social care, and informal care) up to 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The secondary health economics objectives are as indicated below:</p><p>1. To compare care costs (including the costs falling to health service agencies, other agencies and also those borne by patients and their carers) and lost-employment costs between randomisation and 24&#x000a0;weeks for (i) CBT versus APT; (ii) GET versus APT; (iii) SSMC versus APT; (iv) CBT versus SSMC; (v) GET versus SSMC; and (vi) CBT versus GET.</p><p>2. To assess the relative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of APT, CBT, GET, and SSMC (with costs based on health, social care, and informal care) up to 24&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>3. To describe the annual healthcare and societal costs at baseline and their association with clinical and demographic characteristics.</p><p>4. To describe and compare patterns of service utilisation up to 24&#x000a0;weeks and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks across the four interventions.</p><p>5. To identify patient characteristics which predict service costs for each intervention.</p><p>6. To identify patient characteristics which predict cost-effectiveness/cost-utility up to 24&#x000a0;weeks, and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks for each intervention.</p><p>Health economic hypotheses</p><p>The primary hypotheses are:</p><p>1. Health and other service costs do not differ between APT, CBT, and GET up to 24&#x000a0;weeks, and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks, but are all higher than the costs for SSMC.</p><p>2. Total (health and societal) costs up to 24&#x000a0;weeks, and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks, are highest for SSMC, followed by APT, and with no substantial difference between CBT and GET.</p><p>3. APT has better cost-effectiveness and cost-utility than SSMC up to 24&#x000a0;weeks, and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>4. Both CBT and GET have better cost-effectiveness and cost-utility than SSMC and APT up to 24&#x000a0;weeks, and up to 52&#x000a0;weeks, but their cost-effectiveness does not differ substantially.</p><p>The secondary hypotheses are:</p><p>1. Higher healthcare costs are associated with being female, being older and having comorbid conditions, particularly mood disorders and having other symptom-based diagnoses.</p><p>2. Higher total societal costs are associated with being male, being younger, having more severe physical disability, pervasive passivity (measured by actigraphy), certain illness beliefs, and having comorbid conditions, particularly mood disorders and having other symptom-based diagnoses.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Outcome measures</bold>&#x02009;The primary outcome measures will be:</p><p>1.

Adaptive pacing therapy&#x02009;+&#x02009;standardised specialist medical care (APT).</p><p>APT is based on the illness model of CFS/ME as a currently undetermined organic disease, with the assumption that APT can improve quality of life while not affecting the core disease other than providing the best conditions for natural recovery.

There are three essential elements: (a) assessment of illness beliefs and coping strategies; (b) structuring of daily rest, sleep, and activity, with a graduated return to normal activity; and (c) collaborative challenging of unhelpful beliefs about symptoms and activity.</p><p>3. Graded exercise therapy&#x02009;+&#x02009;standardised specialist medical care (GET).</p><p>GET is based on the illness model of deconditioning and exercise intolerance, used in the previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therapy involves an assessment of physical capacity, negotiation of an individually designed home exercise programme with set target heart rates and times, and participant feedback with mutual planning of the next fortnight&#x02019;s exercise programme.</p><p>4. Standardised specialist medical care alone (SSMC).</p><p>SSMC is given to all participants and includes visits to the clinic doctor with general, but not specific advice, regarding activity and rest management, such as advice to avoid the extremes of exercise and rest, as well as symptomatic pharmacotherapy. SSMC is standardised in the SSMC Doctor&#x02019;s Manual. SSMC participants, like all other participants, will already have received the patient clinic leaflet (PCL). There will be no additional therapist involvement, and, in particular, there will be no diary monitoring with consequent advice.</p><p><bold>Participating centres</bold>:</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> gives the details of the participating centres, including their IDs.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Details of participating centres</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>ID</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Clinical service</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Centre leaders</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chronic Fatigue Clinic, St Bartholomew&#x02019;s Hospital, London<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Professor PD White<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Service, Western General and Astley Ainsley Hospitals, NHS Lothian, Scotland<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr D Wilks, Professor MC Sharpe<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chronic Fatigue Research Unit, King&#x02019;s College Hospital, London<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Professor T Chalder, Professor S Wessely<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">4<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chronic Fatigue Clinic St Bartholomew&#x02019;s Hospital, London<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr M Murphy<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust and Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals Trust, Oxford<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr B Angus, Professor T Peto, Dr E Feldman<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">6<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fatigue Service Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust, London<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr G Murphy<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">Pain Management Centre Frenchay Hospital, Bristol</td><td align="left">Dr H O&#x02019;Dowd</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Centres 1 and 4 were combined on 01 June 2006 and are regarded as a single centre for both randomisation and analysis.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><bold>Sample size calculation taken from the protocol (v5.2)</bold></title><p>The following is quoted from the PACE trial protocol (v5.2) (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) and describes sample size estimation based on percentages responding to the trial interventions. The primary outcomes were changed subsequently to measures on continuous scales.</p><p>At one year we assume that 60% will respond with CBT, 50% with GET, 25% with APT, and 10% with SSMC. The existing evidence suggests that at one-year follow-up, 50 to 63% of participants with CFS/ME had a positive outcome, by intention to treat, in the three RCTs of rehabilitative CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] with 69% improved after an educational rehabilitation that closely resembled CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This compares with 18 to 63% improved in the two RCTs of GET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and 47% improvement in a clinical audit of GET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. For usual medical care 6 to 17% improved by one year in two RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. There are no previous RCTs of APT to guide us, but we estimate that APT will be at least as effective as the control therapy of relaxation and flexibility used in previous RCTs, with 26 to 27% improved on primary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Our planned intention to treat analyses will compare APT against SSMC alone, and both CBT and GET against APT. Assuming &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;5% and a power of 90%, we require a minimum of 135 participants in the SSMC alone and APT groups, 80 participants in the GET group and 40 in the CBT group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However these last two numbers are insufficient to study predictors, process, or cost-effectiveness. We will have low statistical power to detect the difference between CBT and GET, though our estimates will be useful in planning future trials. As an example, to detect a difference in responder rates of 50 and 60%, with 90% power, would require 520 participants per group; numbers beyond a realistic two-arm trial. Therefore, we will study equal numbers of 135 participants in each of the four arms, which gives us greater than 90% power to study differences in efficacy between APT and both CBT and GET. We will adjust our numbers for dropouts, at the same time as designing the trial and its management to minimise dropouts. Dropout rates were 12 and 33% in the two studies of GET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and 3, 10, and 40% in the three studies of rehabilitative CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. On the basis of our own previous trials we estimate a dropout rate of 10%. We therefore require approximately 150 participants in each intervention group, or 600 participants in all. Calculation of the sample size required to detect economic differences between intervention groups requires data on cost per change in outcome, which are not currently available.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Stratification at randomisation</bold>&#x02009;Allocation of interventions to participants was by minimisation with a random component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and four stratification factors:</p><p>Centre (6 strata): 1 and 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7</p><p>CDC Criteria (2 strata): Met or unmet</p><p>London Criteria (2 strata): Met or unmet</p><p>Current Depressive Disorder (2 strata): Present or absent</p><p>Participants found to be incorrectly stratified will be kept in their original strata for the primary analysis in accordance with the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

This sample will be a subset of the ITT sample, excluding randomised participants who (i) are confirmed not to have met trial eligibility criteria at randomisation, and (ii) departed from their randomised intervention policy at any point up to 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>As-treated sample</bold>&#x02009;The as-treated sample is defined for the health economic analyses as all participants who were randomised into the trial and received one of the trial interventions.

</bold></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Blinding of randomised interventions</bold>&#x02009;The members of the Data Monitoring Committee, Trial Steering Committee and the trial statisticians were blinded to intervention allocation. Participants and all other research and therapy staff were not blinded, since it was impossible to do so. The steps taken to minimise and measure bias were:</p><p>1. Primary outcomes were self-rated by the participant.</p><p>2. Outcome assessments were coordinated by research workers not directly involved in the interventions participants received.</p><p>3. Equipoise was actively encouraged throughout the planning and course of the trial.</p><p>4. Baseline staff expectations regarding the outcome of the trial were recorded.</p><p>5. Participant intervention preferences and expectations regarding the outcome of their intervention were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Departure from intended therapy (APT, CBT, GET)</bold></title><p>Departures from intended therapy refer to discrepancies between the intended therapy (as described in the therapy manuals) and the manner in which the therapies were actually delivered within the trial. To assess the extent of fidelity to the manuals as well as the distinguishability of the therapies, a random sample of audio recordings of therapy session number 10 will be independently and blindly assessed at the end of the trial. This will be done by competent therapists who do not have specific allegiance to any of the three forms of therapy. The sample will be of sufficient size to ensure that at least one tape from each therapist will be assessed. Each tape will be evaluated by two raters using a treatment integrity schedule specifically designed for the purpose. The scheme will be piloted using three tapes from each therapy, nine in total. Inter-rater reliability will be assessed and the ratings reported using descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Departures from randomised intervention policy</bold>&#x02009;The overall definition of departures from the randomised intervention policy is given in terms of session attendance as:</p><p>a. Fewer than three sessions of SSMC (participants allocated SSMC only)</p><p>b. Fewer than ten sessions of APT, CBT or GET (participants allocated these therapies)</p><p>The number of sessions includes both face-to-face sessions and those conducted over the telephone. Within this definition, formal withdrawal from intervention after three sessions of SSMC or ten sessions of APT, CBT, or GET have been completed will not be regarded as a departure from the randomised intervention policy. However any participant withdrawing from his or her randomised intervention, or initiating another trial therapy prior to the above cut-offs would be regarded as a departure from the randomised intervention (it will be noted when this was by mutual consent). This includes participants randomised to SSMC who, in fact, receive APT, CBT or GET as a trial therapy. The overall compliance variable will therefore be binary separating those who followed their randomised intervention policy from those who did not.</p><p>The average (and range) of the numbers of therapy and SSMC sessions attended will be reported by intervention.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Withdrawals from intervention</bold>&#x02009;The decision to withdraw a participant from an intervention is made by the clinician or the participant (active withdrawals).</p><p>The number of active withdrawals (broken down by initiator (participant, clinical staff, both)) will be reported by intervention and centre, and by interval from randomisation. The most common reasons for withdrawal will be summarised.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Withdrawals from the trial and losses to follow-up</bold></title><p>The decision to withdraw a participant from follow-up within the trial is made only when the participant withdraws their consent to research follow-up. All reasonable attempts are made to continue to follow up all participants, including those that withdraw from intervention.</p><p>For the purposes of analysis, losses to follow-up are those missing all primary outcome scale data at all follow-up assessments, those missing all primary outcome scale data at weeks 24 and 52, or those missing all primary outcome scale data at week 52.</p><p>The numbers of withdrawals and losses to follow-up will be reported (see Comparisons of Losses to Follow-Up).</p></sec></sec><sec><title><bold>
<italic>Statistical considerations</italic>
</bold></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Stratification in the analysis</bold>&#x02009;The primary analysis of therapy effect will be adjusted by the factors used for stratification at randomisation (that is, centre, CDC criteria, London criteria and current depressive disorder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and by the baseline assessment of the outcome variable.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Method for handling centre effects</bold>&#x02009;The PACE trial was designed with variation in participant outcomes between centres rather than between doctors or therapists in mind. For the primary analysis to be consistent with the trial design, the primary method for handling contextual variation in the analysis of therapy effects will be to include centre as a fixed covariate. The centre that randomises the largest number of participants will be the reference category. The centre assigned to each participant will be based on the participant&#x02019;s centre at randomisation. Consideration will also be given to including centre as a random effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Method for handling other clustering effects</bold>&#x02009;Outcomes at weeks 12, 24 and 52 are nested within participants. The primary method for handling clustering associated with repeated measurements will be to fit a cluster-specific random effects model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] including the participant as a random intercept, and investigating the addition of a random slope over time. Where therapy effects cannot be interpreted as population-averaged effects because outcomes are binary, a population-average (GEE) model will also be fitted.</p><p>Due to (i) the nesting of participants within therapists and doctors; (ii) the partial nesting of therapists within APT, CBT, and GET as there was no therapist involvement in SSMC; and (iii) the crossing of doctors with interventions, variation in participant outcomes between therapists, and in intervention effects between SSMC doctors, are recognised to be potential sources of clustering in this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The data structure envisaged in the design (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) differs from that observed in practice due to a number of planned deviations resulting from unavoidable therapist absences (section 8.6 of Protocol v5.2). To summarise:</p><p>a. Local centre cover delivered by a PACE therapist of the same discipline working in a nearby centre will mean that some therapists will be crossed with centres.</p><p>b.

We will initially assume independence of outcomes within therapists/doctors in the primary analysis. Two further analyses are planned, using two-level heteroscedastic models assuming a fully nested design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], with clusters based on i) the main care provider and ii) the pair comprising the main therapist and the main doctor to assess the robustness of the model to the assumption of independence.</p><p>If no clustering is found in (i) supporting the conclusions of the primary analysis, then (ii) will not be performed. The &#x02018;main care provider&#x02019; is defined as the therapist or doctor providing the largest number of trial therapy sessions for each participant. As such, the main care provider is likely to be a therapist for APT, CBT, and GET and a doctor for SSMC. To be explicit, if the doctor provides more sessions than the therapist in APT, CBT or GET then the doctor is the main care provider (see Departures from Randomised Intervention Policy). If there is a tie in number of sessions delivered by two care providers the main care provider will be the one who delivered the earlier sessions.</p><p>In summary, three analyses are planned: 1) without accounting for therapist effect/clustering, 2) accounting for main care provider, and 3) accounting for both the main therapist and main doctor for each participant. The third will not be done if the second shows no clustering effects.</p><p>An analysis accounting for the effect of clustering on secondary outcomes will be considered.</p><p>Any differences in the point estimates, confidence intervals (CIs) or conclusions will be reported. Any problems encountered in fitting these models will be reported and the scope of the analyses will be restricted; the weights used within the multiple membership model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] will be determined by the proportion of participants treated by each therapist/doctor.</p><p>Additional models to explore or take account of complex clustering effects may also be fitted; if so, the motivation for these will be reported together with their results.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Method for handling dropouts and missing data</bold>&#x02009;Data are missing completely at random (MCAR) when they represent a simple random sample of the complete sample and the missing data mechanism is independent of all observed and unobserved variables. The assumption that data are missing at random (MAR) is reasonable when missing data represent an identifiable stratified sample of the complete sample and the missing data mechanism is dependent only on other known and observed variables. Data are missing not at random (MNAR) where missing data represent an unidentifiable stratified sample of the complete sample and the missing data mechanism depends on measured and unmeasured variables. The model describing the missing data mechanism will take any clustering effects into consideration. The planned strategy for handling missing data at the item [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] levels will depend on whether the amount of item-missing data observed is minimal. Within practical constraints it will be assumed that data are missing at random (MAR) conditional on the variables included in the substantive model.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Missing item data</bold>&#x02009;To ensure the same strategy is followed across all scales reported in the principal paper(s) any guidance given by authors of validated questionnaires will be superseded by the strategy outlined here. Where item-missing data are considered minimal (defined here as no more than 10% of participants with any missing item data across visits where collected or where no more than 20% of the items within a scale are missing within participants), prorating (that is, mean imputation across items within a scale, or subscale where scales are formed of subscales, for each visit and participant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] will be used. The focus will instead be on handling scale-missing data. Any bias or underestimation of variance of scores associated with prorating is anticipated to be negligible where item-missing data are minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. We will report the amount of missing item data by the percentage of participants who have more than 10% item missing data for each scale reported.</p><p>The amount of item-missing data is expected to be minimal. However, if this is not so for any outcome scale then multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] at the item-level will be the primary method used. Items will be imputed 100 times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] separately for each scale (with the exception of the CFQ and SF-36PF, which will be imputed simultaneously). All of the other items for that scale across all time points (including baseline), scores (overall and any subscales) across all time points (including baseline), the four stratification factors at randomisation, randomised intervention, main therapist, and main SSMC doctor will be included in the imputation model.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Missing scale data</bold>&#x02009;Missing baseline scale data are not an issue for the primary analysis of efficacy; no missing data are expected for the stratification factors. Where the CFQ or SF-36PF is missing at baseline they will be replaced by the relevant scale at screening. There is specific guidance for missing baseline scale data, and this will be followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. That is, we will use mean imputation of baseline variables assuming baseline and outcome are correlated less than 0.6.</p><p>Where the amount of item-missing data is considered minimal, missing outcome scale-data will be handled within the primary analysis by maximum likelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] under a similar model for the missing data mechanism assumed for missing item data (see section above).

</bold></title><p>Some participants will withdraw from follow-up during the trial, and for these it may be more appropriate to assume data are missing not at random (MNAR). Where more than 10% of randomised participants are lost to follow-up, the impact of this will be investigated in a sensitivity analysis using the weighting approach described by Carpenter, Kenward and White [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] if multiple imputation is the primary method, or comparing selection model and pattern-mixture model therapy effect estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] where maximum likelihood is the primary method.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>

The following five comparisons will be made using two-sided hypothesis tests (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) at 52&#x000a0;weeks: APT versus SSMC, CBT versus SSMC, GET versus SSMC, CBT versus APT, GET versus APT.</p><p>For the co-primary outcomes, fatigue and disability, and for the secondary outcome, the participant-rated CGI, <italic>P</italic>-values will be presented unadjusted for multiplicity.</p><p>2.

Interpretation of the extent to which intervention effect estimates reflect the effects of the intervention described in the protocol requires analyses focusing on the effects of the interventions received rather than the interventions prescribed. It is recognised that per-protocol analyses have a number of limitations, most importantly, selection biases resulting from participants who are excluded not being a simple random sample of those randomised. As such, discrepancies between the conclusions of an intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis may not reflect discrepancies between the effects of the intervention prescribed and the intervention received. Acknowledging these and other limitations, a per-protocol analysis will serve as the primary sensitivity analysis investigating the robustness of the conclusions of the primary analysis to assumptions about departures from the randomised intervention policies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><bold>

Serious deterioration, defined at 52&#x000a0;weeks, will be the primary assessment of safety. Its four components will be reported separately to enable evaluation of their relative contributions.

The CSRI is used at baseline and at 24- and 52-week follow-up each time covering resource use for the previous 6&#x000a0;months. The CSRI covers the following broad categories of information.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Living situation/accommodation</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Education, employment and income (including benefits)</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Time off work (measured in days) and time unemployed (or retired due to illness) summing the relevant cost period (&#x02212;24 to 0&#x000a0;weeks, 0 to 24&#x000a0;weeks 0 to 52&#x000a0;weeks)</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02009;Use of health and social care resources</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Cost calculation</bold>&#x02009;The costs of each resource item will be calculated using best available unit cost estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. The cost of APT, GET and CBT will be estimated using information on the core resource inputs involved in delivering the interventions, and estimating country-specific costs for those inputs. Costs will be calculated using data on the number of intervention sessions received by each participant.</p><p>Lost employment costs for those in employment will be calculated by combining time off work with daily earnings. For those unemployed/retired due to ill health lost employment costs will be calculated by combining this period of time with average age and gender specific earnings.</p><p>The variables derived from the CSRI will be: (i) use (yes/no) of each service, (ii) number of service contacts/days in hospital, (iii) cost of each service, (iv) in employment (yes/no), (v) days not worked, and (vi) whether benefits received (each benefit - yes/no).</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Quality adjusted life year measurement</bold>&#x02009;The EQ-5D consists of five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each of these will receive a score of 1, 2 or 3 corresponding to no problems, moderate problems and major problems. Utility scores will be attached to each health state based on these scores (a table of utility values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] has been produced by the Centre for Health Economics, University of York). These utility scores will be used to generate QALY gains over the follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Descriptive statistics for outcome measures</bold>&#x02009;Data will be reported on the number and percentage of participants using each service in the CSRI by intervention, at baseline and 24 and 52&#x000a0;week follow-up. The mean and standard deviation number of service contacts for using services will also be reported as well as the mean and standard deviation costs for all participants. The number and percentage of participants with a score of 1, 2 or 3 for each EQ-5D domain will be reported.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Primary analysis (including method of analysis)</bold></title><p><bold>Cost comparisons</bold>&#x02009;Regression analysis will be used to compare service costs and total costs between the four interventions which will each be represented by dummy variables. Each intervention will be used in turn as the reference category to make all relevant comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Predictors of cost</bold>&#x02009;Participant characteristics will be used in a regression model to explain differences in baseline costs. We will test the hypothesised associations with both healthcare and societal costs, as well as using multivariable modelling of other possible predictors identified from univariate analyses. Subsequent regression models will be used to explain variations in follow-up costs, and these will also include clinical characteristics from preceding periods. Two types of regression model will be used. First, we will construct ordinary least squares models, with bootstrapping used to produce reliable 95% CIs around the regression coefficients. Second, we will construct generalised linear models with a log link and gamma distribution to account for the skewness that is likely in the costs data.</p><p>Independent variables will include demographic characteristics (such as age, gender and marital status), year of randomisation, clinical variables (such as fatigue score, disability, depression, anxiety) and benefits status (whether receiving benefits and whether benefits are in dispute).</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Cost-effectiveness analysis</bold>&#x02009;Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by linking data on service cost differences and outcome (fatigue and physical disability) differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. If any intervention has significantly lower costs and significantly better outcomes then it will be deemed to be more cost-effective. If costs are significantly higher and outcomes significantly better or if there is uncertainty in these findings (indicated by the CIs) then we will use the net benefit approach and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to assess cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness results will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. This will involve producing estimates of cost and outcome differences from 1,000 bootstrapped re-samples of the original data. Such planes will be produced for each combination of two-way group comparisons. The plane will inform us as to the probability that an intervention has either (i) lower costs and better outcomes, (ii) lower costs and worse outcomes, (iii) higher costs and better outcomes or (iv) higher costs and worse outcomes than each comparator.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Cost-utility analysis</bold>&#x02009;This will be conducted in the same way as the cost-effectiveness analysis but will use quality adjusted life years (derived from the EQ-5D) as the outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Predictors of cost-effectiveness/cost-utility</bold>&#x02009;The net-benefit approach allows multivariable analyses of economic data. This will enable us to identify predictors of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. This will be done using regression models as described above. In particular we hypothesise that age and gender will predict cost-effectiveness and cost-utility.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Baseline adjustment</bold>&#x02009;The predictors of the cost regression model will be adjusted by the CSRI baseline outcome data.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Model assumptions checks</bold>&#x02009;Cost data are usually skewed and if this results in similarly skewed residuals then the standard linear model is inappropriate. The distribution of the regression residuals will be checked visually and if the distribution is non-normal we will use bootstrapping with 10,000 resamples to estimate 95% CIs around the cost differences (CIs will be based on the percentile or bias-corrected method depending on the level of bias observed in the model.) The assumption of independent residuals will be checked by bootstrapping at the therapist level.</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Other analyses supporting the primary analysis (including sensitivity analyses)</bold>&#x02009;Sensitivity analyses will be carried out on two aspects of the analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. The effect of each of these alternative approaches on mean total societal costs at 12&#x000a0;months and subsequent cost-effectiveness calculations based on these costs will be explored in turn.</p><p>The main analyses will use an informal care unit cost based on the replacement method (where the cost of a homecare worker is used as a proxy for informal care). We will alternatively use a zero cost and a cost based on the national minimum wage for informal care. We will also conduct sensitivity analyses around the costs attached to lost employment.</p><p>The estimated costs of APT, GET and CBT will be increased and decreased by 50% to see how sensitive the costs, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility findings are to these variables.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><bold>
