Affecting 10&#x000a0;% of all pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], hypertension is the first cause of maternal death in Brazil <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inseer.ibict.br/rbsp/index.php/rbsp/article/viewFile/474/pdf_150">http://inseer.ibict.br/rbsp/index.php/rbsp/article/viewFile/474/pdf_150</ext-link> and the second cause in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Worldwide, more than 99&#x000a0;% of cases of maternal deaths related to hypertension occur in low-income countries, reflecting not only a higher incidence as the lack of prenatal care and adequate treatment of obstetric emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, it is an important potentially life-threatening condition of life and cause of maternal near miss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], along with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also associated with long-term complications, with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in affected women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Among hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia represent the most severe conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Associated maternal risks include abruptio placentae, convulsions, acute pulmonary edema, convulsions, acute kidney injury and death. Perinatal risks are due to the reduction in the utero-placental blood flow and are represented by fetal growth restriction, hypoxia and fetal death, prematurity and its complications, among which the most important is the respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that magnesium sulfate is the most effective and safe drug for preventing and treating eclamptic seizures and should be administered to all women in whom there is concern about eclampsia or eclampsia risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Magnesium sulfate significantly reduces maternal death when used to treat eclampsia and is a real "evidence-based solution" <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.engenderhealth.org/files/pubs/maternal-health/engenderhealth-eclampsia-report.pdf">http://www.engenderhealth.org/files/pubs/maternal-health/engenderhealth-eclampsia-report.pdf</ext-link>. The only definitive treatment is delivery, and the resolution of pregnancy is indicated in all cases of eclampsia regardless of gestational age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in cases of preeclampsia at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;34&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and mild preeclampsia cases without other complications at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;37&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>However, even after birth and with appropriate treatment, concern about the complications of disease persist, since this condition can take days or weeks to resolve. In the postnatal period, with the return of liquid from the interstitial and extravascular compartment to the intravascular, very high blood pressure episodes are common and the persistence of hypertension in critical levels results in increased puerperal morbidity. Thus, blood pressure levels may continue to rise, which most often occurs in the first five days after birth, reaching a peak between three to six days after delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. New onset postpartum hypertension and preeclampsia can occur, with a frequency ranging from 0,3&#x000a0;%-27,5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Complications of severe hypertension include stroke, eclampsia, congestive heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, renal failure and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Besides the mobilization of liquid from the interstiticial and intravascular to extravascular space corresponding to six to eight liters of the total body water, there is also a return of 950&#x000a0;mEq of total body sodium accumulated during pregnancy. It is observed increased urinary sodium excretion between three and five days after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] possibly due to the increase of atrial natriuretic peptide in the first week after delivery, which has a role in natriuresis and entails inhibition of aldosterone, angiotensin II and vasopressin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Several approaches have been proposed to accelerate the postpartum maternal recovery, but the effectiveness of these approaches as well as the ideal antihypertensive treatment in the postpartum period, remain to be established. Furosemide use has been proposed with this goal. Patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia may experience persistent hypertension after delivery, in response to the mobilization of interstitial and extravascular fluid into the intravascular space, the excess of total body water and inadequate secretion of sodium due to reduced glomerular filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is an important rationale for furosemide therapy since by its mechanism of action, this loop diuretic can act in patients with fluid overload, eliminating the intravascular fluid that has been mobilized in the postpartum period and thereby reducing blood volume and blood pressure and also reducing the need of antihypertensive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This therapy is logical when considering the pathophysiology of postpartum hypertension, with the objective of maintain a low central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, raising colloid osmotic pressure and preventing the development of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In the systematic Cochrane Review that evaluated prevention and treatment of postpartum hypertension were included nine randomized clinical trials, of which two trials (282 women included) assessed postnatal furosemide at a dosage of 20-40&#x000a0;mg orally daily), compared with placebo or no treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One trial added potassium supplementation (20&#x000a0;mEq orally daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and in the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] women at &#x0201c;high risk&#x0201d; of eclampsia also received magnesium sulfate. None of the studies reported the mean and standard deviation of the baseline blood pressure but one trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported a greater decrease in blood pressure in the group receiving furosemide compared to placebo. In the group receiving furosemide it was reported a change of blood pressure on days one, three and seven after delivery (i.e., &#x02212;6.5&#x000a0;mmHg (furosemide) versus &#x02212;3.5 (placebo) on day one, &#x02212;10.6 (furosemide) versus &#x02212;9.75 (placebo) on day three, and &#x02212;11.5 (furosemide) versus &#x02212;7.8 (placebo) on day seven). In the other trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] including 264 women, only postpartum patients with severe preeclampsia (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;70) who received furosemide compared with controls had significantly lower systolic blood pressure by postpartum day 2 (142 +/&#x02212; 13&#x000a0;mmHg compared with 153+/&#x02212;19&#x000a0;mmHg, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.004) and required less antihypertensive therapy during hospitalization (14&#x000a0;% compared with 26&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.371) and at discharge (6&#x000a0;% compared with 26&#x000a0;%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045). Follow-up ranged from day 10 postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to six weeks postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The reviewers conclude that reliable data are not available to guide management of women with postpartum hypertension. For women with pre-eclampsia, postnatal furosemide may decrease the need for postnatal antihypertensive therapy in hospital, but more data are needed on substantive outcomes before this practice can be recommended. Notwithstanding, the optimal management of postpartum hypertension is not yet well established.</p><p>Thus, to determine the potential benefit of using diuretics in women with preeclampsia is an important issue in modern obstetrics.

Long-term treatment may inhibit lactation but is not the case of this proposed therapy, using low dose of only five days after birth. If it is demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure levels, the need for antihypertensive drugs and shortening of hospitalization, significant benefits can be obtained for women with pre-eclampsia and the health system. With the reduction in blood pressure and the elimination of excess intravascular, the incidence of acute pulmonary edema and other diseases resulting from fluid overload can be decreased. The reduced need for antihypertensive drugs, beyond avoiding side effects for women, can along with the reduction of hospital days, lead to substantial savings for the health system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>IMIP</term><def><p>Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>Systolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDP</term><def><p>Diastolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Mean blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNH</term><def><p>Number needed to harm</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>Number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONEP</term><def><p>National Committee for Ethics in Research of the Brazilian Ministry of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The first version of this protocol was drafted by MA and LK.
