Recent studies suggest that approximately 23% of individuals aged 35-65 years in Isfahan have a high blood pressure (BP).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The risk of cardiac accidents and stroke mortality rise with increasing levels of BP. Preventing and controlling HTN was known as the one of the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the global burden of premature cardiovascular disease and death.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The goal of prevention and management of HTN is to reduce morbidity and mortality. This goal may be achieved by lifestyle modification, alone or with pharmacological therapy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Reducing just 3 mmHg of systolic BP (SBP) in the general population has the potential to decrease stroke mortality by 8% and coronary artery disease mortality by 5%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies have demonstrated a relation between high BP and lifestyle factors such as overweight, high salt intake, physical inactivity, and maladaptive coping with stress.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] For as long as anyone can remember, lifestyle modification has been recommended in order to reduce BP.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In fact, if people decreased their sodium intake, exercised more, and kept their weight at an optimal level, HTN would have been less prevalent.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Countries differ in their ability to manage HTN and implement these interventions. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the most vital barriers for lifestyle modification programs in developing countries are low literacy levels and low income. WHO encourages countries to develop prevention programs based on their own resource and patients&#x02019; education levels.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Iran conducted every 3 years Screening program for HTN in patients over 30 years in primary health-care setting. Sohrabi and Heydarnia (HM) in a study to evaluate national screening program reported follow-up activities for the known cases was low and unsatisfactory.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In Iran the Isfahan Healthy Heart Program (IHHP) showed after the comprehensive, integrated community-based lifestyle intervention program, beneficial changes were noted in diet and physical activity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In fact, IHHP was targeting the general population and the environment. Jahromy <italic>et al</italic>. in a noncontrolled trial study reported lifestyle education, improve healthy lifestyle performance in hypertensive patients.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Science, the organizational structure, and human resources of health centers can be considered as an opportunity for lifestyle modification interventions. On the other hand, women are the major attendants to primary health centers and the myth that heart disease is a &#x0201c;man's disease&#x0201d; has been debunked. Hence, we designed a lifestyle intervention package including diet, physical activity, and stress management components in order to change the women's behavioral health with high BP attending the health-care centers in Isfahan, Iran. Present paper reported the effectiveness of a multicomponent lifestyle guidance on lowering BP in health center settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Our study design and intervention methods have been completely described previously.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The study design, protocols, and informed consent procedure have been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Ethical Number: 391298).</p><p>The lifestyle modification trial is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial, designed to assess the effectiveness of a 4-week educational lifestyle intervention program on the improvement of dietary status, physical activity level, and control of daily stress in order to reduce BP levels in short- and long-term follow-up. The trial was endeavoring in four health-care centers in Isfahan, Iran.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total number of 160 participants (80/group) was enrolled in the study. Eligibility criteria included hypertensive patients (taking anti-hypertensive drugs or having a SBP of 140-179 mmHg or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 90-109 mmHg), based on the average of two screening visits. Major exclusion criteria were any condition, which might have had a negative effect on the compliance of the participants, including a prior cardiovascular event, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, cancer diagnosis or treatment in the past 2 years, diabetes, history of leisure-time exercise in the past 6 months, pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or lactation and being absent in two consecutive sessions of the classes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>We selected intervention and control group from separate health centers in order to prevent contamination. According to the Isfahan province health center report, HTN screening program was conducted in only six of eleven health centers of Isfahan. Furthermore, two of the six health centers did not have enough hypertensive patients for our study (15 and 17). So, we selected the four remaining health centers and randomly assigned two centers to intervention and two centers to control group. The centers are located in different zones of the city, and we will try to control the socioeconomic state as a confounder in the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The power calculations were based on 5.32 mmHg[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] standard deviation (SD) of the change in the major primary outcome SBP between the intervention and control groups with &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 20%.

All measurements and also filling the questionnaires were repeated right after intervention and 6 months after the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Instruments</title><p>To assess the physical activity level, we used the long forms of the Persian version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The questionnaire, which has been developed by WHO, is composed of 28 questions about physical activity in a typical week and assesses the physical activity in four domains, namely, work (7 items), transportation (6 items), household/gardening (6 items), and leisure-time activities (6 items). IPAQ also includes two questions about the time spent on sitting as an indicator of sedentary behavior. In order to measure energy expenditure, the concept of metabolic equivalents (MET) was used. MET is the ratio of a person's working metabolic rate relative to the resting metabolic rate.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Reliability and validity for the Persian version of the long form IPAQ were acceptable.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The stress level of the participants was assessed by a Persian translation of the 14 Likert-type items Cohen perceived stress scale (PSS; Cohen <italic>et al</italic>. 1983)[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in the past month. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Total scores (0-56) are generated by summing individual items, with higher scores indicative of greater perceived stress. A group of Iranian scholars and experts approved the content and face validity of the translated scales. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78-0.81.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>To measure dietary intake, all participants completed a self-report 3 days food record questionnaire.

Several trial demonstrated the feasibility and short-term efficacy of using selected stress-reduction approaches on reducing perceived stress but further research is essential to determine whether the observed treatment effect can be sustained over a longer period.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Another explanation is the benefits of social interaction, positive reinforcement, and positive peer group effect were helpful on stress changes during 4-week. Furthermore, a systematic review suggested stress, anxiety, and depression were most commonly barriers that delayed adoption of a healthier lifestyle.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Repeated measures analysis showed that the intervention significantly lowered SBP and DBP through 4-week and 6 months of follow-up. In addition, the intervention significantly improved physical activity level, BMI, perceived stress level, and dietary sodium intake within 4-week and 6 months of follow-up. Previous researches have found that multiple lifestyle modifications could improve the control of BP and reduce the risk for chronic diseases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The mean level of SBP and DBP at baseline was significantly different in various groups of BP-lowering medications. After adjusting for this confounder, repeated measure of analysis indicated that the mean change in BP was not significantly different between various groups medications.</p><p>Systolic blood pressure and DBP were moderately correlated with all lifestyle factors such as weight and waist circumference, physical activity level, NaCl intake. Although BP and lifestyle factor were significantly correlated, the stepwise regression analysis showed that change in weight and physical activity level can predict the change in SBP level within 4-week and similarly, dietary salt intake, and weight loss were the best predictor factors for SBP level after 6 months.</p><p>The result of the stepwise regression showed that, SBP was decreased by 0.5 mmHg for 1 kg decrease in weight and 0.2 mmHg for every unit increase in physical activity level through 4-week. SBP can be predicted by 1.2 mmHg for 1 g decrease in dietary salt intake and 0.8 mmHg for 1 kg decrease in body weight. Based on a long experience, there is empirical evidence for the moderate relationship between BP with lifestyle changes, like weight reduction if appropriate, sodium restriction and exercise.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] According to the seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high BP (JNC 7),[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] each 10 kg weight loss resulted 5-20 mmHg, Engage in at least 30 min/day, most days of the week showed 4-9 mmHg decrease, and reduce dietary sodium intake to 6 g NaCl due to 2-8 mmHg.</p><p>As we mentioned before, we conducted intervention by two different educators (members of the health centers) at two health center, we detected the same result for both centers. So, we can say implementing such programs at these settings could be feasible.</p><p>Another characteristic of our study was the usage mobile phone text messages in order to increase the patients&#x02019; adherence to weekly sessions and also lifestyle changes. BJ Fogg, PhD, Director of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Laboratory (Stanford, CA), that sponsored a conference called mobile persuasion suggested the use of mobile technology in order to change patient's attitudes and behaviors.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>We tried to present educational content by picture, graph, and flowchart in order to being suitable for lower literacy and elderly patients. Our educational materials were full of simple and cheap ways for changing diet and practical recommendation for doing regular exercise at home.

This study had a small sample size, which reduced the statistical power. Another limitation of this study was self-reported food record questionnaires. For this reason, participants were interested in reporting less dietary intake especially salt and oil intake. To better estimate measuring blood sample for fasting blood sugar, TG, LDL, and urinary Na suggested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>However as few studies have addressed the effectiveness of lifestyle modification program on BP control in Iranian women in primary health setting. The results of this randomized controlled trial study show that multimodality lifestyle modification can improve BP control in primary care settings in a developing country like Iran. Decreased body weight and sodium intake and also increased physical activity level over the study period was directly associated with a decrease in BP level. Hence, targeted interventions and incorporate lifestyle modifications in addition to pharmacological treatment should be considered in the care of women with high BP in primary care settings in developing countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>TH was the main investigator, who analyzed the data and wrote the paper.
