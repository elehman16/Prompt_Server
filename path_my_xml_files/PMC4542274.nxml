Severe hypoglycemia may occur in some patients without warning symptoms (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), preventing them from taking corrective action and necessitating help from other individuals. Thus, for many patients, the immediate fear of hypoglycemia exceeds the fear of long-term complications.</p><p>A fall in blood glucose in subjects without diabetes provokes a multitiered response, including suppression of endogenous insulin secretion, release of counterregulatory hormones, and symptoms of hypoglycemia, which together act to restore euglycemia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In type 1 diabetes, this critical defense system may be interrupted at every level (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Loss of endogenous insulin and reliance on exogenous hormones make rapid insulin reductions impossible, and the loss of islet &#x003b2;-cells also leads to the loss of glucagon responses to hypoglycemia, a stimulus-specific defect seen in the vast majority of type 1 diabetes patients after several years (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Diminished epinephrine (adrenaline) response in type 1 diabetes, however, appears to be mainly a hypothalamic metabolic adaptation to antecedent recurrent hypoglycemia that occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The impaired epinephrine response is often accompanied by hypoglycemia unawareness, which greatly magnifies the risk of hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To avoid further episodes of hypoglycemia and interrupt this vicious cycle, a reduction in insulin delivery and/or increased carbohydrate consumption are commonly recommended (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), measures that generally worsen glycemic control.</p><p>A variety of therapeutic approaches have been developed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, including patient education, judicious use of carbohydrate intake, changes in dosing or timing of insulin delivery, and intensification of glucose monitoring (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, a few small pilot clinical trials have suggested that certain drugs offer potential utility in increasing defenses against hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes, including terbutaline (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), diazoxide (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and naloxone (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Among these drugs, terbutaline, a specific &#x003b2;-2 agonist, has been reported to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), although the nighttime dose of terbutaline required was associated with hyperglycemia the following morning (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The more specific long-acting &#x003b2;-2 agonist, formoterol, has been shown in rodent studies to limit insulin-induced hypoglycemia by diminishing the inhibitory effect of insulin on glucose production (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Formoterol&#x02019;s effect appears to be mediated in large part via a direct effect on the liver, although activation of &#x003b2;-2 receptors in the ventral medial hypothalamus might contribute as well (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It is noteworthy that formoterol is approved for acute treatment of asthma when used in combination with steroids and comes in an inhaled formulation, which could provide direct access to the arterial circulation and more rapid onset of action. Its long half-life (10 h) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) also makes it a potential therapeutic agent to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. The current study was therefore undertaken to assess the efficacy of inhaled formoterol during an acute bout of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Study subjects participated in two research protocols; their characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Participants who qualified for the study were invited to return to the HRU for one of the two protocols.

In the morning of the study, an intravenous plastic catheter was inserted in an antecubital vein for insulin and glucose infusion.

The therapeutic options for treating or preventing hypoglycemia are currently limited and generally rely on adjusting the dose of insulin or increasing carbohydrate consumption (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although these therapeutic modifications reduce hypoglycemia frequency and/or severity, they commonly lead to increased glucose levels. Thus, there remains a need for novel therapies that allow carrying out tight glycemic control more safely.</p><p>Previous small clinical trials showed that terbutaline diminished the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In those studies, however, there was an increase in fasting glucose levels the next morning. In this study we tested whether formoterol, a more selective and long-acting &#x003b2;-2 agonist, could be used to counteract the effect of insulin and prevent hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. This compound has been shown to promote glucose production in rodents and is commercially available in a more rapidly acting inhaled formulation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, inhaled formoterol significantly decreased the amount of glucose required to keep circulating glucose at a standardized hypoglycemic level during a hyperinsulinemic clamp study in healthy control subjects and in subjects with type 1 diabetes. These findings are consistent with the established insulin antagonistic effects of formoterol in humans (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) as well as rodent data showing that peripheral administration of formoterol mainly acts to directly increase hepatic glucose production with no significant effect on counterregulatory hormones (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). These results imply that the metabolic effects of inhaled formoterol are most likely due to a direct effect of formoterol on &#x003b2;-2 receptors in the peripheral tissues (i.e., hepatic glucose production and/or insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake). However, it is possible that formoterol may affect peripheral metabolism indirectly by activating &#x003b2;-2 receptors in the hypothalamus (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>To examine if inhaled formoterol could be used to prevent hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes, we gave formoterol 60 min before doubling the participants&#x02019; basal insulin infusion rate. The study was designed to simulate episodes of iatrogenic insulin-induced hypoglycemia that result from an imbalance between the basal insulin dose needed and the dose of insulin given by the patient, something that particularly occurs during the first third of the nighttime sleep cycle, a time when such patients have reduced insulin requirements as well as diminished capacity to release catecholamines, making them more vulnerable to severe hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Under these conditions, we show that formoterol effectively prevented an acute hypoglycemic episode. These findings suggest that inhaled formoterol may have potential value as a preventive therapy for iatrogenic hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes with hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure and frequent episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Of note, this was accomplished without a major increase in glucose levels. However, more studies will be needed to define the optimal dose and time for it to be delivered as well as its long-term effect on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>The study has some limitations. The short duration of the studies did not allow us to determine the effect of formoterol during the subsequent hours after completion of the study. Even though the study participants were asked to report major problems in the hours after the study and no major side effects were described, glucose levels were not monitored in a standardized fashion. In addition, the study was limited by the small number of subjects tested, and thus further studies will be necessary to confirm the efficacy of formoterol in the treatment of iatrogenic hypoglycemia.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that the hyperglycemic effect of formoterol is not restricted to hypoglycemia, as demonstrated by an increase in plasma glucose levels in the group with type 1 diabetes at the end of the first step (euglycemic phase). Formoterol treatment may increase glucose levels, and long-term studies will be necessary to evaluate its effect on glycemic control. However, due to the limited options for prevention of hypoglycemia, formoterol treatment may be useful for a subgroup of patients with type 1 diabetes at high risk for severe and frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.</p><p>With regard to the possible adverse cardiovascular effects of formoterol, we measured vital signs during the hypoglycemia-clamp study. Neither blood pressure changes nor palpitations occurred after formoterol treatment in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, although small increases in pulse rate were observed.</p><p>In summary, our results from this pilot study suggest that specific &#x003b2;-2 agonists delivered via inhalation may prove useful during intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes who have hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure and thus are at high risk for hypoglycemia. Its effects occur rapidly and appear to be a direct effect of formoterol on peripheral glucose metabolism, particularly in the liver (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), because counterregulatory hormone responses were not significantly altered in subjects with and without diabetes. Although, as our data suggest, formoterol acts to directly offset the effects of insulin and most likely can cause mild hyperglycemia (similar to the studies using terbutaline for hypoglycemia [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), we believe that due to the limited options for prevention of hypoglycemia, a more specific &#x003b2;-agonist might benefit a particular group of patients unable to generate a counterregulatory hormone response, resulting in a history of severe and frequent hypoglycemia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
