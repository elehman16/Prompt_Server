Kumar and Sinha in their study on patients who underwent surgery for perforated duodenal ulcer found that active duodenal ulcer was significantly higher in patients who had <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in the postoperative follow up endoscopy and concluded that <italic>H. pylori</italic> was the single most important factor for the persistence of ulcer after surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Mihmanli <italic>et al</italic>. studied patients of perforated duodenal ulcer who underwent bilateral truncal vagotomy and Weinberg pyloroplasty along with excision of ulcer with the pyloric ring, and found that <italic>H. pylori</italic> was present throughout the wall of the ulcer and noticed the high ratio of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive antral biopsy in these patients indicating the importance of eradicating this organism in the complicated peptic ulcer disease patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The International Agency for Research on cancer, classified <italic>H. pylori</italic> as a definite carcinogen and recommends eradication of this organism in all the positive cases. Although there is no documentation to suggest that patients of perforated duodenal ulcer have more virulent organisms, the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to prevent ulcer recurrence after duodenal ulcer perforation has been shown to be effective, in other studies.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The standard triple therapy (STT) treatment regimen, which includes proton pump inhibitors (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole, proposed at the first Maastricht conference to treat <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection has become universally accepted and is being widely used for eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, especially in developing countries.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Vaira <italic>et al</italic>. have reported an inconsistent eradication rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with STT.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Recently Graham and Fischbach showed that among the studies published regarding STT, 60% of the studies failed to reach 80% treatment success, and only 18% had treatment success exceeding 85%.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Several other investigators from the West have reported low eradication rates for STT. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, newer regimens to achieve higher eradication rate became necessary.</p><p>Sequential therapy (ST) with four drugs is defined as use of one PPI and amoxicillin for first 5 days followed by PPI plus clarithromycin and metronidazole for next 5 days.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Several studies have shown that ST was more effective than STT.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Concomitant therapy (CT) is defined as the use of one PPI, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and amoxicillin for 10 days and is found to have a higher eradication rate than STT.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>There are limited studies comparing the eradication rates for <italic>H. pylori</italic> between ST and CT especially in developing countries like India, where the burden of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is much more than that of developed countries.

The study included all consecutive patients who presented to the Institute's Emergency Medical Services with perforated duodenal ulcer and underwent emergency laparotomy with simple closure and were found to be positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Positivity for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was diagnosed in these patients at their third-month visit following surgery. Patients were advised to stop the PPI at least 8 weeks before the endoscopy.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients who were found to have perforated gastric ulcer, who had undergone any other procedure apart from the simple closure for duodenal ulcer perforation, re-perforations, those who had associated upper gastrointestinal diseases, and those who had undergone any definitive surgery for peptic ulcer disease.</p><p>The study was designed as a prospective parallel arm randomized controlled trail. Block randomization was done using computer program with randomly selected block sizes of 4 and 6. Allocation concealment was ensured by serially numbered opaque sealed envelope (SNOSE). The sample size was calculated using OPENEPI<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software. Considering the detection of eradication rate more than 15% between the two regimens on two&#x02013;tail basis with 95% confidence interval and power of the study &#x0003e;80% and expected drop out rate of 10%, the sample size was calculated to be 35 in each group. A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>All patients meeting the inclusion criteria were subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy after getting informed written consent. A 2% lignocaine viscous is used as a local anesthetic allowing a contact time of 5 min. Biopsies were taken from antrum and corpus (two each from both sites) using endoscopic biopsy forceps. One biopsy specimen from antrum and corpus was used for urease test while two other were for Giemsa staining. All endoscopies were done by experienced consultant endoscopists in our department.</p><p>Diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was done by urease test and histology by Giemsa stain. Urease test was done using a solution standardized in our institute.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Two gastric mucosal biopsies were put in the solution at room temperature for 24 h. Urease test was considered positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection when the color of the solution changed from yellow to pink. The patient was considered positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> status if either or both the tests were positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic>. The patient was considered negative for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection if both tests were negative.</p><p><italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients were randomized into two groups using the opaque sealed envelope technique. One group received ST while the other received CT. ST comprised omeprazole 20 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 1 gm twice a day for the first five days and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and metronidazole 400 mg thrice a day for the next five days. Total duration of treatment was 10 days. CT comprised omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day, amoxicillin 1 gm twice a day, and metronidazole 400 mg thrice a day for 10 days.</p><p>Compliance and side effects were assessed after finishing anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> therapy by semi-structured interview method allowing the patients to state the reason for noncompliance and side effects in addition to those mentioned in the questionnaires. Patient compliance was assessed as to what extent patient adhered to the schedule and duration of treatment. Patients who did not follow the schedule or those who could not complete the prescribed duration of treatment were considered as noncompliant. A follow-up of these patients was done at 3, 6, and 12 months after index endoscopy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was done to assess the eradication rate of <italic>H. pylori</italic> following ST and CT at three-month follow-up. Ulcer recurrence was noted during follow-up endoscopies.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institute's Research Council and the Ethics Committee. The nature, methodology, and risks involved in the study were explained to the patients and an informed consent was obtained. All the information collected was kept confidential and patients were given full freedom to withdraw at any point during the study. All provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed in this study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using GraphpadInstat Software version 3.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA, USA).

Primary clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance rates in India are 33% and 78%, respectively, which are higher than in other countries. Metronidazole has been used as a part of standard ST and CT regimen in majority of the studies. Although metronidazole resistance is more prevalent compared with the other drugs used for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication, it has not changed over the years. It is also emphasized that metronidazole resistance has less impact in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy than that of the clarithromycin resistance and this resistance can be overcome by increasing the dose and the duration of the treatment.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This high rate of antimicrobial resistance is probably because of injudicious use of antibiotics for various diseases.</p><p>Ulcer recurrence rates are highly variable in different studies in different parts of the world.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In an earlier study conducted in our institute, Bose <italic>et al</italic>. found out that eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in patients with perforated duodenal ulcer, treated with simple closure, decreases the rate of ulcer recurrence significantly.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In the present study, the differences in ulcer recurrence rates between the two groups at 3, 6, and 12 months by ITT, mITT, and PP analysis were not statistically significant. High recurrence rates in both the ST and CT might be due to noncompliance to treatment or might be due to re-infection of <italic>H. pylori</italic> as a result of poor socioeconomic conditions. A study with more number of study subjects is needed to get a broader picture of ulcer recurrence following ST and CT.</p><p>Compliance in ST and CT groups were 90.62% and 96.77%, respectively. CT group has better compliance, but the difference was not statistically significant. In a study by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. compliance in ST and CT were 95.7% and 98.2%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Lim <italic>et al</italic>. in their study showed a better compliance with CT than ST (95.3% vs. 96.2%; <italic>P</italic> value = 0.80).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Lesser compliance for both CT and ST (82.7% vs 82.4%; <italic>P</italic> value = 0.93) was shown in a study by McNicholl <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Even though ST is having lesser number of tablets, its complex dosage schedule makes its use difficult for the patient. The success in eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> using ST was postulated to be because of its sequential nature of dosage schedule and due to increase in the number of antibiotics. Hence, if compliance is not maintained in ST, the effectiveness of the therapy will decrease. Higher compliance for CT seen in this study might be due to less complex dosage schedule.</p><p>Most common side effects in ST and CT were diarrhea (27.59%) and metallic taste (26.67%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in side effects profile between the two groups. Wu <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found bad taste (15.7%) as a major side effect in the concomitant group and fatigue in sequential group (11%).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Diarrhea was the major side effect in both ST and CT groups in a study done by De Francesco <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Kongchayanun <italic>et al</italic>. in their study found bitter taste, epigastric soreness, and diarrhea as the most common side effects in both groups.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The cost of a complete course of ST was 570 INR and 1080 INR for CT. ST was economically better than CT. <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication with CT and ST shows a wide variation in different parts of the world. This difference might be due to the difference in regional antibiotic resistance patterns against <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Based on Graham <italic>et al</italic>.'s proposed report card to grade <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication regimen, except study by De Francesco <italic>et al</italic>. for CT, none of the studies got grade A result, which is deemed acceptable for prescription in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication rate between concomitant therapy and sequential therapy in various studies by per protocol and intention-to-treat analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJG-22-309-g006"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the present study, it was found that the <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rates with ST and CT were similar.
