The objective was to assess the dose dependent effect of dexmedetomidine (3 mcg vs 5 mcg) as an adjunct to isobaric ropivacaine in spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty selected female patients were randomized to receive intrathecal 0.5% isobaric ropivacaine (15 mg) with dexmedetomidine 3 mcg (Group D3) or 5 mcg (Group D5) in spinal anesthesia for abdominal hysterectomy. Block characteristics, hemodynamic changes, postoperative analgesia, and adverse effects were compared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Both groups were comparable regarding sensory-motor block characteristics and postoperative analgesia (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Four (10%) patients of Group D5 and 5 (12.5%) of Group D3 could not achieve desired T6 sensory level and Bromage score of 3(complete motor block) hence were converted to general anesthesia at the outset. Nine (22.5%) patients each in both groups required ketamine supplementation (0.5 mg/kg) for intraoperative pain at the time of uterine manipulation. Incidence of hypotension was comparable (55.56% in Group D5 and 37.14% in Group D3, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11), but this occurred significantly earlier in Group D5, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001.

Both doses of dexmedetomidine produced a similar effect on block characteristic and postoperative analgesia; however, a dose of 5 mcg dose was associated with more hypotension and sedation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abdominal hysterectomy</kwd><kwd>dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>isobaric ropivacaine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ropivacaine a newer amide local anesthetic with a high pKa and low lipid solubility has gained popularity as an intrathecal agent.

Hypotension (decrease in systolic blood pressure of &#x0003e;20% of baseline or &#x0003c;100 mm of Hg) was treated with i.v. bolus of 6 mg ephedrine hydrochloride.

The height of sensory block was assessed by pinprick method (24G hypodermic needle) in mid-clavicular line bilaterally, loss of sensation to pin prick was considered as sensory block. Motor block was assessed according to the modified Bromage scale[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (0: Patient able to move hip, knee, ankle, 1: Unable to move hip, able to move knee and ankle, 2: Unable to move hip and knee, able to move ankle, 3: Unable to move hip, knee and ankle). Onset of block was assessed by noting time to reach T10 dermatome sensory block, peak sensory level and Bromage 3 motor block. All time durations were calculated considering the time of end of spinal injection as time zero. Sensory and motor block level were recorded every 2 min for 20 min. Intraoperative sedation[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was measured every 15 min using sedation score as: 0-No sedation (alert), 1-mild sedation (occasionally drowsy, easy to arouse), 2-moderate sedation (frequently drowsy, easy to arouse), 3-severe sedation (somnolent, difficult to arouse).</p><p>After 15 min of spinal injection, outcome of SAB was assessed.

In the postoperative period, whenever patient complained of pain (visual analog scale &#x0003e;3) intravascular infusion of diclofenac 75 mg was given as rescue analgesic. Time to first rescue analgesic and total analgesic consumption during first 24 h were also noted in terms of the number of doses and dose in milligram.

These structural differences make it less lipid soluble resulting in less potency and less cardiotoxicity and also renders difficulty in penetration of large myelinated motor fibers.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>When dose-dependent effect of intrathecal dexmedetomidine using 5 or 10 mcg on isobaric bupivacaine was investigated, it was found that by increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine, onset of sensory and motor block was faster and block regression time was significantly more.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We also observed that mean time taken to reach T10 level was significantly less in patients receiving 5 mcg dexmedetomidine as compared with 3 mcg dose, but the difference of 1-min does not make clinical significance. Time to reach peak sensory level and to attain maximum motor block were comparable in the two groups. Time to two-dermatomal regression was also significantly more with 5 mcg dexmedetomidine though the difference of 4 min had no clinical significance.</p><p>Intrathecal alpha-2 adrenergic agonists have a well-established synergistic effect with local anesthetics because both have different mechanism of action. The local anesthetics act by blocking sodium channels, whereas the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists act by binding to presynaptic C-fibers and postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Intrathecal dexmedetomidine when combined with spinal local anesthetics prolongs the sensory block by depressing the release of C-fibers transmitters and by hyperpolarization of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons. Motor block prolongation by &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist may result from binding of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists to motor neuron in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Intrathecal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists have antinociceptive action for both somatic and visceral pain;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] therefore, use of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to isobaric ropivacaine causes significant prolongation in duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] However, when we compared 3 and 5 mcg dose of dexmedetomidine along with ropivacaine postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirement was comparable.</p><p>It is a well-known fact that intrathecal local anesthetics block the sympathetic outflow and reduce the blood pressure and HR.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] We also observed that HR and blood pressure showed a significant fall from baseline values intraoperatively in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The sympathetic block is usually near-maximal with the local anesthetic doses used for spinal anesthesia. The addition of a low dose of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist to a high dose of local anesthetic does not further affect the near-maximal sympatholysis.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Therefore, on intergroup comparison there was no significant difference in mean values of HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP in our study as documented by others.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In our study, most common adverse effect was hypotension (55.56% in D5 and 37.14% in D3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.11). &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists have shown to decrease intra and post-operative stress response effectively.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] These agents also have substantial hemodynamic effect in causing hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>We observed that incidence of mild sedation was significantly more in Group D5 (30.56%) as compared to Group D3 (8.57%), <italic>P</italic> = 0.01. Dexmedetomidine is a partial agonist of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors that are found densely in the pontine locus ceruleus, which is an important source of sympathetic nervous system innervations of the forebrain and a vital modulator of vigilance. The sedative effects evoked by &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists most likely reflect inhibition of this nucleus.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Tan J O[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] compared the dose-dependent effect of dexmedetomidine (5 mcg and 10 mcg) and found that all patients had mild sedation.</p><p>The limitation of our study was that it was not sufficiently powered to evaluate any difference in adverse effects of two doses of dexmedetomidine to reach a conclusion. Further, we have not taken control group using intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine without dexmedetomidine, because previous studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have mentioned unreliable anesthesia with plain ropivacaine. We also conducted a pilot study in 10 patients and had a very high failure rate which prevented us from planning a control group for our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that intrathecal dexmedetomidine in dose of 5 and 3 &#x003bc;g as an adjuvant to isobaric ropivacaine in spinal anesthesia was comparable regarding sensory and motor block characteristics and success rate. However, overall incidence of supplemental analgesic requirement with intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine 3 mL of 0.5% (15 mg) with 5 or 3 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine was disconcerting in both groups (32.5% vs. 35%; respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In addition, the incidence of hypotension and sedation were higher with dose of 5 &#x003bc;g. Our study does not favor the use of isobaric ropivacaine (15 mg) with dexmedetomidine (3 or 5 mcg) in spinal anesthesia for abdominal hysterectomies.</p><p>We suggest that a larger study should be carried out in the future in which a comparison of varying doses of intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine with various adjuvants is evaluated, so that advantages and disadvantages of one regimen over another can be more clearly delineated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferreti</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Amour</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vivien</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Eve</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Petit</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effects of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine and ropivacaine on myocardial relaxation</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>2007</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>208</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17331933</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeo</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>YJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyperbaric spinal ropivacaine for cesarean delivery: A comparison to hyperbaric bupivacaine</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2001</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>157</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11429357</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kallio</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Sn&#x000e4;ll</surname><given-names>EV</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuomas</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of hyperbaric and plain ropivacaine 15 mg in spinal anaesthesia for lower limb surgery</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2004</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>664</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15347608</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gautier</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>De Kock</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Huberty</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Demir</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Izydorczic</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanderick</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of the effects of intrathecal ropivacaine, levobupivacaine, and bupivacaine for Caesarean section</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2003</year><volume>91</volume><fpage>684</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14570791</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van Kleef</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Veering</surname><given-names>BT</given-names></name><name><surname>Burm</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal anesthesia with ropivacaine: A double-blind study on the efficacy and safety of 0.5% and 0.75% solutions in patients undergoing minor lower limb surgery</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1994</year><volume>78</volume><fpage>1125</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8198269</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wahedi</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nolte</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ropivacaine for spinal anesthesia.
