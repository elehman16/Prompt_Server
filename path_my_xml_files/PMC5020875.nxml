However, the relative benefits and risks of different types of exercise in this population are unknown. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a main study evaluating the efficacy of cycling and resistance exercise each performed during the haemodialysis treatment on QoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this factorial (2&#x000d7;2) pilot trial, 31 haemodialysis patients were randomised to cycling, resistance, cycling and resistance, or an attention control. Feasibility was defined a priori by criteria on recruitment, fidelity to the protocol and patient response to the intervention. To better understand feasibility, we conducted interviews with dialysis unit staff and trial participants. As secondary outcomes, we estimated the main effect of cycling and weights each compared with control on QoL, physical function and strength.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>We exceeded the target accrual of 28 participants over 12&#x02005;weeks. Irrespective of exercise group allocation, adherence was high; of the 1038 training sessions offered, 87% were initiated and over 80% of exercise sessions were performed as per protocol. Progression based on perceived exertion, individual instruction and interactions with the kinesiologist facilitated acceptability across exercise groups. Using an attention control, measures of contamination and attrition were low. Important barriers to unit staff readiness for the intervention were initial safety and workflow concerns, unit workload and onerous data collection. Secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. Adverse events were low and did not increase with a higher volume of exercise.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The main study is feasible with minor modifications. In addition to practical assistance, involvement from unit staff could increase patient participation and improve trial implementation. Strategies to increase acceptability of the intervention for staff include improving workflow integration and using a prestudy demonstration phase to introduce the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02234232">NCT02234232</ext-link>.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> How to most effectively engage patients in the optimal exercise prescription and achieve the desired outcome while minimising risk, is critical to increasing patient participation.</p><p>Many generic QoL scales used in exercise studies in people with ESRD address the individual's perception of their ability to meet the demands of everyday living. However, performance of daily tasks is more dependent on musculoskeletal fitness than aerobic capacity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and in people with congestive heart failure (CHF),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> resistance training is a promising means of improving QoL and decreasing disability. However, whether resistance training confers specific benefits relevant to aspects of QoL in people with ESRD is not known.</p><p>The aim of our future multicentre study is to evaluate the effect of two types of exercise (cycling and resistance) each compared with control and performed during the HD treatment (intradialytic exercise, (IDE)) on QoL and physical performance using a randomised factorial design. Prior to proceeding with this main study, a pilot was warranted to evaluate the feasibility of the design. Although delivering exercise during HD has been associated with greater adherence compared with a home-based exercise programme,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> few pilot studies have rigorously evaluated the feasibility or the integrity of trial implementation and we are not aware of any studies that have included qualitative methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implementation process.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This mixed methods, single-centre, randomised, factorial (2&#x000d7;2) trial included qualitative interviews with trial participants and dialysis unit staff to evaluate domains of feasibility defined a priori: recruitment, fidelity to the study protocol and the response of trial participants and dialysis unit staff to the intervention. In a secondary analysis, we explored differences in QoL, physical function and strength. The two factors evaluated were aerobic exercise (cycling) and resistance exercise (leg weights). HD patients were randomised to one of four groups: cycling, leg weights, combined leg weights and cycling, or stretching (an attention control). The rationale for using a factorial design is for the efficiency of testing more than one intervention in the same participants.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (There is no known interaction between aerobic and resistance exercise in the literature ie, the effect of aerobic exercise does not differ in the presence of resistance exercise.) All exercises were performed during HD at each thrice-weekly dialysis session over 12&#x02005;weeks (36 sessions). The study protocol was registered under NCT02234232.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The trial setting was an outpatient dialysis unit in Edmonton, Canada that serves &#x0223c;110 patients. A study coordinator recruited participants during their HD sessions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: adult (age &#x02265;18); dialysis dependent for &#x02265;3 consecutive months; receiving &#x02265;3 dialysis treatments per week; mobile (any distance, walking aid permitted); at least one non-prosthetic limb; and capable of providing consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: currently enrolled in a clinical trial; missing an average of &#x0003e;2 dialysis sessions per month; planned move or modality change within the next 4&#x02005;months; currently enrolled in a structured exercise programme; scheduled hospitalisation for &#x0003e;1&#x02005;week; unstable during HD; and any uncontrolled medical condition that would preclude participation in a low/moderate intensity exercise programme.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Participants were randomised on a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a computerised randomisation procedure with permuted blocks of eight and twelve. Allocation was concealed in serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The randomisation list was generated by the statistician and kept in a locked cabinet. Given the open setting of the dialysis unit and the nature of the intervention, it was not logistically possible to blind the participants or the kinesiologist to treatment allocation. Therefore, participants and HD unit staff were blinded to the study hypothesis. Patients were informed that they would be randomised to one of four different exercise regimens; a stretching exercise group served as the attention control. Kinesiologists assessed all tests of physical performance; a blinded assessor performed outcome assessments at 12&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Exercise intervention</title><p>A kinesiologist instructed all participants on how to perform exercises and supervised a minimum of two of the participants' thrice-weekly exercise sessions. In addition, the kinesiologist supervised the first three exercise sessions and the first session following progression of the exercise prescription. When the kinesiologist was not present, dialysis unit staff assisted patients with equipment set-up and completed trial documentation. Throughout the study, unit staff were also asked to help motivate patients by providing verbal encouragement. The kinesiologist instructed all participants on how to use rating of perceived exertion (RPE) with the Borg scale (6&#x02013;20).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The intensity of exercise for the aerobic, resistance and combined intervention groups was prescribed at a level of 12&#x02013;14 or &#x02018;somewhat hard&#x02019; on the Borg (RPE) scale and a RPE level of 8&#x02013;9 (&#x02018;very light&#x02019;) for the stretching group.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Aerobic intervention</title><p>Each session included a 5&#x02005;min warm-up and cool-down on the cycle ergometer at an RPE of 9&#x02013;11. The cycling protocol started with 15&#x02005;min of cycling with time increased by 2.5&#x02005;min each week. The resistance was adjusted to maintain the target RPE. One of two types of cycle ergometers were used according to compatibility with the type of dialysis chair: the Monark 881E cycle (Healthcare International, Langley, Washington, USA) or the TherapyTrainer (Interactive Motivation, Greeley, Colorado, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Resistance intervention</title><p>Ankle weights (Fabrication Enterprises, White Plains, New York, USA) were used for knee extension, knee flexion and hip flexion. A Thera-Band (Hygenic Corporation, Akron, Ohio, USA) was used for hip abduction. Each session included a warm-up of one set of the four exercises against gravity. Based on RPE, exercises progressed from one set of 10&#x02013;15 repetitions up to three sets.

We demonstrated feasibility of recruitment and high patient acceptability. In addition, few exercise trials in this population have attempted to blind participants to group allocation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We demonstrated a low risk of contamination and attrition with the use of an attention control and blinding to study hypothesis. However, primarily based on the findings from the interviews with dialysis unit staff and trial participants, several modifications to the study protocol are required prior to proceeding with the main study.</p><p>Readiness for change is considered critical to the successful implementation of complex interventions in healthcare settings.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In this pilot, we found that there was a lack of readiness among dialysis unit staff for IDE. Several of the factors that influenced unit staff's preparation, motivation and ability to participate in this trial have been cited in other studies as barriers to the implementation of clinical IDE programmes: lack of time,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> high patient care demands<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and safety concerns with the exercise equipment in their workspace.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our previous study, we also identified a lack of support from management and personal beliefs about exercise as influencing staff readiness for IDE.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Therefore, prior to recruitment for the main study, it will be necessary to develop a strategy for understanding staff readiness at potential study sites. Although the influence of education on staff participation in IDE remains unknown, in one study, patient and staff thought that a better understanding of IDE would have improved their initial participation.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In this pilot, the lack of interest among many unit staff for IDE education was a barrier to engaging staff. Other more convenient forms of delivering education, that is, videos online and reading material on the unit were not highly accessed. As unit staff expressed that seeing and hearing the benefits from their patients first-hand positively influenced their perceptions of the intervention, a pretrial demonstration phase may be the most effective means of promoting acceptability of IDE. Despite the concerns expressed in the pretrial interviews about patient and workspace safety, that no unit staff mentioned these concerns in the second set of interviews (once the intervention was established), also supports the value of providing staff with the opportunity to experience IDE in their own setting prior to study start.</p><p>In addition to requiring the unit staff's assistance with IDE delivery for practical reasons, we identified other reasons why their participation was important. First, due to their frequent and prolonged contact with patients, dialysis unit staff are in a unique position to assist patients with decision-making.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> As we found that some patients seek the opinion of dialysis unit staff on study participation, it is important that those who engage in these discussions are prepared to discuss the risks and benefits of IDE with patients. Although 30% non-participation is comparable to other trials in this population,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> it is possible that the staff's perceptions of IDE influenced patients' decision to participate. Second, the patients' perspective that unit staff's assistance and encouragement with IDE is consistent with their role as carer and patient advocate has the potential to influence patient acceptability of IDE.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Third, many patients experienced difficulty consistently obtaining exercise equipment from unit staff, which has clear implications for patient adherence.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>For unit staff, exercise data collection was too time-consuming and resulted in missing data. This issue was recognised early in the trial and resolved with greater involvement from study staff. This strategy is not feasible for a multisite study and exercise vital signs will be limited to pre-exercise, midexercise and postexercise. We also found that for unit staff, feasibility of workflow integration was affected by the timing of when in the dialysis treatment that IDE was performed.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To decrease the risk of hypotension, other trials have typically completed exercise within the first 1&#x02013; 2&#x02005;hours of the HD session<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and starting exercise within the first hour of HD is often recommended. However, this is often the busiest time for unit staff, and in settings where there are staffing constraints, it may be a barrier to optimal staff engagement. We are only aware of one trial where IDE was performed in the final 2&#x02005;hours of the HD session and this was well tolerated.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our protocol specified that patients finish their exercise within the first 3&#x02005;hours of the dialysis shift. The safety of this approach is supported by our BP and safety data. A more detailed evaluation of the timing of the HD session and its effect on BP would provide important insight into how to optimise the safety and the practicality of IDE delivery.</p><p>This study has several important strengths. Most studies evaluating exercise adherence in people with kidney disease have focused on individual determinants and not evaluated programme factors.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In this study, progression based on RPE and individualised instruction facilitated acceptability among patients. As described in our qualitative study, patients perceived the kinesiologist's technical support as conveying a sense of esteem and capability.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This interaction may have served to increase participation, irrespective of group assignment. Additionally, the most commonly mentioned benefit to IDE was that it helped pass the time, suggesting that many patients are interested in participating in interventions where they can use their time on HD more constructively. It also suggests that some of the perceived improvement in well-being could be mediated through engagement in an activity, rather than exercise. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to use a supervised attention control for the main study. Our study also has several limitations that warrant mention. Given the potential impact of the interaction with the exercise specialist on IDE acceptability, it will be important to ensure that the interaction time between the attention control group and the kinesiologist is equivalent to that of the intervention groups. Also, the trial study population was small and relatively homogeneous with respect to sex, age and ethnicity, which may limit the generalisability of the findings.</p><p>We did not detect differences in physical activity or exercise performed outside of the unit during the trial, nor was the trial powered for this outcome. The antagonistic interaction term for the SPPB will also need to be explored in more detail, as this could be a spurious finding due to multiple outcome testing. The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate feasibility and small sample sizes were used. Therefore, the finding that cycling or weights did not improve QoL or other measures of physical performance should not be interpreted as providing evidence for no effect. Based on 80% power to detect a difference in the primary outcome of PCS of five points<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> in the main effect of aerobic and the main effect of resistance, 32 participants per arm are required. Allowing for 25% dropout per arm, the main study will enrol 160 patients. A four-arm parallel design would allow direct comparisons between the interventions; however, the sample size would need to be at least twice as large as that calculated for the main study. Given that recruitment and retention are barriers to performing adequately powered exercise studies in this population, the factorial design is one means of improving efficiency while allowing for indirect comparisons between aerobic and resistance training.</p></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first feasibility study to use qualitative methods to evaluate IDE implementation within an RCT design and to address known limitations to trial design. In addition to informing the design of our future definitive study, these results are useful in the development of future trials and for guiding clinicians with the implementation of their own IDE interventions. The key lesson learnt was that within this protocolised setting, the potential for unit staff readiness to influence aspects of feasibility, such as recruitment and patient adherence was high. Therefore, prior to study start, more time will need to be invested in understanding and enhancing staff readiness. For engaging unit staff, a less didactic approach that is also integrated into their existing workflow may be highly effective.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Stephanie Thompson at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/StephanieTh11">@StephanieTh11</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> Authorship followed International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines.
