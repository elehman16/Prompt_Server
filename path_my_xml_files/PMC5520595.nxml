Inclusion criteria were: Patients aged &#x0003e;18 years, with acute or chronic symptoms or signs of cervical myelopathy undergoing cervical spine surgery. Exclusion criteria were: patients with preoperative hemodynamic instability or heart failure, pregnancy, known allergies to any anesthetic agent, chronic use of opiate analgesics, family history of malignant hyperthermia, coagulopathy, medical history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent history of airway infection, or chronic cough.</p><p>All patients were randomly assigned (using a computer-derived randomization list) to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane as induction hypnotic. Patients were identified and assigned to the treatment group through a code, and the data were stored on a secure computer network, and only members of the research group had access to the data in accordance with good research practice. On arrival in the operating room, patients were monitored with a two-lead electrocardiogram for heart rate, pulse oximetry for arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (Biox, Ohmeda, France), invasive systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Intraoperative normothermia was actively maintained through a forced air warming system (Bair Hugger, 3M Company, United Kingdom). Immediately before anesthesia induction, all patients received isotonic saline solution through IV cannula-infusion rate 5 mL/kg of the ideal body weight (IBW), topical 2% lidocaine (1&#x02013;5 ml, 20&#x02013;100 mg), oropharynx anesthesia (which has shown to be safe and to ensure good conditions for FOI[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), and a single IV bolus of fentanyl (2 mcg/kg of IBW). All patients were preoxygenated for 3 min using a reservoir bag and 80% O<sub>2</sub> with the fresh gas flow of 6.0 L/min.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In patients assigned to receive total IV anesthesia induction, propofol was administered by a target-controlled infusion system (Diprifusor, Fresenius, Grenoble, France with Schnider Pharmacokinetic Model) using a slow induction rate (injection rate 5 ml/min) with a target plasmatic concentration of 3.5&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/ml titrated to abolish patient's reaction (loss of consciousness confirmed by testing for loss of the eyelash reflex).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In patients assigned to inhalational anesthesia induction, an 8% fraction of the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was delivered using a semi-closed circuit with a fresh gas flow of 6.0 L/min. The time needed to achieve a successful FOI, accomplished by the same operator throughout the study, was recorded. FOI technique included the insertion of a 6.5&#x02013;8 mm internal diameter reinforced lubricated tube into the oropharynx; an adult fiberscope was passed through the tube and after visualizing the glottis straight ahead, lidocaine 2% was sprayed twice into the vocal cords (&#x0201c;spray as you go&#x0201d; technique). The fiberscope was then passed through the vocal cords visualizing the tracheal rings, and the tube was railroaded into the trachea.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was accomplished with a microconvex 2.25 MHz transducer (Hewlett Packard Sonos 2500); standard views were taken from the left parasternal (short- and long-axis views) and the heart apex (two-chamber and four-chamber views).</p><p>Percentage values of left ventricular FS were calculated according to the formula:</p><p>FS = LVEDD&#x02212;LVESD)/LVEDD &#x000d7; 100.</p><p>LV ESQ was measured according to the formula:</p><p>LV ESQ = SBP/LVESD.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Where, LV: Left ventricular, LVEDD:</p><p>Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, LVESD: Left ventricular end-systolic diameter, ESQ: End-systolic quotient, SBP: Systolic blood pressure.</p><p>Primary end-points included changes in MAP and echocardiographic data regarding cardiac function, recorded at four time points:</p><p>

We found that anesthesia induction with propofol determinates a more pronounced drop in mean MAP and echocardiographic changes compared to inhalational anesthesia induction with sevoflurane.</p><p>The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of cervical myelopathy are still unclear; however, there are several factors which can contribute to the progression of this pathology, that can be categorized as either static (such as disc degeneration, spondylosis, congenital stenosis) or dynamic mechanical factor (changes in neck flexion/extension canal), as recently reviewed by Dolan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Recent studies proposed that even several cellular mechanisms including ischemia, glutamatergic toxicity, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis could be involved in the progression of cervical myelopathy, suggesting that oligodendroglia of the spinal cord may be hypersensitive to hypotension and hypoperfusion, with consequent ischemic injury.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, in patients undergoing cerebral myelopathy surgery, close attention must be paid to avoid mechanical spinal cord compression and to maintain an adequate spinal cord perfusion to prevent further neurological damage.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Several studies have discussed the risks related to laryngoscopy and cervical spine movements in these patients and several approaches have been proposed.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The effects on the hemodynamic system as well as the risk of neurological complications are yet to be deduced. To ensure an adequate spinal cord perfusion, MAP values should be maintained in line or above patient's baseline values.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Doppler ultrasonography has shown that in patients without signs of myelopathy, a MAP cutting edge of 60 mmHg is related to a critical reduction of the anterior spinal artery blood flow.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The strength of our work is the ability to underline the clinical relevance of an adequate hemodynamic management in this group of patients, where most of the attention is generally addressed and limited just to the choice of the technique used for tracheal intubation. In this context, we advocate the use of transthoracic echocardiography as a noninvasive tool for hemodynamic monitoring and management.</p><p>We propose a practical approach to the clinical management of anesthesia induction comparing two types of drugs which are commonly used, demonstrating for the first time in this group of patients that sevoflurane is less hypotensive than propofol. The challenge in patients undergoing cervical myelopathy surgery is that it is very important to maintain hemodynamic stability, but at the same time to ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia during intubation to avoid secondary spinal cord injury by mechanical damage.</p><p>Our results confirm and extend previous evidence recorded in a different subset of patients, where propofol anesthesia induction caused more pronounced hemodynamic changes compared to sevoflurane anesthesia induction presumably because of its side effects on myocardial contractility and direct vasodilation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Despite these statistically significant differences, both techniques are suitable for clinical use as recorded differences were rarely associated with MAP values below the safety threshold[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] at any time point. The reduction of LV FS and LV ESQ values at T2 in patients who received propofol suggests a reduction of afterload and preload rather than changes in cardiac contractility.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, to minimize hemodynamic changes related to total IV anesthesia induction with propofol, we have selected a slow induction rate protocol that requires longer time but induces minimal effects on arterial pressure.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that the incidence of apnea was higher in propofol-treated patients as previously described;[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] however, the duration of apnea was similar in the two study groups and lasted &#x0003c;30 s in all the cases.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring has not been used to assess anesthesia depth. Although it might have been informative, BIS-derived measures do not have conclusive evidence,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and we considered that the clinical criteria used in this study could adequately describe the level of anesthesia achieved before intubation. Second, the use of sevoflurane-based inhalational induction could not induce deep anesthesia state. This is unlikely in our patient population because the time required for the intubation was limited. However, should the patient present a difficult and protracted intubation, it needs to be reminded that the anesthesia depth might be lighter when sevoflurane is used compared with propofol. Finally, a more accurate estimation of the effects of anesthesia induction on cardiac hemodynamics would require a more aggressive monitoring (such pulmonary artery catheterization or other invasive monitoring techniques including the measurement of cardiac output, central venous pressure to the degree of venous drainage impairment and to assess venous pressure). However, due to a lack of evidence supporting the use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in patients undergoing these procedures, these techniques were not performed. Finally, it would be very useful in these patients the calculation of spinal cord perfusion pressure (SPP), to assess the correct value of MAP to achieve. However, at present, the only reliable way to measure spinal cord perfusion is through the insertion of a pressure probe placed subdurally in the spine and calculating spinal cord perfusion as SPP = MAP-spinal cord pressure.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Again, this invasive procedure was not applicable in this case.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients undergoing surgery for cervical spine myelopathy, attention should be addressed to minimize arterial hypotension related to anesthesia induction to ensure adequate spinal cord perfusion, by preemptive volume replacement and with the use of an adequate anesthesiological slow induction rate protocol. Both total IV anesthesia induction with propofol and inhalational anesthesia induction with sevoflurane are safe and suitable techniques for anesthesia induction and FOI without nbas. However, total IV anesthesia induction with propofol, even used at slow induction rate, can cause a significant drop in MAP even when the value is within the safety threshold for spinal cord perfusion. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of different techniques of anesthesia induction in patients with cervical spine myelopathy, to minimize the risk of neurological and systemic complications in this group of patients.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of
