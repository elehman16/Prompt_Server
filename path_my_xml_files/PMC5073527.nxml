Participants were aged &#x02265;18&#x02005;years, listed on a Quality and Outcomes Framework register for CHD and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, with persistent depressive symptoms. Patients with psychosis or type I/II bipolar disorder, actively suicidal, in receipt of services for substance misuse, or already in receipt of psychological therapy for depression were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Collaborative care consisted of evidence-based low-intensity psychological treatments, delivered over 3&#x02005;months and case management by a practice nurse and a Psychological Well Being Practitioner.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>As planned, the primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)).

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In time-restricted and performance-managed primary care settings, detecting and diagnosing depression in people with long-term conditions can be especially problematic. Patients and healthcare professionals commonly dismiss depression as an inevitable consequence of long-term conditions and favour strategies that prioritise physical health.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Global and English health policy has recognised the importance of improving mental health generally and specifically among those with physical health problems.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In England, government policy has increasingly promoted increased access to mental healthcare through commissioning and provision of health and social care in the primary care setting. This is supported by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative. It is important to explore ways in which the IAPT initiative can be capitalised on to improve healthcare and health outcomes for patients. Collaborative care is a complex intervention which may provide a framework for delivering IAPT-based treatments. Collaborative care was developed in the USA and involves the use of a case manager working with primary care professionals, often supervised by a mental health specialist and supported by appropriate care management systems that can enhance interprofessional communication and facilitate proactive and scheduled follow-up of patients.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>A definitive Cochrane review reported that collaborative care effectively treated depression and anxiety over the short (0&#x02013;6&#x02005;months), medium (7&#x02013;12&#x02005;months) and long term (13&#x02013;24&#x02005;months), compared with usual care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The review defined usual care as one of: no additional intervention; the same additional intervention applied to both study arms (effects potentially cancelled out); or enhanced usual care (a non-collaborative intervention that the collaborative care arm did not receive). Much of the evidence is drawn from the USA, where care is organised, provided and funded differently from the UK. However, the COINCIDE and CADET trials showed that the short-term and medium-term benefits of collaborative care also translate to the English healthcare system.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> There is good evidence (from the USA) that collaborative care is also effective for treating depression in people with coexisting long-term physical health conditions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref></p><p>Evidence that collaborative care is <italic>cost</italic>-effective is more limited, and again mostly from the USA.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, an economic evaluation of CADET has recently shown that compared with usual care, collaborative care is cost-effective in the medium term (12&#x02005;months), from the perspective of the English National Health Service (NHS).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Analysis of complete-case data in that trial, estimated that collaborative care offered a mean incremental gain of 0.02 (95% CI &#x02013;0.02 to 0.06) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 12&#x02005;months, at a mean incremental cost of &#x000a3;270.72 (95% CI &#x02013;202.98 to 886.04). This resulted in a cost per QALY of &#x000a3;14&#x02005;248 and a probability of 0.58 that collaborative care was cost-effective if decision-makers are willing to pay &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000/QALY gained.</p><p>The long-term (&#x0003e;12&#x02005;months) clinical and cost-effectiveness of collaborative care in the English healthcare system have not been evaluated previously. The long-term effectiveness of collaborative care may be particularly relevant to patients with comorbid physical illnesses if an artefact of collaborative care is an altered trajectory of mental and/or physical health needs or long-term improvements in relationships with healthcare practitioners/self-care.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A trial of a collaborative care for managing depression in patients with cancer reported a higher cost per QALY gained over 5&#x02005;years than over 20&#x02005;years, suggesting it may become better value with an increasing time horizon.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>The COINCIDE trial was a robust, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) of collaborative care versus usual care, delivered in routine primary care in the English NHS to trial participants with a long-term condition (diabetes and/or coronary heart disease (CHD)) and depression.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Owing to logistical constraints, COINCIDE participants were only followed for 4&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> CHD and diabetes are lifelong conditions, and depression can be a recurrent, chronic condition. Therefore, it is important to consider the effectiveness of collaborative care in this population over long-term periods. Economic models can be used to extrapolate the cost-effectiveness findings from a short-term RCT to longer time horizons and alternative settings and populations.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>This study is important because it makes a robust contribution to economic evidence about estimated costs and benefits of implementing collaborative care in the English healthcare system (NHS England). Existing evidence is limited to studies conducted in the US healthcare system which may not be relevant to the implementation of collaborative care in the NHS. Emerging evidence from a single English complete-case analysis suggests that collaborative care may be cost-effective in this context over 12&#x02005;months. However, it is still unknown whether these findings are likely to translate to longer time horizons. This analysis uses an economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of collaborative care in the context of the NHS at 12, 24 and 36&#x02005;months. This has not been done previously. Furthermore, this is the first analysis of the cost-effectiveness of collaborative care in the NHS for patients with long-term physical conditions alongside depression (multimorbidity).</p><p><italic>Aim</italic>: To use an economic model to extrapolate trial-based cost-effectiveness estimates for collaborative care versus usual care over a long-term (24&#x02005;months) time horizon.

The evaluation was a cluster RCT of 36 primary care (general) practices in the North West of England, randomised to provide either collaborative care or usual care. Randomisation was by a central service, separated from the investigators, using minimisation based on practice size and deprivation. Three hundred and eighty-seven participants were recruited; 191 at practices randomised to deliver collaborative care and 196 at practices delivering usual care. Sixty-two per cent of participants were male, 14% were of non-white ethnicity. The majority (76%) of participants were from moderately/highly deprived areas (54% from highly deprived areas) and had a mean of 6.2 (SD 3.0) medical conditions in addition to diabetes and/or CHD. Full details of the trial design are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

Standard management for depression in adults with physical health conditions can vary but should include the components of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) stepped care model which includes support from general practitioners (GPs), referral for a range of low-intensity to high-intensity psychological interventions and/or antidepressant therapy (dependent on severity of depression, patient preference and prior experience).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In line with the pragmatic nature of this evaluation, patients in the usual care group could receive antidepressant treatment and referral for psychological therapy, although this was not delivered by a specially trained COINCIDE PWP.</p><p>The primary clinical outcome was the difference between the collaborative and usual care groups in the mean score on the 13 depression-related items of the 90-item symptom checklist (SCL-D13)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> at the end of a 4-month follow-up period.

Data on the use of other health and social care services were collected by questionnaire completed by participants at initial (4-month) follow-up. The services included primary and community care, hospital inpatient and outpatient care, prescribed medications, and patient health-related costs and expenses (travel to healthcare appointments and private medical expenses exceeding &#x000a3;50, eg, reflexology). The costs of resources used were estimated as the product of the resource use and its unit cost. The unit costs of the services used were originally derived from the 2011&#x02013;2012 Reference Costs database (published by the Department of Health), 2011&#x02013;2012 unit costs of primary and community health and social care services (published by the Personal and Social Services Research Unit), and the 2011&#x02013;2012 British National Formulary (BNF) handbook<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S1</xref>).

The health states and possible transitions between them were the same for both models.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Probability of events</title><p>The probabilities of following the different pathways through the decision tree or moving between the health states in the Markov model were derived from COINCIDE. The proportion of participants in each health state at the end of the initial follow-up was used to estimate the probability of transitioning between health states for the model. All participants recruited to COINCIDE were identified as depressed; this was based on a PHQ-9 score &#x02265;10. There was a proportion of participants in both study arms who did not have a baseline SCL-D13 score &#x02265;20; the estimated probability of becoming depressed was derived from the outcomes of these participants during the trial. Three participants died before outcome data had been collected at the initial 4-month follow-up, both of whom had SCL-D13 scores &#x02265;20 (ie, classified as depressed in this model). This was applied to the primary analysis as depression-related mortality rate of 0.02 over 4&#x02005;months. Cardiovascular events were not accounted for in the model as data were not available to explore whether/how the intervention was associated with their likelihood and long-term impact on health status.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Modelling resource use, costs and QALYs</title><p>The mean cost and SE of resource use (including direct costs of the collaborative care intervention) and utility weights observed in the trial were used to generate point estimates associated with the different health states in the model.

In the primary model, it was assumed that the impact of collaborative care on the utilities associated with each health state and the likelihood of moving between the health states was not sustained beyond the initial 4-month follow-up; utilities and event probabilities were the same in both models. This assumption was explored in one-way sensitivity analyses (described below).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012514TB1" orientation="portrait"

Each model parameter (event probability, cost or QALY) was assigned a primary value (mean base on data observed from COINCIDE) and a distribution of possible values (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012514TB1">table 1</xref>). Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate mean expected costs and outcomes, and statistical measures of expected variance (SD) around the mean for each of 10&#x02005;000 iterations drawn from the distributions defined. Each of the 10&#x02005;000 net outcome estimates were revalued by a willingness to pay threshold (WTPT) of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 (current NICE decision threshold).<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This was repeated for each of a range of WTPTs.

For each one-way sensitivity analysis, the parameter of interest was set to a specific value and the PSA and cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses rerun, to assess the robustness of the results to changes in that variable. Parameter values for sensitivity analyses were chosen either as systematic variations around the values in the primary model or from differences between observed data from COINCIDE and CADET and published meta-analyses (clinical effectiveness) and narrative systematic reviews (cost-effectiveness). The parameters tested by one-way sensitivity analysis included time horizon, effectiveness of collaborative care, discount rate for costs and QALYs, mortality rate, and intervention costs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Within-trial analysis</title><p>The probability of being depressed (SCL-D13&#x02265;20)<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> at the end of the initial 4-month follow-up was lower for participants randomised to collaborative care (0.57, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.65) than usual care (0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.78; p=0.004; imputed data). The mean cost per participant of delivering the collaborative care intervention (including training/supervision/set-up costs) was &#x000a3;317 (&#x000a3;168&#x02014;when training costs were excluded).

Online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S3</xref> presents the results of subgroup analyses on the basis of age at baseline and number of physical conditions reported (in addition to diabetes/CHD). Based on the mean age of the sample (58&#x02005;years), and the (former) age of retirement for women in England (60&#x02005;years), two subgroups were defined: under 60 and 60+ years. There was little difference in the likelihood that collaborative care is cost-effective in participants under 60&#x02005;years old (ICER &#x000a3;16&#x02005;891; probability cost-effective (&#x000a3;20k/QALY) 0.49) or those older than 60 (ICER &#x000a3;23&#x02005;358; probability cost-effective (&#x000a3;20k/QALY) 0.49), despite a lower ICER for the under 60 group. This reflects the additional uncertainty around these subgroup estimates. Based on the mean number of long-term conditions reported (other than diabetes or CHD), two subgroups were defined: fewer than 6 conditions and 6+ conditions. Collaborative care may be less likely to be cost-effective in participants with more than six additional conditions (ICER &#x000a3;33&#x02005;210; probability cost-effective (&#x000a3;20k/QALY) 0.50), compared to those with fewer than six (ICER &#x000a3;9625; probability cost-effective (&#x000a3;20k/QALY) 0.55).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Principal findings</title><p>The results described here suggest that over a 24-month time horizon, collaborative care, for patients with depression plus comorbid cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes, is potentially cost-effective compared with usual care in the English healthcare system.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>The relative risk of depression for usual versus collaborative care observed in COINCIDE was the same as estimated from a meta-analysis of RCTs over a range of follow-up periods up to 24&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Comparison of the ICERs estimated from this model at 12, 24 and 36&#x02005;months support the finding that collaborative care is better value over longer time horizons.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Economic evaluation of the medium-term (12&#x02005;month) effects of collaborative care in the English healthcare system reported from CADET was similar to the 12-month results from our model.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The QALYs gained from collaborative care over 12&#x02005;months (CADET 0.02; COINCIDE 0.03) and probability of cost-effectiveness at a WTPT of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 (CADET 0.58; COINCIDE 0.53) were comparable. The estimated cost of delivering collaborative care (CADET &#x000a3;273; COINCIDE &#x000a3;317) and net cost of health service resources used were higher in COINCIDE (CADET &#x000a3;271; COINCIDE &#x000a3;560). This suggests that for COINCIDE participants, collaborative care was associated with an impact on health service usage. This may result from improved self-care/management of physical health conditions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This also reflects the specific impact of implementing collaborative care in patients with complex needs arising from multimorbidity and highlights the importance of examining this group as a special case. The mean QALY gain from collaborative care over 18&#x02013;24&#x02005;months reported in a systematic review<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> was the same as when it was assumed that the benefit of collaborative care observed during COINCIDE waned by 10% every 4&#x02005;months. Even when it was assumed that the beneficial effect of collaborative care <italic>increased</italic> by 25% every 4&#x02005;months, the estimated QALY gain over 24&#x02005;months (0.21) did not reach the level estimated by a seemingly comparable US study (0.34).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This exemplifies the difficulty of generalising between studies and the need for health service-specific research.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The parameters used in the decision model were derived from within-trial data and so are subject to the same strengths and limitations as the trial.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> COINCIDE was a large pragmatic trial (integrated within routine NHS settings) with good retention rates. A range of recruitment (eg, from diverse geographical/sociodemographic areas), randomisation (eg, cluster randomisation of practices) and analytic (eg, multiple imputation; adjusting for baseline characteristics) techniques were used to minimise bias and confounding and so ensure that the results of the economic evaluation are also likely to be robust and representative of routine practice.</p><p>Data regarding the usage of healthcare during the study period were self-reported by participants, collected via questionnaire at follow-up assessment. Participants may not be able to accurately recall each time they used a healthcare service, or may be unclear which category different services come under. These issues may affect people who use a large amount of healthcare services more. Verification against medical records may increase the reliability of these data; however, access to medical records was not agreed for COINCIDE participants.</p><p>There were 210 (54%) participants with complete EQ-5D (utility), healthcare usage (cost) and baseline covariate data. Multiple imputation of missing data for all COINCIDE participants reduced the potential for bias associated with missing data. However, the robustness of any imputation method declines as the level of missing data increases, reducing the validity and reliability of the analyses. For example, the high level of missing data and inconsistency of reporting for informal care received (from friends and family) meant that it was not possible to reliably impute data. The estimated cost-effectiveness may have been sensitive to the inclusion of informal care costs, but it is not possible to know the magnitude or direction of any effect. Findings reported here about the cost-effectiveness of collaborative care over 24&#x02005;months (used to denote long-term follow-up in comparable trials of collaborative care<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) were estimated from an extrapolation of short-term (4-month) trial data. The physical health conditions experienced by the cohort are long term and depression can also be a chronic, recurrent condition. The cost-effectiveness of collaborative care over 36&#x02005;months (very long term) was explored in sensitivity analyses, but in this population, longer horizons (eg, 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;years) may also be important. There is already uncertainty around the ICERs estimated for 24&#x02005;months. Extending the time horizon for this model would stretch the evidence from the trial too far (limiting robustness and increasing uncertainty). The economic model presented here demonstrated good external validity; results are supported by findings from other trials/reviews and the ICER changed as expected in response to the different one-way sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the conclusion regarding cost-effectiveness and the probability that collaborative care is cost-effective did not vary greatly across sensitivity or subgroup analyses. This indicates that the model is robust. However, the probability of cost-effectiveness was conservative, even for an ICER of &#x0003c;&#x000a3;4000/QALY. This is due to differing levels of uncertainty around the estimates of costs and QALYs which can be seen by comparing the width of 95% CIs around the means (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012514TB2">table 2</xref> and see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary table S3</xref>).</p><p>In a US study, collaborative care was associated with better self-management of diabetes and/or CHD.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There may be an important long-term impact of improved self-management on mortality (or other long-term health outcomes), especially among patients with multimorbidities. It was not possible to ascertain the long-term effect of collaborative care on morbidity and mortality for COINCIDE participants and so this was not explored further here.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings contribute to the evidence base in support of the commissioning of collaborative care for patients with depression in England. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that collaborative care may also be cost-effective in the English health service for patient groups with depression in conjunction with long-term physical health conditions, and over a long-term time horizon. However, the long-term findings were extrapolated from 4-month trial data and so associated with some uncertainty. Collection of long-term and very long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness data from a pragmatic RCT of collaborative care for patients with multimorbidities, which can be included in an updated meta-analysis, is needed to address this uncertainty.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Peter Coventry at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/peteyc73">@peteyc73</ext-link>, Peter Bower at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/Bowercpcman">@Bowercpcman</ext-link>, Elizabeth Camacho <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/e_camacho_UoM">@e_camacho_UoM</ext-link> and Linda Davies <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/lmdHE1">@lmdHE1</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PC, KL, CD, PB, CC-G, CB, and LG were responsible for drafting and revising the original trial protocol.
