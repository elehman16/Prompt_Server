The standard Ponseti protocol uses weekly above knee plaster cast combined with specific manipulation techniques to correct the deformities. All components of the deformity usually correct within 4&#x02013;5 weeks with the exception of the equinus which is corrected completely in most patients with percutaneous tendo-achilles tenotomy followed by a final plaster cast for three weeks <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The final cast in the classical Ponseti method is above knee cast post tenotomy with the knee in 90&#x000b0; which is left in place for 3 weeks before removal. The modified Ponseti is a below knee cast post tenotomy, the cast get to the junction of the proximal third and the distal two third of the leg and is left in place for three weeks before removal.</p><p id="p0070">Patients are thereafter placed in a foot-abduction brace after the casting phase.

The work complied with the STROCSS criteria. It was conducted at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife, in south-western Nigeria. The hospital has two units (Ife Hospital Unit, Ile-Ife and the Wesley Guild Hospital Unit, Ilesha) where clubfoot clinic runs on weekly basis. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics and Research committee of the hospital for this study with the number IRB/IEC/0004553 and Protocol number ERC/2012/10/08.</p><p id="p0085">The study group comprised of children born with congenital Talipes equinovarus not associated with any other pathology. Subjects included in the study were patients born with congenital idiopathic Talipes equinovarus up to two years of age, while patients older than two years, patients who had been walking and wearing shoes with this deformity, syndromic and recurrent clubfoot were excluded.</p><p id="p0090">Consecutive patients presenting at the outpatient clubfoot clinic of the hospital with idiopathic clubfoot, which satisfied the inclusion criteria, and whose parents/caregivers had consented to the study were recruited and were clinically evaluated. Variables of interest such as the biodata, and Pirani score at presentation were entered into a structured information sheet. Treatment was started as soon as they were referred, and consisted of gentle manipulation of the foot and the serial application of above knee cast with knee flexion to 90&#x000b0; without anaesthesia for the two groups initially. Plaster of Paris (Gypsona, Agary) was used for casting in these patients. After achieving 50&#x000b0;-70&#x000b0; abduction measured with the aid of a Universal Goniometer, the need for tenotomy was determined by the degree of dorsiflexion. If the dorsiflexion was not up to 15&#x000b0;, patient were considered for Tendo-achilles percutaneous tenotomy <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Consecutive patients that needed tenotomy were randomize into two groups as they present: above knee cast(AKC-control) and below knee cast(BKC-study). All the subjects in the control group had the classical Ponseti cast for three weeks while those in the study group had below knee cast for three weeks immediately after the tenotomy. Consultants and Senior Registrars trained in Ponseti treatment protocol were involved in the manipulation, casting and performing of tenotomy for the patients in the two groups and a consultant was on ground to guide as to the adherence to treatment protocol.</p><p id="p0095">Patients were given foot abduction braces following the completion of the casting phase of treatment. This is to be worn 23&#x000a0;h per day for the first 3 months after removal of the post tenotomy cast, and thereafter at nights throughout the study period. These patients were followed up in the clinic on regular basis for up to 6months after tenotomy. The initial follow up was 2 weeks after commencing foot abduction brace to see how patients were coping, then monthly for three months after which patients were reviewed at the 6th month after correction.</p><p id="p0100">Other data that were collected included the number of casting sessions, whether it was above or below knee cast, recurrence, Pirani score at full correction, and at 6 months after full correction. Data analysis was performed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS; IBM; Chicago, Illinois) software for windows version 17. The comparability of patients in the 2 groups of clubfoot treatment was determined from the demographic data and baseline values. Changes in the mean hospital care cost and mean Pirani points were evaluated using Chi-Square test and ANOVA for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U technique was used to compare the two clubfoot groups for non-parametric data. A confidence interval (CI) of 95% p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 was taken to be significant. The cost of treatment has to do with hospital care cost; the cost of transportation for the patients and parent(s)/guardian(s) with the cost as a result of time spent away from work was not included. Also the cost of health care professionals was not included because there was no difference in the skill required for manipulation and casting in the 2 groups. The exchange rate used was 199.25naira to a dollar as obtained with Central Bank of Nigerian in early 2015.

He found an average of 4.9 casting sessions (range of 3&#x02013;10) <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="p0165">To the best of our knowledge there is paucity of documented studies that compared above and below knee cast after percutaneous tenotomy but there are studies that have compared above and below knee cast from the onset of treatment with conflicting results.</p><p id="p0170">Brewster et al., in 2008 in a study among 51 consecutive patients with 80 clubfeet over a 4 year period who had below knee cast from the beginning to the final cast concluded that a below knee softcast in conjunction with Ponseti manipulation technique showed promising initial results which were comparable to those using above knee plaster of Paris cast. Part of the modification they employed was below knee softcast applied directly over a stockinette, without padding thereby obtaining a snug fit. Moreover, particular attention was paid to the formation of a groove above the heel as suggested by Ponseti and Campos to prevent slippage of the cast <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="p0175">Whereas, Maripuri et al., in 2013, in a prospective randomized clinical trial to compare treatment times and failure rates between above and below knee Ponseti cast with 26 children: 13 children (17 feet) in above knee cast and 13 (16 feet) in below knee cast stopped the trial early due to 37.5% failure (6 patients) in below knee cast and concluded that the use of a below knee Plaster of Paris cast in conjunction with the Ponseti technique leads to unacceptably high failure rates and significantly longer treatment times <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our study only compared casting post-tenotomy and as such the outcome may not be significantly different between the classical method and the modified method. Reason being that the Achilles tendon has been severed at tenotomy and its plantar-flexion effect on the ankle effectively removed, hence application of above knee cast with the knee in flexion post &#x02013;tenotomy may be superfluous. It is also noted in a study by Chaudhry et al. that above knee cast helps to keep the ankle and the foot from rotating <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, but in our study, the correction of the forefoot adduction would have been achieved before tenotomy.</p><p id="p0180">Moreover, application of below knee cast will further decrease the overall cost of treatment as seen in our study. The cost of treatment in the two groups were compared and found to be statistically significant. This is important in a resource poor setting like ours. Most studies done on the cost benefits of methods of treatment focussed on comparing different treatment modalities and not variation in treatment technique <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="p0185">The limitation of this study was the short period of follow up of the patients treated. Standard follow-up need at least 3&#x02013;4 years and some have been followed up for 30 years <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0190">Early result showed that there was no difference in the recurrence rate between patients that had above and below knee cast after percutaneous tenotomy in the first six months but the total cost of in-hospital care in the above and below knee cast after percutaneous tenotomy was statistically significant. Due to the short follow up period, we therefore recommend that studies with longer follow up period will be necessary to validate these results. There was no conflict of interest. Funding was borne partly by the hospital where the research was conducted, the authors and the parents/guardians of the patients <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="p0195">Yes.
