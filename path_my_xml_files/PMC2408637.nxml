During the initial 3-month phase, patients received subcutaneous efalizumab 2 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly with randomization to receive concomitant fluocinolone acetonide or placebo ointment during month 3. The second phase was a long-term observational period; patients achieving a &#x02265; 50% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score were eligible to receive efalizumab 1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly for up to 33 months.

Previous clinical studies have indicated that some patients respond with relatively long-lasting residual erythema in sites of resolving plaque psoriasis during efalizumab treatment. To address the erythema, topical therapy was introduced during the third month of treatment after efalizumab typically had effected an improvement in total disease burden. Thus, an early endpoint of this study was a comparison of the efficacy of 12 weekly injections of efalizumab with and without concomitant administration of topical corticosteroid ointment added during the third month of the treatment period.</p><p>During the first 3 months (12 weeks), the initial phase of the study, patients received subcutaneous (SC) efalizumab 2 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly. To address the concern that persistent erythema would influence PASI responses and hinder patient entry to the second phase of the study, the effect of concomitant use of a weak topical steroid was investigated during month 3. Patients were randomized to receive concomitant fluocinolone acetonide ointment 0&#x000b7;025% (<italic>n</italic> = 169) or placebo equivalent (white petrolatum ointment; <italic>n</italic> = 170) during weeks 9&#x02013;12, as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> The second phase of the study was a long-term observational period in which after 3 months, patients who achieved a &#x02265; 50% improvement in PASI relative to baseline (PASI-50) or a static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) rating of mild, minimal or clear on the Overall Lesion Severity (OLS) scale were eligible for an additional period of up to 12 months of maintenance therapy in 3-month segments with SC efalizumab 1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly. Patients who did not achieve the required level of clinical benefit were withdrawn from the study. Subsequent amendments to the protocol extended the study so that patients were eligible for up to a total of 33 months of therapy. If patients experienced a protocol-defined relapse (loss of &#x02265; 50% of the PASI improvement achieved between baseline and week 12) during months 4&#x02013;15, they immediately ended participation in their current 3-month segment and started their next segment at an escalated dosage of 2 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly. At the investigator's discretion, efalizumab could be escalated up to 4 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly. In total, 25 patients were treated with an escalated dose of 3 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly (<italic>n</italic> = 10) for a median duration of 4 weeks (range 2&#x02013;55) or 4 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> weekly (<italic>n</italic> = 15) for a median duration of 4 weeks (range 2&#x02013;21). However, dose escalation was not permitted after month 15 per protocol.

All systemic psoriasis therapies were excluded 1 month prior to the first dose of efalizumab and throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessment and analysis</title><p>The study was divided into 3-month (12-week) segments, and PASI responses were evaluated at month 3 on the last day of each treatment segment. The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis involved all 339 patients who entered into the study. Patients who discontinued treatment during the first treatment period (months 0&#x02013;3) were classified as nonresponders, and patients who did not achieve a PASI-50 or an sPGA score of mild, minimal or clear within the first treatment period were discontinued from the study and considered nonresponders for the remainder of the study. If a patient discontinued during the maintenance treatment period (months 4&#x02013;33), his or her last PASI score was carried forward for each successive time point (last observation carried forward, LOCF). Patients who received an excluded systemic psoriasis therapy for a psoriasis indication were considered nonresponders for the segment in which they first received the excluded medication and in all subsequent segments. Patients who received a systemic psoriasis medication for an indication other than psoriasis had their last PASI score prior to the segment in which they first used the systemic therapy carried forward for all subsequent segments (LOCF).</p><p>Secondary to the ITT analysis, an as-treated analysis included only those patients who remained in the study and initiated each treatment segment. Although not as conservative as the ITT&#x02013;LOCF analysis method, as-treated analysis is reflective of the efficacy seen in the patients who persist on therapy over time.</p><p>In a separate ITT analysis of patients by weight, patients were divided into two groups, heavy (&#x02265; 91 kg, <italic>n</italic> = 173) and nonheavy (&#x0003c; 91 kg, <italic>n</italic> = 166) patients, and the analysis was performed on each weight group with LOCF for missing values.</p><p>As is common in long-term studies, this study had a number of patient discontinuations.

The relatively small size of the cohort limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding rare events such as cancers; however, a separate analysis of malignancy rates, based on 14 pooled efalizumab clinical trials, has been performed to address this question.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> The incidence rate for solid tumours was 0&#x000b7;47/100 patient-years in efalizumab-treated patients and 0&#x000b7;54/100 patient-years in placebo-treated patients, and it ranged between 0&#x000b7;26/100 and 0&#x000b7;44/100 patient-years in three external reference databases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> In the 36-month study reported here, solid tumour events occurred at a rate of 0&#x000b7;49/100 patient-years.
