There is an urgent need for country specific primary prevention strategies to address the growing burden of cardio-metabolic disease in this population. The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether intensive (3-monthly) lifestyle modification advice is superior to a less-intensive (12 monthly; control group) lifestyle modification advice on a primary composite cardio-metabolic end point in 'at risk' urban subjects aged between 5-40 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is an open randomised controlled parallel group clinical trial performed at a single centre in Colombo, Sri-Lanka. A cluster sampling strategy was used to select a large representative sample of subjects aged between 5-40 years at high risk of T2DM and CVD for the intervention study. We have screened 23,298 (males 47% females 53%) healthy subjects for four risk factors: obesity, elevated waist circumference, family history of diabetes and physical inactivity, using a questionnaire and anthropometry. Those with two or more risk-factors were recruited to the intervention trial. We aim to recruit 4600 subjects for the intervention trial. The primary composite cardio-metabolic end point is; new onset T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glycaemia, new onset hypertension and albuminuria, following 5 years of intervention. The effect of the intervention on pre-specified secondary endpoints will also be evaluated. The study will be conducted according to good clinical and ethical practice, data analysis and reporting guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>DIABRISK-SL is a large population based trial to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes, pre-diabetes and cardio-metabolic risk factors among young urban Sri-Lankans and the effect of a primary prevention strategy on cardio-metabolic disease end points.

Nearly two thirds of the estimated 285 million people with diabetes (predominantly T2DM) live in low and middle income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent data indicates that South Asia is one of the major sites of this epidemic of T2DM with a projected 72% increase in the number of subjects with T2DM in the next 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In parallel there is an epidemic of pre-diabetes [impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG)], with prevalence rates between 10-15% reported in South Asian adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>T2DM and IGT are associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with South Asian's particularly predisposed to early onset of T2DM and CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In South Asia almost a third of T2DM cases will be in those aged below 45 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Both CVD and T2DM may share a common pathogenesis and indeed retain many common risk factors/features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Sri Lanka is a middle income country in Asia with a population of 20 million. Nearly 40% of Sri Lankans are aged below 40 years and 25% are aged below 18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There has been a rapid urbanisation in recent decades with an estimated 30% of the population now living in urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The most recent national study in subjects aged over 20 years indicated a population prevalence of dysglycaemia (defined as T2DM or IGT or IFG) of 20% which rose to 30% in urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Physical inactivity, raised body mass index (BMI) and central obesity along with urban living were strongly associated with the increased risk of dysglycaemia.</p><p>The majority of lifestyle modification (LSM) intervention studies/programmes on preventing T2DM have been done in older pre-diabetic subjects with mean ages between 45-50 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis suggested that in subjects with IGT, the number needed to treat to prevent one case of T2DM was 10.8 with anti-diabetic drugs as compared to 6.4 with LSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

The sampling strategy was designed to provide a sample that was representative of the age and sex distribution of the general population aged between 5-40 years in the Colombo district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A list of schools, workplaces, universities and community organisations was made that were representative of the organizations and population aged between 5 to 40 years obtained from the most recent national census results. This list comprised of 65 organisations and each of these organizations was individually approached and eligible participants were invited to take part in the screening study. The screening survey took place between 1<sup>st </sup>January 2008 and 30<sup>th </sup>June 2009. The age and sex distribution of the screened population was regularly compared with the distribution of the reference population to ensure that the screened population was representative of the distribution of the general population aged between 5 and 40 years in the Colombo district. More than 95% of subjects and institutions approached agreed to participate. Subjects with a known history of T2DM, CVD, hypertension or diabetes and pregnant women were excluded from the initial sample. Subjects on lipid lowering drugs or anti-diabetic or anti-hypertensive drugs were also excluded.</p><p>Subjects with any active communicable or non-communicable chronic disease (NCD) such as cancer, asthma or other forms of chronic lung disease, depression, and tuberculosis were also excluded. A screening questionnaire (see additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) was used to determine first degree family history of T2DM and the physical activity of the individual participants. Further information regarding socio-demographic factors was also collected.</p><p>The screening study aimed to identify four risk-factors: physical inactivity (&#x0003c;30 minutes continuous exercise for &#x0003c;3 days/week), raised WC (central obesity) defined as WC in subjects between 5-17 yrs &#x02265;91<sup>th </sup>percentile, 18-40 yrs: females &#x02265;80 cm and males &#x02265;90 cm, first degree FH of T2DM and raised BMI defined in subjects aged 5-18 yrs of a BMI value greater than internationally standardized age and sex specific percentile cutoffs and between 18-40 yrs as BMI &#x02265;23 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

Both instruments are calibrated weekly. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in meters. WC is measured using a graduated measuring tape (Seca France), calibrated weekly, with a locking device to the nearest 0.1 cm. WC is taken at the mid-point between the iliac crest and the last rib in expiration. Blood pressure is measured by automatic oscillometry from the non-dominant arm after 5 minutes rest with the mean of two measurements recorded (Riester Ri-Champion Riester, Jungingen, Germany). WHO approved growth charts for male and female children will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Fasting plasma glucose and a standard 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed in adults and glucose solution 1.75 g/kg body weight, to a maximal dose of 75 g is given to those below 16 years following a 12-hour fast as per WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Plasma Glucose, total cholesterol, high density density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and serum creatinine will be measured by enzymatic colorimetry (Vitros MS 250, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Johnson and Johnson, Co, Rochester USA). Fasting plasma insulin will be measured using radioimmunoassay (Immulite, Siemens, Surrey, UK), which has a sensitivity of 4 &#x003bc;U/ml (&#x0003c;24 pmol/l) and intra and interassay coefficients of variation &#x0003c;8%. Insulin resistance will be calculated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio will be measured by immunoturbidemtry (Vitros 5,1 FS Chemistry System, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Johnson and Johnson Company, Hampshire, United Kingdom) from an early morning urine sample. In subjects below 18 years the Schwartz equation will be used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and in subjects above 18 years the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation will be used to estimate GFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention and goals</title><p>Intensive LSM group: The main goals of the intensive group delivered three monthly on an individual basis are:</p><p>Dietary advice and support: individualised advice is given on the need to have a well balanced food intake and to maintain appropriate body weight in those with normal BMI and WC. In subjects with a raised (age and gender appropriate) BMI and WC a goal of &#x0003e;5% weight loss is set concordant to targets in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dietary advice on avoiding a high intake of food containing simple sugars, refined carbohydrates and high saturated fats (total fat intake &#x0003c;20 g/day) and advice to increase intake of healthy natural foods which are fibre-rich-whole grains, legumes, vegetables and fruits is given. A list of refined foods to be avoided is provided. Subjects are advised on the importance of regular meals and to avoid delaying or missing meals.</p><p>Exercise; Subjects with physical inactivity at baseline are advised to increase physical activity to at least 30 minutes of continuous exercise a day for more than 5 days of the week. Individualised exercise advice is given depending on the needs and facilities available to the subject. Children are advised on need to play at least for 1 hour every day. All subjects are advised to minimise sedentary activity such as watching television. For children, the LSM advice will be given to the parent and the child jointly. To ensure that the intervention does not hamper normal growth, assessment of the child's growth (height and weight) will be performed at each visit and these measures compared to the previous values on the child's growth chart; and if there is any medical and or parental concerns regarding growth, the child will be referred to a paediatrician for further evaluation and assessment.</p><p>The dietary and exercise goals are comparable to those set in the Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme (IDPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All subjects have a three monthly telephone contact to assess progress and reiterate goals. The total number of one to one contacts is 4 per year. The basis of LSM advice is made on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] which postulates that individuals are at different stages of readiness to adopt a new behaviour and that individuals are required to progress through various 'stages of change'. Evidence suggests that providing individualised interventions tailored to a subject's stage of behaviour change i.e. stage matched, as done in this study, are more effective than providing the same intervention to all subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Control group: Less intensive (annual) lifestyle advice: Identical dietary and exercise advice as outlined above are given to all subjects in the control group; however this is done on a 12 monthly basis. The goals and targets set for diet and exercise are identical to those in the intensive group but these are evaluated and reinforced annually in one individualised face to face contact session with an educator.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods and power calculation</title><p>Approximately 2300 subjects with &#x02265;2 risk-factors are required in each group (4600 subjects in total) to detect a 25% relative risk reduction at 5 years on the primary composite cardio-metabolic end-point of new onset T2DM, IGT, IFG, hypertension, albuminuria, renal and CVD events with intensive LSM. The study is powered at the 90% level with a type-1 error of 0.05 (2 sided) assuming a 15% incidence of the primary end-point in the control group and including allowance for 25% drop-out of subjects. The proposed 25% relative risk reduction of the composite outcome is derived from the effects of intensive LSM programme reducing the relative risk of new onset T2DM in South Asian IGT patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>There will be a pre-specified interim analysis of the composite primary and secondary endpoints at 2 years, as requested by one of the funding bodies (IDF BRIDGES).

We hope to show that a simple screening strategy based on self-reported physical inactivity, family history of T2DM in first degree relatives, as well as obesity and increased WC provides an efficient method for identifying a sample with a high frequency of cardio-metabolic risk. More recently the entity of metabolic syndrome as a disease syndrome has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However it is irrefutable that individual risk factors for CVD and T2DM cluster and inter-relate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore in its purest form, as we will report with the exclusion of those with known T2DM or CVD and with detailed description of the individual risk components, it is a pre-morbid condition that could be useful in developing country specific public health intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>This study will have the largest urban cohort below the age of 40 years in South Asia evaluated for cardio-metabolic risk. Our results will raise awareness of growing burden of T2DM and obesity in developing countries that is of major public health and economic importance and which requires urgent remedial actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The results of DIABRISK-SL will help advise and assist in the formulation of a national policy and guidance document for combating T2DM and associated non-communicable diseases in Sri Lanka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MW is the principle investigator (PI) for the DIABRISK-SL study and he is the trial coordinator in Sri Lanka.
