increase the pulmonary function of normal adults. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty normal
adults in their 20s were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=15) or a control
group (n=15). Over the course of four weeks, the experimental group participated in place
running exercise for 30 minutes five times per week. The control group only participated
in moto-med exercise for 30 minutes five times per week. Subjects were assessed pre- and
post-test by measuring the tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve
volume, and vital capacity. [Results] Our findings show significant improvements to vital
capacity in the experimental group. The experimental group had higher pulmonary function
than the control group. In the investigation of the differences between the intervention
group and the control group before and after the experiment, significant differences were
found for expiratory reserve volume and vital capacity. [Conclusion] Finally, the
experimental group showed a greater improvement in pulmonary function than the control
group, which indicates that place running exercises are effective at increasing the
pulmonary function of normal adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Cycle exercise</kwd><kwd>Place running exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Recently, air pollution, change of life style, and smoking have increased airway
resistance, which chronically progresses and increases breathing capacity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, emphysema and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), which hinders gas exchange in the lung, cause difficulties in
daily life due to perfusion effects arising from the excessive expansion of the thorax<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that pulmonary
function diminishes when muscles that contribute to respiratory function are weakened<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. When these muscles are weakened due to a
variety of causes, dyspnea can occur, and the ability to perform exercise can also be
affected. Therapeutic interventions, such as ventilator muscle training, are required to
reduce severe, hectic breathing patterns and strengthen respiratory muscle function to
ultimately enhance exercise tolerance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
While responding to patients&#x02019; weakened breathing efficiency and changed breathing
mechanisms, it is necessary to properly maintain expansion of the chest wall, ventilation,
lung capacity, and lung volume<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated the use of breathing exercises in diverse subject
groups, including one that applied feedback respiratory equipment to normal, healthy
individuals<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, one that implemented a
combination of diaphragm breathing exercises and pursed-lip breathing exercises among
patients with CNS<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and one that only
implemented pursed-lip breathing exercises among order<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A variety of breathing training methods was proven to increase
muscle strength and endurance, resulting in an increase of breathing function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle strength training that involves
resistance loads, such as running, cycling, and swimming, has been implemented as well as
respiratory muscle training that involves moving the upper and lower limbs for
endurance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>So far, most previous research has implemented exercises for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
while subjects are in a supine or sitting position. Yet, for patients who recover mobility
to a certain degree, cardiopulmonary exercises are commonly replaced by aerobic exercises.
Hence, it is necessary to develop a new combined exercise routine that mixes cardiopulmonary
and aerobic exercises for patients with cardiopulmonary disease that have a certain degree
of mobility. This study attempts to produce objective data that can be used as clinical
grounds for changes in breathing capability by implementing a place running exercise among
normal individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>For the subjects of this study, 30 normal individuals were selected from the college
students attending N university in Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do in Korea between December 1
and 31, 2016. The study subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group of 15
subjects and a control group of 15 subjects. The subjects were selected from those who had
no history of lung disease; who had no respiratory damage, such as congenital deformation of
the chest; and who had not received any treatments to improve pulmonary functions. The
subjects understood the purpose of this study and consented to participate in it. This study
was approved by the Clinical BioethicsCommittee at Korea Nazarene University (KNU IRB
16-1021-04), and it was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The general characteristics of both groups are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General participant characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.1 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.8 &#x000b1; 0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.7 &#x000b1; 4.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.6 &#x000b1; 6.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.5 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.6 &#x000b1; 7.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SD.

and each session consisted of 30 minutes of the place running exercise. The place running
exercise was implemented, which the subjects performed in the center of a square mark with a
size of 30&#x02005;cm by 30&#x02005;cm. Before the exercise, the subjects straightened their backs and
looked forward. They maintained the neutral position of the cervical vertebra and waist
pelvis by drawing their jaw close to the body. Then, they placed their feet approximately
10&#x02005;cm apart and lifted one knee to the height of the hip joint by bending it 90&#x000b0;. They bent
the elbow opposite to the lifted leg by 90&#x000b0; and lifted the tip of that hand to eye height.
The subjects then jumped while lifting each arm and leg on opposite sides along the sagittal
plane and kept jumping for a predetermined number of times. During the exercise, the
subjects carefully maintained their constant posture inside the restricted space. Each
session consisting of 20 jumps in one place with a 30-second resting time between each
session was implemented for 30 minutes.</p><p>In the control group, each participant performed a cycling exercise using MOTOmed
(RECK-Technik GmbH &#x00026; Co., Betzenweiler, Germany), which allowed for regular and
repetitive training without affecting respiration. The strength of the training was
controlled so that the heart rate of the participants did not exceed 20% of the heart rate
reserve<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Measurements were conducted
in the sitting position using a Fit Mate (COSMED Srl., Italy), which is a measuring
instrument for pulmonary function tests. To ensure accuracy, explanations and demonstrations
of the procedures were given prior to the measurements. The experimental and control groups
were instructed to use a mouthpiece, and the subjects&#x02019; noses were closed during the
measurement so that air could not be inhaled or exhaled through the nose. Beginning from
expiration, the subject was instructed to breathe out slowly and completely and then to
breathe in slowly when the tester gave the signal. The values of tidal volume (TV),
inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and vital capacity (VC)
were measured. The measurements were conducted three times both before and after the
experiment, and the average values of the three measured values were used in the analysis. A
resting time of five minutes was given after each measurement<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, SPSS ver. 12.0 was used to examine the general characteristics of the
subjects and to obtain the means and standard deviations of individual groups. A paired
sample t-test was used to compare pulmonary functions before and after the intervention, and
the exercise and independent sample t-test was used to examine the differences between the
measurements taken before and after the experiment between the groups. The statistical
significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Here, we review the comparison of vital capacities before and after the intervention

running exercise in the experimental group and a moto-med exercise only in the control
group. To investigate the effects of these exercises on the pulmonary function of normal
individuals in their 20s, we compared the results of both groups. In breathing
rehabilitation programs, muscle strength training often uses equipment or has restrictions
on space restrictions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, to design
training that improves pulmonary function without such restrictions, we implemented
breathing exercises while the subjects were in place running exercises. The number of
repetitions, the duration of the exercise, and the length of rest time should be considered
to minimize the subjects&#x02019; muscle fatigue and increase their muscle strength efficiently<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that interventions are effective
only when implemented for at least 20&#x02013;30 minutes, 2&#x02013;5 times per week for 4&#x02013;12weeks, in this
study, the interventions were conducted for 30 minutes, 5 times per week for 4 weeks<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pulmonary function tests were conducted after four weeks of intervention. The experimental
group showed a significant increase in VC after the intervention compared to the
measurements taken prior to the intervention, but they did not show significant increases in
TV, ERV, or IRV. The control group showed no significant increase in any of the measured
items. In the examination of pre- and post-test changes in the experimental and control
groups, although the experimental group showed greater increases than the control group in
all measurements, the differences were significant only for ERV and VC. In the experimental
group, ERV and IRV was a slight improvement. We believe the active and powerful place
running exercise not only directly increased the activity of respiratory muscles and
strengthened the overall cardiopulmonary function, but it also improved breathing capability
through the deep breathing activity.</p><p>In a study conducted by Enright et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, normal people who had undergone high frequency inspiratory muscle
training registered significant increases in breathing capacity, total breathing capacity,
inspiratory muscle strength, and inspiratory endurance. Normal people group which performed
diaphragm respiration exercises showed a greater improvement in pulmonary function compared
with the control group<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study
conducted by Townsend<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, normal people
who had undergone respiration training exhibited large differences between the resultant
inspiratory volumes and expiratory volumes. In previous studies, pulmonary functions have
been improved by diverse exercises aimed at improving the respiratory activities of patients
with a variety of diseases. The use of PNF breathing and place running exercises showed
similar effects to those of direct breathing exercises for normal individuals.</p><p>This study has limitations in that the sample consists of healthy subjects who have normal
functional activity instead of those with cardiopulmonary disease. Nevertheless, we believe
that this study provided objective data that can be that can be applied to patients with
cardiopulmonary disease in the future.</p><p>Finally, despite the limitation that basic professional therapy methods have not been
popularized or standardized in heart and cardiac pulmonary rehabilitation centers in Korea,
physiotherapy that specializes in breathing is already wide spread in Western developed
countries. We believe that there will be more opportunities to implement effective breathing
interventions among patients with cardiopulmonary disease if the physiotherapy interventions
for breathing gradually advance and gain popularity in Korea in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">American Thoracic Society:
