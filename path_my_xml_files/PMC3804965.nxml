stroke patients&#x02019; upper limb function. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 33 chronic
stroke patients who were randomly assigned to four groups. The action observation group (5
males, 3 females) watched a video of the task, the action practice group (5 males, 4
females) performed the action, the combined action observation-action practice group (5
males, 4 females) watched the video of the task and practiced the action, and the control
group (4 males, 3 females) did not perform either action observation or action practice.
The video used in the action observational physical training comprised a scene of an adult
male picking up a cup, bringing it to his mouth in order to touch his mouth, and then
returning the cup to its initial position. [Results] Improvements in drinking behavior
functions were observed immediately after the experiment and one week later. After the
intervention, the number of drinking motions had increased the most in the combination
group. One week after the experiment, there were increases in the action observation,
action training, and combination groups. [Conclusion] A combination of action observation
and action training is the most effective treatment method, and action training is a
desirable second to combined therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Action observation</kwd><kwd>Drinking behavior training</kwd><kwd>Upper limb function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>For patients such as those who have had a stroke or sustained a brain injury,
rehabilitation conducted by a multidisciplinary team is effective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, it was
suggested that motor imagery practice may be effective at enhancing motor performance in
sport and of patients who have had a stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the purpose of rehabilitation is to recover motor skills that
have previously been learned rather than learning new skills, motor imitation is frequently
used for motor recovery in rehabilitation. Motor imitation is a cognitive process, which
involves wide neural networks, and includes action observation, motor imagery, and motor
execution as sub-processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor imagery
refers to the process of obtaining indirect experiences of motor sensation by imagining the
act of performance in the mind<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Action
observation is a learning method using the visual and auditory effects of activities
performed by others. It can be said to be a cognitive intervention technique for sportsmen
or ordinary persons which can be used to enhance motor skill and motor learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of mirror neurons, which are
known to be activated during action observation or motor imagery, the same neural circuit
that is activated during voluntary performance of an action is triggered when observing
actions performed by other individuals. Therefore, motor imagery and action observation can
be said to be useful for stroke patients who cannot voluntarily perform actions, since these
methods can lead to the recovery of their damaged functions.</p><p>Mirror neurons are a particular class of visuomotor neurons. In order to be triggered by
visual stimuli, mirror neurons require an interaction between a biological effector such as
the hand or mouth and an object, which initiate interactions between biological effectors
and the object. In terms of mirror neurons, effective observed and executed actions
correspond to goals (e.g., grasping) and the means for reaching those goals (e.g., precision
grip), respectively. The visual stimuli effective in triggering the neurons, indicate there
are two classes of mouth mirror neurons: ingestive and communicative mirror neurons.
Ingestive mirror neurons respond to the observation of actions related to ingestive
functions, such as grasping food with the mouth, breaking it, or sucking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Action practice is a conservative therapeutic method and requires the repeated practice of
the same action many times. The upper extremities serve many functions in daily life.
Therefore, if a person has functional disorders in the upper extremities due to stroke, it
is important that those be dealt with and efforts are made to recover the relevant
functions. In particular, the drinking action&#x02014;to stretch a hand to pick up a cup and bring
it to the mouth&#x02014;is similar to the eating action, and is the most essential action as humans
do it frequently in daily life. The understanding and re-learning of this action are
important for those who have upper extremity functional disorder, as its use provides
independence and nutrition in daily life. Therefore, in the present study, drinking behavior
training was conducted for stroke patients using action observation and action practice
using the mirror neuron system. Using the results of the study, the effects of action
observation and action practice were compared with other approaches to the treatment of
stroke patients&#x02019; upper extremities, and their possible uses in rehabilitation therapy are
discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of the present study were 33 chronic stroke patients who were hospitalized and
treated in Daejon, Korea. They had stroke at least six months earlier and were assessed as
having recovered to Brunnstrom stage 5. Pursuant to the Helsinki Declaration, the procedure
and purpose of the present study were explained to the prospective subjects and their family
members, and only those who voluntarily agreed to participate in the study became the
subjects of the present study. The subjects were those who scored at least 20 points in the
Korean Mini-Mental Status examination, were able to understand and perform instructions, and
had visual acuity that was sufficient for watching videos. Since most Koreans&#x02019; dominant hand
is the right hand, only right hemiplegic patients were selected. The study period was from
November 2011 to March 2012, and the subjects were trained for 10 minutes per day for three
weeks (i.e., 15 days in total) using the training methods of their respective groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients selected as the subjects were
randomly assigned to four groups. The first group was an action observation group (5 males,
3 females, mean age: 63&#x000b1;3.7&#x02005;years, mean height: 162&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;cm) that watched a task video made
to fit the purpose of the experiment. The second group was an action practice group (5
males, 4 females, mean age: 62&#x000b1;1.5&#x02005;years, mean height: 160&#x000b1;5.3&#x02005;cm) that repeatedly practiced
the actions performed during the preliminary test for 10 minutes. The third group was a
combined action observation and action practice group (5 males, 4 females, mean age:
61&#x000b1;2.3&#x02005;years, mean height: 161&#x000b1;3.7&#x02005;cm) that watched the task video for five minutes and
practiced the actions for five minutes. The fourth group was a control group (4 males, 3
females, mean age: 60&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;years, mean height: 159&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;cm) that neither watched the video nor
practiced the actions.</p><p>The study task used in the present experiment was the action of stretching out the right
hand to pick up a cup, bringing the cup to the mouth in order to touch the mouth, and then
returning the cup to its initial position. The video used in the action observational
physical training comprised a scene of an adult male picking up a cup, bringing it to his
mouth in order to touch his mouth, and then returning the cup to its initial position. The
video was taken from the front of the model. The cup used in the video scene was an empty
paper cup without any handle. The position of the cup was 5&#x02005;cm away from the edge of the
table at the side where the patient was sitting and 45&#x000b0; from the affected hand. The action
observation group watched the video of the task on a large screen for 10 minutes in a quiet
room. The subjects were instructed to observe the action 20 times in 10 minutes. They were
instructed to imagine they were performing the same task as that performed by the model at
the same time as they watched the video. An oral instruction, &#x0201c;Please imagine that you the
activities are identically copying&#x0201d;, was given every time the motions started and again
after one set of the motions had been completed so that the subjects would concentrate on
the video. The action practice group performed the action of picking up an empty cup,
bringing it to their mouths in order to touch their mouths, and then returning the cup to
its original position repeatedly for 10 minutes as instructed by the therapist, without
watching the video. The combined action observation&#x02013;action practice group observed the task
video for five minutes and practiced the action for five minutes. The control group did not
perform either action observation or action practice, or any task-related activities during
the training period. However, this group was assessed for their performance of the task in
the same way as the other groups.</p><p>The assessment was performed three times: before the intervention, immediately after the
completion of the intervention, and one week later. In the assessment, the number of times
the full drinking action was performed in one minute was measured. Only complete actions
within the measuring time were counted, and those that were not completed were excluded from
the measurement. The position and shape of the cup used in the experiment were the same as
those presented in the video. Before the experiment, the physical therapist sufficiently
explained the details and methods of the task to be performed to the study subjects,
elucidating basic postures, technical details, and matters to be noted for the performance
of the drinking action. The action was then demonstrated two times. The physical therapist
performed the assessments one subject at a time, in an independent space. The physical
therapist who conducted the assessments did not have any information about the experimental
group of the subjects.</p><p>We employed SPSS 19.0 for data analysis examining the effects of action observation on the
task performance of drinking. A repeated one-way analysis of variance was conducted in order
to compare the number of drinking motions among the groups. Mauchly&#x02019;s sphericity hypothesis
was not satisfied; therefore, a modified version of the Greenhouse-Geisser degree of freedom
correction was used in the analysis. For significant differences, a posthoc test was
performed with the Bonferroni method. To test the statistical significance, the significance
level was chosen as &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Number of drinking motions by each group in each period (unit: time)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After**<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After one week**<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.1&#x000b1;2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.6&#x000b1;2.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.1&#x000b1;2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Action observation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.1&#x000b1;2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1&#x000b1;4.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Combination</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1&#x000b1;3.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1&#x000b1;1.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1&#x000b1;5.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Action training </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.0&#x000b1;4.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.3&#x000b1;3.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1&#x000b1;3.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>**p &#x0003c;0.01, <sup>&#x02020;</sup>Before experiment &#x02212; After experiment: p &#x0003c; 0.01,

According to the comparison of the combined group with the other groups, the increase in the

training on stroke patients&#x02019; drinking behavior as a proxy of upper limb function. According
to our results, the drinking behavior function of the action observance, combination, and
action training groups improved compared to the control group. The result was maintained in
the delayed post-test, suggesting maintenance of the improvement. The action observation
group&#x02019;s drinking behavior function improved, a result similar to those of the combination
and the action training groups. It can therefore be surmised that action observation through
the activation of the mirror neurons produces effects analogous to actual action training.
The number of drinking behavior motions was maintained in the delayed post-test, suggesting
that action observation in the learning stage may promote stroke patients&#x02019; motor function
learning. In this study, the combination group&#x02019;s drinking behavior functions were better
than those of the action training and action observation groups, and the action training
group&#x02019;s number of drinking behavior motions increased more than those of the action
observation group after the experiment and one week after the experiment, though not
significantly.</p><p>The results of the present study are similar to those of Kim<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In that study, mentally retarded middle-school girls obtained high
scores for golf putting in the delayed post test after a combined therapy of action
observation and action practice. Lee et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that learning through actual performance resulted in
somatic sense learning, and concluded that it is the best learning method. It was further
observed that under circumstances when no actual performance was possible, action
observation had similar effects to actual performance. The results of Sakamoto et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> support the results of the present study
in that a combination of action observation and action training enhanced corticospinal
excitability. In a motor-evoked potential test of stroke patients&#x02019; hand functions,
motor-evoked potential after action observation and action training was high, which again
agrees with the results of the present study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, a combination of action observation and action training was the most
effective treatment method, and action training was a desirable second to combined therapy.
In circumstances where no actual performance is possible, action observation has similar
effects to actual performance. In the event that stroke patients can actually perform
motions, the most effective method of rehabilitation treatment would be to induce the
activation of mirror neurons through action observation and have them practice the motions.
In order to generalize the results of the present study, future research should enroll a
larger number of subjects, and should consider the time needed for action observation and
the degree of changes according to the onset time. In the planning of physical therapy and
occupational therapy training, the application of a combined therapy of action observation
and action practice is necessary. For those patients who cannot actually perform motions, an
action observation program needs to be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">British Society of
