Undernutrition is prevalent in regions where women are at high risk of malaria in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This coexistence of undernutrition and malaria markedly increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, such as intrauterine growth restriction, compared to malaria or undernutrition alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The complex relationship between malaria and nutrition has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but understanding of its mechanisms remains limited. Malaria in pregnancy predisposes women to anaemia, and may result in reduced nutrient intake due to febrile illness and anorexia. Malaria also increases susceptibility to other infections through its immunosuppressive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], whilst on the other hand both macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies may increase the risk of infections including malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This increased susceptibility is believed to be due to impairment of host immune defences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] such as abnormalities in complement activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and impaired cell mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] leading to reduced antibody production.</p><p>In endemic regions, pregnant women naturally acquire antibodies to malaria with repeated exposure to infectious mosquito bites prior to and during pregnancy. During first pregnancies, women frequently acquire antibodies to the pregnancy-specific antigens, primarily to VAR2CSA of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein-1 family of variant surface antigens (VSA). These antibodies help protect women against adverse clinical outcomes in subsequent pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, undernourished women may have difficulty effectively maintaining or acquiring antibodies against malaria antigens.</p><p>In non-malaria-related studies both macro- and micronutrient supplementation have been shown to significantly improve pregnancy outcomes and maternal health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) are multiple micronutrient-fortified lipid-rich products that can be beneficial as prenatal supplements in vulnerable groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Prenatal LNS has been shown to improve birth length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and reduce weight loss in HIV-infected mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and in young HIV-exposed infants LNS is suitable as a breast milk replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, LNS may improve linear growth outcomes in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The only study to date that has assessed the effects of maternal nutrient supplementation on malaria antibody levels reported that vitamin A prenatal supplements were associated with a reduction in antibody responses to a placental-binding isolate EJ-24, but no significant changes in antibody responses to non-pregnancy related parasite isolates were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In areas with food insecurity and high malaria transmission, nutritional supplements could improve pregnancy outcomes and may also lead to stronger acquired immune responses to malaria. To investigate this, antibody immunity was measured to antigens expressed by placental-binding and non-placental-binding parasite isolates, merozoite antigens and schizont extract in pregnant women from Mangochi, Malawi enrolled in a randomized controlled trial receiving daily LNS, multiple micronutrients (MMN - multi vitamin and minerals combined supplement) or iron and folic acid supplements (IFA &#x02013; 60 mg of iron and 400 &#x003bc;g of folic acid). The primary aim was to determine whether LNS supplementation improved antibody responses to malaria in pregnancy compared to IFA or MMN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p>From February 2011, 1391 pregnant women attending four antenatal clinics in Mangochi District, Malawi were recruited to a single-blinded randomized controlled trial of nutrient supplementation to improve pregnancy outcomes and child development (registration ID: NCT01239693 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Mangochi District experiences holoendemic malaria transmission and a high prevalence of stunting (low height-for-age Z-score) and low weight-for-age among infants. Women &#x0003c;20 gestation weeks (gw) pregnant by ultrasound dating, aged &#x0003e;15 years of age and without any chronic health conditions were enrolled in the study following informed consent.

Parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) were counted microscopically against 200 leucocytes under 100 X magnification. PCR was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots using Chelex&#x000ae;100 (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and a quantitative real-time PCR assay was performed to amplify the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lactate dehydrogenase (<italic>pfldh</italic>) gene. The samples were assayed in duplicate using a Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR detection system. Concentration of PfLDH was estimated using standard curves computed from amplification curves of a series of 10 g DNA extracts of parasite line 3D7 that were included in each assay. RDT was performed using Clearview&#x000ae; Malaria Combo (British Biocell International Ltd., Dundee, UK) which detects the proteins PfLDH and histidine-rich protein 2.

The plates were washed with PBS/Tween 20 and non-specific binding blocked with 0.1% casein on the following day. The plates were then incubated with participant sera diluted at 1:1,000 in 0.1% casein and assayed in triplicates. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Life technologies, Australia) was used at 1:2,000 dilution to detect antigen-bound IgG. The fluorescence intensity (FI) of each well, which is proportional to the amount of IgG bound, was measured using BMG POLARstar Omega fluorimeter (BMG Labtech, Germany) in the 485&#x02013;1 excitation and 520 emission spectra range.</p><p>Plasmas collected at enrolment and at 36 gw from 150 participants (50 from each supplementation group) were chosen by selecting alternate pairs of samples from 4 boxes containing equal numbers of samples from the three supplementation arms, blind to participant clinical data.

Ingestion of LNS was not associated with significant increases in malaria antibody levels, a faster rate of change of antibody levels from enrolment to 36 weeks, or likelihood of seropositivity to malaria antigens. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between nutrient supplementation and malaria immunity in detail.</p><p>Antibodies were measured against VSA expressed by a placental-binding and non-placental-binding parasite isolate, merozoite antigens and schizont extract. Antibodies to placental-binding VSA reduced the risk of placental malaria by inhibiting cytoadhesion to receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and by promoting their phagocytic clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Antibodies to merozoite antigens can prevent invasion of pRBCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] inhibit intra-erythrocytic development and opsonize merozoites for phagocytic clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] contributing to the protection against clinical malaria.</p><p>A strong increase in both total and opsonizing antibodies to placental-binding VSA from study entry to 36 weeks was observed while antibodies to merozoite anti6gens and non-placental-binding isolates declined. Several explanations are possible. First, most parasite isolates infecting pregnant women express antigens that are unique and are exclusively expressed during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Antibodies induced against such antigens may have a longer half-life than those directed against merozoite antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Second, reduction in total plasma IgG at 36 weeks suggests haemodilution may have an impact on antibody levels to non-placental-binding malaria antigens; however, antibodies to tetanus and measles show very little decline during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] suggesting haemodilution is not always a significant factor. Third, antibodies to antigens expressed by a placental-binding isolate appear to be maintained from previous pregnancies, and the majority of women in the cohort were multigravidae with high levels of these antibodies at study entry; exposure to new infections might rapidly boost antibody responses. By contrast, antibodies to merozoite antigens have been reported to fluctuate markedly with exposure during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Of note, all participants received repeated doses of SP; parasite resistance to this agent in Malawi is common, but not high-grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Parasites with SP resistance demonstrate mutations in the genes encoding <italic>P. falciparum</italic> dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate (DHPS). In Malawian pregnant women quintuple mutations of DHFR and DHPS are highly prevalent, however the prevalence of more severe sextuple mutant DHPS 581 which is associated with increased placental inflammation is uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>The type of supplementation had no strong or consistent influence on malaria antibody levels, however a regression analysis showed a decline in antibody responses to MSP-2 and PfRh2 from enrolment to 36 weeks, and an increased rate of reduction in antibody levels to MSP-2, in women who received LNS compared to MMN. Given the large number of comparisons reported, these differences in the adjusted models could be due to chance. Similar differences in other anti-merozoite antibodies were not observed, and the significance of the changes is unknown. The current study also reported the effects of nutrient supplementation on antibody responses in subsets of women at high risk of undernutrition and infection; those with poor nutritional status and low SES. A negative relationship was observed between malaria antibody levels and maternal BMI and SES. Overall, women with a low BMI at study entry had higher antibody levels to VSA than did women with normal or increased BMI. Supplementation type did not influence the relationship between antibody responses and BMI. Of all the antibody types being tested the opsonizing antibodies to VSA were the most strongly related to BMI and SES in the current cohort, suggesting that these women might be exposed to more malaria (Nkhoma M <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished work) during the current pregnancy, thereby eliciting pregnancy-specific immunity. Poorer women could have more exposure to malaria due to poor housing that allows entry of mosquitoes, and they may be less likely to own insecticide-treated bed nets. In addition poverty could lead to poor nutrient intake due to inability to afford food especially during the hunger season.</p><p>The study had several limitations. The timing of nutritional interventions may be critical; supplementation starting prior to conception and continuing through out pregnancy and lactation may offer more benefits. In the current study the intervention started on average at 16.5 gw, following malaria peak prevalence, at around 12-17gw. Therefore the maximal benefits of the supplementation on malaria antibody acquisition may have been missed. Primigravidae constituted only 20% of participants, limiting our ability to examine acquisition of pregnancy-specific immunity in this group. Samples were missing for 382 of 1,391 women enrolled. Potential causes include failure to attend the 36-week visit, or pre-term deliveries (prior to 37 weeks). In addition unavailability of participant data for some of the covariates may have reduced the power of the multiple regression analyses. For analysis of BMI and malaria immunity, stratification of participants reduced the study power: for instance only 57 pregnant women were in the low BMI group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall the current study concluded that nutrient supplementation of pregnant women was not associated with broad changes in antibody responses to malaria. This study is the first to investigate interactions between nutrition and malaria immunity in pregnancy and further studies must be conducted to determine the role of nutrient supplementation on other components of host immune system such as cell-mediated immunity, to determine the overall influence of nutrient supplementation on malaria susceptibility and malaria immunity.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2015_707_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
