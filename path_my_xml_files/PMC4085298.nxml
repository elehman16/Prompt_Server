The present study was a prospective and interventional study. The study period was from July 2007 to June 2008. Before enrolling study participants, priori analysis was performed to determine sample size as follows: disability with intervention =25%, disability with control =30%, alpha =5%, beta =50%, two-sided analysis, 10% extra data for possible follow-up loss, and estimated sample size in each group =475.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria were 1) community-dwelling age 65 years or older; 2) hospital admission to the general medicine floor under hospitalist service for principal diagnosis of heart failure (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification: 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.03, 404.11, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93, and 428.0&#x02013;428.9); 3) hospital length of stay (LOS) 3 days or longer (required to meet the 3-day inpatient rule to receive post-acute care at an SNF for 20 days without copayment under Medicare Part A);<xref rid="b21-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and 4) physical functional decline from 2 weeks prior to hospital admission, as indicated by changes in activities of daily living (ADL) from Stage 0 at pre-hospital admission to ADL Stage I at hospital admission. ADL stage has been validated and used as a well-established functional hierarchy tool.<xref rid="b22-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> ADL Stage 0 refers to the most independent, and Stage IV refers to the most dependent. A total of 1,275 participants were eligible for enrollment. Participants were excluded when they declined study participation (n=104) or had either coexisting acute myocardial infarction or isolation precaution (n=39). The number of study participants between the intervention and control groups was 1,132. The number of allocated participants was 543 in the intervention and 589 in the control group. Due to incomplete data, 49 and 42 participants were withdrawn from the intervention and control groups, respectively. In the intervention group, 21 participants were lost due to in-hospital death (n=8) or referral to another hospital (n=13). In the control group, 72 participants were lost due to in-hospital death (n=8), referral to another hospital (n=8), or contamination from control to intervention group due to required urgent intervention (n=56). The final number of analyzed participants was 473 in the intervention group and 475 in the control group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jmdh-7-259">Figure 1</xref> outlines the flow chart of sample enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis based on the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) statement.<xref rid="b24-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The study was approved by the institutional review board (equivalent to ethics committee) at Cleveland Clinic Health System.

A control was composed of physical therapy &#x02265;0.5 hour/day only. Study participants in both intervention and control groups received physical therapy for at least 3 days. We examined the hospital LOS across the sum of physical therapy hours.<xref rid="b8-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b25-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> For example, we divided the sum of the physical therapy hours by the LOS. Physical therapy had specific modalities of ambulation (with or without device), muscle strengthening, gait transfer, and obstacle negotiation. The physical therapist was not aware of group allocation.</p><p>An SSA intervention was designed to enhance interpersonal communication among health care providers. Multidisciplinary meetings were held at the conference rooms of the general medicine floors during weekdays (Monday through Friday). Attendees of the SSA meetings were not aware of the group assignment and collaborated on assessment and management of diet compliance (sodium and fluid restrictions), medication compliance, and resource utilization compliance (clinic or home care visit), where they were updated on each health professional&#x02019;s opinions and shared approaches to solving problems in complicated situations. Attendees of the SSA meetings also discussed the progress of physical therapy and were able to modify specific therapy modality, duration, frequency, and intensity. All patients were discussed at these meetings, and the average time for each patient was approximately 2 minutes. All disciplinary health care professionals (physicians, nurses, case managers, social workers, physical therapists, speech/language therapists, pharmacists, and dietitians) were responsible for attending these meetings.</p><p>The study coordinator, who did not participate in patient care, randomly assigned patients to the intervention group using medical record number finishing either 1 or 5 when patients were admitted to hospital. The study coordinator derived control group participants using matching covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Group [APR-DRG] classification, cognitive impairment, and Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]) with the intervention group. When SSA meetings were necessary for the control group, we regarded contamination and excluded the participant from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes: 1) disability, 2) transition to an SNF, and 3) 30-day hospital readmission rate</title><p>Hospital nursing staff examined physical function using ADL stage at three different times (pre-admission, hospital admission, and hospital discharge). Disability was defined as ADL Stage I&#x02013;IV at the date of hospital discharge. Transition to SNF was defined as patient discharge to post-acute care settings (either SNF or inpatient rehabilitation facility). Referral to a facility where rehabilitation was not the primary purpose, such as a psychiatric facility, hospice, assisted-living facility, or adult foster home, was not considered as a transition to SNF. Thirty-day hospital readmission rate was defined as hospital readmission for heart failure within 30 days since hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Covariates</title><p>Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, severity of illness, cognitive impairment, and CCI.

In fact, a review of approaches to reduce this excessive utilization is urgently required.<xref rid="b37-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Reducing transition to SNFs through SSA intervention may shed light on reductions in Medicare expenditures related to older persons&#x02019; post-acute care.</p><p>Strategies of diet-control, medication adherence, and appropriate resource utilization are universally provided for older persons with heart failure at any acute care hospitals.<xref rid="b37-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The benefits of SSA intervention in this study can apply to innovations in health care processes, transforming fragmented to integrative care, during the management of the care of these hospitalized older adults with heart failure. SSA interventions through securing and maintaining the benefits of physical therapy after hospital care can improve functional outcomes, as suggested by health outcome assessment experts.<xref rid="b38-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Heart failure&#x02019;s 30-day readmission rate of the Medicare population has increased (known as the &#x0201c;revolving door&#x0201d; effect) over the recent decade due to a decreasing trend of hospital LOS.<xref rid="b17-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Heart failure is the most common cause of hospital care in the Medicare population. Medicare attempts to reduce the 30-day readmission rate of heart failure.<xref rid="b39-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> No effect of SSA intervention on 30-day readmission rate can be interpreted that early hospital admission for heart failure may be more closely related to post-hospital care such as early clinic or home visit care. Post-hospital care, recent changes in medications, and care instructions may raise barriers to older adults with complex comorbidity, lack of transportation, and cognitive decline. Future research should compare the effects of SSA interventions (hospital and post-hospital care) on early readmission rate of older adults with heart failure.</p><p>Despite these important findings, our study has certain limitations. The first limitation is that in determining physical therapy intensity, we relied on the sum of physical therapy hours divided by hospital LOS. This method may not have entirely reflected the effects of the actual rehabilitation program. However, Jette et al<xref rid="b40-jmdh-7-259" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> observed that there was no clear pattern in rehabilitation therapy for specific diagnoses among patients receiving acute care in hospitals and that, eventually, the fundamental goal of rehabilitation therapy is functional recovery. Second, limited demographics in this study (older adults, predominant female, and metropolitan area in the Unites States) may not represent the outcomes of the whole heart-failure population. Third, we did not analyze the effects of SSA intervention on hospital revenues. Further analysis should determine whether SSA intervention would save more unnecessary costs of SNF utilizations or whether hospital revenue would shrink more if personnel attended SSA intervention meetings. Therefore, our analysis is preliminary until further, more representative, data are analyzed to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SSA intervention enhanced the benefits of physical therapy for functionally declining older adults.
