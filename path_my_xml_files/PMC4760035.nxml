All these studies have shown that the perineural dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to local anesthetics for peripheral nerve blocks can prolong the duration of the blockade and postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no previous study examined the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine 0.5% during femoral-sciatic nerve blocks.</p><p>We hypothesized that adding of dexmedetomidine 100 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine 0.5%, would lengthen the time to the first request for postoperative analgesia, shorten sensory and motor block onset time, and increases the duration of sensory and motor blockade. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study aimed to investigate the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine 0.5% on the onset and duration of femoral-sciatic nerve block, as well as its effect in prolonging postoperative analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining the approval of the Ethical Committee and a written informed patients&#x02019; consent, 60 patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or III, who were scheduled for below knee surgery under combined femoral-sciatic block, were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled double-blind study.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they have significant cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, neuromuscular, or psychiatric disorders, coagulopathy. Pregnant women, patients with body mass index &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, those receiving adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists, anticoagulants, antiplatelets other than acetylsalicylic acid, patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study medications, and those who refused to participate in the study, were also excluded.</p><p>Standard anesthesia monitors including a three-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive blood pressure were attached, and baseline measurements were recorded. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 1-2 L/min. Intravenous (IV) access was achieved using 20 gauges cannula. Patients were given 1-2 mg of midazolam IV as a premedication 10-15 min before the start of the block in addition to 50 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl prior to block needle insertion.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated using the closed envelope method into two groups (30 patients each): In group BD, bupivacaine-dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) one mL, containing100 &#x003bc;g, was added to 39 mL of bupivacaine 0.5%. In group B; 1 mL of normal saline was added to the same volume of bupivacaine 0.5%. In both groups, the 40 mL of the mixture was used for both femoral and sciatic block. The study solutions looked identically and were prepared by an anesthesiologist who did not participate in the study.</p><p>Patients were placed in the supine position, with the operative lower limb in the neutral position. After skin disinfection with povidone iodine and sterile drapes were applied. A lubricated high-frequency, 8-12 MHz, straight array ultrasound (US) probe covered with a sterile plastic sheath of Sonoscape A5 portable US machine (Guangdong, China) was placed perpendicular to the skin just beneath the inguinal crease to identify the femoral artery, using a two-dimensional ultrasonographic scanning. The femoral nerve was visualized as a hyperechoic structure, 1-2 cm lateral to the femoral artery. Infiltration with 3 mL of lidocaine 1% was performed at the needle insertion site. A short bevel 40 mm, 21 gauges insulated nerve block needle (Stimuplex A, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany), was inserted parallel and in line (in the plane) with the US transducer probe. The needle was advanced slowly until it approached the femoral nerve under the US guidance. After a negative aspiration of blood, 15 mL of the prepared study solutions were deposited around the femoral nerve according to group assignment by an anesthesiologist who was unaware of the nature of study drug solution. The satisfactory spread of the drug around the brachial plexus was observed sonologically in real time.</p><p>Patients were, then, positioned in the lateral decubitus, with the operative side uppermost with flexed hip and knee. The lateral prominence of the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity were identified with palpation, and a line was drawn between them. After skin disinfection with povidone iodine and sterile drapes were applied, a lubricated low-frequency, 5-2 MHz, curved array US probe covered with a sterile plastic sheath was used to scan the sciatic nerve at depth between 6 and 8 cm. The &#x0201c;subgluteal space&#x0201d; appeared as a hypoechoic line between the gluteus maximus and the quadratus femoris muscles. At this level, the sciatic nerve was seen as a hyperechoic triangle with an approximate diameter of 1.5-2 cm within the subgluteal line. A short bevel 100 mm, 21 gauges insulated nerve block needle (Stimuplex A, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) was inserted parallel and in line (in the plane) with the US transducer. The needle was advanced slowly until it became close to the sciatic nerve under the US guidance, after a negative aspiration of blood, 25 mL of the study solutions were deposited around the sciatic nerve in real time, according to the group assignment.</p><p>An independent third investigator who was not involved in patient's care collected outcome data. The primary outcome was the duration of postoperative analgesia. Secondary outcomes included; the onset and duration of both sensory and motor blockade, postoperative analgesic requirements, and evidence of any adverse drug reactions.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by pinprick using a 23 gauge needle across the dermatomal areas innervated with the common peroneal and tibial nerves (namely; lateral aspect of the leg and plantar aspect of the foot) and femoral nerve (namely; anterior aspect of the thigh at the level of the patella and medial part of the leg for saphenous distribution). Sensory blockade was assessed using a 3-points numerical rating scale: 0 = sharp pin felt (normal sensation), 1 = dull sensation felt that is, loss of sensation to pinprick only (analgesia), 2 = no sensation felt that is, loss of sensation of pain and touch (anesthesia).</p><p>Motor blockade was assessed across the distributions of the common peroneal and tibial nerves through assessing the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot, respectively, against a manual resistance. The femoral nerve motor block was assessed by the ability to elevate the leg outside the bed or to extend the leg at the knee while the hip is semi-flexed. The degree of motor blockade was assessed using a 3-points numerical scale: 0 = normal motor function, 1 = reduced motor strength, but with reserved perceptible movement, 2 = complete motor block.</p><p>Sensory onset time was defined as the time interval between the end of study solution administration (T0) and a loss of sensation to pinprick (Grade 1) along the distribution of any of either femoral or sciatic nerves. Motor onset time was defined as the time interval between the T0 and a reduced motor strength (Grade 1) either at knee or ankle levels. Time to surgical anesthesia was defined was defined as the onset time for readiness for surgical procedures that represent by the time interval between the T0 and the complete sensory blockade at the distribution of both of sciatic and femoral nerves with inability to move the ankle and toes of the operated leg (Grade 2).</p><p>Patients who did not achieve a complete block through the two nerves, defined as Grade 2 sensory and motor blocks, within 30 min were excluded from the study.</p><p>Hemodynamics parameters including heart rate (HR), systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), and diastolic arterial blood pressure (DAP) were recorded at 0 (baseline), 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after completion of the blockade.</p><p>Intraoperative complications including hypotension (defined as a 20% decrease below the baseline value), bradycardia (defined as HR lower than 50 bpm), hypoxemia (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] &#x0003c;90%), or nausea and vomiting were recorded. Any side effects relate dexmedetomidine such as bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia were recorded. Furthermore, any evidence of clinical criteria suggesting local anesthetic toxicity (lightheadedness, dizziness, tinnitus, disorientation, drowsiness, generalized muscle twitching, and convulsions) was recorded.</p><p>Durations of sensory and motor blockades were defined as the time interval between the T0 and the complete resolution of either sensory or motor blockades (Grade 0) across the distribution of the two blocked nerves, respectively.</p><p>Postoperative analgesia was accomplished with 6 hourly interval IV paracetamol 1 g irrespective of pain status, starting after arrival to the ward. Rescue analgesia (tramadol 100 mg) was administered when patients report visual analog pain scales score &#x02265;4. The time between the end of local anesthetic administration T0 and the first analgesic request was recorded as the duration of the analgesia. Furthermore, the total amount of tramadol consumed during the postoperative 24 h was recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Power analysis was based on a pilot study of five patients in the control group that showed a main duration of analgesia of 420 min (&#x000b1;80).

The addition of dexmedetomidine enhanced postoperative analgesia through lengthening the time to the first analgesic request and reducing the postoperative analgesic consumption. It also resulted in the more rapid onset of motor and sensory block with increased duration of block.</p><p>This study has clinically importance that the addition of dexmedetomidine 100 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine for combined sciatic-femoral nerve block during US-guided for below knee surgery was associated with +75% longer duration of analgesia, &#x02212;20% shorter onset times for sensory and motor block, &#x02212;25% faster time for surgical readiness, and longer duration of sensory and motor block (+45% and +40%, respectively) despite it would be more importantly to consider the cumulative tramadol consumption 24 h as a primary outcome. However, the reported statistical differences of 4 min in the onset time of sensory and motor blockades would not have medical importance, particularly the study was not deign to test the cost of healthcare like operating room stays.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine, is a highly specific and selective &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist. It has &#x003b1;2:&#x003b1;1 binding selectivity ratio of 1620:1 as compared to 220:1 for clonidine, thus decreasing the unwanted side effects of &#x003b1;1 receptors.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Presynaptic activation of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor in central nervous system inhibits the release of norepinephrine through activation of locus coeruleus, which inhibits the propagation of pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In various experimental studies, dexmedetomidine had been reported to enhance sensory and motor blockade along with increased duration of analgesia when it added to local anesthetics solution.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In addition, it has a dose-dependent increase in the duration of thermal antinociception and analgesia.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The beneficial effects of adding dexmedetomidine to local anesthetics for peripheral nerve block procedures have proved to be efficacious in humans.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The peripheral effects of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist appear to be less obvious because &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors are not present on the axon of the normal peripheral nerve.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] There have been four proposed mechanisms for the action of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist in peripheral nerve blockades. These mechanisms are centrally mediated analgesia, &#x003b1;2B-adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstrictive effects, attenuation of the inflammatory response, and direct action on a peripheral nerve. Central analgesia, vasoconstriction, and anti-inflammatory properties do not fully explain the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in peripheral nerve blockades.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The direct action of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonists on the nerve can be explained on the basis of a study conducted by Dalle <italic>et al</italic>. on the C nerve fibers of rabbit nerves.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The authors concluded that &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist enhances activity-dependent hyperpolarization by inhibiting the hyperpolarization-activated cation (Ih) current. The Ih current plays a key role in cell excitability, especially the firing frequency, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The Ih current is activated during the hyperpolarization phase of an action potential and normally acts to reset a nerve for subsequent action potentials. Therefore, by blocking the Ih current, &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist enhances hyperpolarization and inhibits subsequent action potentials.</p><p>The analgesic effect of adding &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist to local anesthetics for combined sciatic-femoral nerve block remains unclear. Casati <italic>et al</italic>. reported that addition of 1 mg/kg clonidine to 0.75% ropivacaine had no effect on onset time and quality of combined sciatic-femoral nerve block, but prolonged nerve block duration, providing a 3 h prolongation in postoperative pain relief, and no hemodynamic side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] On the other hand, Helayel <italic>et al</italic>. did not find an advantage in the quality and the duration of block in their sciatic block that was formed with the addition of 2 g/kg clonidine to 0.5% 40 mL ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine may lead to side effects such as a hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperglycemia. No patient had hypertension, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Unfortunately, the present study found that the addition of 100 &#x003bc;g dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine during combined femoral-sciatic nerve block for below knee surgery was associated with bradycardia and hypotension (20% and 6.7%, respectively). Similarly to the present study, Esmaoglu <italic>et al</italic>. reported bradycardia in 23.5%.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Hyperglycemia was not recorded, interestingly the dexmedetomidine group showed lower serum glucose levels.</p><p>The decrease in pulse rate and blood pressure might be related to the postsynaptic activation of central &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors, leading to decreased sympathetic activity that decrease the blood pressure and slower HR.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Baroreceptor reflex is well preserved with the use of dexmedetomidine. Thus, bradycardia is easily treatable conferring hemodynamic stability.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, the beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine may be explained by systemic absorption rather than the peripheral effect on the nerve itself. The recruitment of a control group, for which the same dose of dexmedetomidine is administered systemically, would help to differentiate between systemic and local mechanisms of action. Second, in similar to others,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we have considered using of 100 &#x003bc;g of dexmedetomidine, despite the effective dose of perineural dexmedetomidine has not been identified yet. Further studies are required to determine the optimum dose of dexmedetomidine needed to enhance the action of local anesthetic without producing side-effects. Third, it would be better to indicate the dose of dexmedetomidine on patient body weight rather than a fixed dose to avoid the heterogeneity that can be raised from dividing the dose between the femoral and sciatic nerve (37.5%: 62.5%). In addition, the present study was not designed to test the onset of sensory and motor blockades individually.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The addition of dexmedetomidine 100 &#x003bc;g to bupivacaine 0.5% during US-guided combined femoral and sciatic block for below knee surgery was associated with a prolonged duration of analgesia.
