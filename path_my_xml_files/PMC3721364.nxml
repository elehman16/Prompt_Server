Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive Lipanthyl 200 mg/day (<italic>n</italic> = 4 895) or matching placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 4 900).</p><p>At each clinic visit, information concerning laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy &#x02013; a prespecified tertiary endpoint of the main study &#x02013; was gathered. Adjudication by ophthalmologists masked to treatment allocation defined instances of laser treatment for macular oedema, proliferative retinopathy, or other eye conditions.</p><p>In a sub-study of 1 012 patients, standardised retinal photography was done and photographs were graded with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy study (ETDRS) criteria to determine the cumulative incidence of diabetic retinopathy and its component lesions. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study was registered as an international standard randomised controlled trial, number ISRCTN64783481.</p><p>Based on the FIELD study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref> a pharmaco-economic analysis of the use of Lipanthyl in preventing cardiovascular events has been developed. This study modelled the economics of Lipanthyl use in type 2 diabetes patients, focusing on the cost-saving impact of Lipanthyl treatment in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events due to myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and the need for angiography and revascularisation procedures. According to Carrington and Stewart,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref> type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Significance of this and previous studies</title><p>Fibrates are currently receiving renewed attention in South Africa. Lipanthyl has some of the strongest evidence in the class of fibrates. The recent FIELD study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> with its 9 795 patients positioned Lipanthyl as perhaps the strongest contender in this class.</p><p>The clinical argument has been well established by means of the evidence-based medicine supporting Lipanthyl. Not only has its efficacy been established in numerous clinical trials, but its effectiveness in the reduction of clinical events has now been proven by the FIELD study as well.</p><p>Pharmaco-economic evidence is critical in obtaining reimbursement in private healthcare in South Africa. With the FIELD study, the opportunity is now presenting itself to develop not only a compelling clinical argument but also a definitive economic or value argument to support the use of Lipanthyl as an essential component in lipid management.</p><p>With such a large study as FIELD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> now available, the potential of a pleiotropic effect associated with Lipanthyl will be explored. Bearing these arguments in mind, the development of economic evidence as part of the portfolio of evidence associated with Lipanthyl is not only justified, but is critical to position the molecule in the market window presenting itself at present.</p><p>In the FIELD study at five-year follow up, a similar proportion of subjects in both groups (10&#x02013;11%) had discontinued therapy (FIELD study group: 2005).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref> However, those randomised to placebo were more likely to require supplementary lipid-lowering therapy (in this case, statin therapy) compared to the fenofibrate group. There was no difference in the rate of starting other lipid-lowering treatment between the groups in those with a history of cardiac events (23 vs 14%) and those without a history at baseline (16 vs 7%). However, for those with previous CVD, the average rate was higher.</p><p>Despite a similar all-cause mortality in the FIELD study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref> (6.6% in the placebo group vs 7.3% in the fenofibrate group), fenofibrate was associated with (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>):</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Event rate per 1 000 person years at risk.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cvja-21-44-g001"/></fig><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x025cf; 11% risk reduction for a coronary event (<italic>p</italic> = 0.16)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cf; 24% risk reduction for non-fatal MI (<italic>p</italic> = 0.010)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cf; 19% risk increase for CHD mortality (<italic>p</italic> = 0.22)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cf; 11% risk reduction for a cardiovascular disease event (<italic>p</italic> = 0.035)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cf; 21% risk reduction for coronary revascularisation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003).</p></list-item></list><p>Although fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome (coronary events) relative to treatment with placebo (standard treatment), it was associated with fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions and revascularisations in this relatively high-risk group of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study aim</title><p>This analysis has developed an economic assessment of the reduction of the risk associated with myocardial infarction, stroke and the need for angiography and revascularisation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. This study therefore aimed to prove that the effect of Lipanthyl in reducing the risk associated with cardiovascular disease in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus constituted a cost-saving intervention. In order to test this hypothesis, a cost&#x02013;consequence analysis was followed up with a cost&#x02013;benefit analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4a"><title>Methods</title></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a localisation of the Carrington and Stewart study reported in the <italic>International Journal of Cardiology.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref> The methodology used in their study was applied here as well, to ensure integrity of the findings.

The lipid-lowering therapy introduced in this analysis was 10 mg of simvastatin at the average generic price for the South African private sector. This can be considered to be a conservative approach and adding any other lipid-lowering agents would have only increased the difference in costs associated with the two comparators.

Carrington and Stewart.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref> The results from this analysis are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1.</xref></p><p>As is evident from this table, fenofibrate therapy was consistently associated with a reduction in the incidence of cardiac events. Per 1 000 person years, fenofibrate therapy was therefore associated with a cost saving of R706 254 resulting from events avoided over the 1 000 person-year observation period. This amount was calculated as the product of the unit cost of an event and the number of events per 1 000 person years estimated to be associated with the respective treatment arms.</p><p>To this we then added therapy costs. Fenofibrate therapy resulted in an increase of R84 381 in pharmacotherapy costs. The sum total of the event costs and therapy costs was calculated to be R 3 480 471 in respect of the placebo arm and R 2 858 598 for the fenofibrate therapy. A resultant cost saving of R 621 873 was modelled to result from the introduction of fenofibrate treatment to the treatment of middle-aged type 2 diabetics.</p><p>The one-way sensitivity analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) indicated that the analysis was robust as far as the event-rate assumptions were concerned. Both for the upper and lower 95% limits, a cost saving associated with fenofibrate was indicated (R1.098 million and R84 000, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on this analysis, it appeared that Lipanthyl&#x000ae; resulted in a cost saving due to the prevention of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, when it was used in the treatment of type 2 diabetics as in the FIELD study. It should therefore be considered to be cost effective, even when just the cardiovascular risk-reduction effect is considered. The addition of fenofibrate should therefore be favourably considered for inclusion in the management regimes for type 2 diabetes.</p><p>These results were indicated to be robust to the assumptions made regarding the event rates, as was suggested by the one-way sensitivity analyses that were done.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><etal>The FIELD study investigators.</etal><article-title>Effects of long-term fenofibrate therapy on cardiovascular events in 9795 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (the FIELD study): randomised controlled trial.</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>366</volume><issue>9500</issue><fpage>1849</fpage><lpage>1861</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16310551</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Carrington</surname><given-names>Melinda</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><article-title>Is fenofibrate a cost-saving treatment for middle-aged individuals with type II diabetes?
