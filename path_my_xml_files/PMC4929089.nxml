The international phase IIIb/IV TriCo study was, therefore, designed to evaluate boceprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve genotype 1 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 165 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve genotype 1 patients were assigned to boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin therapy according to the label. All patients received a 4-week lead-in with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin, after which boceprevir (2400&#x000a0;mg/day) was introduced. The total duration of treatment ranged from 28 to 48&#x000a0;weeks depending on the virological response at Weeks 4, 8, and 24, and on fibrosis status. The primary efficacy outcome was sustained virological response (SVR) [undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) 12&#x000a0;weeks after actual end of treatment, SVR12].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall SVR12 rate was 81% (133/165, 95% confidence interval 74&#x02013;86%). After 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, 61% of patients had undetectable HCV RNA, and 78 patients (47%) had an early response (undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 8 and 24) and were eligible to stop all therapy at Week 28. Among early responders the SVR12 rate was 95% (74/78), and among patients with cirrhosis assigned to 48&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; treatment, the SVR12 rate was 67% (14/21). The overall relapse rate was 7% (10/143), and was 4% (3/77) among early responders. The most common adverse events were anemia (41%), neutropenia (32%), and dysgeusia (31%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>High SVR12 rates can be achieved with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HCV genotype 1 patients, including patients with well-compensated cirrhosis.

In general, both interferon-free and interferon-containing DAA regimens increase sustained virological response (SVR) rates and allow for shorter treatment durations when compared with dual peginterferon/ribavirin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Access to these newer agents and combinations is restricted by the application of rigid patient selection criteria in most settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dual peginterferon/ribavirin therapy is no longer recommended for genotype 1 patients by the European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL) and, as evidence of the rapid evolution of the field, boceprevir-based triple therapy is also not recommended unless more efficacious regimens are unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Boceprevir was the first DAA approved for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is only indicated for use in combination with peginterferon/ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection and well-compensated liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Treatment for 48&#x000a0;weeks with the combination of boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin produced an overall SVR rate (defined as undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] levels for 24&#x000a0;weeks after the completion of therapy) of 66% in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients in a large international registration trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01591460) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the drug was not studied in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin during phase III trials in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted an international, multicenter, open-label, phase IIIb/IV trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with HCV genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were aged 18&#x000a0;years or older, had chronic hepatitis C, quantifiable HCV RNA in serum and HCV genotype 1 infection, and had not received prior treatment with any interferon-based therapy or any DAA.

The total duration of therapy was determined by cirrhosis status and the on-treatment response.</p><p>Non-cirrhotic patients received a response-guided therapy regimen, the length of which was based on the virological response at Weeks 4, 8, and 24. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA (Roche COBAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2.0 HCV Test, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) at Weeks 8 and 24 stopped all therapy at Week 28. Patients with detectable HCV RNA at Week 8 and undetectable HCV RNA at Week 24 continued triple combination therapy until Week 36, at which time boceprevir (Victrelis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Stations, NJ, USA) was discontinued, but dual peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin therapy was continued to Week 48. Patients with poor interferon responsiveness during the lead-in phase, defined as a &#x0003c;1-log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL decline in HCV RNA at Week 4, were recommended to receive triple combination therapy from Weeks 5 to 48. Patients with cirrhosis received triple combination therapy from Weeks 5 to 48. All treatment was to be stopped in patients who met the criteria for the predefined futility rules (HCV RNA &#x02265;100&#x000a0;IU/mL at Week 12, or detectable HCV RNA at Week 24).</p><p>Subcutaneous peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was administered at a dosage of 180&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/week. Oral ribavirin (Copegus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Roche) was administered at a dosage of 1000 (body weight &#x0003c;75&#x000a0;kg) or 1200&#x000a0;mg/day (&#x02265;75&#x000a0;kg) in two divided doses, and oral boceprevir was administered at a dosage of 800&#x000a0;mg three times daily (i.e., every 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h). The dose of peginterferon alfa-2a and/or ribavirin could be reduced in cases of adverse events (AEs) or laboratory abnormalities. Dose reductions of boceprevir were not recommended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was SVR12 defined as undetectable HCV RNA (Roche COBAS TaqMan 2.0 HCV Test, [lower limit of detection for genotype 1 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;IU/mL, lower limit of quantification 25&#x000a0;IU/mL]) after 12&#x000a0;weeks of untreated follow-up (&#x02265;70&#x000a0;days after actual end of treatment [EOT]). SVR12 is considered to be equivalent to SVR 24 by regulatory authorities and in current treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients without an HCV RNA test result &#x02265;70&#x000a0;days after EOT were assumed not to have achieved an SVR12.</p><p>Virological rebound was defined as an increase in HCV RNA by 1-log<sub>10</sub> from nadir in a patient whose on-treatment HCV RNA level remained &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;IU/mL. Virological breakthrough was defined as occurrence of an HCV RNA level &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;IU/mL during treatment after achievement of undetectable HCV RNA. Relapse was defined as detectable HCV RNA during follow-up in a patient with undetectable HCV RNA at EOT. Patients without an HCV RNA test result after EOT response were excluded from relapse rate calculations.</p><p>Safety was assessed by AE reports, physical and laboratory evaluations, and dosage adjustments and drug discontinuations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>As this was an exploratory study, no formal hypothesis testing was involved. A sample size of approximately 150 patients was estimated to provide sufficient precision to assess the SVR rate in relation to that achieved with dual combination therapy (peginterferon alfa/ribavirin) and triple combination therapy comprised a DAA plus peginterferon alfa/ribavirin. This estimation was made on the basis of the SVR rate achieved with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin in a previous clinical trial (64&#x02013;70%) which would provide a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of &#x000b1;8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

However, when compared with the overall study population, the incidence of SAEs was higher in cirrhotic patients as was the incidence of study drug discontinuation for AEs and of certain laboratory abnormalities (low hemoglobin concentrations and platelet count) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of note, the incidence of thrombocytopenia was 12% overall (20/165), but was 33% (7/21) in patients with cirrhosis. Consistent with this observation, a higher proportion of cirrhotic patients had platelet counts of &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>9</sup>/L (48% versus 8% in the overall study population).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SVR12 rate observed in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients treated with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in this study was 81% overall. An overall SVR24 rate of 66% was previously achieved with a 48-week fixed-duration regimen of boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin in a large, randomized international registration trial (SPRINT-2, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00705432) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A direct comparison of the two trials is not possible, because the present trial included only patients from Central and Eastern Europe, whereas the SPRINT-2 trial included a substantial subgroup of Black patients (15%). Moreover, a higher proportion of patients in SPRINT-2 were infected with HCV genotype 1a (64% versus 13% in the present study). The SVR rate was lower in Black (53%) than non-Black patients (68%) in SPRINT-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The frequency of important baseline characteristics predictive of SVR was similar in the present study and in the non-Black cohort in SPRINT-2 (19% and 12% of patients had bridging cirrhosis/cirrhosis, respectively, 77% and 84% of patients had a baseline HCV RNA &#x0003e;800,000&#x000a0;IU/mL, respectively, and the mean ages were 46 and 49&#x000a0;years, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Approximately one-half (47%) of patients enrolled in the present study had an early response, defined as undetectable HCV RNA at Weeks 8 and 24 of treatment. These patients were eligible to stop all therapy at Week 28, and importantly, all but two of these individuals completed the full 28-week regimen. The overall SVR12 rate in these individuals was 95%, which is comparable to that achieved with interferon-free DAA-containing regimens that are approved for use in patients with chronic HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These results are important because access to interferon-free regimens is limited to patients who meet specific and restricted criteria in many jurisdictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The overall SVR rate of 81% achieved with boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a in the present study is comparable to SVR rates achieved in large Phase III studies of simeprevir-based triple therapy (QUEST-1, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01289782; QUEST-2, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01290679) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and faldaprevir-based triple therapy (StartVerso-1, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01343888) (80&#x02013;81%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy of the different regimens used in these trials or between the present study and the phase III study by Poordad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, anemia occurred frequently during boceprevir-based triple therapy. In the present study, a total of 41% of patients experienced anemia as an AE, 27% of patients had a hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;g/L during treatment, and three patients discontinued treatment with boceprevir due to anemia. The incidence of anemia in the present study was similar to that reported in boceprevir recipients by Poordad et al. (49%); however, use of erythropoietin to treat anemia was less common in the present study than in the study by Poordad et al. (6% versus 43%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Patients with cirrhosis are a particularly important subgroup of those with chronic hepatitis C, as they are at increased risk of hepatic decompensation, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Boceprevir-based triple therapy produced an SVR12 in 67% of patients with compensated cirrhosis in the present study. Patients with a history or evidence of hepatic decompensation were excluded from this study in accordance with labeling for boceprevir and peginterferon alfa-2a. However, the incidence of SAEs, including anemia and thrombocytopenia, was somewhat higher in patients with cirrhosis than in non-cirrhotic patients, demonstrating that clinicians must monitor the former closely during treatment. The AE burden associated with boceprevir-based triple therapy is increased in patients with cirrhosis, and in particular, in those patients with cirrhosis in combination with a baseline platelet count &#x0003c;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> and serum albumin level &#x0003c;35&#x000a0;g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, careful patient selection is necessary when using boceprevir.</p><p>In an ideal world, every patient with chronic hepatitis C would have access to interferon-free regimens; in reality, this is restricted. In Western Europe and North America, publicly funded treatment is available only for patients with advanced liver disease (e.g., Metavir F3&#x02013;F4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], while publicly funded treatment may not be available to any patient in other countries. The first generation of protease inhibitors (PIs) (boceprevir and telaprevir) has been withdrawn from the market in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and these are rarely used in Western Europe. Where resources are limited, waiting is the only option as it may be some time before broad access to the new combinations is possible on a worldwide scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Resources are limited in most European countries, even in those that are economically well off, where (with the exception of France) insurance companies restrict the use of interferon-free regimens to patients with advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). Notwithstanding guidance from EASL that boceprevir may need to be used in some settings with limited resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], newer DAAs are preferred over first generation PIs, and thus, should be used where available.</p><p>Limitations of the TriCo study include the open-label design and the lack of a control group making it difficult to draw direct comparisons with randomized controlled trials in similar populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that an overall SVR rate of 81% can be achieved with the combination of boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection that an SVR12 of 95% can be achieved in patients with an early response, and that treatment is well tolerated when the restrictions in the label are observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
