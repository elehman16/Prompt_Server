They were selected for the study. The inclusion criteria included:</p><p>

</p><p>All fractures were classified according to Spiessl and Schroll,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] into types I to VI [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Six fractures were classified as type II and twenty four fractures as type III. The high condylar neck fracture was defined as a fracture with the fracture line extending over to the sigmoid notch. Low subcondylar fractures were defined as fractures of the condylar neck situated below a horizontal line drawn from the right to the left sigmoid notch on panoramic radiographs. The lowest fractures of this type are often referred to as oblique fractures of the superior ramus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Twenty patients had an additional parasymphyseal, six had symphysis fracture of the mandible, and four patients had associated midface fracture.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Spiessl and Schroll classification of condylar fracture</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The patients were randomly divided into two groups of 15 each. Randomization was performed by lots in closed envelopes. Group I comprised of patients treated with a single miniplate (Orthomax, Baroda, India), as suggested by Champy <italic>et al</italic>. Group II were treated with two noncompression miniplates, in which one plate was fixed in a similar manner to that of Group I and the other plate was fixed medial to it, at a 5 mm distance [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Subcondylar fracture fixation done with two miniplates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g002"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Panoramic radiograph showing patient treated with two miniplates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g003"/></fig><p>A Risdon's incision [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] was used to expose the fracture condyle and the intraoral vestibular incision, to expose the symphysis and parasymphysis fracture site. The fracture was then reduced and the jaws were placed into the intermaxillary fixation (IMF) with the help of arch bars / IMF screws. After placement of the plates, the IMF was released and the occlusion was checked. The intraoral incision was closed with resorbable sutures and the extraoral incision was closed in two layers (with 3-0 vicryl and 5-0 prolene), after securing the drain. Postoperatively, elastics were placed for one week, in every case. The patients were reviewed after surgery for six months. The elastics were removed after one week and the arch bars after the fourth week. A single surgeon performed all the surgeries. All patients, in both the groups, were given antibiotics (ampicillin 500 mg intravenously four times a day, for five days postoperatively, and 1000 mg intravenously, two hours before surgery.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Risdon's incision marking</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g004"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Assessment</title><p>The patients were assessed for malocclusion, lateral deviation on opening, infection, plate removal, facial nerve function, the time taken in the surgery in both the groups, as well the cost of implants used in both the groups.

Specifically, the intent was to see the efficacy of two noncompression miniplates in comparison to a single noncompression miniplate, in the fixation of a subcondylar fracture. The results of this study confirmed that two miniplates were better than a single miniplate for a fixation with less complication.</p><p>Different approaches such as preauricular incision, endaural incision, a Risdon's incision, a submandibular incision, a retromandibular incision, the rhytidectomy approach, or an intraoral incision were mentioned in the literature, for exposing the condyle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] We used the Risdon's incision, without any complication, in all our cases, to expose the fractured condyle. The advantage of this approach was that we could pull the distal segment of the mandible downward by applying the bone holding forceps or a 24 gauge wire, which helped in reduction and adequate surgical access of the fractured condyle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>].</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Stainless steel wire used to retract the mandible downwards</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g009"/></fig><p>Several complications are mentioned in the literature when a single miniplate is used for fixation of a condylar fracture. According to Hammer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] 35% cases had plate failure or screw loosening when the fracture was stabilized, with a single miniplate. Sometimes the single plate also led to inadequate fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>].</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Subcondylar fracture-inadequate fixation done with 1 miniplate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g010"/></fig><p>We also observed plate bending (6.66%) and screw loosening (13.33%) in Group I of our study. Sargent and Green[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] also reported plate fracture in their study and they suggested that the functional forces exceeded the rigidity of one miniplate. To avoid plate fracture in cases of condylar fracture Ellis and Dean[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] used minidynamic compression plates, however they also reported bending of the plate and loosening of screws. Inadequate reduction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>], lateral deviation on opening, and malocclusion occurred in one patient, in whom the plate was bent, in Group I. Infection occurred in two (13.33%) of the cases, in whom screw loosening was present.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Photograph showing inadequate reduction and displacement of fractured condyle laterally following fixation with a single miniplate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-2-141-g011"/></fig><p>On the other hand, inadequate stability causing either plate fracture or screw loosening was not observed when two miniplates were used, which strongly suggested that two miniplates were better than a single miniplate for fixation. The second plate protected the first plate from the damaging mechanical strains that could cause its fracture, and prevented a secondary displacement of the mandibular condylar fragment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>According to Choi <italic>et al</italic>., the two-miniplate fixation technique provides functionally stable fixation for fractures of the condylar neck. They also suggest that application of a miniplate at the posterior and anterior borders of the condylar neck seem to have the beneficial effect of restoring tension and compression trajectories.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Pilling <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] after comparative evaluation of ten different condylar base fracture osteosynthesis techniques, concluded that osteosynthesis with two miniplates would be the most stable way of treating a condylar fracture. Using an in vitro model, Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] demonstrated that a two-miniplate system applied to the anterior and posterior regions of the condylar neck was more stable than a single-plate system. We had no complications in our patients treated with two plates.</p><p>In our study, the mean operating time in Groups I and II was 2.22 hours and 2.48 hours, respectively, and the time required in Group II was more. Rallis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] also demonstrated longer operating time in patients treated with two plates and they also mentioned increase in cost when patients were treated with two miniplates, although the cost of implants in our series of patients in Group II was also more as compared to Group I.</p><p>The small sample size and limited follow-up could be considered the limitation of the study, but it is concluded from our pilot study results that the use of two plates for subcondylar fractures, represents the best solution to obtain stable osteosynthesis, in comparison to a single miniplate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict
