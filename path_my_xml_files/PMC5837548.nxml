The active RM pathway included formalized remote follow-up protocols, and UC was standard practice in nine recruiting centres in England. The primary endpoint in the time to event analysis was the 1st event of death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. Secondary endpoints included death from any cause, death from cardiovascular reasons, death from cardiovascular reasons and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, and unplanned hospitalization. REM-HF is registered with ISRCTN (96536028). The mean age of the population was 70&#x02009;years (range 23&#x02013;98); 86% were male. Patients were followed for a median of 2.8&#x02009;years (range 0&#x02013;4.3&#x02009;years) completing on 31 January 2016. Patient adherence was high with a drop out of 4.3% over the course of the study. The incidence of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between active RM and UC groups, which occurred in 42.4 and 40.8% of patients, respectively [hazard ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87&#x02013;1.18; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87].

It is likely that the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of RM depends on the design of care pathways in which the technologies are deployed.<xref rid="ehx227-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>We conducted a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial, remote management of heart failure using implantable electronic devices (REM-HF), to determine whether management of heart failure patients in response to information gained by RM of implanted devices would reduce the combined endpoint of death from any cause and hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons, as compared to usual care (UC). To make the study as relevant as possible to real-world clinical practice and circumstances, it was conducted using devices from multiple manufacturers. The RM follow-up processes were formalized according to the prevailing understanding of clinical practice at the time of study inception and allied healthcare professionals were trained in the RM process in each of the participating centres. To our knowledge, REM-HF is the largest study, with longest follow-up, of RM of heart failure to date.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design, administration, and supervision</title><p>A description of the study design was published previously.<xref rid="ehx227-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In summary, our study was a randomized, event-driven, multicentre, open label, and parallel group clinical trial in which patients with heart failure and a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) [cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with pacemaker function (CRT-P), CRT with defibrillator function (CRT-D), or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)] were randomized to receive either UC or management informed by active remote-monitoring (RM). The active RM approach is described in detail below. In summary, it consisted of weekly data downloads from patients&#x02019; devices with simultaneous review by remote monitors who followed a defined active follow-up approach. Usual care was existing follow-up practice in the participating centres and care was taken that it was not influenced by study procedures. The context of the study was the UK&#x02019;s National Health Service and nine recruiting centres.</p><p>The study protocol (which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/398865/">http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/398865/</ext-link>) was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee, Yorkshire and the Humber-Sheffield, UK. The study was registered with the UK&#x02019;s Clinical Research Network (10383) and ISRCTN (96536028) and conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the 2002 Declaration of Helsinki. All patients recruited to the study provided written informed consent.</p><p>The Steering Committee oversaw the execution of the trial and data analysis according to a pre-specified statistical analysis. A Supervisory Committee was responsible for trial governance. An independent Endpoint Review Committee reviewed all patient events and adjudicated them according to its charter, detailed in the statistical analysis plan. The trial was reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee who reviewed an interim analysis for signals of harm, overwhelming benefit, or futility, and sanctioned study continuation when 400 primary events had been adjudicated on 27 February 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomization procedure</title><p>For inclusion, patients had to have symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II&#x02013;IV) documented at enrolment, with a CIED (ICD;CRT-D; CRT-P) implanted according to NICE guidance or local clinical discretion at least 6&#x02009;months previously (and optimally programmed according to the treating physician), stable and optimal medical therapy (working to NICE Guidelines) for heart failure for 6&#x02009;weeks prior to enrolment, the ability to independently comprehend and complete quality of life questionnaires and to give informed consent. Patients were not eligible for recruitment if they had had any device change or lead replacement procedure within 30 days, had had an acute myocardial infarction or any cardiac surgical procedure within 3&#x02009;months, were unable to use the technology due to mental or physical limitations, were aged &#x0003c;18&#x02009;years, were pregnant, were on a planned heart transplantation list, had a life expectancy of less than a year due to non-cardiovascular disease, had current CIED complications (such as wound infection, haematoma, lead fracture), or were unable to understand written and spoken English.</p><p>Patients meeting these criteria, after informed consent, were randomized 1:1 to UC or to active RM, performed centrally by FormsVision B.V. (Abcoude, The Netherlands) via an electronic care record form management system. The randomization schedule was stratified by recruiting site and device type (CRT-P; CRT-D; ICD), with randomly permuted block sizes of either four or 6 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Remote monitoring care pathway, procedural handbook, and remote monitoring staff</title><p>The trial investigators adopted a pragmatic approach to active RM based on a feasibility study,<xref rid="ehx227-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> steering committee clinical experience, and reference to the published literature.

Remote monitoring clinical management procedures were standardized across centres and formalized in a Procedural Handbook (Appendix II to the protocol) that guided reactions to active RM changes (including medication changes, lifestyle advice, and onward referral). The Procedural Handbook integrated the monitored parameters into the active RM workflow. Choice of CIED was determined by purchasing practice in participating centres.

These monitors underwent an initial 2 days intensive training in application of the CIED&#x02019;s monitoring technologies in the study protocol, the workflows described in the Procedural Handbook (which was written by the steering committee to optimize monitoring capabilities based on understanding of the literature, personal experience, and learnings from a the feasibility study described in a methodology article<xref rid="ehx227-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>) and active RM aims. There was subsequent informal refresher training at intervals during the study.</p><p>Following patient enrolment, they instructed participants randomized to active RM in how to perform weekly CIED downloads. They also interpreted the weekly downloads with particular attention to the observation of multi-parameter trends rather than single observations (including thoracic impedance change) and in the context of patient feedback during telephone interviews. No &#x02018;alerts&#x02019; were programmed &#x02018;on&#x02019; for the purpose of heart failure management and therefore, there was no co-ordinated heart failure care response to &#x02018;alert&#x02019; generation. &#x02018;Alerts&#x02019; for lead integrity or battery depletion were allowed according to physician discretion. The remote monitors offered lifestyle, clinical and medication change advice to patients within the confines of the Procedural Handbook, and additional clinic visits, or recommendation to attend their general practitioner or the emergency room. Patients in the UC group were informed of study follow-up procedures. The remote monitor contacted these patients by telephone to make a comprehensive assessment of heart failure events during the study follow-up period, with completion of the study UC CRF. However, the remote monitor was instructed not to interfere with UC patient management and to avoid any patient interactions that might inadvertently do so. For UC, those sites that used RM for device checks continued that practice as to do otherwise would have interfered with UC. At its most frequent, this was done every 6&#x02009;months and without use of a &#x02018;protocol-driven&#x02019; response. Usual care did not include use of active RM to manage heart failure in any form.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and management</title><p>All study data for both the active RM and UC groups were collected and recorded by the site staff on the electronic case record form, which captured clinical events and healthcare utilization elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up timing</title><p>Contact was made with all patients at 3, 6, 12, and 24&#x02009;months and at the end of the study.</p><p>Continual on-site monitoring was performed with source-data verification of core data in all patients. Central monitoring of documents (patients&#x02019; records and electronic case report forms) regarding serious adverse events was performed before assessment by the endpoint review committee. The trial was terminated after the protocol-specified goal of 546 identified and adjudicated primary endpoints was met, and patients exited from the study with an end-of-trial telephone contact so that any remaining endpoints or adverse events could be collected before the database was locked.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>The primary study endpoint in the time-to-event analysis was the 1st event of the composite of death from any cause or an unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. The secondary endpoints were death from any cause; cardiovascular death; non-cardiovascular death; cardiovascular-related death or unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization; death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for non-cardiovascular reason; unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization; unplanned hospitalization for non-cardiovascular reasons.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study was designed to show a maximum hazard ratio (HR) of 0.755 in the rate of the 1st primary end-point event with RM. We calculated that data on 546 events were required for the study to have power of 90% to show that reduction, at an overall two-sided type I error rate of 5%. We estimated that this would require a minimum of 697 patients to be recruited per group (1394 total) with a minimum follow-up of 2&#x02009;years, but to allow for patient drop-out, we increased the total planned recruitment to 1650.</p><p>The primary analysis was conducted in the intention to treat population, which consisted of all randomized subjects, with each subject analysed as part of the group to which they were randomized and including all events that occurred before the database was locked. This included any subjects later found to be ineligible and those who did not follow the trial protocol. The trial was designed to include one interim analysis and used the Peto&#x02013;Haybittle rule to maintain an overall 5% type I error. The significance level of the final analysis was 0.048. Cox proportional hazards models including the stratification variables of recruiting site and device type were used to test for differences between the UC and active RM groups. The excess of events at the termination of the trial was included in the final analyses. Cause-specific HR was calculated, and cumulative incidence curves were used to visualize survival data. Further details regarding the statistical analysis, including analyses of the secondary endpoints and a priori subgroup analyses, are provided in the statistical analysis plan (Appendix III to the protocol).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Manuscript preparation</title><p>The study funders and sponsor had no role in study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, manuscript preparation or decision to submit the article for publication.

REM-HF did not use &#x02018;alerts&#x02019; to trigger interactions but rather review of changes in trends over time in monitored parameters; the incidence and nature of RM actions in REM-HF (5536 interventions in 599 patients) appears comparable to that in IN-TIME (1225 actions in 280 patients). We would argue that the patients&#x02019; adherence to the RM weekly download schedule throughout the study was as good as was pragmatically possible, generating additional contact with the majority (72.5%) of patients. In our multicentre, randomized, controlled trial in patients with heart failure and a CIED, we found no reduction in the risk of death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons with management guided by weekly active RM, as compared to UC in nine English hospitals. Subgroup analyses failed to identify a group for which the intervention was effective, including those with a history of atrial fibrillation. This was despite both the trial having a larger number of patients and considerably longer follow-up than other similar studies, and clinically relevant patient adherence to weekly downloads driving many additional contacts with patients. Importantly, however, we did not show an increase in hospitalization for heart failure as has been the case with pre-set &#x02018;alert&#x02019; based approaches to RM of CIED.<xref rid="ehx227-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>The patient population recruited to REM-HF may have been less sick than that in IN-TIME and OPTILINK as suggested by a higher proportion of patients with mild symptoms (NYHA Class II). However, the mortality rates in these studies appear similar to that found in REM-HF. More patients gave a history of atrial fibrillation at study enrolment in REM-HF (41.4%) than in either OPTILINK (30&#x000b7;4%)<xref rid="ehx227-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> or IN-TIME (25&#x000b7;4%).<xref rid="ehx227-B20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>In contrast to the use of diagnostic features within therapeutically-indicated CIEDs, two monitoring-only cardiac implantable technologies have undergone clinical trial assessment.<xref rid="ehx227-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx227-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> A pressure sensor mounted on an intravascular lead and connected to an implanted monitoring device giving continuous right ventricular pressure monitoring failed to achieve a significant reduction in hospitalizations.<xref rid="ehx227-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, a wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitor that allows a physician to adjust medication to achieve a target pulmonary artery pressure reported a 33% reduction in hospitalizations at 6&#x02009;months compared to UC in the US healthcare system.<xref rid="ehx227-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> It is unclear whether the effect relates to RM and/or to the specific haemodynamic targeting of drug therapy but it may be that managing patients to remain within a target zone reflecting optimal physiological status offers better outcomes.</p><p>In summary, REM-HF employed a rigorous active RM strategy, employing the monitoring capabilities of CIEDs. The strategy was relevant to real-word clinical practice and not focused on single manufacturer technology or single centre capability although it was implemented by trained &#x02018;remote monitors&#x02019;. Nevertheless, this active RM strategy provided no benefit over UC for patients with heart failure. Thus, this large multicentre trial with longer follow-up than previous studies does not support the routine use of management guided by weekly routine RM using a CIED. Perhaps an effect could be demonstrated in health care systems with less well developed UC or in a sicker heart failure population. Furthermore, future developments in RM technologies may enhance diagnostic and interventional capabilities but will require robust evaluation before broad clinical adoption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
