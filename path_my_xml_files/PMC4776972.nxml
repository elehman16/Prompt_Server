And the continuously changing epidemiology of invasive fungal infections results in the need for an expanded armamentarium of antifungal therapies. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Butenafine (BTF) versus Bifonazole (BFZ) in the treatment of superficial mycosis in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Of 96 patients, 48 applied (BTF) cream and 48 applied (BFZ) cream for 2 weeks to tinea versicolor, corporis and cruris treat, while tinea of feet &#x00026; hands was treated for 4 weeks duration. Efficacy was assessed after the end of treatment and 2 weeks later. At the end of therapy, we find somewhat more patients using (BTF) than using (BFZ) had a mycologic cure ((BTF), 87.5%; (BFZ) 83.3%) and effective clinical response ((BTF), 91.7%; (BFZ), 83.3%). (BTF) provides rapid and persistent antifungal activity and symptom relief in patients with superficial mycosis during treatment. And patients continued to improve for at least 2 weeks after treatment. The Rates of mycologic cure and effective treatment with (BTF) were higher than with (BFZ) at cessation of treatment and 2 weeks later. However, no significant difference found between the two drugs (p&#x0003e; 0.05).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>butenafine</kwd><kwd>bifonazole</kwd><kwd>superficial mycosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Superficial fungal infections, including rare infections and commons skin disease confine to be limit to groups of patients or geographical areas. Superficial mycosis has been considered to be as major world public health problem and one of the most frequent diseases in human beings and animals (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Kibbler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Midgley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Merlin et al., 1990)</xref>. Hence; the superficial mycosis clinical treatment has been introduced by many of antifungal agents (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Zarowny et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Fredriksson, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Kokoschka et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">McVie et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Groll &#x00026; Tragiannidis, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Nolting et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Del Palacio et al., 1999)</xref>. Nevertheless the increased use of such agents in recent years has caused the development of resistance to available drugs. For this reason, a constant effort toward the synthesis of new antifungal agents has been made in the last few years. In particular, the class of azoles (imidazole and Triazole derivatives) has supplied many effective antifungal drugs currently in clinical use, and newer azoles with expanded spectrum of activity are at the moment in continuous development (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2011)</xref>. Bifonazole (BFZ), an imidazole derivative, has a broad spectrum of action used currently for topical therapy of mycoses and dermatomycoses (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Gupta &#x00026; Sauder, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">European Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2001</xref>). Butenafine (BTF) is a synthetic benzylamine antifungal agent with fungicidal activity against susceptible organisms that have been approved in many countries worldwide (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Georgopapadakou, 1998</xref>). The therapeutic efficacy of these two agents was compared in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>Our hospital received 96 patients with superficial mycosis disease complaints. Informed consent was obtained. We begin with complete medical history for each patient and record all data, including sex, age, and symptoms and signs of the disease. A physical examination included total body mass, weight and dermatological inspection. A clinical examination with standard laboratory tests was also carried out at inclusion and repeated after the end of treatment and 2 weeks later. In addition, vascular disease, particularly diabetes and other medical condition&#x02019;s history are record. Hence, any patients received antibiotic or antifungal treatment for previous 90 days are excluded.</p><p>For this study 96-subjects with superficial skin mycosis by carry out KOH and fungal cultures positive randomized, parallel group; double-blind. The study group (subjects, including female 54 Male 42, age 14~72; duration of disease 3~10 months) divided into two treatment groups.</p><p>Of 96 patients, twice daily for 2 weeks each 48 applied (BTF) hydrochloride 1% and 48 applied (BFZ) 1% cream to the affected area to treat versicolor, corporis and cruris tinea and tinea of feet and hands need 4 weeks treatment. Efficacy was assessed after the end of treatment and 2 weeks late.</p><p>In this paper, the skin scraping by curetting of the affected webs was used for mycological study. For each patient, the Potas-sium hydroxide preparation was performed and Sabouraud dext-rose agar (SDA) was used for all specimens. Firstly, SDA with 0.005% chloram-phenicol to inhibit bacterial contamination and 0.05% cycloheximide to inhibit contaminating fungi were used for selective isolation of dermatophytes. Secondly, SDA without cycloheximide used to grow non-dermatophyte fungi that are commonly considered saprophytes or contaminants. With the aid of a straight needle, small fragments of skin were placed on the surface of the agar in Petri&#x02019;s dishes containing 40 mL of culture medium and pressed onto the surface to make a good contact. The samples were adjusted into four different areas, or at least in two spots in the case of a scanty sample. Petri&#x02019;s dishes were surrounded by paraffin seal to prevent dehydration and incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C for 4 weeks before being considered negative for fungus. Media were tested every 3&#x02013;4 days for growth of fungus. Plates overgrown with contaminants growing from Petri dish edges were eliminated. Media were examined macroscopically and when applicable, the texture and surface color of the colony, as well as any pigment diffusing into the medium, were carefully noted and recorded. An adhesive tape strip was applied onto the surface of the colony, and then mounted in a drop of lactophenol cotton blue stain.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>2.1 Drug Administration</title><p>The first group was treated with 1% (BTF) hydrochloride cream.</p><p>The second group was treated with 1% (BFZ) cream.</p><p>Both of them were treated by applying the cream twice daily for 2 weeks to treat tinea cruris, tinea corporis and Tinea versicolor.

Discussion</title><p>The progress in managing of fungal infections, the incidence increased and response rates remain insufficient and this may led to the development a new antifungal agent. Recent antifungal chemotherapy drugs show new advances in offer clinician&#x02019;s fewer toxic alternatives and more effective at conventional therapy. BTF hydrochloride has similar action a synthetic benzylamine derivative mode to that of the allylamine class of antifungal drugs (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Gerald &#x00026; Mc Evoy, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The evaluation of randomized, double-blind, controlled trial for the safety and efficacy of 2 weeks, twice-daily treatment with (BTF) versus (BFZ) for each patient with versicolor, cruris, and corporis tinea; and 4 weeks to treat tinea of feet &#x00026; hands. The final comparing the treatment of BTF group mycologic cure higher than a BFZ show group (87.5, vs. 83.3%, p&#x0003e; 0.05). Similarly, the mycologic cure rates at the 2 weeks follow-up were 95.8% vs. 91.7%, respectively (p &#x0003e;0.05). Clinical efficiencies were 91.7% for (BTF) group, compared to 83.3% for BFZ group in the (p&#x0003e;0.05). Then after 2 weeks clinical efficiency was 93.7% for (BTF) group, compared to 91.7% for BFZ group (p&#x0003e; 0.05). These results show that both (BFZ) and the significant advance for newer (BTF) treatment of fungal infections. Their expanded activity gives the clinician efficacious, safe, inexpensive and available more choices other than conventional treatment. Particularly, the optimal treatment of superficial mycosis still remains in the resistant cases with neither drug class offering an overwhelming advantage. Slightly higher rates of mycologic cure and effective treatment, (BTF) group offers a little advantages over (BFZ) group. The BTF main benefits are appeared as safety, ease of use, and offset by its current additional costs.</p><p>No serious side effects were noted with (BTF) except for mild itching and skin rash, but it was tolerable and no patient discontinued therapy due to an adverse event. In the adverse events for most commonly uncontrolled trials, associated with the use of (BTF) group 1% cream included erythema, contact dermatitis, itching, and irritation, for each occurring in less than 2% of patients (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Syed et al., 1998)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In this paper, during patient treatment (at least 2 weeks) BTF provides rapid improving antifungal activity and symptom relief with superficial mycosis The Rates of mycologic cure and effective treatment with (BTF) were higher than with (BFZ) at cessation of treatment. However, statistically there was not any difference significant between the two drugs (p&#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burns</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Breathnach</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><source>Rook&#x02019;s Textbook of Dermatology</source><year>2004</year><edition>4th ed</edition><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470750520">http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470750520</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Del Palacio</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuetara</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Topical treatment of dermatophytosis and cutaneous candidosis with flutrimazole 1% cream: double-blind, randomized comparative trial with ketoconazole 2% cream</article-title><source>Mycoses</source><year>1999</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>649</fpage><lpage>55</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0507.1999.00520.x">http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0507.1999.00520.x</uri></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10680442</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><element-citation publication-type="book"><collab>European Pharmacopoeia Commission</collab><source>European Pharmacopoeia</source><year>2001</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>67075 Strasbourg Cedex, France</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Council of Europe</publisher-name><fpage>737</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fredriksson</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of dermatomycoses with topical tioconazole and miconazole</article-title><source>Dermatologica (Suppl)</source><year>1983</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>20</fpage><lpage>33</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000249910">http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000249910</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Georgopapadakou</surname><given-names>N.
