The degradation of the dentin matrix occurs after it has become accessible by the removal of mineral, i.e., the dentin matrix cannot be degraded unless it is demineralized<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The dentin demineralization rate decreases when the amount of degradable collagen increases, whereby the demineralized matrix is attributed to hamper ionic diffusion into and out of the demineralizing area<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. However, the organic matrix can be degraded mechanically and chemically, which can contribute to an enhanced progression of dentin wear<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Among the proteases that can chemically degrade the organic matrix of dentin are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) present in dentin and saliva<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. MMPs are responsible for hydrolyzing the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during remodeling and degradation processes in the oral environment. MMPs related to the degradation of the collagen matrix of dentin are especially MMPs 2, 8, and 9<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. MMPs get activated when the pH drops in the presence of acids from cariogenic challenges. The subsequent neutralization by salivary buffer systems enhances the degrading activity of the organic matrix<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. In addition, phosphorylated proteins released during the demineralization of the organic matrix can interact with inhibited host MMPs within the lesion and reactivate them, thus enhancing the degrading activity. The activation of MMPs seems to be important for the progression of dentin caries, since they have a crucial role in the collagen breakdown in caries lesions. Individuals with a high concentration of MMPs in saliva present an increased susceptibility to dental caries<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Despite the lack of studies investigating the role of MMPs in dental erosion, processes similar to those occurring for caries could be speculated to occur for erosive lesions. In this sense, the maintenance of the organic matrix on eroded dentin would be likely to postpone further erosion progression, which could be achieved by the use of MMP inhibitors. This strategy has been successfully employed, by using chlorhexidine as an MMP inhibitor, for reduction of the degradation of the dentin hybrid layer both <italic>in vivo</italic>

Considering that the softened zone by erosive challenge seems to be more susceptible to mechanical forces, such as abrasion<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, the protective effect of green tea on erosion associated to immediate abrasion (ERO+I-ABR) or abrasion 30 min after the erosive challenge (ERO+30-mim-ABR) was investigated as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>One hundred and twelve crown dentin specimens (4 x 4 x 3 mm) were prepared from extracted bovine incisors, which had been stored in 0.1% thymol solution (pH 7.0) at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 days. One specimen was obtained from the labial surface of each crown. For preparation of dentin specimens, enamel was completely removed until dentin was just exposed. The exposed dentin was ground flat with water-cooled carborundum discs and polished with felt paper wet with 1 &#x003bc;m diamond spray (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA), resulting in a removal of about 100 &#x003bc;m of the outermost layer. For allocation of the specimens to the groups, the surface microhardness was determined by performing five indentations in different regions of the specimens (Knoop diamond, 10 g, 5 s, HMV-2000; Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The overall range of microhardness was 5575 KHN. Specimens were allocated to groups by stratified randomization according to the mean surface microhardness. All groups presented similar mean microhardness (around 65 KHN).</p><p>In order to maintain reference surfaces for lesion depth determination by profilometry, two layers of nail varnish were applied on half of the surface of each specimen. Individual acrylic palatal appliances with 6 palatal cavities were used for intraoral exposure of the specimens.

On the following 5 days, erosive and abrasive challenges were made extraorally 4 times a day at predetermined times (8, 12, 16 and 20 h) after the principal meals.</p><p>For erosion of the dentin specimens, the volunteers were instructed to remove the appliance and immerse it in a cup containing 150 mL of regular Coke (pH 2.6; Coca-cola Company Spal, Porto Real, RJ, Brazil) for 5 min at room temperature. During this period, the volunteers were instructed to prepare the green tea, according to manufacturers' instructions (Yamamotoyama; Midori Ind&#x000fa;stria de Ch&#x000e1; Ltda, S&#x000e3;o Miguel Arcanjo, SP, Brazil): infusion of 2 g of the herb <italic>(Cammelia sinensis</italic> leaves exposed to steam and presented as a sachet) into 180 mL of boiled water (100&#x000b0; C) for 1 min. The tea was cooled off for 4 min at room temperature. The fluoride content of the tea was 0.87 mg fluoride/L and its pH, 7.0.

Thus, the appliances were re-inserted into the mouth and the volunteers rinsed with 10 mL of green tea or water for 1 min. Subsequently, the appliance was removed for abrasion treatment. While one row remained unbrushed (ERO), the other row was brushed <italic>ex vivo</italic> using a soft end-rounded electric toothbrush (Colgate Montions Multi-action; Colgate-Palmolive Ind. and Com.

The appliances were replaced into the mouth and the volunteers rinsed with water (10 mL, 5 s). After 30 min of erosion, the abrasive treatment was repeated for the 3<sup>rd</sup> row (ERO+30-min-ABR). The rows for the 3 experimental conditions were randomly allocated for each volunteer.</p><p>The volunteers received instructions to wear the appliances continuously for 24 h but to remove them during meals (4 times/day), when the appliance was stored in wet gauze. Seven days prior to the beginning and throughout the experimental phase, the volunteers brushed their teeth with a non-fluoridated dentifrice (Procter and Gamble Co, Cincinnati, OH, USA).

Despite our protocol did not require the volunteers to drink the green tea, if this had to be done there would be no toxicological problems. It has been shown that tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the EGCG content in 8-16 cup of green tea once a day is safe<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. The response variable chosen to assess this effect was contact profilometry, which is widely used for this purpose<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. For this methodology to be used, it is essential to keep the specimens moistened before and during analysis, as done in the present study, in order to avoid shrinkage of collagen fibrils, which could interfere with the results. The green tea reduced significantly dentin wear under erosive/abrasive conditions. Despite using a mechanical stylus, which is expected to cave into the organic material to some extent and give higher values than obtained with an optical device<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, the amount of wear (0.98 &#x003bc;m loss after 100 min of erosive challenge) obtained in the present study was low when compared to a previous study from our research group (3.6 &#x003bc;m loss after 28 min of erosive challenge)<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. This can be explained by the different sensitivities of the equipments and the software used in both studies.</p><p>The protective effect of green tea could not be attributed to its fluoride content, since it was quite similar to that present in the negative control (water from the public supply). Additionally, its protective effect could not be attributed either to the temperature of the rinse, since the water rinse had the same temperature. One possible mechanism of action of green on the reduction of dentin erosion could be the inhibition of MMPs. If it is true, the main responsible for this effect may be the polyphenols. Green tea polyphenols, especially epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), were found to have potent and distinct inhibitory activity against MMPs in cell culture tests<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. EGCG seems to exhibit a hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction with collagenases, which is responsible for the change in the secondary structure of collagenases and consequently for their inhibition<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. The EGCG concentration in the green tea used in the present study was 0.185 mg/mL, which is quite above the reported IC<sub>50</sub> values for the inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which were 10 and 0.6 &#x003bc;g/mL of EGCG, respectively<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>in situ</italic> model used in this study allowed the formation of an acquired salivary pellicle, which might play an important role during the erosive challenge<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Considering the possibility that green tea would inhibit MMP activity and would, in turn, allow the maintenance of an organic layer on the eroded dentin, this model could also allow the MMPs from dentin as well as from saliva to influence the dentin wear. It is known that the saliva-derived MMPs could be involved in the destruction of the organic matrix<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and that the MMP-8 present in saliva may influence negatively the remineralization of demineralized dentin<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>Erosion was produced by a cola drink, as it is one of the most widely consumed soft drinks and exhibits erosive potential<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Erosion was performed by extraoral immersion in cola for 5 min, in order to produce the demineralization. It is also probable that the low pH of the drink has induced the activation of dentin-derived MMPs and saliva-derived MMPs, when the volunteers drank one sip of the beverage<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. However, it is generally regarded that MMPs, although activated, cannot degrade the organic matrix of dentin at acidic pH<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. In this protocol, the interval between each erosive challenge (&#x0003e;2 h), could allow for remineralization and also pH neutralization, which is essential for enhancing the degrading activity of the organic matrix by MMPs. However, it must be acknowledged that the protocol employed in the present study does not allow the conclusion that the effect of green tea on reducing the wear of dentin specimens was due to its inhibitory effects on MMPs activity, since we did not test this directly. Further studies focusing on the determination of the activity of MMPs in the organic layer overlying the eroded dentin after an erosive challenge could be instructive on this matter. The verification of the organic material on dentin surface by SEM could also bring additional useful information.</p><p>Tooth wear is a multifactorial condition caused by chemical (erosion) and mechanical (abrasion and attrition) processes, since the softened zone by erosive challenge is more susceptible to mechanical forces, such as abrasion<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Thus, studies regarding tooth wear have to consider both chemical and mechanical challenges to simulate the clinical situation. This aspect is especially important in eroded dentin, where the exposed organic matrix acts as a protective layer against further demineralization, and excessive toothbrushing could impair this matrix. However, a recent report suggested that the demineralized organic layer developed after erosive challenges was unaffected by brushing<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. To simulate abrasive conditions which might occur during oral hygiene treatment, brushing abrasion of each specimen was performed for 30 s each cycle.</p><p>Regarding the abrasive wear of eroded dentin, the present results confirm previous studies showing that abrasion subsequently after an erosive attack can increase wear of acid-softened tooth surfaces<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. However, 30 min delay of abrasion was not able to reduce dentin wear compared to brushing immediately after erosion, which was also shown in previous studies<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Thus, under clinical conditions, the delay of 30 min in toothbrushing after erosion might be ineffective on the reduction of dentin wear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results of the present study, it may be concluded that the green tea reduces the dentin wear under erosive/abrasive conditions, but additional studies are required to confirm its mechanism of action on this process. If it is confirmed that the mechanism of action of green tea on the reduction of dentin wear occurs via MMP inhibition, this will open a new perspective for the prevention/treatment of these lesions, by the design of new products containing MMP inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge <funding-source>FAPESP</funding-source> (grant
