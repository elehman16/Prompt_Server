The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for children with dental anxiety in specialist pediatric dentistry. The study used a parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial design. The primary outcome measure was the behavioral avoidance test; assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Participants were 8 boys and 22 girls 7 to 18 y old (mean &#x000b1; SD, 10 &#x000b1; 3.1). Children fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for dental anxiety were randomized to CBT (<underline>n</underline> = 13) or treatment as usual (<underline>n</underline> = 17), such as various sedation methods. Psychologists provided 10 h of CBT based on a treatment manual. Treatments were conducted in a naturalistic real-world clinical setting. Assessments were conducted before the treatment, 3 mo after the start of treatment, and at 1-y follow-up. The analyses of the primary outcome measure by repeated-measures analysis of variance and independent <underline>t</underline> test showed that children receiving CBT made superior, statistically significant improvements at follow-up (16.8 &#x000b1; 2.4) compared with treatment as usual (11.4 &#x000b1; 3.1, <underline>P</underline> &#x0003c; 0.01). A large between-group effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s <underline>d</underline> = 1.9) was found. Following treatment, 73% of those in the CBT group managed all stages of the dental procedures included in the behavioral avoidance test compared with 13% in the treatment-as-usual group. Furthermore, 91% in the CBT group compared with 25% in the treatment-as-usual group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for dental anxiety at the 1-y follow-up according to the secondary outcome measure. Measures of dental anxiety and self-efficacy showed larger improvements in the CBT group compared with controls. We conclude that CBT is an efficacious treatment for children and adolescents with dental anxiety and should be made accessible in pediatric dentistry (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01798355).</p><p><bold>Knowledge transfer statement:</bold> The results of this study can be used by decision makers and clinicians when planning to implement evidence-based treatment in pediatric dentistry and give children and adolescents access to methods for treating dental anxiety. The results can also be used by parents of children with dental anxiety when asking dentists to cooperate with psychologists using cognitive behavioral therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pediatric dentistry</kwd><kwd>clinical psychology</kwd><kwd>self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>evidence-based dentistry</kwd><kwd>dental fear</kwd><kwd>behavioral problem</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2380084416661473"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dental anxiety affects approximately 9% of children and adolescents (<xref rid="bibr14-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Klingberg and Broberg 2007</xref>). The fourth edition text revision of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>) classifies dental anxiety as a form of specific phobia (<xref rid="bibr3-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association [APA] 2000</xref>). The condition is characterized by marked fear and anxiety response when the individual is exposed to dental care. It leads to intense distress and/or avoidance (APA 2000). Dental anxiety often manifests itself during childhood and is associated with poor oral health such as untreated caries, missing teeth, or periodontal problems (<xref rid="bibr6-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Crego et al. 2014</xref>). These negative consequences also include sense of embarrassment related to poor oral health, reduced self-confidence, and increased absence from work (<xref rid="bibr26-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Wide Boman et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>Pediatric dentistry commonly employs several methods to deal with dental anxiety, which include tell-show-do, premedication with midazolam, nitrous oxide sedation, and general anesthesia (<xref rid="bibr13-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Klingberg et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al. 2010</xref>). A recent systematic review, however, reported that the quality of the evidence supporting these common methods in pediatric dentistry is low or very low (<xref rid="bibr18-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Mej&#x000e0;re et al. 2015</xref>).

Self-referral was not allowed, so all potential participants were referred from a dentist in general dentistry.</p><p>Participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) the patient and all primary caregivers agreed to participate in the study, 2) the patient had a principal diagnosis of specific phobia (dental anxiety or intraoral injection phobia) according to the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>, 3) no other psychiatric or developmentally related diagnoses considered to be the primary diagnosis, 4) the patient was not receiving concurrent psychological treatments and did not have appointments for psychological examination elsewhere, and 5) the patient needed dental care but not emergency care.</p><p>In addition to the eligibility criteria above, parents and children needed to fulfill some practical requirements for participation. They had to have 1) the time and opportunity to take time off from school to go to a specialist clinic for treatment, 2) a stable living situation with no family crisis such as an ongoing divorce, 3) no serious somatic illness that would disrupt daily life and hinder participation in the study, 4) access to a computer at home or in a public place for answering the online questionnaires related to the study, and 5) motivation to participate in the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2380084416661473"><title>Interventions</title><p>We based this trial on CBT models for treating anxiety disorders and specific phobias (<xref rid="bibr17-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Lyneham et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Beidas et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2012</xref>). Our research team developed the therapist manual, 40 pages in total.</p><p>The patients, parents, and therapists met for 10 h of CBT at 2 pediatric dental clinics in Stockholm. Sessions 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6 were offered during the first 3 wk. Double sessions were offered at the same day with 15 min of rest between the sessions. Sessions 7 to 10 were offered during the remaining 8 wk (1 session/h every other week). The central components of these sessions were behavioral analyses, psychoeducation, parent education, exposure to dental procedures both in vivo and in films, relaxation techniques, procedural pain management information, and cognitive restructuring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2380084416661473">Table 1</xref>). Patients underwent exposures by watching short films showing a child going through various dental procedures during the sessions with psychologist. Children and parents had access to dental tools and materials such as a probe, cotton balls, topical anesthetic, a spiral-shaped suction nozzle, and needle to practice at home. The manual and films are available in Swedish and can be obtained by emailing the corresponding author. Treatment was adapted to the child&#x02019;s age, and the younger the child, the more parental support and behavioral techniques (less cognitive interventions). The therapists conducting the treatment were 3 licensed psychologists with at least 5 y of psychology training at university and 1 y of clinical training under supervision. All therapists had a CBT qualification and between 6 mo and 8 y of experience delivering CBT in pediatric dentistry. To increase treatment adherence and therapist competence, the psychologist with 8 y of experience gave weekly supervision to the other 2 therapists during the study. Treatment fidelity was continuously discussed during these supervisions. The therapists were also given access to checklists for each session (maintaining the major feature of the session). The total number of dental visits varied depending on the patient&#x02019;s dental treatment needs. Dental treatment began earliest after session 6 in the CBT group. The treatment as usual consisted of methods such as, tell-show-do, distraction, premedication with midazolam, nitrous oxide sedation, and general anesthesia. Appendix A (available online) describes treatment as usual in more detail.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2380084416661473" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Description of Session Content.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2380084416661473-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;1.

The version of the BAT used in this study was adapted to pediatric dentistry and more standardized than the earlier version. During the test, a dentist would expose participants to a potential maximum of 18 hierarchically organized dental clinical situations such as entering the dental treatment room, opening the mouth, injection of local anesthesia (a quarter of a cartridge), and drilling (a small piece of composite was etched to the buccal surface of a mandibular molar, which made it possible to simulate drilling in a tooth. This piece of composite was thereafter removed). Children were instructed by the dentist to try their best to complete the list of different dentistry procedures but were also given the possibility to discontinue at any moment (without being persuaded by parents or dentists to continue). The score for each child was sum of stages from 0 (not entering the dentist room) to 18 (managing the drill), 1 point for each stage. Measurement fidelity was ensured through detailed test manual and assessor training. A psychologist monitored and maintained the measurement fidelity by continuous discussions with dentists and dental assistants conducting the BAT. The Swedish BAT and its manual are available on request. The assessments were conducted before the treatment, 3 mo after the treatment, and at 1-y follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2380084416661473"><title>Other Outcome Measures</title><p>The secondary outcome measure was the presence or absence of dental anxiety as measured in the Structured Clinical Interview for Dental Anxiety (SCI-DA).

The CFSS-DS consists of 15 items (scale 1&#x02013;5, from no fear to high fear) measuring the degree of fear associated with various situations in dental and medical care and interactions with people unfamiliar to the child. We also used the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Specific Phobias (SEQ-SP). It consists of 14 questions (scale 1&#x02013;5, from low to high self-efficacy) assessing the level of self-efficacy, defined as people&#x02019;s belief in their ability to accomplish given achievements (<xref rid="bibr4-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Bandura 1977</xref>).

Two participants in the CBT group dropped out after randomization and before receiving treatment. In the first case, the parent reported that the child had received treatment during travel abroad due to an acute need for treatment and required no further dental treatment. In the second case, a parent got a new job and stated the child could not participate because the parent had difficulties taking time off to visit the clinic during office hours. Also, despite several reminders, 1 parent and child in the treatment-as-usual group did not complete the CFSS-DS and SEQ-SP after treatment, and another participant in the control group did not show up for the 1-y follow-up visit and measurement. Furthermore, parental outcome for 1 teenager among controls could not be obtained. One young participant (CBT group) had major difficulties understanding and answering the self-efficacy questionnaire, and we made the decision in consultation with the assessor not to include scores for the SEQ-SP. All other patients in both groups completed their treatments and measurements. Information from dental records showed that the necessary dental treatment needs for participants were met in both intervention groups. In the CBT group, 9% of participants (1 person) needed adjunctive midazolam sedation. In the treatment-as-usual group, 50% of participants were treated using nitrous oxide, midazolam, or general anesthesia.</p><fig id="fig1-2380084416661473" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure.</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing patient selection, randomization, dropout, and follow-up assessments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2380084416661473-fig1"/></fig></sec><sec id="section16-2380084416661473"><title>Primary Outcome (Clinician Administered)</title><p>There was a statistically significant interaction of group and time in the ability to cope with dental procedures according to the BAT, the primary outcome measure, <italic>F</italic>(2, 50) = 5.78, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006, partial &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.19.

Furthermore, 91% in the CBT group compared with 25% in the control group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for dental anxiety at the 1-y follow-up. We chose a 1-y follow-up period because it is common in both CBT studies and in dentistry (1-y recall interval).</p><p>Effect sizes for both the CBT and controls regarding the BAT and CFSS-DS outcome measures were large, indicating that we achieved our aim of having treatment as usual as an active control group. The CBT group, however, showed a larger effect size than the control group. Treatment effects were maintained at the 1-y follow-up. One interesting finding was that the effect size related to self-efficacy was high for the CBT group and low for the control group. This, in addition to a significant increase in the SEQ-SP from before treatment to the after-treatment assessment and 1-y follow-up seen only in the CBT group, could support studies that suggest self-efficacy as a mechanism of change in CBT (<xref rid="bibr9-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al. 2013</xref>). Findings in the present study are consistent with results of CBT and its efficiency in treating children and adolescents with anxiety disorders (<xref rid="bibr11-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">In-Albon and Schneider 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>According to repeated-measures ANOVA, interaction effects of time and group were nonsignificant for several secondary outcomes. This could be due to the absence of improvement from the after-treatment assessment to the 1-y follow-up for the CFSS-DS (C &#x00026; P) and SEQ-SP. We did not offer patients booster sessions (since the controls could not get this intervention, and it would disrupt the randomized controlled trial design), which could explain the lack of improvement between the after-treatment assessment and the 1-y follow-up.</p><p>Most children and adolescents in our study stated that intraoral injection was one of their main fears in dentistry. This made the CFSS-DS inappropriate as the primary outcome measure, since it contains only 1 item measuring injection fear, and the literature suggests that the CFSS-DS cannot measure changes in the degree of injection fear properly (<xref rid="bibr16-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Lopes et al. 2013</xref>). Other reasons for choosing the BAT as our primary outcome included its greater capacity to reflect the child&#x02019;s actual performance in dentistry and that it can be measured by a blinded assessor, which increases accuracy and reduces detection bias.</p><p>The necessary dental treatment needs of participants in both intervention groups were met according to information from dental records. This suggest that treatment-as-usual methods such as sedation techniques make it possible for children with dental anxiety to undergo dental treatment in specialist pediatric dentistry. Our study shows that these methods in contrast to CBT cannot sufficiently influence the behavioral and emotional variables important for clinically significant and sustainable psychological change.</p></sec><sec id="section25-2380084416661473"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is limited by the number of randomized patients, which may reduce the representativeness of the sample and create difficulties in generalizing the results. The reason for the small sample size in this study was difficulty in recruiting and finding participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were willing to participate in a psychological scientific study. The individuals we invited to participate in the study were a mixed group of referred patients (from general dentists) that included patients with behavior management problems, dental fear, and primary psychiatric diagnoses other than dental anxiety. Some were receiving ongoing psychological treatment elsewhere, which led to their exclusion. Our inclusion criteria were, perhaps, too strict. But, since this is the first randomized controlled trial of CBT in pediatric dentistry, we aimed for high internal validity rather than high external validity. The literature recognizes the difficulties in recruiting participants with a specific phobia diagnosis in general and with dental anxiety in particular (<xref rid="bibr2-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Antony and Barlow 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Wide Boman et al. 2014</xref>). Another limitation is related to the use of treatment as usual as the control group. This meant that we could not match the number of dental visits in our intervention groups.</p></sec><sec id="section26-2380084416661473"><title>Implications</title><p>As stated in a recent meta-analysis, it is uncertain if methods commonly used in pediatric dentistry to manage dental anxiety can influence behavioral problems sufficiently (<xref rid="bibr18-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Mej&#x000e0;re et al. 2015</xref>). The results of this study show that it is feasible to conduct CBT for children and adolescents with dental anxiety in dentistry. The treatment approach is effective in increasing a patient&#x02019;s ability to manage dental procedures, increase self-efficacy, and reduce fear related to specific dental procedures. Strengths of this study include its randomization, manual-based treatment, standardized masked BAT, and 4-fold measurement (child, parent, dentist, and psychologist assessments). Furthermore, the trial was conducted in a naturalistic real-world clinical setting, which suggests that the results could be an important and promising treatment alternative for children and adolescents with dental anxiety and should be made accessible for this patient group. Nevertheless, there is a need for more randomized controlled trials of CBT for children and adolescents in dental settings. There is also a need to modify and adapt CBT for dental organizations that do not have access to psychologists and for groups of patients in pediatric dentistry who cannot benefit from the traditional face-to-face version of the CBT treatment (e.g., patients and parents who cannot take time off from work or school to visit a psychologist). Studies examining the efficiency of shorter CBT interventions such as 1-session treatment would also be important to conduct in pediatric dentistry (<xref rid="bibr10-2380084416661473" ref-type="bibr">Haukeb&#x000f8; et al. 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="section27-2380084416661473"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>S.
