Vaccinees' V3 Abs were highly cross-reactive with cyclic V3 peptides (cV3s) from diverse virus subtypes. Sieve analysis of CRF01_AE breakthrough viruses from 43 vaccine- and 66 placebo-recipients demonstrated an estimated vaccine efficacy of 85% against viruses with amino acids mismatching the vaccine at V3 site 317 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004) and 52% against viruses matching the vaccine at V3 site 307 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). This analysis was supported by data showing that vaccinees' plasma Abs were less reactive with I<sup>307</sup> when replaced with residues found more often in vaccinees' breakthrough viruses. Simultaneously, viruses with mutations at F<sup>317</sup> were less infectious, possibly due to the contribution of F<sup>317</sup> to optimal formation of the V3 hydrophobic core. These data suggest that RV144-induced V3-specific Abs imposed immune pressure on infecting viruses and inform efforts to design an HIV vaccine.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The RV144 vaccine reduced infection by viruses with isoleucine in V3 position 307.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Many vaccine-induced antibodies are cross-reactive and target an epitope including I<sup>307</sup>.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>There was selection for breakthrough viruses carrying F<sup>317</sup> in V3 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004).</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>F<sup>317</sup> is needed to maintain optimal infectivity.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>F<sup>317</sup> is a poor or non-contact residue for vaccine induced V3 antibodies.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Antibody</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The vaccine tested in the RV144 Thai clinical trial provided modest protection in healthy heterosexual individuals against HIV-1 infection. To date this is the only HIV clinical trial to demonstrate vaccine efficacy (VE), albeit at a level of 31.2% (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009</xref>). A case&#x02013;control study designed to identify immune correlates of reduced infection risk demonstrated that high levels of antibodies (Abs) directed against the V1V2 region of the virus gp120 envelope glycoprotein were associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection, while high levels of Env-specific plasma IgA were associated with an increased risk (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>). The V1V2 vaccine-induced Abs were shown to be broadly reactive with the V2 region of multiple subtypes despite immunization with immunogens from only subtypes B and CRF01_AE (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic studies that compared the V1V2 region of viruses infecting placebo and vaccine recipients identified two positions in V2, 169 and 181, that distinguished viruses from vaccine recipients, resulting in VEs of 48% and 78%, respectively (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>). This sieve analysis complemented the finding of an association between high V1V2-binding Abs and reduced HIV-1 acquisition, and provided independent evidence that vaccine-induced V2 Ab responses plausibly had a role in the reduced rate of infection associated with the RV144 vaccine regimen (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Pollara et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Additional analyses showed that plasma Abs from RV144 vaccinees reactive in a microarray to a linear V3 peptide from CRF01_AE were also an inverse correlate of infection risk, but only in vaccine recipients who had lower levels of Env-specific plasma IgA and aggregate neutralizing Ab activity (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et al., 2013</xref>), and V3-specific Abs from RV144 vaccinees were shown to capture infectious virions, including the vaccine strain CM244 (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). These and previous data (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Karasavvas et al., 2012</xref>) generated the hypothesis that IgG Abs to epitopes in both the V2 and V3 regions of gp120 are part of a complex interplay of immune responses that contributed to the reduced rate of infection in RV144 participants, and suggested that further delineation of additional elements of the V3 Ab response might reveal important information about the factors involved in blocking HIV infection.</p><p>Extensive data in the literature support a possible protective role for Abs directed against the crown of the V3 loop. The proof of principle that human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) specific for the V3 loop could react with and neutralize many strains of HIV, including lab-adapted and primary isolates from several HIV subtypes, was established 20&#x000a0;years ago (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Conley et al., 1994</xref>).

A second type of V3-directed Ab is glycan-dependent, specific for the base of V3 and the adjacent glycan in C4; these Abs are extremely broadly reactive and potent, but are induced in only a small percentage of infected individuals, and their heavy chains are extensively mutated from germline (27&#x02013;34%), reflective of somatic hypermutation which requires several years of exposure to antigen (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Pejchal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>).</p><p>An early indication that V3 bears conserved structural elements allowing the broad cross-reactivity of V3 Abs directed to the crown of the V3 loop came from data showing that V3 participates in the binding of gp120 to the cell surface coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 and in determining virus tropism (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Shioda et al., 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Shioda et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Trkola et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 1997</xref>). Subsequently, extensive crystallographic studies of V3 mAbs in complex with V3 peptides revealed a generic &#x003b2;-strand/turn/&#x003b2;-strand structure for the V3 crown encompassing a hydrophobic core (often composed of the highly conserved amino acids I<sup>307</sup>, I<sup>309</sup> and F<sup>317</sup>) and a hydrophilic face (including amino acids at positions 306, 308 and 316 which are positions displaying considerable variation) (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Almond et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner and Cardozo, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In order to examine the V3 Abs induced by the RV144 vaccine regimen, the immunochemical characteristics of V3-specific Abs in vaccine recipients were studied. Simultaneously, V3 sequence variation in viruses infecting vaccine and placebo recipients were compared and key V3 residues were analyzed to understand their contribution to optimal V3 structure and function.

The plasma were derived from study participants and consisted of plasma from 20 placebo recipients and 40 vaccine recipients who were HIV seronegative at the end of the study period; the specimens used had been collected at weeks 0, 26 (two weeks after the last immunization) and 52.</p><p>Cyclic V3 peptides representing this region from subtypes A, B and C and from CRF01_AE (AE) and CRF02_AG (AG) (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) were used to assess the cross-reactivity of V3 Abs in the plasma of the panel of RV144 vaccine and placebo recipients. All specimens were tested at a dilution of 1:100. The response rate to cV3s by vaccinees' specimens at week 26 ranged from 87.5% (35/40) for cV3<sub>AE(92TH023)</sub>, to 95% (38/40) for cV3<sub>AE(244)</sub> and to 100% for consensus A, AG, and C, and subtype B strains MN and BaL cV3s (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). Thus, like the V2 Ab response (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2014</xref>), the V3 Ab response generated by the RV144 immunization regimen was highly cross-reactive. The strongest response was detected with the cV3 peptide homologous to that of the gp120<sub>MN</sub> protein boost, while the weakest responses were detected to the cV3s CRF01_AE (A244 and 92TH023) despite the fact that gp120<sub>AE(A244)</sub> was also used as a gp120 protein boost (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The data were also analyzed to determine how well the responses to various cV3s correlated with one another. These data, shown in Supplementary data Fig. S1, indicate that Spearman correlation coefficients range from 0.48 to 0.98 for the wild type cV3s. For example, a correlation of 0.80 was achieved for reactivity with cV3<sub>92TH02</sub> and cV3<sub>Consensus A</sub> and a correlation of 0.94 was achieved for cV3<sub>BaL</sub> and cV3<sub>Consensus A</sub> indicating that the strength of responses correlated across clades. These data, generated with cV3s, confirm previously reported microarray data with linear V3 peptides (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et al., 2013</xref>) and indicate that the V3-specific Abs were preferentially induced by gp120<sub>MN</sub>.

Vaccine efficacy (VE) was increased to 52% (CI: 20&#x02013;72%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004) against viruses with I<sup>307</sup>, i.e., matched with the residue found at this site in the vaccine (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>, upper left and Table S2); there was no significant vaccine effect with viruses that were mismatched at position 307, i.e., I307X (VE&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.99, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>, upper right and Table S2); this corresponds to a typical sieve effect.

Furthermore, while neutralization by vaccinees' specimens was weak, demonstrable neutralizing activity was due primarily to V3-specific Abs (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if the V3 sieve analysis and these previous studies were consistent with the immunochemical characteristics of V3 Abs in vaccinees' plasma, specimens from the plasma set described in the <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref> section were analyzed for their relative reactivities with cV3s carrying substitutions at position 307 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>), a primary contact residue for highly cross-reactive V3 Abs (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Almond et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>).

Notably, F<sup>317</sup> is known to often form part of the hydrophobic core of V3 that contributes to the conformation of V3 but has little or no direct contact with V3 human monoclonal Abs (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stanfield et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Stanfield et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>), thus obviating binding experiments with F317X V3 peptides variants. However, structural data suggested an explanation for the conservation of F<sup>317</sup> in viruses infecting vaccinees: F<sup>317</sup> could play a structural role affecting virus fitness, similar to the role played by the V2 residue I<sup>181</sup> (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Spurrier et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated the frequency and nature of mutations at position 317 and the effect that substitutions at this site could have on infectivity. Phenylalanine is present at position 317 in 5263/6010 (88%) viruses from multiple subtypes and CRFs that were previously analyzed (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Almond et al., 2010</xref>). Only two vaccinees carried breakthrough viruses with F317X; the V3 sequences of these viruses are shown in <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>, revealing that these viruses had five and six mutations in V3 when compared to the V3 of A244 and most of these mutations are rare in circulating CRF01_AE viruses (<xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>).</p><p>To determine if substitutions at F<sup>317</sup> affect infectivity, an F317L or an F317W mutation was made in CM244 and 92TH023. These are mutations that occur at F<sup>317</sup> in the two F317X escape viruses in vaccinees (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). For both CRF01_AE strains tested, substitution of F<sup>317</sup> with leucine reduced infectivity by ~&#x000a0;65&#x02013;85%, and substitution at this site with tryptophan rendered both pseudoviruses non-infectious (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). An F317A mutant of 92TH023, bearing another substitution that is rare but occurs at this site in nature, was also non-infectious (D.

This selection is based on both structural and functional parameters, i.e., virus selection in the presence of Abs induced by the RV144 vaccine appears to be related to both the packing of the hydrophobic core of V3 which includes I<sup>307</sup>, I<sup>309</sup> and F<sup>317</sup> and the impact of the structure of the hydrophobic core on the accessibility of the most immunogenic V3 epitope (which includes I<sup>307</sup>) (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>3.5</label><title>Structural Analysis of the V3 Hydrophobic Core</title><p>V3 structures in complex with mAbs 447-52D (PDB ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:4M1D" id="ir0045">4M1D</ext-link>) and 2557 (PDB ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:3LMR" id="ir0050">3LMR</ext-link>) show that the V3 hydrophobic core can occur on either side of the V3 crown (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Killikelly et al., 2013</xref>). For the amino acids identified in the sieve analysis at position 317 (Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile, <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B), all side chains of the V3 crown were energy-minimized by a Monte Carlo procedure using the ICM software package (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abagyan et al., 1997</xref>). The V3 hydrophobic core composed of residues 307, 309 and 317 was then analyzed for their side chain contact areas. In the 447-52D bound conformation, the residue 317 side chain contact areas in the core were calculated to be 12.4&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 6.2&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 16.8&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 12.4&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, and 0.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, for amino acids Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile, respectively. Similarly for the case of mAb 2557 V3-bound conformation, the calculated side chain contact areas were 16.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 2.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 22.6&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 17.1&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, 12.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The results show that F<sup>317</sup> provides the best measure for formation of the hydrophobic core in terms of side chain contact areas and hydrophobicity, except in the case of Trp. The bulky side chain of a Trp residue may be suboptimal for packing against V1V2 in the trimer (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>), and as noted above, the F317W mutation abrogates infectivity (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). Notably, the two F317X breakthrough viruses in vaccinees (with W<sup>317</sup> or L<sup>317</sup>) displayed rare mutations in the crown of V3 (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>) suggesting that for survival, viruses with F317X require extensive V3 mutations to simultaneously infect and escape Ab pressure. It is noteworthy that both of these two X<sup>317</sup> vaccine breakthrough viruses retained the I<sup>307</sup> residue. Moreover, in the just published 3.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution structure of BG505 SOSIP.664 (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Pancera, Zhou et al. 2014</xref>), the hydrophobic core of V3 has exactly the same conformation as that recognized by V3 mAb 2557, and it packs under several hydrophobic residues of V2. Thus the computational analysis reported above based on the 2557-bound V3 structure is consistent with the SOSIP conformation. Interestingly, V3 mAb 447-52D was shown to be able to bind the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Pancera et al. 2014</xref>). This indicates that V3 can swing out from under V2, even in the stabilized SOSIP, and, in addition, the V3 hydrophobic core can flip from the conformation recognized by mAb 2557 to that recognized by mAb 447-52D (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>The RV144 clinical trial showed an estimated VE of 31.2%, and that V2-directed IgG Abs were found to be a significant inverse correlate of infection risk.

These residues are highly conserved, with I<sup>307</sup> and F<sup>317</sup> each present in eight of nine HIV subtype consensus sequences (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2009</xref>), but whereas position 307 is a major contact residue, position 317 has minor or no contact with most V3-specific human mAbs (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stanfield et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Stanfield et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This extensive body of literature is augmented by studies of two mAbs, CH22 and CH23, which were isolated from vaccinees in the RV135 trial who received a vaccine regimen identical to that of RV144 (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>). The epitopes recognized by these two mAbs are glycan-independent and react with V3 linear peptides in the crown of the V3 loop containing I<sup>307</sup> and F<sup>317</sup> (shown in bold and underlined: RKR<bold><underline>I</underline></bold>HIGPGRA<bold><underline>F</underline></bold>YTT and NTRTS<bold><underline>I</underline></bold>NIGPGQV<bold><underline>F</underline></bold>Y, respectively). Notably, these are not highly mutated Abs, having VH mutation frequencies of 3.7% and 4.5%, respectively, and each has a CDR H3 of 11 amino acids, characteristics similar to those found commonly in human Abs (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Tiller et al., 2007</xref>). CH22 administered to macaques was able to protect against infection with SHIV BaL P4 (Haynes BF and Santra S, personal communication), extending similar work reported earlier (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Watkins et al., 2011</xref>) and providing new data on the breadth of reactivity and the protective effects of V3 Abs. These data add support for the hypothesis that vaccine-induced V3-specific (and/or V2 specific) Abs contributed to the reduction in infection rate in vaccinees. While it is known that V3 Abs are induced early after infection and can drive rapid viral escape (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Tomaras et al., 2008</xref>), the fact that the sieve analysis showed a difference between breakthrough viruses of vaccine and placebo recipients suggests that the V3 Abs exerted immune pressure in the vaccinees and therefore the vaccine-induced Abs had a biologic effect on the viruses that emerged in the setting of human infection.</p><p>The results of the RV144 study, identifying inverse correlates of risk related to levels of both V2 and V3 Abs (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et al., 2013</xref>) recapitulate some of the many V2 and V3 commonalities. First, both crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of gp120 have shown that V2 and V3 are closely packed together at the apex of the envelope trimer (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bartesaghi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Julien et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>). Both V2 and V3 induce highly cross-reactive Abs in HIV-infected individuals (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 2012</xref>); and V2 and V3 induce both glycan-independent (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Gorny et al., 2002</xref>) and glycan-dependent Abs (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Pejchal et al., 2011</xref>). Most striking, perhaps, are the similarities revealed by the RV144 sieve analyses of V2, published earlier (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2012</xref>), and the sieve analysis related to V3, described above. These studies suggest, independently, that immune pressure is exerted on viruses that match the vaccine at V2 position 169 and also at V3 position 307 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). Vaccine efficacy for viruses matched with the vaccine at 169 is 48% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004); VE for viruses matched with the vaccine at 307 is 52% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). The analogy continues to hold from the sieve analyses of site 181 in V2 and site 317 in V3 (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). For these latter positions, there was an atypical sieve effect with a VE of 78% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003) against viruses with mutations at V2 site 181 (I181X), and a VE of 85% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004) against viruses with mutations at V3 site 317 (F317X).</p><p>The implications of the sieve analyses along with immunologic and viral data suggest that both positions 169 (V2) and 307 (V3) are subject to immune pressure by RV144-induced Abs that target 169 (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2013</xref>) and 307 (XP Kong, personal communication and <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the amino acid at 181 is either a poor or non-contact residue for RV144-induced V2-specific mAbs CH58 and CH59 or for mAbs that target the conformational &#x0201c;V2i&#x0201d; epitope (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Mayr et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Spurrier et al., 2014</xref>), and the amino acid at position 317 is a minor or non-contact residue for V3 mAbs (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Stanfield et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Burke et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). The conservation of V2 site 181 and V3 site 317 and their preferential presence in vaccine breakthrough viruses leads to the hypothesis that these residues are not subject to direct immune pressure but instead, in the presence of the vaccine-induced Abs, must be retained in order to preserve the optimal structures of V2 and V3 that permit efficient infection (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Spurrier et al., 2014</xref>). It is noteworthy however, that statistical significance was not achieved for covariation between positions 307 and 317 within either the vaccine or placebo groups. In the vaccine group, 38 of 43 subjects were matched to both 181 and 317, and one subject was mismatched to both. In the placebo group, 40 of 65 subjects were matched to both 181 and 317, and 6 were mismatched to both (one placebo recipient subject was excluded for this analysis because of a sequencing artifact at site 317) (see Table S4).</p><p>The data relevant to immune pressure exerted by the immune response to the RV144 vaccine regimen have important implications for the design of an effective HIV vaccine. A 31% reduction in infection rate was achieved in RV144. The data support the hypothesis that broadly cross-clade reactive V3 and V2 Abs (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2014</xref>) played an important role in reducing the infection rate despite the fact that the vaccine-induced Abs display modest mutation rates from germline, i.e., &#x0003c;&#x000a0;5%, and none of the mAbs isolated to date from RV135 or RV144 vaccinees possess long CDR H3 regions (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Abs mediating ADCC also displayed modest levels of VH somatic mutation (0.5 to 1.5%) and showed considerable cross-clade activity (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bonsignori et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although there was poor neutralizing Ab activity demonstrated in RV144 plasma (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>), this must be interpreted cautiously since negative data in vitro do not prove that virus neutralization is not occurring in vivo. Thus, while a vaccine that reduces infection risk by only 31% surely needs improvement, the data available from RV144 suggest that vaccine-induced conventional Abs, i.e., those with modest rates of mutations in germline (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;5% VH mutation rates) (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Montefiori et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) and without abnormally long CDR H3 regions or other structural anomalies, if targeted to the correct epitopes and present at appropriate levels over months to years should be effective (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner, 2014</xref>). While desirable, broadly neutralizing, potent Abs that carry long CDR H3 regions and display extreme mutation rates from germline (as reviewed in <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>) have not yet been induced by any immunization regimen and, as demonstrated by RV144, are not necessarily needed to reduce infection risk. Therefore, the results of RV144 support a targeted effort to improve the design of immunogens such as those used in RV144, as well as recombinant epitope-scaffold immunogens to be used in prime-boost regimens that will induce conventional Abs now shown to be correlates of reduced risk of infection (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bonsignori et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Haynes et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Zolla-Pazner et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides important new information supporting a critical role for vaccine-induced conventional antibodies in reducing the risk of HIV infection. In addition to immune pressure exerted by V2-specific antibodies, we show here that V3-specific antibodies also exerted immune pressure on breakthrough viruses infecting vaccinees in the RV144 vaccine trial. The results reveal the similarities in immune pressure exerted on the V2 and V3 regions of HIV-1 gp120 in vaccine recipients. These data inform the process of designing more effective candidate vaccines for reducing the rate of HIV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><title>Conflict of Interest &#x00026; Author Declaration</title><p>We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0330"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abagyan</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Batalov</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Homology modeling with internal coordinate mechanics: deformation zone mapping and improvements of models via conformational search</article-title><source>Proteins</source><issue>Suppl. 1</issue><year>1997</year><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>37</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9485492</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Almond</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Structural conservation predominates over sequence variability in the crown of HIV-1'S V3 loop</article-title><source>AIDS Res.
