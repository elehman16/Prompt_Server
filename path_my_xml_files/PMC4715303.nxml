Directing interventions towards older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints may provide the greatest impact on dementia incidence and prevalence. Risk factors for cognitive and functional deficits are multifactorial in nature; many are cardiovascular disease risk factors and are lifestyle-mediated. Evidence suggests that multiple-modality exercise programs can provide cognitive and functional benefits that extend beyond what can be achieved from cognitive, aerobic, or resistance training alone, and preliminary evidence suggests that novel mind-motor interventions (i.e., Square Stepping Exercise; SSE) can benefit cognition and functional fitness. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether multiple-modality exercise combined with mind-motor interventions can benefit diverse cognitive and functional outcomes in older adults with cognitive complaints.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Multiple-Modality, Mind-Motor (M4) study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the cognitive and functional impact of combined physical and cognitive training among community-dwelling adults with self-reported cognitive complaints who are 55&#x000a0;years of age or older. Participants are randomized to a Multiple-Modality and Mind-Motor (M4) intervention group or a Multiple-Modality (M2) comparison group. Participants exercise for 60&#x000a0;minutes/day, 3-days/week for 24&#x000a0;weeks and are assessed at baseline, 24&#x000a0;weeks and 52&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome is global cognitive function at 24&#x000a0;weeks, derived from the Cambridge Brain Sciences computerized cognitive battery. Secondary outcomes are: i) global cognitive function at 52&#x000a0;weeks; ii) domain-specific cognitive function at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks; iii) mobility (gait characteristics under single and dual-task conditions and balance); and 3) vascular health (blood pressure and carotid arterial measurements). We will analyze data based on an intent-to-treat approach, using mixed models for repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The design features of the M4 trial and the methods included to address previous limitations within cognitive and exercise research will be discussed. Results from the M4 trial will provide evidence of combined multiple-modality and cognitive training among older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints on cognitive, mobility-related and vascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02136368?term=NCT02136368&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02136368</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multiple-modality</kwd><kwd>mind-motor</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>cognitive complaints</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>mobility</kwd><kwd>vascular health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 130474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrella</surname><given-names>Robert J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>St. Joseph's Health Care Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>048-1415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrella</surname><given-names>Robert J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008958</institution-id><institution>Lawson Health Research Institute (CA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gill</surname><given-names>Dawn P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008958</institution-id><institution>Lawson Health Research Institute (CA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gregory</surname><given-names>Michael A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Cognitive impairment in aging</title><p>With the global population aging, there is a growing urgency to identify the most effective strategies to prevent cognitive decline. Early prevention strategies may provide the greatest impact on the incidence of cognitive impairment in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With the goal of intervening earlier, it is of interest to examine non-demented older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints, regardless of whether they have objective evidence of impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The estimated prevalence of cognitive complaints in older adults ranges between 11 % and 56 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cognitive complaints have been associated with poorer scores on objective cognitive assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], as well as cortical and hippocampal atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and each identified cognitive complaint increases the likelihood of cognitive impairment by approximately 20 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Relationship between cognition and vascular disease</title><p>Vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, obesity) are considered the most readily modifiable risk factors for dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These risk factors, especially elevations in blood pressure (BP) and the associated arterial stiffening, reduce cerebrovascular reactivity and cerebral blood flow, and predispose older adults to greater risk of hypoperfusion in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Sustained hypertension and arterial stiffness are associated with a number of pathological changes in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the occurrence of a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the presence of neurotropic markers of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], poorer scores on objective cognitive testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and clinical dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although there is an increasing consensus on the role of vascular risk factors in cognitive impairment, few studies have investigated the effects of modifying vascular risk factors on cognitive health in either healthy older adults, or in those with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Relationship between cognition and mobility</title><p>Gait dysfunction is frequently observed in older adults with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], often precedes a diagnosis of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and has been suggested as a potentially modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Specifically, reduced gait velocity and step length, and increased gait variability under usual (i.e., normal walking) and dual-task (DT; i.e., walking while subtracting 7&#x000a0;s from 100) conditions, have been associated with impaired executive functioning (EF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], underlying cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and reduced prefrontal and parietal cortical volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in cognitively healthy older adults, as well as diffuse cortical atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and abnormal neurochemical signatures within the primary motor cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], among those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Gait dysfunction has also been associated with increased falls risk among cognitively healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and those with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as well as an increased risk for institutionalization over 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interventions aimed at improving both cognition and mobility may prove most effective at reducing the risk of both cognitive and functional decline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Non-pharmacological interventions to prevent cognitive and functional decline</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exercise interventions</title><p>Healthy lifestyles, including vascular risk factor control through the habitual participation in exercise, may be an important strategy to prevent or slow the progression of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previous meta-analyses have revealed positive effects of aerobic exercise on cognition, with the largest effects on EF and global cognition in cognitively healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and those with objective cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Despite this evidence, a recent Cochrane review found that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that cognitive improvements are solely attributable to improved cardiovascular fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although more research is needed, resistance training has been found to impart cognitive benefits in older adults without cognitive impairment, including improvements in memory and EF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], as well as frontal lobe neurophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and elevations in circulating neural growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Exercise interventions aimed at improving balance and mobility have also produced discrepant findings. A Cochrane review highlighted the paucity of evidence related to the effect of exercise on mobility outcomes (i.e., usual and DT gait) and concluded that the available evidence suggesting exercise can impart moderate benefits on mobility outcomes is weak, and that further rigorously developed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Multiple-modality exercise programs incorporate a number of physical exercise training types (i.e., aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Combining multiple exercise modalities may lead to greater improvements in cognition, vascular health, and functional outcomes, when compared to programs that focus on a single modality (e.g. aerobic only or resistance only programs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previous meta-analyses in healthy older adults observed that aerobically-based, multiple-modality exercise programs can improve cognitive function, specifically EF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and information processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], to a greater extent than aerobic exercise alone. Results from several RCTs suggest that similar results can be expected for those self-reporting cognitive complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] or with objective cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Participation in three months of multiple-modality training or less has been associated with improved cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], medial temporal lobe neurophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], functional mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and usual and DT gait velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] in cognitively healthy older adults. Further, improved cognitive functioning has been observed in older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Longer duration interventions might be more efficacious at improving cognition. Six months of multiple-modality exercise has been shown improve global cognition in older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], as well as improve global cognition and reduce cortical atrophy in older adults with objective cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and these improvements can be maintained for up to 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Further, 12&#x000a0;months of multiple-modality exercise can improve global cognition, memory (immediate recall), and verbal fluency in older adults with objective cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These observations suggest that multiple-modality exercise programs can serve as an effective and multifaceted approach to benefit a number of cognitive and functional outcomes in cognitively healthy older adults and in those at risk for dementia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>&#x0201c;Traditional&#x0201d; cognitive training &#x00026; innovative cognitive-physical (&#x0201c;Mind-Motor&#x0201d;) programs</title><p>Cognitive training requires the organization and direction of a number of neurological processes, such as attention, perception, memory, and EF, and has been shown to benefit cognition in aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis revealed significant effects for cognitive training on EF, memory and global cognitive functioning, when compared to active controls (e.g., groups receiving educational DVDs or health promotion training) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Further, this meta-analysis suggested significant effects for cognitive training on memory and subjective cognition functioning when compared to controls receiving no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although the initial observations related to the cognitive benefits of cognitive training are promising, the improvements in cognitive functioning that are garnered following cognitive training are traditionally domain-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Square-Stepping Exercise (SSE) is a simple, low-cost, indoor, group-based exercise program for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This novel program can be best described as a visuospatial working memory task with a stepping response (i.e., &#x0201c;mind-motor&#x0201d; training) and requires participants to memorize and execute progressively more complex foot placement patterns that involve forward, backward, lateral, and diagonal steps using a gridded floor mat. Although SSE was originally designed to improve lower extremity mobility in at-risk fallers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], pilot work suggests the potential for SSE to benefit cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Improvements in global cognition, attention, and mental flexibility were seen in cognitively healthy older adults after a 16-week SSE program (40&#x000a0;min/day, 3&#x000a0;days/week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and improved memory and EF following a 26-week SSE program (1&#x000a0;day of class-based SSE/week for 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min plus 10&#x000a0;min of daily SSE homework) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, improvements in verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency and global cognitive function were seen in older adults without dementia following a 6-month exercise plus DT training intervention (involving SSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The available evidence regarding the effects of SSE on cognition is still preliminary and has not been examined in regard to gait dysfunction, and thus, future rigorously designed trials are required to determine the efficacy of SSE on cognitive and functional outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Rationale and study objectives</title><p>Despite these promising observations, several limitations related to our understanding of the cognitive and functional benefits of exercise or cognitive training remain. Questions regarding the frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise that would provide the greatest cognitive benefit are currently equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Other external factors, including biological sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the severity of cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] also appear to modify the relationships of exercise with cognitive and physical functioning. The available evidence suggests that aerobically-based exercise programs that incorporate other exercise modalities (i.e., resistance, balance) and some form of cognitive training, might impart a significantly larger global cognitive benefit than those that focus on a single strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Additional large-scale, rigorous RCTs are required to determine the impact of multiple-modality exercise programs combined with novel cognitive training programs, on cognition and functional mobility outcomes, and to delineate the trajectory of these improvements as well as the maintenance of training effects after follow-up, in older adults who may be at increased risk for future cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a group-based multiple-modality exercise program combined with mind-motor training [Multiple-Modality, Mind-Motor (M4)] can lead to improved global cognitive functioning at 24&#x000a0;weeks, when compared to a multiple-modality exercise program alone [Multiple-Modality (M2)], among community-dwelling older adults with self-reported cognitive complaints. The study hypothesis is that improvement in global cognitive functioning will be observed in both groups; however, the improvement will be greater for M4 compared to M2. Secondary objectives include investigating whether M4 (when compared to M2) improves: i) global cognitive functioning at 52&#x000a0;weeks; ii) domain-specific cognitive functioning at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks; iii) mobility (gait characteristics under usual and DT conditions and balance) at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks; and iv) vascular health (BP and carotid arterial measurements) at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a two-arm, 24-week RCT with a 28-week no-contact follow-up.

This way, participants in both groups were taking part in the same amount of activity (60-minute classes; 3&#x000a0;days per week for 24&#x000a0;weeks) and were receiving the same amount of social interaction and attention from the study personnel, with the only difference being the type of activity that they received for 15&#x000a0;minutes during each class.</p><p>The SSE was selected as the mind-motor training component within this study. There are over 200 stepping patterns that range in difficulty from beginner to advanced. Participants progressed through SSE patterns each class (as a group), and started from the last successfully completed pattern performed during the previous exercise session. The goal was to progress as far as possible over the 24-week period. Participants watched an instructor demonstrate a pattern and then attempted to repeat the pattern (by memory) on the SSE mat (250&#x000a0;cm x 100&#x000a0;cm, partitioned in to 10 rows of 4 equal-sized squares (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Under both usual and DT conditions, the following will be examined: average gait velocity (cm/s), step length (cm), and stride time variability [coefficient of variation (CoV), expressed as a percentage&#x02009;=&#x02009;(SD/mean) x 100]. In recordings of the usual and DT walks, footfalls that do not entirely fall on the walkway at the start and the end will be removed prior to analyses.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Balance</title><p>Balance is assessed using the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) Scale, a valid and reliable tool that was developed to identify emerging static and dynamic balance issues in functionally independent older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Individual performance across 10 separate balance tasks is evaluated and scored on a Likert Scale (ranging from 0&#x02013;4) following strictly defined criteria. The individual scores are summed to provide a total balance score, where higher scores reflect better balance performance (score ranges from 0 to 40).</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Other measurements</title><p>Other measurements were taken in order to further describe the sample, help with explaining study findings, and for planned sensitivity analyses.</p><p><italic>The Phone-FITT:</italic> This interview can be administered over the phone or in person, and is a valid and reliable method to evaluate both instrumental activities of daily living (household activity) and leisure time activities (recreational activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The Phone-FITT evaluates the frequency of activities, the average duration of participation during a given bout of the activity, and the perceived intensity at which the activity was performed, during an average week in the past month. Summary scores are calculated for household, recreational and total physical activity. In addition to being measured in-person as part of the measurement sessions, the Phone-FITT was also administered via telephone each month throughout exercise intervention, in order to track other activity that participants were undertaking.</p><p><italic>Clinic BP.</italic> Following 5&#x000a0;minutes of seated rest, BP is measured in triplicate from the brachial artery using an automated oscillometer (BPM-100, BPTru&#x02122; Medical Devices, Coquitlam, BC, Canada), with each measure separated by a 2-minute rest period. Clinic BP will be calculated as the average of the last two measurements.</p><p><italic>Anthropometric measurements:</italic> Body weight (to the nearest kg) is measured with a standard weigh scale and height (to the nearest cm) is measured with a stadiometer (Health-o-Meter, Continental Scale Corp., Chicago, Il, USA). Waist circumference (to the nearest cm) is also measured following a normal exhalation at the mid-point between the twelfth rib and the upper boarder of the iliac crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p><italic>Fitness:</italic> Predicted maximal oxygen uptake (pVO<sub>2</sub>max) is calculated using the STEP&#x02122; tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Participants are instructed to step up and down a set of two steps (20&#x000a0;cm high), 20 times, at a comfortable pace. An algorithm using age, sex, time to complete the test, and post-test heart rate generates the pVO2max. This tool is also used to provide participants with a target heart rate for exercise at the start of the study and again at the mid-way point of the exercise intervention (as described previously).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome and analysis. To our knowledge, no study to date has observed the effect of a 6-month multiple-modality and mind-motor exercise intervention on global cognitive functioning in older adults with cognitive complaints. A meta-analysis on the impact of aerobic fitness training on cognition in older adults suggested that physical exercise can improve cognition with an effect size of <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Although the CBS is grounded in well-validated neuropsychological tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], it has not been used to date as an outcome in published exercise intervention studies. For these reasons, sample size for the proposed study must be approximated by using the effect size approach, combined with feasibility and comparisons to sample sizes used in other similar studies.</p><p>With 52 participants per group, our study would have 80 % power at the 5 % significance level to detect an effect size (mean difference divided by SD) of 0.55, a moderate effect size. We estimated a dropout rate of 20 % during the 24-week period, which increased our calculation to 65 participants per group. Thus, we proposed that 130 participants (65 participants per group) is a reasonable sample size.</p><p>The 20 % drop out rate is conservative since we observed a drop out rate of 16 % in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This sample size may also be considered conservative since we will be using a variant of Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to perform data analysis for the primary outcome. This proposed sample size is also in line with two exercise intervention studies for older adults with cognitive complaints; specifically, the MAX trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], where 126 individuals were enrolled, and a trial by Lautenschlager et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], where 170 participants were enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>The randomization sequence was computer-generated (1:1 in one block of 130) and concealed using envelopes until interventions were assigned. Following baseline measurement, the Research Coordinator (who was not involved in generating the randomization sequence) enrolled and allocated participants to either the M4 or M2 group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Blinding</title><p>The CBS cognitive battery measurement will be blinded at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. Additionally, wherever possible, study personnel conducting other aspects of the assessments will be blinded to group allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor the exercise instructors can be blinded to group allocation. The principal investigator and investigators conducting the statistical analysis are also be blinded to group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We will analyze data based on an intent-to-treat approach, using mixed models for repeated measurements, which encompasses ANCOVA as a special case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Therefore, we will include all enrolled participants in analyses and analyze data according to the randomization scheme. For our primary outcome, we will examine the difference between the M4 and M2 groups at 24&#x000a0;weeks in mean change of global cognitive functioning. Our secondary analysis will include examining the difference between groups at 52&#x000a0;weeks in mean change of global cognitive functioning. Next, we will examine differences between groups at 24 at 52&#x000a0;weeks on i) cognitive outcomes: memory, reasoning, concentration and EF; ii) mobility-related outcomes: usual and DT gait velocity, step length and stride time variability, and total FAB score; and iii) vascular outcomes: 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP, CAC, and carotid IMT.</p><p>For our primary outcome, we will also conduct sensitivity analyses whereby: 1) we will additionally adjust for age, sex, and baseline cardiorespiratory fitness; and 2) we will only include participants who complete a 24-week assessment and attend at least 80 % of exercise classes (i.e., &#x0201c;all-completers analysis&#x0201d;). For our primary analysis, we will also examine interactions involving age, sex, and baseline cognitive functioning (via the MoCA score). Two-sided P-values less than 0.05 will be claimed as statistically significant; however, interpretation of study results will primarily be based on estimation and associated 95 % confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will evaluate the effects of a 24-week multiple-modality plus mind-motor exercise program on global cognitive functioning, as well as domain-specific cognitive functioning, indices of cardiovascular health, and functional mobility in a sample of community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.</p><p>With the aging population and increased life expectancy, novel interventions aimed at preventing or slowing the onset of chronic diseases are needed. The cognitive continuum in aging suggests that strategies aimed at preventing or mitigating the progression of cognitive impairment might be most effective when targeting individuals who are within the earliest phase along the pathological cognitive continuum (i.e., prior to the establishment of objective cognitive impairment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Improving cognition or reducing the risk of cognitive decline in individuals who report cognitive concerns may help to reduce the future incidence of more serious forms of cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Physical and cognitive activities, social engagement and vascular risk factor modification have all been suggested as important strategies for the prevention of cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Literature suggests that healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as well as those with MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] have improved EF following multiple-modality exercise programs. Further, initial research related to cognitive training has shown improvements in cognition, albeit domain-specific improvements in healthy older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Recent evidence continues to suggest that cognitive training interventions produce cognitive improvements that are reserved for the cognitive domains that are actively being trained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and unless there is significant progression in task difficulty through the intervention, there are very little transfer effects encountered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>By combining exercise and cognitive training programs, improvements in cognitive functioning may be additive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The combination of a cognitive training paradigm within a physical exercise program may be superior to interventions that deliver these training modalities in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The mind-motor intervention used in this study, Square-Stepping Exercise (SSE), combines physical and cognitive tasks and also promotes social engagement, which itself has been shown to benefit cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]; thus, SSE might be a preferred cognitive training program for older adults compared to other available options (i.e., computerized cognitive training). Combining group-based multiple-modality exercise training with mind-motor training may provide concurrent and complementary cognitive and vascular benefits, while providing greater cognitive benefits than either intervention alone.</p><p>The vascular benefits of aerobically-based exercise training are well documented; however, the impact of aerobic exercise on cognition and brain health has yet to be unequivocally discerned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Further, although a number of studies have investigated the cognitive benefits of cognitive training, there remains very little evidence regarding the potential vascular benefits that can be garnered through cognitive training. By combining a multiple-modality exercise program with mind-motor training, we aim to reduce risk factor burden related to a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, mobility limitations, and cognitive impairment and dementia, in an attempt to provide the most effective strategy to promote active and successful aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of the design and implementation of the study must also be considered. Participation was limited to a group of motivated volunteers, available during daytime hours, who are able to commit to a 24-week exercise program. In this study, we chose to use an active control group (M2 exercise program) as our comparison group rather than including an inactive control group. However, recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] have drawn attention to the limited number of investigations on the effects of exercise in older adults with cognitive impairment that include an active control group comparison, and have recommended that future studies address this issue. The inclusion of an active control group allows for the control of other factors such as the social interaction associated with group exercise classes; however, there is evidence that implicates low intensity exercise interventions with improvements in cognition and physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Future studies might consider also including usual-care control groups, in addition to an active comparison group in their study design. The definition of what classifies a &#x0201c;subjective cognitive complaint&#x0201d; has yet to be elucidated in the literature. We chose to use a simple question to measure whether individuals had self-reported a cognitive complaint, following the methods used by Barnes and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Future studies should consult the recently published conceptual framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] in order to determine the most appropriate methods to evaluate subjective cognitive decline and accurately identify individuals who are at increased risk for dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>With the global population aging, there is growing urgency to identify the most effective methods to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factor burden, the establishment of functional limitations, and the development of cognitive impairment. The Multiple-Modality, Mind-Motor study has been designed to simultaneously address these concerns and determine whether a multiple-modality exercise program combined with mind-motor training can improve cognition, vascular health, and mobility in older adults with cognitive complaints, to a greater extent than multiple-modality exercise programs alone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MG participated in the study design and acquisition of data and helped to draft the manuscript.
