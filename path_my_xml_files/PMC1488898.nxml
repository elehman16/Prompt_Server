<bold>Background:</bold> Evidence from observational studies indicates a link between high concentrations of homocysteine (an amino acid) in the blood and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the basis for the link between homocysteine concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk is not clear. Supplementing the diet with B-vitamins lowers homocysteine levels, and large-scale trials are underway that will determine whether B-vitamin supplementation has an effect on cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart attacks and strokes. These trials also involve administration of folic acid as well as other B-vitamins. It is not obvious, however, whether the effects of B-vitamin supplementation arise as a result of homocysteine lowering or via some other biochemical pathway.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> Olthof and colleagues aimed to further understand the effects of homocysteine lowering by randomizing 40 healthy volunteer participants to receive either folic acid supplementation; placebo; or betaine, a nutrient that lowers homocysteine levels via a different biochemical pathway than folic acid. Each participant in the trial received each supplement for 6 wk, with a 6-wk washout period before the next supplement was given. The researchers then used a technique called flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to measure functioning of the main artery of the upper arm, as a surrogate for cardiovascular disease risk. In this trial, both folic acid and betaine supplementation significantly lowered homocysteine levels over the 6-wk supplementation period. However, both forms of supplementation failed to result in any significant change in functioning of the artery, as measured using FMD.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> In this trial 40 participants were recruited, and 39 were followed up to trial completion. A crossover design was used, with each participant receiving each supplement and a placebo in sequence. This method enabled a smaller number of participants to be used to answer the question of interest, as compared to parallel-group designs. The majority of participants in the trial were followed up. However, the trial's outcomes are surrogates for cardiovascular disease risk, measured over fairly short time periods, and no clinical outcomes were examined.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This trial adds to the evidence on the effects of nutrient supplementation on surrogate outcomes for cardiovascular disease risk. The results show that over a 6-wk study period, these surrogate outcomes are not affected by either folic acid or betaine supplementation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Olthof MR, Bots ML, Katan MB, Verhoef P (2006) Effect of folic acid and betaine supplementation on flow-mediated dilation: A randomized, controlled study in healthy volunteers.

Some clinical trials of homocysteine lowering through B-vitamin treatment support this hypothesis [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but others do not [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several years from now, there will be data from about 50,000 patients that have been supplemented with B-vitamins or placebo [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, all supplements in these trials include folic acid, which will make it impossible to distinguish between the effects of folic acid itself and the effects of homocysteine lowering per se. In an attempt to do so, we compared the effect of homocysteine lowering via folic acid supplementation and via betaine supplementation on vascular function. Betaine is involved in the remethylation of homocysteine into methionine via a different pathway than folic acid [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and supplementation with betaine lowers plasma homocysteine in healthy volunteers to a similar extent as folic acid [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We assessed vascular function noninvasively through flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. FMD is considered a good alternative outcome measure for cardiovascular disease risk. FMD is associated with endothelial function in coronary arteries of patients [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both coronary endothelial function [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and FMD [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] are associated with increased mortality and morbidity risk in patients, as well as in low-risk populations. Furthermore, in a trial of anti-hypertensive treatment, those with improved FMD had a more favorable prognosis than those without improved FMD, irrespective of blood pressure lowering [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This supports the idea that FMD is a good surrogate marker to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease in intervention studies in low-risk populations. The study presented here shows findings from a 6-wk randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in healthy men and women (50&#x02013;70 y), investigating whether folic acid and betaine supplementation differentially affect FMD of the brachial artery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from the pool of volunteers registered at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

We measured each participant on two separate days after each 6-wk treatment period to reduce the variation within participants. The within-participant coefficient of variation (CV = {SD/mean} &#x000d7; 100%) was 65% in our study, and this corresponded to previous measurements in our laboratory [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>On each measurement day, participants rested on a bed for 15 min in a temperature-controlled room (20 &#x000b0;C &#x02212;25 &#x000b0;C) and then we measured endothelium-dependent FMD of the brachial artery using a 7.5 MHz linear-array transducer of an ATL Ultramark 9 HDI duplex scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington, United States). The measurements were done at the brachial artery of the right arm, at the site of the antecubital crease, with an inflatable cuff around the forearm. Arm and ultrasound transducer were held in position with a specially designed fixture (TAF, developed by Meijer, Vascular Imaging Center, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands) [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We chose a segment of the artery of at least 10 mm in length with clear lumen and distinctive vessel walls. All images were 10&#x000d7; zoomed and electronically focused. We first obtained an optimal two-dimensional B-mode ultrasound image of the brachial artery at rest and recorded three baseline images to measure baseline diameter. We then either inflated the cuff around the lower arm to a pressure of 200 mmHg or we inflated the cuff 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure in cases in which the systolic blood pressure was &#x0003e;150 mmHg. The pressure was kept constant for 5 min to induce ischemia in the forearm and hand, and then the cuff was deflated and image recording was started. In the next 5 min, images of the brachial artery were frozen every 15 s. All measurements were done at the end-diastole by the use of the R-wave of the electrocardiogram. All images were recorded on super-VHS videotape for offline analysis.</p><p>The offline reading of ultrasound examinations was done using Brachial Tools, Version 3.2.6 (Medical Imaging Applications, Coralville, Iowa, United States), as has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One reader, who was unaware of treatment allocation, read all images at the Vascular Imaging Centre of the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands). Each scan was read in duplicate, to limit reading variation. The coefficient of variation (CV = {SD/mean} &#x000d7; 100%) in calculated FMD% between readings was 22%. The reader traced the trailing edge of the adventitia&#x02013;media interface at the near wall and the leading edge of the media&#x02013;adventitia interface at the far wall of the brachial artery over a length of at least 3 mm. The distance between these interfaces reflects the lumen diameter. FMD was computed as the percent increase in arterial diameter: FMD% = {(maximum minus baseline)/baseline} &#x000d7; 100%. For reasons of clarity, we use &#x0201c;FMD%&#x0201d; as a unit of FMD measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Blood sampling and laboratory analyses.</title><p>Venous blood was taken from the antecubital vein following an overnight fast on days 41 and 43 of each treatment period.

Neither the baseline diameter nor the maximum diameter was affected by folic acid or betaine treatment relative to placebo.</p><fig id="pctr-0010010-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Individual Values of FMD (FMD%) of 39 Participants Who Ingested Placebo, 0.8 mg/d of Folic Acid, and 6 g/d of Betaine in Random Order for 6 Wk Each</title><p>Each spot represents the mean of duplicate FMD measurements at the end of the treatment period in one participant; the line represents the mean FMD for each treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010010.g002"/></fig><p>As expected, concentrations of serum folate were increased more than 2-fold after folic acid treatment relative to concentrations after placebo treatment (+37 nmol/l, 32; 42) and after betaine treatment (+39 nmol/l, 34; 44) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010010-t002">Table 2</xref>).

This suggests that homocysteine, if involved in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, does not exert its action through a mechanism related to vascular function in healthy individuals. This is the first study to our knowledge that has compared the effects of two different homocysteine-lowering components on FMD in order to distinguish between effects of homocysteine itself and effects of folic acid.</p><p>We are confident that we designed and performed our study well. We selected apparently healthy elderly people with slightly elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations, who are expected to have a greater response to the homocysteine-lowering interventions than randomly selected individuals.</p><p>The FMD measurement itself was performed similar to previous studies done in our laboratory. In one study, replacement of dietary saturated fatty acids by dietary trans fatty acids impaired FMD after 4 wk of intervention [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but no effect was found of a low-fat diet versus a high-oil diet on FMD [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>We standardized the FMD measurement to a maximum of what is possible in a free-living situation. To reduce the variation in the FMD measurement due to diet, we provided all foods the day preceding the FMD measurements, and we standardized coffee and tea consumption. Further, we standardized the timing of the last time eating and smoking on the evening before measurements. During the entire study, we also asked the volunteers to keep physical activity, smoking, and dietary patterns as usual. To limit the influence of variation in FMD between participants, we chose a crossover design in our study, so that each participant was his or her own control. In addition, we know that the within-participant variability of the FMD measurement is large [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, we did duplicate FMD measurements in each participant on each intervention, and we also did the reading of the videotapes for each of the FMD measurement in duplicate. Indeed, the narrow 95%CI we found for the difference in FMD indicate that the power for our study was more than sufficient. Our study was powered to detect an absolute difference of 2 FMD% between the treatments and placebo, as this effect is considered to be clinically relevant and is also used in power calculations in other studies [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. If we assume that the 95%CIs in our study contain the true effect, then we can say that the beneficial effect on FMD could be maximally +0.7 FMD% for folic acid and +0.4 FMD% for betaine in our population. It is unlikely that we missed a biologically relevant effect through chance fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Overall Evidence and Generalizability</title><p>We are not aware of other published studies that have investigated effects of betaine supplementation on FMD. Betaine lowered plasma homocysteine as expected [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but we previously reported that betaine supplementation&#x02014;unlike folic acid supplementation&#x02014;increased LDL cholesterol concentrations by ~11% and increased triacylglycerol concentrations by ~13% [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consequently, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that these increases in blood lipids induced by betaine supplementation negatively affected FMD [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and thereby counteracted the potential positive effect of homocysteine lowering. However, this seems unlikely, since folic acid supplementation also lowered homocysteine and did not affect FMD either.</p><p>The absence of an effect of folic acid on FMD in our study is in line with results from other studies in healthy volunteers that show that chronic folic acid supplementation does not affect FMD in healthy volunteers. Only two out of eight studies in healthy volunteers reported an improvement in FMD upon long-term folic acid supplementation; the other studies did not find an effect of supplementation with folic acid alone, or in combination with other B-vitamins, on FMD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010010-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, it should be noted that one of the two studies [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that found an improvement of FMD upon folic acid supplementation reported that participants ingested folic acid just before measurement of FMD. Therefore, the improvement in FMD they found could be caused by an acute effect of folic acid on FMD and not by homocysteine-lowering per se [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, in our other study conducted at the same time as this one, we found no effect of a single dose of folic acid on FMD following a methionine load [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A second study [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] does not report when participants ingested the last dose of folic acid. In our study reported here, vascular function was measured in participants after they had fasted overnight, to ensure we measured chronic rather that acute effects of the supplements. The results of the study reported here are also in line with the findings of our other study on effects of acute homocysteine lowering on FMD following methionine loading [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Also, our findings are in line with results from recent placebo-controlled trials that found no effect of B-vitamin supplementation on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pctr-0010010-t003" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Overview of Placebo-Controlled Studies into the Effects of Folic Acid Supplementation on Vascular Function, Measured through FMD</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010010.t003"/></table-wrap><p>Of course, it remains possible that homocysteine lowering affects vascular function only in patients with cardiovascular disease or participants who have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, data on effects of folic acid on FMD in high-risk populations are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010010-t003">Table 3</xref>). Six out of 11 studies stated that FMD improved upon folic acid supplementation [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The study from Madhavan et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found an improvement in FMD only upon supplementation of high doses of folic acid (5 mg/d), but not on supplementation of low doses of folic acid (0.4 mg/d) in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Two studies in patients with renal failure [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], one study in patients with CAD [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], one study in patients with peripheral arterial disease [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and one study in hypercholesterolemic patients receiving statins [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] found no effect of folic acid on FMD relative to placebo. Therefore, similar to the finding in healthy volunteers, studies in patients do not convincingly show that folic acid supplementation improves FMD.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Although we have performed the FMD measurement with utmost care, there are some methodological issues to discuss. First, we did not perform a nitric oxide-independent vasodilation test, usually done with sublingual nitroglycerine (NTG). The rationale for such a test is to show whether or not the artery is capable of responding to nitric oxide directly given to participants (endothelium-independent vasodilation). Since we selected healthy participants in our study, we assumed that all participants would have an FMD response, and we therefore did not confirm this with an NTG test. Moreover, treatment effects on the NTG test were not expected [<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010010-b057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As we have seen an FMD response in all of our participants, we do not think that the lack of NTG measurements affects the validity of our findings.</p><p>Second, we did not perform Doppler measurements after the cuff release. The Doppler measurements reflect the stimulus (i.e., the blood flow) that elicits the FMD response, and through these measurements one may examine whether the differences between participants and between visits are due to differences in exposure to increased blood flow. We did not perform the Doppler measurements in order to optimize the measurements of the B-mode imaging. The time window to switch between B-mode and the Doppler mode in the ultrasound machine was too short to perform valid Doppler measurements and at the same time capture reliable images for lumen diameter measurements within the first period after cuff release, which is the most important phase in which dilation occurs. However, it is highly unlikely that the stimulus will differ between visits, as the measurements were done in a standardized manner, by the same technicians using an identical protocol. Moreover, the FMD was measured in duplicate on each treatment, which minimized variations in the FMD responses that were not due to the treatments. Therefore, the validity of our findings is not severely hampered by the lack of the Doppler measurement.</p><p>Finally, we added a small amount of quinine to all of the supplements in order to keep the study blinded by masking the original tastes of the supplements. Especially betaine has a somewhat distinct, unpleasant taste. Quinine is a flavoring agent, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in beverages up to 83 mg/l. We added 2 mg of quinine to each daily portion of the supplements, and we are not aware of any effects of such a small dose on vascular function. In addition, because we added quinine to all of the supplements, including placebo, it is highly unlikely that this would have influenced the results of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We showed that neither long-term folic acid nor betaine supplementation affects vascular function in healthy elderly volunteers, despite effective homocysteine lowering. This is in line with findings from other studies, most of them showing no effect of chronic folic acid supplementation on vascular function in healthy volunteers. This may indicate that homocysteine is not causally related to cardiovascular disease, but leaves open the possibility that homocysteine affects cardiovascular disease risk through mechanisms other than impaired vascular function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010010-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010010.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(53 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010010-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010010.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(115 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010010-sd003"><label>Alternative Language Abstract</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010010.sd003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>Translation of the abstract into Dutch by Margreet R.
