It provides faster onset of surgical anaesthesia and prolongs the duration of post-operative pain relief. Various adjuvants further increase its efficacy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The addition of opioids, which are the most commonly used adjuvants, to neuraxial anaesthesia is effective in prolonging the analgesic effect but has also been associated with adverse effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, urinary retention and pruritus, so various options including &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists are extensively evaluated as an alternative. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists when used as adjuvant in central neuraxial blockade produce significantly lower post-operative pain scores without any of these opioid-related side effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Studies comparing effects of the two &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists &#x02013; dexmedetomidine and clonidine on spinal and epidural anaesthesia &#x02013; have found that both produce a similar prolongation in the duration of the motor and sensory block with preserved haemodynamic stability and sedation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, as an adjuvant with local anaesthetics, increases the duration of pain relief after intrathecal or epidural administration but is associated with significant hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Literature search revealed very few studies using clonidine and local anaesthetics sequentially via different routes in CSE to assess the influence of clonidine on characteristics of subarachnoid block (SAB). An attempt was made by this study to determine whether administration of clonidine alone as epidural adjuvant in CSE would provide prolonged analgesia without causing significant haemodynamic side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was undertaken in a tertiary teaching institute over a period of 7 months.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using duration of analgesia as primary criterion. Keeping power of study at 80% and confidence interval at 95%, to detect 30% difference in duration of analgesia, the sample size required was 25 in each group. We enrolled a total of 60 patients for better validation of results.</p><p>After obtaining the institutional ethical committee approval and written informed consent, 60 female patients undergoing elective gynaecological surgeries, aged 25&#x02013;60 years, belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I and II, were enrolled. Gynaecological surgeries included in this study were total abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, myomectomy, open ovarian cyst excision and tubal recanalisation. Patients for whom central neuraxial block was contraindicated, those with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine disorders, psychiatric illness, antihypertensive therapy, with known allergy to study drugs and those who refused neuraxial block were excluded from the study. Patients enroled were randomly allocated into Group C (study) and Group S (control) of thirty each using a computer-generated random number sequence. The drug solution for both groups was prepared by an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study. The allocation sequence and the drug received by the patients were not revealed to the investigating anaesthesiologist until the end of data collection.</p><p>After intravenous (IV) access, the patients were preloaded with infusion of Ringer lactate (20 ml/kg). The epidural space was identified at L<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>3</sub> interspace with 18 G Tuohy needle using loss of resistance technique under strict asepsis, and a 20 G epidural catheter was then advanced into the epidural space. Correct placement of epidural catheter was verified with a test dose of 3 ml of lignocaine (2%) with adrenaline (1: 200,000). Group C received injection clonidine 150 &#x003bc;g, diluted to 5 ml in normal saline (NS) via epidural catheter 10 min before SAB. Group S received 5 ml NS 10 min before SAB. Hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%, 15 mg (3 ml) was given intrathecally to both groups at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> interspace using 27G Quincke needle.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed bilaterally using loss of sensation to pinprick with a short hypodermic needle in midclavicular line. Motor blockade was assessed using modified Bromage scale [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (0: No motor block; 1: Inability to raise extended legs; 2: Inability to flex knees; 3: Inability to flex ankle joints). Surgery was commenced after sensory block at T<sub>6</sub> dermatome was attained.</p><p>In this study, onset of sensory block was defined as time taken to achieve loss of sensation to pinprick at L<sub>1</sub> dermatome level following SAB. Time taken to achieve Bromage 3 following SAB was defined as onset of motor block. Time taken for two segment regression of sensory block was noted, and time taken for motor block to recede from Bromage 3 to Bromage 0 was recorded as the duration of motor block.</p><p>Basal heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, non-invasive arterial blood pressure and oxygen saturation were recorded before placement of epidural catheter and every 5 min till the end of surgery. Intra- and post-operative sedation was assessed using Ramsay Sedation Score [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (1: Anxious or restless or both, 2: Co-operative, oriented and tranquil, 3: Responding to commands, 4: Asleep, brisk response to light, glabellar tap or auditory stimuli, 5: Asleep, sluggish response, 6: Asleep, unarousable).</p><p>Post-operatively, pain was assessed using visual analogue scale [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (VAS) (0: No pain, 2&#x02013;4: Mild pain, 5&#x02013;7: Moderate pain, 8&#x02013;10: Worst pain). Duration of analgesia was the time from onset of sensory block at L<sub>1</sub> till the patient complained of pain. Rescue analgesic injection tramadol 2 mg/kg was given via epidural catheter when patient requested for analgesic or VAS &#x0003e;4. Sedation score, VAS and haemodynamic parameters were observed at 30 min, 60 min, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> h post-operatively.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or &#x0003e;30% decrease in baseline mean arterial pressure, treated with IV crystalloid 250 ml bolus and injection mephentermine 6 mg IV. Bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c; 50/min and treated with injection atropine 0.6 mg IV. Other side effects such as nausea and vomiting, shivering and urinary retention were also looked for in both the groups.</p><p>Sensory and motor block characteristics and time to request for analgesics were recorded in both groups.</p><p>Parametric data are expressed as mean (standard deviation) and nominal data are presented in tabular format. Fischer exact test and Chi-square test were applied for nominal data.

It significantly prolonged the duration of analgesia with improved sedation and pain scores in the post-operative period.</p><p>Clonidine is a centrally acting partial &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor agonist with selectivity ratio of 200:1. Its analgesic effect is mediated by binding to postsynaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors (G-protein coupled inhibitory receptors) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This mimics the effects of noradrenaline which is released from the descending inhibitory pathways in the central nervous system. Thus, decreased activity of the second-order neurons and wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn occurs which in turn attenuates the input from peripheral nociceptive A<sub>&#x003b4;</sub> and C fibres. It does not affect proprioception or produce motor blockade. Studies in rats show that clonidine partially inhibits voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels and suppresses generation of action potentials in tonic firing spinal dorsal horn neuron.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Studies have demonstrated potentiation of analgesic effects of local anaesthetics by clonidine through oral, IV, intrathecal and epidural routes. As clonidine-induced analgesia is mediated by activation of adrenergic receptors on the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, intrathecal or epidural administration of the drug close to its action site seems to be logical. Clonidine is rapidly and extensively absorbed into the spinal cerebrospinal fluid compartment after epidural administration, with concentrations peaking 30&#x02013;60 min after injection and coincides with near-maximal analgesia. After epidural administration, clonidine produces peak concentrations in arterial blood within 10 min and venous blood within 30&#x02013;45 min.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] As side effects, such as sedation, hypotension or bradycardia, are at least partly related to systemic absorption, the route that provides the best balance between analgesia and side effects is more acceptable.</p><p>In this study, we used 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine (3&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight) epidurally as some studies have shown increased incidence of adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension and sedation with higher doses (&#x0003e;600 &#x000b5;g) of clonidine.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, duration of analgesia was very much prolonged in clonidine group (299.00 &#x000b1; 43.38 min) as compared to saline group (152.50 &#x000b1; 21.04 min). We also observed that epidurally administered clonidine reduced post-operative analgesic requirements. A previous study found that epidural clonidine (150 &#x003bc;g) prolonged anaesthesia duration along with significant sedation,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] similar to what was observed in our study. Motor and sensory blockade effects of local anaesthetics are enhanced by clonidine. The effects of clonidine on the prolongation of nerve blockade are dose-dependent [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>After neuraxial administration, clonidine affects arterial blood pressure in a complex manner because of opposing actions at multiple sites. The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists produce sympatholysis and reduce arterial blood pressure through effects at specific brainstem nuclei and sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, effects that are counteracted by direct vasoconstriction resulting from the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists on the peripheral vasculature.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Eisenach <italic>et al</italic>. showed that 160 &#x003bc;g clonidine decreases arterial blood pressure by 18% and reduces HR by 5&#x02013;20% and concluded that epidural clonidine does not induce haemodynamic instability.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The current study showed relatively low incidence of hypotension and bradycardia with epidural clonidine at dose of 150 &#x003bc;g.</p><p>The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists when used in regional anaesthesia are shown to hasten onset of action of local anaesthetics with rapid establishment of both sensory and motor blockade, prolongation of analgesia into the post-operative period, with dose-sparing action of local anaesthetics and stable cardiovascular parameters.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The current study also showed similar findings.</p><p>Sedation is another central effect of clonidine due to its action on locus ceruleus. Sedation after epidural clonidine is due to its systemic absorption and vascular redistribution to higher centres.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, we found that epidural clonidine produced arousable sedation in intra- and post-operative periods. Patients rested quietly in beds with eyes closed but were able to respond to oral commands. Duration of sedation corresponded with duration of analgesia but did not hinder VAS measurement.</p><p>Epidural clonidine and neostigmine [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been used as adjuvants following intrathecal labour analgesia with local anaesthetic and found to be associated with improved quality of analgesia, reduced the local anaesthetic requirement and higher patient satisfaction. In the current study, we administered epidural clonidine before SAB in gynaecological surgery and found improved quality of analgesia, along with the early onset of sensory and motor blockade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Epidural clonidine when administered 10 min prior to SAB during CSE, produces prolonged analgesia and arousable sedation. It increased the speed of onset and prolonged the duration of sensory and motor blockade of intrathecal bupivacaine without significant haemodynamic adverse effects.</p><sec
