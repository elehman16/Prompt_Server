Recent research has shown that sleep facilitates abstraction of gist information as well as integration across multiple memories, insight into hidden solutions, and even the ability to make creative connections between distantly related ideas and concepts. To investigate the effect of sleep on memory organization, 35 normal volunteers were randomly assigned either to the sleep (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) or wake group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18). The sleep subjects performed the Japanese Verbal Learning Test (JVLT), a measure of learning and memory, three times in the evening, and slept. On the following morning (9&#x02009;h later), they were asked to recall the words on the list. The wake subjects took the same test in the morning, and were asked to recall the words in the same time interval as in the sleep group. The semantic clustering ratio (SCR), divided by the total number of words recalled, was used as an index of memory organization. Our main interest was whether the sleep subjects elicit a greater increase in this measure from the third to the fourth assessments. Time&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Group interaction effect on SCR was not significant between the sleep group and wake group as a whole. Meanwhile, the change in the SCR between the third and fourth trials was negatively correlated with duration of nocturnal waking in the sleep group, but not other sleep indices. Based on this observation, further analysis was conducted for subjects in the sleep group who awoke nocturnally for &#x0003c;60&#x02009;min for comparison with the wake group. A significant Time&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;Group interaction was noted; these &#x0201c;good-sleepers&#x0201d; showed a significantly greater improvement in the memory index compared with the wake subjects. These results provide the first suggestion that sleep may enhance memory organization, which requires further study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>memory organization</kwd><kwd>Japanese Verbal Learning Test</kwd><kwd>wake after sleep onset</kwd><kwd>polysomnographic recordings</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="6244"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is important for a variety of physiological functions, e.g., homeostatic maintenance (Achermann and Borb&#x000e9;ly, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Recently, sleep has been shown to enhance processing of information obtained during wakefulness, and consolidate it in the form of memory (Peigneux et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Smith, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).</p><p>Memory is generally classified into short-term memory and long-term memory; the latter divided into episodic memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory (Tulving and Fergus, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The concepts of memory organization refer to the possibility that the internal representation of a given perceptual input may assume different forms depending upon certain operation on the input, or on its representation in the memory store. Memory organization carries the implication of changes in the memory trace of an event that are influenced by the presence of certain other traces in the episodic memory store. Temporal encoding of an input implies the registration of the date of an episode without regard to other episodes, and it may not represent the way the system works, and the temporal date of a stored event may be determined by its organization in relation to other events with their temporal dates. Semantic encoding of a verbal item in episodic memory implies that the trace of the item is influenced by the information already available about its referent concept in semantic memory, while semantic organization refers to the grouping of items in a given set that reflects the semantic relations among the corresponding concepts. Memory organization refers to the collection and associations of memorized items and their recall (Kirimura, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and implicitly serves as a strategy for facilitating memory itself. With memory organization, it is defined as &#x0201c;the method of summarizing, arranging, and memorizing related information.&#x0201d; Since other information which is related to it can be remembered as nature if more information can be memorized efficiently and certain information is remembered if information can be systematized by systematization, the burden in the case of search also decreases.</p><p>From the view point of cognitive psychology, primary aspects of memory organization are already integrated in long-term memory. Generally, we unconsciously categorize items from the materials being learned, and judge novel items if they fall into a certain category. Memory organization is assessed by several ways, e.g., verbal fluency (Sumiyoshi et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), story memory (Sumiyoshi et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), and word memory (Nohara et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yamashita et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) tests. Accordingly, the Japanese Verbal Learning Test (JVLT), a word list test, was developed as a measure of memory organization (Yamashita et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). JVLT is a learning task and consists of a word list of 16 words. This test was developed based on previous reports (Gold, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>) that employed three word lists (random, blocked, and unblocked lists), with a differential degree of semantic organization. The unblocked list is constituted by four semantic categories (animals, countries, musical instruments, and vegetables) with four words in each category. The unblocked list is organized in a manner that the words in the same category do not appear one after another. Thus, this list has an implicit category structure. JVLT uses a 16-word unblocked list involves four semantic categories with four words in each category. The words in the list are selected from everyday Japanese vocabulary; they are used approximately in the same frequency (Nohara et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Yamashita et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The number of semantic categories (semantic clustering ratio, SCR) is counted when a separate word belonging to the same semantic category is recalled consequently. Thus, the SCR implicitly reflects the degree of memory organization. However, this index by itself can be affected by the total number of words recalled. Therefore, this study used the ratio of SCR vs. the total number of recalled words (SCR ratio) as an index of memory organization (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Further, this cognitive domain is impaired in patients with psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia (Nohara et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>An example of memory organization as assessed by the Japanese Verbal Learning Test</bold>. The number of semantic categories (SCR) is counted when a separate word belonging to the same semantic category is recalled consequently. Thus, the SCR implicitly reflects the degree of memory organization. However, this index by itself can be affected by the total number of words recalled. Therefore, this study used the ratio of SCR vs. the total number of recalled words (SCR ratio) as an index of memory organization (see Materials and Methods).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnbeh-08-00065-g001"/></fig><p>A relationship between memory and sleep has been reported (Stickgold, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). For example, a facilitative effect of sleep on declarative memory has been demonstrated in humans (Stickgold and Walker, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Specifically, performance on paired-association task has been associated with slow-wave sleep (Plihal and Born, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Gais et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Gais and Born, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), REM sleep (Koninck et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>), stage 2 sleep (Walker et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), and spindles (Fogel et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In particular, subjects with sleep apnea syndrome perform worse on tests of memory consolidation compared with healthy individuals (Kloepfer et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Further, sleep deprivation has been shown to impair attention span (Hsieh et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest an importance of an appropriate amount of sleep in general and the maintenance, and, possibly, enhancement of memory.</p><p>The over lapping replay of related memories selectively strengthens shared elements (Lewis and Durrant, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Repeated reactivation of memories in different combinations progressively builds schematic representations of the relationships between stimuli. Sleep can integrate information into existing memory networks, look for common patterns and distil overarching rules, or simply stabilize and strengthen the memory exactly as it was learned (Stickgold and Walker, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The above considerations led us to hypothesize that sleep would improve memory organization. To date, however, there is little information on the link between this domain of cognitive ability and sleep. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine whether organization of memory, as evaluated word list learning, would be enhanced during sleep in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-five healthy female subjects (university students; average age: 20.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;years) participated in the study.

We compared memory organization between sleep and wake group, but found no significant difference between the groups. So, we needed more subanalyses. In sub analyze, sleep subjects elicited an increase in memory organization compared with awake subjects. On the other hand, sleep did not affect the number of recalled words. To our knowledge, these findings indicate that sleep may enhance memory organization.</p><p>A prominent theory proposes that three characteristic field potentials, &#x0201c;slow oscillations,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;spindles,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sharp&#x0201d; wave-ripples are involved in some forms of sleep-dependent consolidation (Lewis and Durrant, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). During SWS, memories newly encoded into a temporary store (i.e., the hippocampus in the declarative memory system) are repeatedly reactivated, which drives their gradual redistribution to the long-term store (i.e., the neocortex). System consolidation during SWS relies on a dialog between neocortex and hippocampus under top-down control by the neocortical slow oscillations. The depolarizing up phases of the slow oscillations drive the repeated reactivation of hippocampal memory representations together with sharp wave-ripples and thalamo-cortical spindles. This synchronous drive allows for the formation of spindle-ripple events where sharp wave-ripples and associated reactivated memory information become nested into succeeding troughs of a spindle (Rasch and Born, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The neural basis for memory formation has been investigated by using several modalities. In a positron emission tomography study (Fletcher et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), performance on a task to generate an organization structure in a word list was associated with activation in the left prefrontal cortex in normal subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the left inferior prefrontal cortex elicits increased activation during semantic encoding (Demb et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study using near-infrared spectroscopy showed activation of prefrontal cortex during a memory organization task in healthy people (Matsui et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>). These findings suggest the role for prefrontal cortex in memory performance and its organization.</p><p>Suppression of cholinergic activity during SWS alleviates tonic inhibition of hippocampal CA3 and CA1 feedback neurons, thereby it enables spontaneous reactivations of the hippocampal networks and of the memory information encoded in these networks, as well as the transfer of the reactivated information to neocortical networks (Rasch and Born, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The acetylcholine system in the hippocampus has been suggested to regulate the acquisition of new knowledge (Terry and Buccafusco, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). For example, cholinergic activity is low during slow-wave sleep (Gais and Born, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) that improves memory performance, as mentioned above. Specifically, it is assumed that the direction of cholinergic activity regulate type of sleep, which affects declarative memory. For example, Gais and Born (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) proposed an antagonistic relationship between the acetylcholine system and memory formation, i.e., cholinergic transmissions increase during waking or REM sleep, while they are reduced during slow-wave sleep. Taken together, acetylcholine is considered a major neurochemical substance for all stages of sleep, and affects some types of cognitive abilities.</p><p>Other neurotransmitters may also play a role in the ability of sleep to enhance memory. For example, Jouvet (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>) proposed monoamines (noradrenaline, serotonin) are also involved in the regulation of non-REM sleep (Jouvet, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Further, REM sleep has been reported to be regulated by monoamines, as well as by acetylcholine (Hobson et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). These observations suggest neurotransmitters affect memory performance by modulating the quality of sleep.</p><p>Results in the present study suggest nocturnal waking is disadvantageous for memory organization, suggesting the importance of the quality of sleep. Specifically, sleep selectively improved an index of memory organization but not total words recalled, a measure of learning memory itself. The reason for this discrepancy may include that the number of words in the JVLT did not pose sufficient workload. The easiness of memory tasks have been reported to make it difficult to interpret data regarding the effect of sleep (Empson and Clark, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>). In fact, our findings indicate a ceiling effect in both groups for the total number of words recalled in the third JVLT [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> (left) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (left)]. On the other hand, the workload for memory organization may have been appropriate to assess the effect of sleep, as implicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> (right) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (right). It considered about the influence of the ceiling effect of a memory organization task, only the sleep subjects obtained the result that organization was promoted by sleep, to the result of having divided and examined the group again (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the greater hike of the SCR ratio in good sleeper subjects compared to controls may have been a result of the ability of the former subjects to effectively restore semantic knowledge. Alternatively, it is also assumed that the ability to organize memory was enhanced by sleep. Recent research has shown that sleep facilitates abstraction of gist information as well as integration across multiple memories, insight into hidden solutions, and even the ability to make creative connections between distantly related ideas and concepts (Lewis and Durrant, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Griessenberger et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Our findings may also suggest these findings.</p><p>Abnormalities in the sleep structure, such as the decreased slow-wave sleep and increased nocturnal waking, have been reported in patients with depression (Tsuno et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) or schizophrenia (Zarcone et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). It is also reported that sleep-dependent memory consolidation is absent or weakened in people suffering from conditions that cause sleep disturbances. For example, consolidation of declarative memory is absent in patients with sleep apnea syndrome (Kloepfer et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These observations suggest that adequate sleep may be effective in enhancing some types of cognitive functions, such as organizing of information, in clinical subjects.</p><p>We compared memory organization between sleep and wake group, but found no significant difference between the groups. So, we needed more subanalyses.</p><p>The difference between groups before the retention interval should be considered as a major limitation, and the fact that ceiling performance was reached for total word recall as well as for the memory organization parameter in the wake group. The absence of a significant relationship between memory organization and other sleep variables, e.g. amount of specific stages of sleep, could be due to the small sample size. We need more analyze another sleep index. In addition, the quality of sleep is much worse as in other sleep studies including young and healthy participants (Carskadon, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Payne et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This is thought that we did not set up adaptation night, so the sleep subjects would not sleep well. The sleep and the wake group would effect by circadian rhythm on learning. Further controlled study with a larger number of subjects and control procedure controlled circadian rhythm effect is warranted to investigate the role for sleep in memory and other cognitive abilities.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by grants-in-aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants for Comprehensive Research on Disability, Health, and Welfare (H23-Seishin-Ippan-002; H24-Seishin-Ippan-002), and SENSHIN Medical Research Foundation.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Achermann</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Borb&#x000e9;ly</surname><given-names>A.
