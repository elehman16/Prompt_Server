A secondary aim was to evaluate the rate of Bankart lesions.</p><p><bold>Patients and methods</bold> 55 patients with primary anterior shoulder dislocation, aged between 16 and 40 years, were randomized to immobilization in ER or IR. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed shortly after the injury. After the immobilization, MRI arthrography was performed. We evaluated the rate of Bankart lesions and measured the separation and displacement of the labrum as well as the length of the detached part of the capsule on the glenoid neck.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Immobilization in ER reduced the number of Bankart lesions (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1 &#x02013;13; p = 0.04). Separation decreased to a larger extent in the ER group than in the IR group (mean difference 0.6 mm, 95% CI: 0.1 &#x02013; 1.1, p = 0.03).

Reduction followed by a period of 2&#x02013;3 weeks with the arm in a sling is still an accepted treatment of primary dislocation, also in young patients. The literature shows no concensus regarding the benefit of traditional immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Kiviluoto et al. 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Henry and Genung 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Hovelius et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Kralinger et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Itoi et al. 2007</xref>). Based on a cadaveric study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Itoi et al. (2000)</xref> introduced the term coaptation zone, in which the edges of a simulated Bankart lesion were kept approximated without the surrounding muscles. These authors anticipated that choosing a position of immobilization (within the so-called coaptation zone) that increases tension in the anterior soft tissue (such as adduction and external rotation) may be better than immobilizing the shoulder in the conventional position. In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. 2001</xref>), they found that external rotation increases the amount of coaptation compared to internal rotation. They postulated that in external rotation the subscapularis muscle becomes tight, which may prohibit the development of a hematoma and promote better coaptation. In an earlier prospective randomized study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Wintzell et al. 1999</xref>), it was reported that removal of the hematoma with arthroscopic lavage reduced the recurrence rate following primary anterior shoulder dislocation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Limpisvasti et al. (2008)</xref> questioned the importance of coaptation. In their cadaveric study, external rotation did not have any effect on the contact pressure between the subscapularis muscle and the labrum. Contrary to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Seybold et al. (2009)</xref> found that immobilization in external rotation after first-time dislocation improved the position of the labroligamentous lesion on the glenoid rim. A recent randomized controlled study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Itoi et al. (2007)</xref> has shown that immobilization with the arm in external rotation after shoulder dislocation reduces the risk of recurrence compared with conventional immobilization in internal rotation. Itoi's cross-sectional MRI study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. 2001</xref>) included patients with initial dislocation and patients with recurrent dislocation. The patients were only evaluated once after the dislocation, and the study was not designed to test whether the effect of the position of the labrum was permanent or temporary.</p><p>In the present prospective study, the aim was to test whether 3 weeks of immobilization in external rotation approximates the Bankart lesion to the glenoid neck differently than immobilization in internal rotation. To evaluate changes in the outcome parameters, imaging was done both shortly after the injury and after the immobilization was finished.</p></sec><sec id="s002" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In February 2005, we started a prospective randomized multicenter study in Norway to compare the recurrence rate of shoulder dislocation in 2 groups of patients. Patients with initial traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation were randomized to either immobilization with the arm in external rotation (ER) or immobilization with the arm in internal rotation (IR). The inclusion of patients was finished in February 2008. 188 patients from 13 hospitals were included in the study. At 2 centers (Oslo University Hospital, Ullevaal, and Akershus University Hospital) the patients were also asked to participate in the present study. This included examination of the shoulders by CT and MRI at the beginning of the treatment and by MRI arthrography (MR-a) after the treatment was finished. Of the 70 patients who were diagnosed and treated at these 2 hospitals, 55 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were willing to participate in the present study, and gave their informed consent (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the prospective randomized multicenter study.

This is a technique with vertical traction and external rotation; it has been used for many years at Oslo University Hospital, Ullevaal, and is very similar to the technique described later as the Spaso technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Yuen et al. 2001</xref>). The method of Kocher was used in 3 cases, and in another 3 cases the Stimson's hanging arm method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">Stimson 1900</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">Thakur and Narayan 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Cunningham 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Chitgopkar and Khan 2005</xref>) was used. In a cadaveric study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">Miller et al. (2004)</xref> found that the contact force between the Bankart lesion and the glenoid is at its maximum with the shoulder in 45&#x002da; of external rotation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">Itoi et al. (2007)</xref> reported discomfort in patients applying too much external rotation, and used 10&#x002da; of external rotation in his prospective randomized study. We had tested our immobilizer in a small pilot study and experienced that the patients tolerated immobilization in 15&#x002da; external rotation very well. All patients in the ER group used a prefabricated shoulder immobilizer (Don Joy Ultrasling ER, 15&#x002da; version). All 3 available sizes (small, medium, and large) were stored in the hospital in a left and right version. To control the position, a line at the top of the immobilizer should be parallel with the frontal plane when the arm is correctly placed. The hospital personnel were trained to instruct patients to use the immobilizer. All patients in the IR group used an ordinary collar and cuff device. After they had finished the immobilization, all patients were asked in a standard questionnaire if they had any problems with the use of the immobilizer or the collar and cuff. It was not possible to provide MRI and CT immediately, but these examinations were conducted shortly after the treatment was started. The median length of time between the dislocation and the CT and MRI was 7 (2&#x02013;14) days. When MRI is undertaken during the first 2 weeks after the dislocation, the blood and effusion in the joint cavity will act as a contrast fluid. After the immobilization period, patients were investigated with MRI arthrography. All 55 patients had CT and MRI. For different reasons, 4 patients did not have MRI arthrography (<xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The study was approved by our institutional study board, the Regional Medical Ethics Committee, and the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services. The study was also reported to Clinical Trials.gov as part of an ongoing randomized multicenter study (Clinical Trials.gov identifier NCT00202735).</p><sec id="s003"><title>Imaging</title><p>Imaging was conducted at the Department of Radiology, Aker University Hospital. All images were routinely reported and a standard questionnaire was used to register CT, MRI, and MRI arthrography findings. One radiologist (MGS), who was blinded as to treatment, filled in the questionnaire. He reported whether the Bankart lesion was present or not. Later, all measurements of separation and displacement of the labrum from the glenoid neck and the length of the detached part of the capsule on the glenoid neck were performed by another radiologist (ESL), who was also blinded regarding treatment. For CT examination, a multidetector scanner (Somatom Sensation 64; Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) was used. The patients lay supine on the CT table. An axial volume uptake (64 mm &#x000d7; 0.6 mm) through the acromioclavicular (AC) and glenohumeral joints was performed. Then an oblique coronal and an oblique sagittal projection were reconstructed directly from the raw data.</p><p>The MRI and MRI arthrography examinations were performed on a 1.5-tesla scanner (Siemens Symphony; Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). For both examinations we used a small flex coil, which was placed at 45 degrees obliquely to the long axis of the body. The following sequences were obtained in the MR evaluation: oblique coronal PD/T2-weighted sequence (FoV 200 &#x000d7; 150, matrix 192 &#x000d7; 192, TR 3,070, TE 13, TE 79) and STIR (T1 inversion recovery, FoV 200 &#x000d7; 159.4, matrix 157 &#x000d7; 256, TR 5,000, TE 29), axial PD fs (fat saturation) (FoV 175 &#x000d7; 175, matrix 248 &#x000d7; 266, TR 3000, TE 13), and sagittal oblique T2 (FoV 190 &#x000d7; 190, matrix 192 &#x000d7; 192, TR 3500, TE 88). A 4-mm slice thickness with 0.8-mm gap and an acquisition of 1 were used in all sequences.</p><p>The MRI arthrography examination was performed fluoroscopically under sterile conditions. The patient lay supine on the fluorotable. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-G needle was introduced into the joint. 5 mL of Omnipaque 300 (General Electric) and 10 mL of diluted (0.02 mmol/L) Omniscan (General Electric) were injected. An arthrogram was then obtained, using the following sequences: oblique coronal PD/T2 (FoV 200 &#x000d7; 150, matrix 192 &#x000d7; 256, TR 3,000, TE 15, TE 93) and T1 fs (FoV 175 &#x000d7; 131.3, matrix 146 &#x000d7; 256, TR 490, TE 12), axial T1 fs (FoV 160 &#x000d7; 160, matrix 256 &#x000d7; 256, TR 490, TE 12), oblique sagittal T1 (FoV 160 &#x000d7; 1,660, matrix 256 &#x000d7; 256, TR 558, TE 12), and ABER (abduction external rotation) T1 (FoV 160 &#x000d7; 160, matrix 256 &#x000d7; 256, TR 551, TE 12). The slice thickness was 4 mm with a gap of 0.8 mm, with an acquisition of 2. The MRI and MRI arthrography examinations were sent to the PACS archive for evaluation.</p><p>To achieve approximately the same degree of rotation in all patients on CT, MRI, and MRI arthrography, the patients kept the arm along the side of the trunk with the thumb facing upwards.</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>Measurements</title><p>Measurements of the separation and displacement of the labrum and also measurements of the detached length of the capsule were conducted according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al.

The data were normalized by dividing the observed values by the ratio of the measured diameter of the humeral head to the mean diameter of the humeral head. We assumed that the detached area and the opening angle are influenced by the degree of humeral rotation and the amount of intraarticular fluid. We found it difficult to measure the exact opening angle between the anterior aspect of the glenoid neck and a line tangential to the capsule at the glenoid insertion, and did not measure these parameters as Itoi et al. had done in their original study (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The definition of &#x02018;separation&#x02019;, &#x02018;displacement&#x02019; and &#x02018;detached length&#x02019; was done according to the method of Eiji Itoi.

These findings are in agreement with results previously published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref>. The difference in separation between groups was statistically significant, but smaller than the measurement error. Thus, the clinical significance is difficult to interpret. In contrast to Itoi et al., we found no differences in displacement of the labrum and capsular coaptation (detached length).The major advantage of our study is the randomized design and the blinded follow-up evaluations in order to reduce selection and observer bias. The experience level of radiologists can affect reproducibility and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Waldt et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">van Grinsven et al. 2007</xref>). All our images were described by one experienced musculoskeletal radiologist (MGS), who filled in a standard questionnaire. Another radiologist (ESL) performed the measurements. Both radiologists were blinded to the treatment given.</p><p>The major limitation of our study is the time from the start of treatment to the baseline MRI evaluation. Comparing our results with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref>, it is possible that more adaptations may have occurred in the ER group in the initial period. Thus, our observations may underestimate the real difference, and may also contribute to the observed minor differences for displacement on MRI arthrography.</p><p>In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref>, the mean length of time between the last dislocation and the MRI was 4 days for the patients who had a primary dislocation, but it was 29 days for the patients who had a recurrent dislocation. However, Itoi did not measure changes over time. Another limitation both of our study and the study by Itoi et al. is that separation, displacement, and detached length could not be measured in all patients, and that MRI arthrography could not be performed successfully on 4 patients in our study.</p><p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Seybold et al. (2009)</xref>, we performed measurements in the anticipated neutral position and evaluated changes in the position of the labrum over time. We controlled the degree of rotation by letting the supine patient hold the arm along the side of the trunk with the thumb facing upwards. We did not measure the exact angle. The ABER position (abducted and externally rotated) was used only to detect if a Bankart lesion was present or not. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref>, the extent of rotation plays a role in the distance of separation and displacement. By applying a randomized study design, measurement error attributed to position is likely to be evenly distributed between groups. However, we cannot exclude that slight differences in arm positioning may have influenced our results.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Itoi et al. (2001)</xref> included patients with primary and recurrent dislocation, but as with the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">Seybold et al. (2009)</xref> we only included primary dislocations. Seybold et al. classified the labroligamentous lesions as Bankart lesions, Perthes lesions, and non- classifiable lesions. In our study and in the study by Itoi, there was no differentiation between Bankart lesions and Perthes lesions.</p><p>In the present study the patients in the ER group were immobilized in 15&#x002da; of external rotation. Although many of the patients found the immobilizer impractical to use, the compliance was good in both groups.</p><p>Previous studies have found age to be the most important factor in determining the risk of recurrent instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">Henry and Genung 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Hovelius et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Kralinger et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Robinson et al. 2006</xref>). Diverging results have been reported for gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Hovelius et al. 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">Robinson et al. 2006</xref>). Our results were adjusted for both age and gender.</p><p>The differences between our results and those of Itoi et al. may be attributed to study design. The clinical importance of our findings will be evaluated in a larger ongoing randomized study with 2 years of follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Conception and design: SL, JIB, SS, MGS.
