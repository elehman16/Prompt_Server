result of weakness of the affected side of the body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and the relatively posterior location of the center of gravity,
which limits their movements and reduces the risk of falls<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill walking is well known as an effective intervention for
increasing walking ability, stability of the lower extremity, muscle strength, balance, and
re-recognition of motor control required for the walking pattern<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Underwater therapy helps improve physical functioning for a
better quality of life by utilizing the properties of water. Hydrostatic pressure, buoyancy,
friction, and viscous resistance are important water properties, and underwater resistance,
in particular, is 12 times greater than overground resistance. Additionally, water
resistance is changeable depending on the velocity of body movement. Faster movement of the
body is associated with greater resistance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercising in water helps achieve an acquired symmetrical gait and
limits unnecessary movement, thereby affecting not only energy efficiency but also muscle
strength and endurance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, a few
studies investigated the effects of treadmill exercise in restricted water depth on
improvement of muscle strength and gait velocity. Moreover, previous studies have proved
that underwater treadmill walking training (UTWT) is beneficial for weight bearing in the
stance phase, which improves both gait and postural control in patients with hemiplegia<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have been conducted on the
effects of UTWT on balance and gait. However, a quantitative evaluation of isokinetic muscle
strength in hemiplegic patients has not been studied sufficiently. Therefore, the purpose of
this study was to compare the effects of UTWT and those of overground treadmill walking
training (OTWT) on peak knee flexion and extension torques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed at the C hospital in Daejeon. Thirty-two subjects with hemiplegia

characteristics. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Mini-mental state examination-Korea
score &#x0003e;24 points; able to walk independently for 20 minutes; and no history of orthopedic
or neurologic problems other than a stroke. All subjects provided written informed consent
for participation in the study prior to its initiation. This study followed the principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients participated in the training for 30
minutes/session, 3 sessions/week, for 6 weeks, from November 3 to December 12, 2014. Warm-up
exercises were performed for 5 minutes to induce muscle relaxation, and these were followed
by UTWT for 20 minutes, and cool-down exercises and stretching for the final 5 minutes to
reduce muscle fatigue. HYDRO PHYSIO (Syspal Limited, England), an underwater treadmill, was
used at a velocity that was 36% of the overground gait speed at the start, and the velocity
was gradually increased by 0.1 m/s until the subjects were walking as fast as possible<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects wore aqua shoes for safety.
Water temperature and depth were 34&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and up to the xiphoid process, respectively<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. RTM 500 (BIODEX, USA), an overground
treadmill, was used following the same procedure as the UTWT. The Isokinetic Dynamometer
(BIODEX, USA) was used to assess knee extension peak torque (KEPT) and knee flexion peak
torque (KFPT). The subjects were instructed to stand holding a chair, with the thigh and
ankle on the test side fixed by a stabilization strap. The maximum torque was assessed 3
times at 60 and 120&#x000b0;/sec and the highest torque among these was selected. A 30-second rest
was given between tests. This test tool has high test-retest reliability (r=0.81) and
validity (r=0.99)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. All data were analyzed
using SPSS version 12 (Statistical Package for the Social Science). The Shapiro-Wilk test
was used for a normal distribution. All data are presented as mean (standard deviation). The
Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and independent t-tests were used for homogeneity of subject
characteristics. The paired t-test and independent t-test were used to compare pre- and
post-test values in each group and the differences between both groups, respectively. A
significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 was used for all statistical tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the pre- and post-UTWT and

daily living. The peak torque can be useful data in assessing a subject&#x02019;s exercise
ability<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, there was no
significant difference in the KFPT at the angular velocity of 120&#x000b0;/sec in the CG. However,
there was a significant difference in the KEPT at the angular velocity of 120&#x000b0;/sec in the
CG. In addition, there were significant differences in the KFPT and KEPT at the angular
velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec in both the EG and CG. In previous studies, OTWT for 12 weeks improved
overall lower extremity strength in hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and treadmill walking training applied in 10 hemiplegic patients
for 12 weeks positively affected the isokinetic muscle strength in the paralyzed knee
joint<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, UTWT is beneficial
for improving both muscle strength and recovery from paralysis. There were significant
differences in the KEPT and KFPT at all angular velocities after the UTWT. In previous
studies, UTWT has been shown to improve lower extremity muscle strength, which improved
walking velocity, cadence<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle
endurance<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> in the elderly. Moreover,
there was no significant difference in the KFPT at all angular velocities in both groups,
but the EG group showed significant improvement in the KEPT compared to the CG. A previous
study reported that UTWT applied in 10 elderly people influenced activation of gluteus
maximus, tensor fascia latae, and biceps femoris in the stance phase<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> and improved hip flexor strength, as a result of which,
there was improvement in gait velocity and stride<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the reason for a significant difference in the KEPT but
not in the KFPT was that underwater exercise influences muscle strength more than overground
exercise owing to water resistance, which was proved in the previous study. According to
Han&#x02019;s study, knee extension during the swing phase in UTWT is performed against much more
water resistance, resulting in increased muscle strength<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, previous studies have reported that muscle
contraction in the quadriceps femoris during UTWT was higher than that during OTWT<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the anteroposterior postural
perturbation of static postural control in the UTWT group showed a considerable difference,
decreasing by 41% compared to that before training<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The limitations of this study were a small sample size, lack of a
follow-up test to determine the carry-over effects, and no constraint of the effects of
other joints. Further investigation of the effects of an underwater therapy program in
hemiplegic subjects with modifications to address the above-mentioned limitations is
needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bohannon</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Recovery and correlates of trunk muscle strength after
