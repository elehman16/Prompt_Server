However, their expectations of surgery are often not met, and dissatisfaction with outcome and ongoing psychosocial concerns and distress are common. We developed a patient-centered intervention, PEGASUS:(Patients&#x02019; Expectations and Goals: Assisting Shared Understanding of Surgery) which supports shared decision making by helping women clarify their own, individual goals about reconstruction so that they can discuss these with their surgeon. Our acceptability/feasibility work has shown it is well received by patients and health professionals alike. We now need to establish whether PEGASUS improves patients&#x02019; experiences of breast reconstruction decision making and outcomes. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to examine the effectiveness of PEGASUS, an intervention designed to support shared decision making about breast reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A multi-centered sequential study will compare the impact of PEGASUS with usual care, in terms of patient reported outcomes (self-reported satisfaction with the outcome of surgery, involvement in decision making and in the consultation) and health economics. Initially we will collect data from our comparison (usual care) group (90 women) who will complete standardized measures (Breast-Q, EQ5D -5&#x000a0;L and ICECAP- A) at the time of decision making, 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after surgery. Health professionals will then be trained to use PEGASUS, which will be delivered to the intervention group (another 90 women completing the same measures at the time of decision making, and 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months after surgery). Health professionals and a purposefully selected sample of participants will be interviewed about whether their expectations of reconstruction were met, and their experiences of PEGASUS (if appropriate).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">PEGASUS may have the potential to provide health professionals with an easily accessible tool aiming to support shared decision making and improve patients&#x02019; satisfaction with breast reconstruction.

In England alone, more than 15,000 women undergo mastectomy each year and over 5000 elect breast reconstruction (BR) to surgically recreate a breast shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Options regarding BR timing and type are numerous, requiring women to make complex decisions amidst the emotional upheaval associated with cancer. Although BR aims to improve quality of life and appearance concerns, a national audit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] reported worrying levels of dissatisfaction with surgical outcome, supporting previous reports of ongoing pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. BR is not a panacea for the distress of mastectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] - almost half patients report some regret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Women seeking BR anticipate it will restore a sense of &#x02018;normality&#x02019;, but their expectations of outcomes are often unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The decision is &#x02018;preference-sensitive&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] because the &#x02018;right choice&#x02019; depends on individuals&#x02019; personal preferences rather than generic treatment factors. Clarifying each patient&#x02019;s preferences and values is imperative, central to shared decision making (SDM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and key to patient-centred care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, treatment decision making often triggers breakdowns in communication between patients and health professionals (HPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients and health professionals differ when rating the importance of facts and goals guiding decisions about reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Whilst women make choices by drawing comparisons with their pre-cancer appearance, health professionals draw on their clinical experience of a wider range of post-surgical outcomes including appearance, pain, impact on physical activities, body image and wellbeing.</p><p id="Par17">Women dissatisfied with the outcome of BR may seek further, corrective surgery (with implications for healthcare resources and distress for patients), and may maintain avoidance behaviours (e.g. intimacy, clothing choices) that BR was intended to reduce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. We surmise that if women have realistic expectations, then patient dissatisfaction, well-being and requests for additional surgery would improve. Although HPs need to ask women about their priorities and concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], promote realistic expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and support them making high quality decisions by empowering them through SDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there are no interventions to help them elicit patients&#x02019; values, expectations and preferences. Instead, support typically focuses on information provision (e.g. websites, leaflets). However, increasing the amount of information available does not address erroneous expectations since it reinforces patients as passive recipients rather than actively engaged in setting clear, patient-centred goals (an approach associated with positive experiences and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. SDM has been heralded as a means of improving patient reported outcomes and satisfaction with cancer care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (particularly concerning preference sensitive decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) but implementation is difficult and slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some decision aids for mastectomy patients are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but these are not BR-specific or focused around a face-to-face discussion centred on patients&#x02019; individual needs and the practicalities and possibilities of surgery. Nor do they explicitly help HPs and patients with the challenge of implementing SDM in this difficult and emotive situation. Clinicians report concerns that online interventions such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bresdex.com">BRESDEX.com</ext-link> cannot be tailored to patients&#x02019; individual needs, and could replace nurses&#x02019; roles and induce patient anxiety if not provided under clinical supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, attention has shifted to decision coaching to facilitate patients&#x02019; preparation for SDM about preference sensitive decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">We developed an intervention to facilitate SDM by specifically helping patients and HPs clarify each woman&#x02019;s motivations for BR (PEGASUS: Patients&#x02019; Expectations and Goals: Assisting Shared Understanding of Surgery) which is designed to elicit each patient&#x02019;s own expectations of what she wants BR to achieve, facilitate setting patient centred goals (what she considers a successful outcome), and aid discussion of both physical and psychosocial expectations, goals and outcomes with their surgical team. PEGASUS is delivered to women previously informed about their reconstructive options, since physique and health status may render some procedures inappropriate. Unlike a purely paper-based intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], PEGASUS involves meeting a decision facilitator (a specialist nurse/psychologist trained in its use who is referred to as the PEGASUS Coach) during which the patient is helped to identify her individual BR goals, what would indicate a successful outcome and the importance of each goal. She takes the completed PEGASUS sheet into the surgical consultation where it is used to inform shared goals and promote concordance between the patient and surgeon, so they approach surgical outcomes as a shared endeavour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Interventions encouraging patients to prepare for and actively engage in consultations effectively improve satisfaction and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. PEGASUS facilitates the disclosure and discussion of expectations, enabling the surgeon to decide the extent to which they are realistic and, if necessary, take appropriate steps to address unrealistic expectations (e.g. explain the likely outcomes further, show more photographs). PEGASUS is a novel, well-accepted intervention that helps women express what they want and assist health professionals &#x02018;diagnose&#x02019; their patients&#x02019; preferences &#x02013; failure to do this is common and warrants interventions to &#x0201c;transform the role of patients in the NHS from passive users into active and engaged partners in care&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] pviii). Our work follows recommendations for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Feasibility and acceptability testing is complete (conducted under NRES reference 11/NW/0788) and showed that PEGASUS is acceptable to both patients and health professionals alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We now need to establish whether using PEGASUS offers benefits over usual care &#x02013; this is the aim of the current study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The main research question</title><p id="Par20">

Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are not necessarily suited for psychosocial research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In this study it is inappropriate to randomize participants since contamination effects between conditions are likely if surgeons must focus some consultations around the patient goals offered by PEGASUS, but revert to usual care in others. In this non-randomised design, the control group comprises consenting patients receiving usual care. On completion of the control group recruitment, the health professionals receive PEGASUS training, prior to intervention group recruitment. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a selection of participants and health professionals involved in the PEGASUS intervention condition. Intervention consultations will be recorded (with permission) and assessed against a study-specific checklist to check the fidelity of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design characteristics</title><p id="Par32">The characteristics of the PEGASUS trial were assessed using PRECIS-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. PRECIS-2 is a tool specifically designed to assess trial design on a continuum of pragmatic-explanatory across nine criteria: eligibility, recruitment, setting, organisation, flexibility delivery, flexibility adherence, follow-up, primary outcome and primary analysis. Pragmatic trials aim to explore whether an intervention works in real-life settings whereas exploratory trials aim to explore whether an intervention works under ideal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the trial design based on the nine criteria.

Telephone interviews will be conducted if preferred by the patient or health professional, or if face-to-face is not possible. Face-to-face interviews will be conducted at a time and place of the interviewee&#x02019;s choosing (following standard University protocols for safe lone working). Interview recordings will be transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Findings will be agreed by the research team, with feedback from the advisory group. Participants&#x02019; goals and expectations on the PEGASUS forms will be subjected to content analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data storage/confidentiality</title><p id="Par54">A data protection document describes the study&#x02019;s safeguards for the storage and protection of confidential information, both held manually and on computers. This document is guided by the Caldicott principles for handling patient-identifiable information, The UK Data Protection Act (1998) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Good Clinical Practice guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. All data will be treated as confidential. Only members of the research team who are also members of the breast reconstruction service at the participating sites will examine clinic and medical records in order to identify potential participants. Once consented, the research team based at the university may require access to participants&#x02019; medical records in order to collect and check health economic data. Permission to do this will be included on the participant consent form. Audio files (interviews and consultation recordings) and data will be stored on a password protected computer accessible only by the research team. Completed questionnaires and consent forms will be stored separately, in a locked filing cabinet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Research governance, safety and the conduct of the study</title><p id="Par55">It was agreed that an independent data monitoring committee was not necessary and interim analyses will not be conducted. A PEGASUS steering group will be set up with an independent chair and members and will meet every 6 months. The steering group will provide advice and supervision of the study and will focus on the progress of the study, approaches to improve adherence, the collection of follow-up data, participant safety and consideration of new information. The management team (consisting of the principle investigator, clinical psychologist, researcher, health economist and statistician) will meet once-a-month to discuss study progress, protocol adherence and amendments for ethical approval. Access to the final dataset will be restricted to members of the study management group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Dissemination of research findings</title><p id="Par56">Members of our steering and management groups will provide expert advice on the dissemination of the main outcomes to participants. The findings of this study will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals. Dissemination of the findings to health professionals and organisations supporting women with breast cancer will be planned and developed with stakeholders throughout&#x000a0;the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study approvals</title><p id="Par57">This study has been approved by the NRES Committee South Central - Berkshire B (reference 15/SC/0331) and the Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences Research Ethics Committee at the University of the West of England, Bristol.

Since it focuses on each patient&#x02019;s individual, personal goals, PEGASUS offers a tool to support health professionals who are looking to provide patient-centred individualized care for women facing the choice of whether or not to undergo breast reconstruction of any sort and at any time (as an immediate or delayed procedure). It is not limited to any particular type or timing of reconstructive surgery since it is delivered after a patient has been given information by her surgical team about the particular procedures for which she is deemed to be a suitable candidate. We will collate information about the decisions women make about reconstructive surgery, as well as details of their diagnosis and other treatment in order to describe our sample.</p><p id="Par61">This study does not employ randomization for the reasons outlined above. Instead, we are employing a rigorous design that is best suited to this specific clinical situation.</p><p id="Par62">We plan future research to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the PEGASUS intervention with other patient groups, including adults seeking cosmetic surgical procedures and young people with craniofacial conditions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par69">
