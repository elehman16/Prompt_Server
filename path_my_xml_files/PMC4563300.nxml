the post-TKA rehabilitation protocol on the functional status and quality of life of the
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Patients were randomized into an exercise (control) and
electrical stimulation (NMES) group. A home exercise program was prescribed for the
control group. For the neuromuscular stimulation group 30 minute electrical stimulation
applied to the vastus medialis muscle 5 days a week for 4 to 6 weeks. VAS, the timed up
and go test, WOMAC and SF-36 scores were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at
the first month and the third month of the follow-up period. [Results] Both the NMES group
had 30 patients each, with 2 and 1 male patients respectively. The comparisons of WOMAC
results at month 1 revealed that pain, stiffness, and total scores of the NMES group was
significantly better than those of control group at the first and third months.
Significantly better physical function and SF-36 subscales, except mental health, were
found for the NMES group at the first month of follow-up. [Conclusion] The inclusion of
the neuromuscular electrical stimulation program after knee arthroplasty was more
effective at providing rapid improvements in knee pain, walking distance and quality of
life.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Quadriceps muscle</kwd><kwd>Knee joint</kwd><kwd>Arthroplasty</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical treatment which is useful in knee
osteoarthritis (OA) for relieving pain and improving function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though TKA provides significant pain relief and improves self
reported function, this procedure fails to improve the quadriceps muscle strength to the
normal level for age-matched healthy population<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with endstage knee osteoarthritis exhibit relatively 20%
more activation deficits in the involved quadriceps than in the uninvolved limb suggesting
that neural mechanisms contribute to the weakness of the quadriceps even prior to TKA
surgery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weakness of the quadriceps muscle results in important functional consequences such as
decreased gait speed, balance, difficulty with stair climbing, and rising from a chair and
risk of falls<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Individuals with
tibiofemoral osteoarthritis demonstrate significant quadriceps weakness compared to people
without radiological evidence of the disease.</p><p>Pre- and post-operative strength loss is another issue which may result in long-term
quadriceps strength loss<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three to four
weeks after TKA surgery, patients experience 60% decrease in quadriceps strength and both
pre- and post-operative loss of strength may be attributed to impaired quadriceps
activation. However central activation deficits are reported to account for two times
greater strength loss than muscle atrophy early after surgery<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is often used as a quadriceps strengthening
modality to train patients without sufficient volitional quadriceps activation by engaging
neurophysiological mechanisms which are believed to facilitate strength gains and provide
general physical stress to quadriceps neuromuscular system of the quadriceps<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>NMES may affect central activation deficits, thereby allowing restoration of normal
quadriceps muscle function more effectively than voluntary exercise alone. The improvement
mechanism of NMES is unclear, however there are some theories. First the intensity of the
muscle contraction with NMES may be greater<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, NMES may alter motor recruitment. Electrically elicited
muscle contractions enable activation of a greater proportion of type 2 muscle fibers than
volitional exercise of comparable intensity. Finally NMES may also influence motor
performance via peripheral afferent inputs that may alter motor cortex excitability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various rehabilitation programs are available for strengthening the quadriceps of the
patients with knee osteoarthtiris before or after the TKA procedure. The exercise programs
include isometric exercises, simple strengthening exercises, gait training and closed
kinetic chain exercises to improve strength and functional recovery<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are conflicting evidence in terms of the effectiveness of NMES in improving
quadriceps strength and physical performance of patients following TKA. The settings,
application methods, overall intensity, duration and postoperative timing differ
substantially among studies. The results of previous studies are controversial as NMES has
been found effective in improving physical performance in two studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, ineffective in another study compared to exercise
alone<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> and another study (designed as
a non-inferiority trial) reporting that the isolated use of NMES is as effective as
traditional physical therapy following TKA<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to a review, home exercise programs consisting of different exercise protocols
provide short term improvements in the physical functioning of post-TKA patients, but these
improvements persist for less than one year, and different exercise programs have no
superiority over each other<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Valid and
acceptable scales are required to analyze the outcomes of treatments for osteoarthritis
patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the addition of NMES to the
post-TKA rehabilitation protocol on patients&#x02019; functional status and quality of life.
Secondary aim was the assessment of the changes in patients&#x02019; pain and range of motion. Our
hypothesis was that the supplementation of exercises with NMES would yield further
improvement in patients&#x02019; functions and quality of life at 3 months after TKA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixty patients with knee OA who were admitted to the Orthopaedia and Traumatology
outpatient clinic for TKA of the Istanbul Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Training
Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey between 01-September-2006 and 01-April-2007 were included in this
study.</p><p>All patients received a physical examination, and knee roentgenograms were taken. The
patients who had symptomatic hip osteoarthritis, concomitant cardiac or internal diseases
precluding surgical treatment, a history of epilepsy, the presence of a pacemaker, a skin
lesion over the quadriceps muscle that required electrode application, muscle atrophy, or
severe cognitive dysfunction were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were hospitalized in the department of orthopedics inpatient clinic and a total
knee arthroplasty procedure was scheduled. Demographic characteristics of the patients were
obtained from paients&#x02019; records. Passive knee range of motion (ROM) was measured in the
supine position using a manual goniometer. Passive knee ROMs were measured and recorded. The
Timed up and Go test (TUG), and Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were
conducted for the assessment of knee functions and symptoms before surgery, and Short-Form
36 (SF-36) for the determination of their general health status.</p><p>The patients were randomized into two groups by flipping a coin. The head side of the coin
determined the control group, and the tail side of the coin determined NMES group. Beginning
from the postoperative day 1, patients in both groups started 30 minute sessions of range of
motion (ROM) exercises from 0 to 30&#x000b0; within the limits of pain, using a continuous passive
motion (CPM) device, for one week. They also attended a rehabilitation program beginning
from the postoperative first day. Ankle ROM exercises were started on postoperative day 0.
Patients were taught to perform isometric quadriceps exercises and to raise their leg
straight, stand up with a walker and fully extend their knees and active and assisted ROM
exercises were started on the first postoperative day. Active ROM and isometric quadriceps
exercises were continued between postoperative days 2 and 10. After the removal of the
sutures, patellar mobilization was performed for patients who did not develop postoperative
problems. Patients were instructed to perform active hip abduction and adduction exercises.
A home exercise program was recommended and patients were discharged from the hospital on
postoperative day 7. Walker- assisted ambulation was recommended until the sixth week after
surgery. Closed kinetic chain exercises were started from 4 to 5 weeks after surgery. CPM
applications and a rehabilitation program were also started in NMES group on the first day
after surgery. In this group, 30-minute sessions of NMES were applied to the vastus medialis
muscle 5 days a week, for 4 to 6 weeks.</p><p>Following the surgery, a bandage was applied to the knee and limb elevation was used for
all patients. Cryotherapy was conducted for 15 minutes, three times a day to reduce pain and
non-opioid analgesics were administered to the patients with severe pain.</p><p>A portable stimulator was used for the NMES intervention (Compex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>DJO company).
During the NMES treatment, the lower extremity was secured with self adhesive straps to a
stable chair to allow approximately 85 degrees of hip flexion and 60 degrees of knee
flexion. Large rectangular electrodes were used to maximize treatment tolerance and
effectiveness. Active electrodes were placed over the vastus medialis muscle. The negative
pole of the channel was placed longitudinally in a position parallel and distal to the
active electrode. Stimuli were given to provide powerful muscle contractions without pain.
The current intensity was adjusted in the range from 28 mA to 90 mA, according to subjects&#x02019;
tolerance. Training duration was 30 minutes and the frequency varied between 30 and 100&#x02005;Hz.
The contraction time, rest time, ramp up time, and ramp down time were respectively 10, 10,
1.5 and 0.75 s. Biphasic, symmetrical synchronized, sequential 400&#x02005;&#x000b5;s pulse-width waves were
used.</p><p>The follow up visits were scheduled for the first month and third month after surgery. Knee
ROMs were measured and TUG, WOMAC and SF-36 forms were completed during the follow up
visits. All of the participants completed the study. Written consent to participation was
obtained from each patient and approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee
of the hospital.</p><p>The WOMAC is a validated health questionnaire which is specific for hip and knee OA, and it
consists of 24 questions scored from zero to four (best to worst respectively). These are
subcategorized into pain (0&#x02013;20), stiffness (0&#x02013;8) and function (0&#x02013;68)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Turkish version has been validated<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SF-36 evaluates general health using a 36-item questionnaire. Component scores are given
for physical and mental health. Both are scored from zero to 100 with a higher score
indicating better health. The reliability and validity of the SF-36 are well
established<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Turkish version was
validated<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TUG was used for the assessment of functionality and mobility. It measures the time (in
seconds) required to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters turn and return and sit on the
chair. The participants wore comfortable shoes during the test. The average of 3 attempts
was calculated<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 11.5 for Windows. Descriptive statistics
were preferred in order to analyze and classify the demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patients. Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to analyze the parametric measurements of the
exercise and NMES groups. Bivariate variance analysis was used for the intragroup analyses
of the data obtained during the preoperative assessment and the follow-up visits at month 1
and month 3. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient was used to analyze non-parametric data. P
values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty (29 female) patients were included in the exercise (control) group and 30 (28

in the NMES group. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in
terms of knee ROMs and TUG times at Month 3 of the follow-up. The results show there were
statistically significant improvements in knee-related pain, stiffness and functions in both
groups at one month after TKA. Quality of life was significantly better in the NMES group,
than in the control group at Month 1. Both the physical and mental subscores of QOL in the
NMES group were found to be significantly better than those of the control group at Month
3.</p><p>In a study the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in total knee arthroplasty,
Avramidis et al. applied electrical stimulation to the vastus medialis during the first 6
weeks after surgery, along with a conventional rehabilitation program, but they did not find
any significant improvements in quality of life at weeks 6 and 12, in comparison to the
preoperative scores<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Quadriceps atrophy of type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers occurs in age-related osteoarthritis
and the atrophy of type 2 muscle fibers is particularly responsible for muscle weakness.
NMES affects type 2 muscle fibers and the addition of NMES to the postoperative treatment of
exercise programs, potentializes muscle strength enhancement. In a study conducted by Lewek
et al., significant improvements in ROMs, muscle strength, and pain resolution were observed
12 sessions of electrical stimulation of the vastus medialis muscle after total knee
arthroplasty<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gotlin et al., used a conventional rehabilitation protocol and CPM for a control group of
subjects and a conventional rehabilitation protocol, CPM and NMES for an experimental groups
of subjects to study the differences between the degrees of active and passive knee
extension before surgery and the degrees of active and passive knee extension at discharge
of 40 patients with TKA. They found the difference between passive and active extension was
significantly lower in experimental group. The mechanism causing limited knee extension is
not clearly understood. However, resection of the anterior cruciate ligaments during the
knee arthroplasty procedure is considered to decrease the number of afferent receptors
eventually resulting in limited knee extension. Furthermore, one suggested that this
mechanism is associated with a reflex inhibitory response, and that earlier functional
improvements might be obtained by NMES through the inhibition of this mechanism<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The degree of flexion at baseline is a
significant predictor of the degree of postoperative knee flexion. Higher degrees of knee
flexion at the baseline were associated with smaller ROM gains, while the ROM gain was
greater in a previously stiff knee<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Knee flexion ranges in the present study increased postoperatively. All patients registered
increases in knee flexion except one patient who had a knee flexion loss. The improvements
in knee flexion and extension ranges were significantly higher in the NMES group than in the
control group at postoperative Month 1.</p><p>Mizner et al. assessed the effects of preoperative quadriceps muscle strength, ROM and pain
on the functional state and quality of life at postoperative year 1 in a study of 40 TKA
patients. At the end of the present study, the most important determinant of the quality of
life and functional state were reported to be the quadriceps muscle strength<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study 276 patients attending a
post-TKA rehabilitation program were evaluated by Jones et al. before the surgery and at
Month 6 postoperatively using WOMAC and SF-36. Significant improvements were observed in the
post-TKA patients&#x02019; WOMAC pain and function scores, and in all the subscale scores of SF-36,
except mental health and general health perception<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. March et al. assessed 52 TKA patients preoperatively and
post-operatively at month 12, using the SF-36 form and found significant improvements,
particularly in the physical functionality, pain, and physical role scores<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Parent et al., on the other hand, reported significant improvements in WOMAC physical
function and SF physical functionality scores at postoperative Month 2, compared to
preoperative scores in a study of 65 TKA patients<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Shields et al. assessed the quality of life preoperatively and postoperative month 3 and
month 6 using the SF-36 form and found that the greatest improvements were in the physical
functionality, pain and vitality subscales. They reported that the scores of these scales
improved in Month 3, that the improvements in limited physical role and emotional role
occured in Month 6 postoperatively, and that these scores approached the scores of the
reference population 3 to 6 months later. They suggested that the greatest improvement
occurred within the first three months since the scores only slightly changed from the third
month to the sixth month<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study statistically significant improvements in knee related pain, stiffness and
functions were found in both groups at Month 1 after TKA. Quality of life was significantly
better in the NMES group, than in the control group at one month post-TKA. In the analyses
of SF-36 summary scores at 3rd month, the physical health, mental health and total scores of
the NMES group were found to be significantly better than those of the control group.</p><p>Two patients in the present study experienced mild skin burns but they continued to
participate in the study after relocation of the electrodes. A full-thickness skin burn
reported as a result of electrical stimulation after unilateral knee arthroplasty in a
previous study<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study had certain strengths and limitations. The first strength of this study was the
prospective randomized design, and the second was the use of the Turkish version of scales
to evaluate the pain, function and quality of life. The third strength was all measurements
were performed by same physician and without a long follow-up period. The limitations of
this study were the relatively small number of the patients and statistical tests
employed.</p><p>In conclusion, supplementation of the exercise program after TKA surgery was found to be
more effective for the rapid improvement in knee functions and quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">American Academy of Orthopaedic
