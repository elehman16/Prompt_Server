Subjects initially received IM oxytocin 10 international units (IU) on day 1, IH placebo on day 2, and IH oxytocin 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g on day 3. Subjects were then randomized 4:1 using validated GSK internal software to IH placebo or ascending doses of IH oxytocin (200, 400, 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g).

Oxytocin acts as a potent endogenous uterotonic (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Arrowsmith and Wray, 2014</xref>), causing an increase in uterine contraction intensity and frequency, which facilitates labor and delivery (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Blanks and Thornton, 2003</xref>). Following delivery, the mother is, however, at risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as blood loss of &#x02265;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;mL within 24&#x000a0;h after birth (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>), most commonly due to uterine atony (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Weeks, 2015</xref>). In the 25&#x000a0;years between 1990 and 2015, an estimated 10.7 million women worldwide died in pregnancy and childbirth (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015a</xref>). Of the estimated 303,000 women who died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2015, 99% were from low-income countries, with approximately two-thirds of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and one-third in Asia (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015a</xref>). PPH is estimated as the single largest contributor to maternal mortality, responsible for 19.7% of maternal deaths worldwide (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Say et al., 2014</xref>). Many of these deaths could be prevented by effective access to treatments to reduce PPH (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>). Active management of the third stage of labor, including prophylactic administration of injectable oxytocin immediately after delivery, has been shown to significantly reduce primary blood loss&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;mL compared with expectant management (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Begley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Intramuscular (IM) oxytocin (10 international units [IU]) was identified as one of 13 life-saving commodities for women and children in a 2012 United Nations (UN) Commission Report (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2012</xref>), and was included in the World Health Organization (WHO) model list of essential medicines (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2015b</xref>). Oxytocin is supplied as an aqueous solution in an ampoule and requires cold-chain storage, sterile needles with sharps disposal, and trained healthcare professionals for administration. This significantly limits access in resource-poor settings, where many women cannot attend medical facilities, their birth attendants are not allowed to administer injections, or the oxytocin cannot be refrigerated, leading to use of material of degraded quality. A review of studies assessing the quality of oxytocin ampoules for injection in low- and middle-income countries found that 58% and 22% of ampoules collected in Africa and Asia, respectively, contained less than the specified content of oxytocin, according to pharmacopoeial limits (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Torloni et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Inhaled (IH) delivery of heat-stable oxytocin could offer a practical means to deliver this medicine without the need for cold-chain storage and provide access in those resource-poor settings of greatest unmet need.

Subjects were randomized 1:4 to receive either IH placebo or ascending doses of IH oxytocin (50, 200, 400, 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g). Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule generated by GSK prior to the start of the study using validated internal software. Dosing with IH placebo and IH oxytocin was single blind (blinded to subjects only) for all subjects throughout the study. The excipients in the placebo formulation had not, to our knowledge, previously been included in an inhaled product in this combination. Although the respiratory risk was deemed to be low, the investigator remained unblinded to allow differentiation of adverse events related to inhaled placebo from inhaled oxytocin in order to monitor the tolerability of the study medication and the safety of the subjects. Blinding for subjects was maintained by the use of a matched inhaler device and capsule presentation for both IH placebo and IH oxytocin. The timings of all procedures after IH placebo and IH oxytocin were identical.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Procedures</title><sec id="s0035"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Interventions</title><p>In dosing session one, all subjects received oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU (17&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) (EVER Neuro Pharma GmbH, Unterach, Austria) by IM injection in the thigh on day 1. The excipients in the dry powder IH formulation capsules have been used previously in other IH products, but not in the combination used in this study. Therefore, the safety and tolerability of the excipients alone (IH placebo) were tested in all subjects on day 2. IH oxytocin was then administered to all subjects at a dose of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g on day 3. All IH treatment capsules were administered by oral inhalation using a Modified Air Inlet ROTAHALER&#x02122; Dry Powder Inhaler. Study investigators were trained to use the inhaler, and trained subjects prior to use. The first dosing session employed a sentinel cohort approach, in which a pilot group of three subjects was evaluated first, before the remaining 12 subjects were dosed in a staggered fashion, with no more than four subjects dosed per day.</p><p>The doses of IH oxytocin selected for investigation were expected to encompass the likely IH therapeutic dose (ie, with a similar systemic exposure to IM oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU). Dose selection considerations encompassed the predicted amount of drug delivered to the lungs (% nominal) for the current dry powder formulation delivered via the ROTAHALER&#x02122; inhaler device, and assumptions around the likely range of relative bioavailability values of IH oxytocin compared with recently reported exposure values following IM administration of oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU to healthy subjects. Lung bioavailability was assumed to be between 10% and 150% of IM availability, with the upper bound of the range reflecting lung bioavailability reported for other low molecular weight proteins, such as leuprolide (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adjei and Garren, 1990</xref>) and insulin (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Patton et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In dosing sessions two, three, and four, subjects randomized to placebo received IH placebo (excipients only), while subjects randomized to IH oxytocin received escalating doses of IH oxytocin: 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (administered as 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g capsules using one ROTAHALER&#x02122; inhaler device per capsule).

Oxytocin is considered the gold standard preventative treatment for PPH, but the requirement for refrigerated storage and needle-based administration for the currently available IM formulations substantially limits its utility in these settings. Other treatments, such as ergometrine or misoprostol, are used but are not considered to be as effective as oxytocin and have contraindications to their use (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>). The WHO states that recommendations concerning alternative uterotonics should not detract from the objective of increasing access to oxytocin (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>) and in response to this, several initiatives have been launched. The Uniject single-use prefilled syringe, which does not require additional sterile equipment, eliminates the need for dosage estimation and can be used by unskilled personnel (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Diop et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Tsu et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Tsu et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Althabe et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Strand et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Stanton et al., 2013</xref>). However, the Uniject devices still require maintenance of cold-chain supply, and a study in rural Ghana highlighted that the single-use prefilled syringe was highly sensitive to small changes in ambient temperature and could expire in as few as 6&#x000a0;days (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Mullany et al., 2014</xref>). The preferred approach would be the development of a heat-stable, non-parenteral oxytocin formulation as identified by the UN Commission on Life-saving Commodities for Women and Children (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2012</xref>). A heat-stable oxytocin analog, carbetocin is in development, but it will still require parenteral administration (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Boucher et al., 2004</xref>). Non-parenteral routes of administration include sublingual, IH, and intranasal administration. A PK study carried out in male volunteers showed that sublingual oxytocin had poor bioavailability, a long lag time and long absorption half-life and was therefore not a reliable formulation for accurate dosing for immediate prevention of PPH (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">De Groot et al., 1995</xref>). We selected the IH route, as this has proven a reliable route for other potent drugs and offers the potential for rapid absorption (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Cazzola et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the formulation of peptides and proteins in a spray-dried matrix for IH delivery is known to confer enhanced thermostability compared with aqueous solutions (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Vehring, 2008</xref>). This approach has been applied to the formulations used in this study: robust heat stability was demonstrated at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C during product development (Supplementary Fig. 1) and recent data support a minimum 30&#x000a0;month shelf-life at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (approved by the UK Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for clinical supply). An in vitro preclinical study further demonstrated that dry powder formulations of oxytocin suitable for oral inhalation can be prepared and are stable after extended storage under tropical and subtropical conditions (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fabio et al., 2015</xref>). The potential for an IH powder form of oxytocin was also demonstrated in an in vivo preclinical study, which showed that administration of an ultra-fine oxytocin powder to the airways of postpartum sheep led to rapid absorption and comparable uterine electromyographic activity to that observed with IM administration (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Prankerd et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This study reports successful administration of oxytocin by the IH route in humans. The five non-pharmacologically active components contained in the IH oxytocin formulation are approved individually for use in other IH products. However, they had never been used previously in this particular combination. Administration of the excipients alone was not associated with features of irritancy (eg, coughing and bronchospasm) in this study. Indeed, the IH route of delivery was well tolerated in this small-scale study.</p><p>Since IM oxytocin reaches its site of action, the uterus, via the plasma it is proposed that demonstrating a comparable plasma drug profile following IH and IM routes of administration allows for extrapolation from the extensive clinical safety and efficacy data for the approved IM oxytocin product for the prevention of PPH to the IH product. Overall, the shape of the plasma PK profile following IH administration was similar to that following IM administration. Both administration routes demonstrated rapid absorption of oxytocin into plasma (median t<sub>max</sub> 8&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min), followed by rapid elimination, with an apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> consistent across administration routes. Oxytocin exposure with IH oxytocin was approximately linear over the 200&#x02013;600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose range, while dose normalized exposure at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was lower. Lower exposure (AUC) following 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g may in part reflect censoring of the PK profile; since concentrations of oxytocin fell below the lower limit of quantification in at least half the subjects by 1&#x000a0;h post-dose. The dose range of IH oxytocin assessed in this study was predicted to cover the therapeutic range and the 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g dose of IH oxytocin was found to result in systemic exposure most similar to that of IM oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU; with the rate and extent of absorption of oxytocin into plasma most consistent with that observed following IM oxytocin 10&#x000a0;IU (as reflected by the geometric mean ratio for IH versus IM for the PK parameters Cp10, Cp30, and AUC<sub>[0&#x02013;3h]</sub>). However, between subject variability tended to be higher following IH compared with IM dosing.</p><p>This study provides important preliminary evidence in humans that a heat-stable, dry powder IH formulation has the potential to deliver a systemic profile of oxytocin comparable with parenteral (IM) administration, although important questions remain. This study was conducted in healthy non-pregnant women. The physiological changes associated with pregnancy, including higher levels of circulating oxytocin, increased renal/hepatic blood flow, increased blood/plasma volume and cardiac output, increased total body water, and decreased plasma proteins have the potential to alter the PK of oxytocin (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Sheffield et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Prevost et al., 2014</xref>). However, unless affecting lung absorption, these factors would be expected to affect IH and IM administration equally. To determine whether there are differences in PK between pregnant and non-pregnant women, investigations are ongoing to study women in third stage of labor. We conducted an enabling study in women in the third stage of labor and observed that their inspiratory profile using the ROTAHALER&#x02122; inhaler device was not materially different from non-pregnant volunteers (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). However, any effect of altered inspiratory profile during labor on the PK of IH oxytocin will need to be determined in future investigations in women in the third stage of labor. In this study IH oxytocin was not associated with evidence of respiratory tract irritancy, but the information is preliminary; an evaluation of tolerability in smokers and people with asthma would form part of future investigations.</p><p>The device for delivery was selected on the basis of its simplicity. The capsule is pushed into the device, the device twisted once to break open the capsule and the powder IH. There has been over 20&#x000a0;years of experience with this type of device, which has optimized and simplified the design to support practical use. Effective delivery in the field will depend on appropriate educational materials and training; in use studies are planned as part of the development program.</p><p>This study provides proof-of-concept that an IH oxytocin formulation resistant to thermo-degradation can achieve systemic exposure comparable with IM delivery. If confirmed in women in the third stage of labor with an optimized formulation and delivery device, this approach has the potential to address one of the most important unmet health needs in developing countries.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Role of the Funding Source</title><p>GSK, the funder of this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02542813" id="ir0025">NCT02542813</ext-link>), was involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the study report.
