Patients with ulcerative colitis in remission (a bloody stool score of 0, and an ulcerative colitis disease activity index of &#x02264;2), received the study drug (Asacol 2.4 g/d) for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the nonrecurrence rate was assessed on the full analysis set.

The full analysis set comprised 602 subjects (QD: 301, TID: 301). Nonrecurrence rates were 88.4% in the QD and 89.6% in the TID. The difference between nonrecurrence rates was &#x02212;1.3% (95% confidence interval: &#x02212;6.2, 3.7), confirming noninferiority. No differences in the safety profile were observed between the two treatment groups. On post hoc analysis by integrating the QD and the TID, nonrecurrence rate with a mucosal appearance score of 0 at determination of eligibility was significantly higher than the score of 1.

Oral mesalamine is recommended as basic treatment of UC in the remission phase.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In most cases, long-term administration is needed to maintain remission. Medication adherence for a long period is known to be a key issue in this patient population.</p><p>A previous cohort study indicates that nonadherence is a risk factor for relapse of UC.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been reported that administration of multiple daily doses is a factor that influences nonadherence.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Thus, once daily (QD) administration is a therapeutic option that encourages compliance. In other reports no differences in efficacy and safety between QD and twice or 3 times daily administration in patients with UC in the remission phase have been reported,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and QD dosing is approved in several countries.</p><p>In Japan, the noninferiority of QD dosing administration was reported when compared with 3 times daily (TID) dosing administration of a time-dependent release mesalamine formulation,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and QD dosing is approved. There has, however, not been a report that compares noninferiority of QD with TID use of a pH-dependent release mesalamine formulation. We conducted the current trial to verify that QD administration of a pH-dependent release mesalamine formulation (Asacol) is not inferior to TID administration.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Informed Consent</title><p>Before conducting this clinical study, the investigator's brochure, clinical study protocol, patient information and consent form, other necessary documents, and the conduct of this study were reviewed and approved from ethical and scientific standpoints by the Institutional Review Board.</p><p>After thoroughly explaining the study to prospective subjects using the informed consent form, the investigator or subinvestigator obtained their voluntary written consent to participate in the study in person.</p><p>The trial was registered in the JapicCTI registry under registration No. JapicCTI-132135.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Study Drugs</title><p>A pH-dependent-release mesalamine is coated with Eudragit-S, and contains 400 mg of mesalamine per tablet. Eudragit-S dissolves at a pH &#x02265;7, and the pH-dependent-release mesalamine tablet is designed to release mesalamine in the terminal ileum, where the intraluminal pH exceeds 7. This pH-dependent&#x02013;release mesalamine tablet is Asacol whose package was changed for use in this study. The placebo did not include mesalamine, and was indistinguishable from the Asacol tablets. The Asacol and placebo tablets used in this study were supplied by Zeria Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Subjects were required to meet all the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients with a bloody stool score of 0, and an UCDAI of &#x02264;2; (2) outpatients aged &#x02265;16&#x02013;&#x0003c;65 years at the time of informed consent; both males and females were included; (3) individuals who fully understood what was involved in this study and could give documented consent to participate in the study. For patients under the age of 20 at the time of informed consent, the consent of their legal guardian had to be obtained and also that of the patient him/herself.</p><p>Patients who met at least one of the following criteria were excluded: (1) the presence of active UC within 83 days before eligibility determination; (2) intestinal stenosis; (3) infectious enteritis or any suspicion of the presence of infectious enteritis; (4) treatment with antidiarrheal drugs or drugs for the treatment of diarrhea within 3 days before eligibility determination; (5) treatment with rectal mesalamine (enema or suppository) within 27 days before eligibility determination; (6) daily dose of oral mesalamine over 2.4 g (if a subject was receiving salazosulfapyridine, the amount equivalent to mesalamine was calculated by multiplying the dose by 0.5), corticosteroids (administration orally, by enema, suppository, or injection), azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (oral), cyclosporine or tacrolimus (oral or injection), infliximab or adalimumab (injection), cytapheresis or other study drugs within 83 days before eligibility determination; (7) laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery, surgery for hemorrhoids or perianal abscess, endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic intestinal dilatation or endoscopic intestinal dilatation of the colon within 55 days before eligibility determination; (8) patients with a history of resection of the small intestine, cecum, colon, or rectum; (9) patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal disease; (10) patients with any serious comorbid disease, such as hematological, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neuropsychiatric disease, or metabolic/electrolyte abnormality; (11) patients undergoing treatment for a malignant tumor or patients who had been followed up for under 5 years; (12) patients with hypersensitivity to mesalamine or salicylate drugs; (13) pregnant and nursing women and women suspected of being pregnant; (14) others whom the investigator or subinvestigator considered to be inappropriate for enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group noninferiority trial was conducted at 56 centers in Japan.</p><p>The screening period occurred 3 to 14 days after informed consent was obtained. After the screening period, eligibility determination was conducted according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects were allocated into the QD or TID group, and were instructed to take the study drug (double-dummy) orally after each meal (QD group: 6 pH-dependent-release mesalamine tablets in the morning, 2 placebo tablets at noon, and 2 placebo tablets in the evening; TID group: 2 pH-dependent-release mesalamine tablets and 4 placebo tablets in the morning, 2 pH-dependent-release mesalamine tablets at noon, and 2 pH-dependent-release mesalamine tablets in the evening) for 48 weeks.</p><p>At weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48, subjects visited the study site and received relevant tests and examinations of efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Randomization</title><p>The allocation manager, who was independent of this study, prepared a study drug allocation table and randomized study drugs (QD group:TID group = 1:1). After completing the allocation, the allocation manager sealed the study drug allocation table and stored it under strict control until the end of the trial.</p><p>The investigator or subinvestigator confirmed whether subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and determined their eligibility. The patient registration center allocated the study drugs randomly to the eligible subjects.</p><p>The patients were assigned dynamically and stochastically using central registration. The allocation factors were duration of remission (&#x0003c;2 years and &#x02265;2 years) and the state of the intestinal mucosa (mucosal appearance score [subscore of UCDAI]: 0, 1, and 2). The balance within the study site was also considered.</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Blinding</title><p>This was a double-blind trial.

Recurrence was defined as a bloody stool score &#x02265;1 and UCDAI &#x02265;3. Four items (stool frequency, bloody stool, mucosal appearance, physician's global assessment) were scored and the sum of all scores was the UCDAI.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Regardless of an incomplete UCDAI, subjects with a bloody stool score &#x02265;1 and UCDAI &#x02265;3 were handled as recurrence.</p><p>The subjects entered into their diary stool frequency, the state of their stool (the extent of bloody stools, if present), and compliance/noncompliance with treatment during the study period, and visited the study site every 4 weeks. The investigator or subinvestigator scored stool frequency score, bloody stool score, and physician's global assessment score based on the diary and the interview with the subject. At the time of screening and final observation (either week 48 visit or visit for discontinuation), the investigator or subinvestigator conducted the colonoscopy and determined the mucosal appearance score by reference to atlases of mucosal appearances based on Mayo endoscopic subscore.</p></sec><sec id="s1-9"><title>Safety Variables</title><p>Safety variables were the incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions. Adverse events considered to be related to the study drug were handled as adverse drug reactions.</p><p>The investigator or subinvestigator collected information about adverse events by interview with the subjects at each visit. Moreover, to determine the presence or absence of adverse events, laboratory tests (hematological test, biochemical test, urinalysis, and urinary enzyme test) were conducted at the time of screening, at the visits during weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 (or at discontinuation), and the recording of vital signs were conducted at eligibility determination, at the visits during weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 (or at discontinuation).</p><p>The adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA/J (Ver. 18.1) terms for tabulation and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s1-10"><title>Statistical Methods</title><sec id="s1-10-1"><title>Noninferiority Margin</title><p>In past clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the efficacy of Asacol was 20% to 26% higher than that of placebo in patients with UC in the remission phase. Thus, we estimated that the minimum difference between the efficacy of the positive control drug and that of the placebo can be expected to be about 20%; hence the noninferiority margin was set at 10%, which is 1/2 of the minimum value. Moreover, the noninferiority margin was set to &#x02212;10% in other clinical trials of Asacol in the past.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s1-10-2"><title>Sample Size</title><p>In the past clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> the efficacy rate of Asacol at final assessment, with efficacy defined as maintenance of remission after 12 months administration, was 65.9% to 85.4%. Thus, we estimated that the nonrecurrence rate in the QD group and TID group would be 75%. The number of cases required for verification of noninferiority is 295 under the following conditions: Significance level = 0.05 (2-tailed), detection power = 80%, and noninferiority margin = 10%.

In tests for uniformity, a significance level of 0.15 (2-tailed) was used, and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.15 was considered unbalanced. The confidence level of 95% (2-tailed) was used for calculating confidence intervals (CIs) unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The primary analysis set was FAS, and the primary efficacy endpoint was the nonrecurrence rate. The lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in nonrecurrence rate (the nonrecurrence rate in the QD group &#x02212; the nonrecurrence rate in the TID group) was calculated; based on this calculation, the lower limit of the CI greater than the noninferiority limit value of &#x02212;10%, we concluded that noninferiority was verified. In addition, we conducted a subgroup analysis (nonrecurrence rate in PPS, nonrecurrence rate by allocation factors), sensitivity analysis, and post hoc analysis after key break. In the sensitivity analysis, we treated as &#x0201c;missing data&#x0201d; a portion of those cases with recurrence, such that determination of recurrence/nonrecurrence depended on the mucosal appearance score. In post hoc analysis after key break, integrating the QD group and TID group, the nonrecurrence rate by each mucosal appearance score at eligibility determination was calculated.</p><p>Safety variables were the incidence of adverse events and the incidence of adverse drug reactions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines and local ethical and legal regulations, in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the &#x0201c;Standards for the Implementation of Clinical Trials on Pharmaceutical Products&#x0201d; (Ordinance).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects entered this trial from June 2013 to January 2015.

Findings in the PPS analysis were equivalent to those of the primary analysis, demonstrating robustness of the result of the primary analysis.</p><p>The nonrecurrence rate in this trial was approximately 90% in both groups, and was higher than we expected (75%) based on the result of the past study,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> before the start of this trial. We consider that this finding was a consequence of the greater number of stable patients (e.g., those with a mucosal appearance score of 0 or remission-maintenance period of &#x02265;2 years) led by an increase in the number of therapeutic options and a prevailing emphasis on the importance of mucosal healing, subsequent to the time when the past trials<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> were conducted&#x02014;trials on which the expected recurrence rate was based.</p><p>Besides, the subgroup analyses of the nonrecurrence rate by prior use of mesalamine or corticosteroid were conducted in this trial (these data were not shown). In almost all of these subgroups, significant difference between QD group and TID group was not observed. Only in a subgroup with the patients who used suppository of corticosteroid in the most recent active phase of UC, the significant difference was observed but we thought that there was a large impact of dispersion caused by small number of subjects.</p><p>In this trial, central reading of mucosal appearance scores was not used. To investigate the effect of not using central reading, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. There were just 7 cases in which determination of recurrence/nonrecurrence depended on the mucosal appearance score. If these subjects were handled as &#x0201c;data missing,&#x0201d; the results of analysis are equivalent to those of the primary analysis. In this trial, we thus consider the effect of not using central reading to be limited. Besides, we did not conduct a sensitivity analysis in cases with nonrecurrence. This was because, in all cases with nonrecurrence, blood was not apparent in the stool at final assessment; thus, the determination of recurrence/nonrecurrence did not depend on mucosal findings.</p><p>Although differences were reported based on the genetic background of Asians (including Japanese) and Caucasians,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> the results of this trial, in which the enrolled subjects were solely Japanese, matched the results of a meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>&#x02014;there is no significant statistically difference in efficacy between QD and conventional dosing.</p><p>As the double-dummy method was used in this trial, high compliance rate was observed in the QD group and the TID group. There was no difference in treatment compliance and the safety profile between 2 groups. In comparison to the known safety profile, there was no incidence of events that needed special consideration in this trial.</p><p>The various risk factors for recurrence are known, and the influence of mucosal state on maintenance-remission has been reported.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> On post hoc analysis of trial data, nonrecurrence rate with a mucosal appearance score of 0 at determination of eligibility was significantly higher than the score of 1. Although this analysis is ad hoc, we consider the result of this analysis to be very important because it was prospective and showed the importance of maintaining a good mucosal state in the maintenance&#x02013;remission period.</p><p>In conclusion, we consider QD dosing maintenance&#x02013;remission therapy to be as effective and safe as TID dosing, and that it can contribute to better adherence by adding a therapeutic option in keeping with the subject's lifestyle. In addition, to prolong remission, it is important to maintain a good mucosal state.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank all of the study participants, doctors, and staff who supported this study.
