Medical educators strive to teach effectively, but unmotivated trainees may not acquire knowledge as well as trainees with higher drives to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since motivation is a learner characteristic, teachers often question what they can do to improve motivation from an instructional standpoint. Previous studies on motivation have targeted learner groups with limited relevance to medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Incorporation of or access to online platforms has improved motivation in college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In one study of a computer-aided learning environment, video-based instruction had a more motivating effect than text-based instruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Granting a learner&#x02019;s choice in training can improve motivation in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and in children, putting problems into fantasy contexts can improve motivation and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Suggestions to enhance motivation among health professions trainees have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but the most effective mechanisms to increase motivation to learn in this population are unknown.</p><p>Many models of motivation for learning incorporate some variation of two core concepts, namely expectancy (the extent to which the learner expects to succeed) and value (the importance of learning to that learner). The expectancy-value theory of motivation suggests that the expectation of success positively influences the learner&#x02019;s perception of learning importance. Expectancy is influenced by a learner&#x02019;s perceptions of his or her own competence, goals, and the expected difficulty of the task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Task value encompasses learners&#x02019; perception of task importance, interest in the task, and their perception of the task&#x02019;s relevance to their future goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In non-medical education research, task value perceptions predicted college students&#x02019; midterm scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and high school students were more likely to learn mathematics and less likely to avoid mathematics when they perceived mathematics as offering high task value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among medical students, low-performing students have reported lower task value beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and task value beliefs have shown positive associations with academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There has been a call for increasing research on motivation in medical education, but as Kusurkar described in 2012, medical education literature lacks publications that link curriculum development to stimulation of learner motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of a motivationally-enhanced instructional design on motivation to learn and knowledge scores, hypothesizing that outcomes would be higher for the enhanced format.</p><p>Empiric evidence does little to inform efforts to directly enhance motivation to learn. However, it is commonly accepted that being required to teach a topic enhances both motivation and learning, and some theories of instruction bear this out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Limited research corroborates the idea that putting learners into a teaching or supervisory role will enhance motivation and/or learning. For example, one study found that peer tutoring activity correlated with higher motivation among medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Other studies have found that residents given formal teaching responsibilities showed improved learning of a given topic compared to lectures or self-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and that residents perceive that teaching medical students improves their own learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesized that placing residents in a &#x0201c;virtual&#x0201d; teaching role - that is, in the context of supervising a medical student - would enhance motivation and learning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To evaluate this hypothesis we conducted a randomized crossover trial comparing standard and motivationally-enhanced online learning modules in a course for medicine residents.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting and sample</title><p>This study was undertaken at an academic medical center between November 2010 and June 2011. There were 168 residents (144 internal medicine, 24 family medicine) in the Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education in Rochester, Minnesota eligible to participate in the study. The study was deemed minimal risk and exempt after Mayo Clinic IRB review. Prior to study initiation, informed consent was obtained. As part of the consent process, participants were informed that the study would &#x0201c;compare two module formats to see if one format promotes more effective learning than the other&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Interventions</title><p>The Internal Medicine Ambulatory Care curriculum included four online learning modules that covered primary care topics: hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These modules were updated to include current guidelines and evidence for each condition. Modules were released at approximately two-week intervals, and residents could finish available modules in any order. Each module contained text, images, hyperlinked resources, and case-based self-assessment questions. The learning modules were created using Articulate Presenter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.articulate.com">www.articulate.com</ext-link>), a program that creates Flash presentations from PowerPoint slides. Both module formats consisted of didactic information with a total of 10 to 12 self-assessment questions interspersed throughout the module. The standard format self-assessment questions were typical case-based knowledge questions. The motivationally-enhanced format included the same question content, but the clinical cases were framed to have residents imagine themselves supervising a medical student in clinic. Response options were changed from a list of management approaches (standard format) to a list of responses and rationale one might use in a teaching role (enhanced format). Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides an example of each question format. Both formats provided the answer and explanation to the question immediately after the resident provided a response.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

Secondary outcome measures included time, mental effort, and perceptions of which format was more efficient, more effective for learning, more motivating and overall preferred.</p><p>To measure baseline motivation, all residents completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) prior to beginning their first learning module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This 31-question instrument uses a 7-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;not true of me, 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;very true of me) and has validity evidence for use in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Since motivation may vary by topic, residents also completed a short 13-question motivation inventory immediately before each learning module. The pre-module short motivation inventory was adapted from the MSLQ by selecting task value and self-efficacy questions that had high factor loadings from a previous factor analysis study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The post-module short motivation inventory included task value questions (the same task value questions as in the pre-module motivation inventory), and single questions about time to complete each module, mental effort, and time elapsed between completing the module and starting the posttest. We collected information on gender, training program, and post-graduate year.</p><p>After completing each module, residents took a knowledge posttest. The test consisted of 14 to 18 (depending on the module) multiple choice questions adapted based on formal item analysis from questions used in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>After finishing all four modules and posttests, residents completed a course evaluation survey containing questions about module format preference, efficiency, effectiveness, and which was more motivating (&#x0201c;which format did you prefer/find more efficient/find more effective/which format best motivated you to learn?&#x0201d;). These items used a 7-point scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly prefer standard format, 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly prefer enhanced format).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Posttest knowledge scores, motivation scores, time spent, and mental effort were compared between formats using mixed linear models that accounted for repeated measures and for differences between modules. Additional adjustments included residency program, post-graduate year, and gender. We analyzed format preferences using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (testing whether results differed from the scale median). Of 168 residents eligible to participate, we estimated 75% participation and 20% drop-out leaving an anticipated 100 residents to complete the study. Using an expected standard deviation of 10 percentage points, 100 subjects would provide 85% power to detect a difference of 3 points (effect size 0.3) on knowledge tests, which we felt to be a minimum meaningful difference. All individuals were analyzed in the groups to which they were randomly assigned. All analyses used two-sided alpha error of 0.05. All analyses were done using de-identified data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred twenty seven residents gave consent to participate and were randomized.

In this randomized trial we confirmed a statistically significant improvement in task value motivation scores for the enhanced modules, but the impact on knowledge scores was small and not statistically significant. We also found an association between module-specific motivation and post-module knowledge test scores. Post-course evaluation results are limited by low response rates (which could bias results), but suggest the two modules were similar with respect to perceived effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>The learners with higher motivation in this study had better test scores, which is consistent with previous research demonstrating associations between task value, course enjoyment, and exam results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One could argue that resident trainees, by nature of their chosen career path, have a strong motivation to learn at baseline. However, it has been suggested that negative achievement emotions can still impact performance in this type of learner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As such, baseline motivation may be a target to improve learning. It is possible that if a motivational module to enhance expectancy and task value preceded a learning module, the learner could engage in positive motivational emotions before a learning activity or knowledge test. Certain motivational teaching behaviors may enhance motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but a formal motivation curriculum and its effect on learning has not been explored. An intervention to increase baseline motivation could ultimately be effective for knowledge acquisition.</p><p>It is notable that topic-specific motivation (measured by the pre-module motivation inventory) was associated with improved knowledge posttest scores. By contrast, and contrary to our earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], overall motivation measured by the MSLQ was not associated with knowledge scores. This suggests that motivation to learn may be topic-specific; for example, a learner might be more motivated to learn about hypertension than COPD. Future efforts to adapt instructional design may choose to target topic-specific motivation rather than general motivation; for example, having a learner commit to individual learning goals before a module may enhance self-efficacy and improve motivation to learn a specific topic.</p><p>Motivation was enhanced in this study by having learners imagine themselves in a supervisory role. This finding supports the idea that supervisory or teaching activities can stimulate motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since lower performing students have lower task value and self-efficacy beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], supervisory or teaching activities may be particularly important when trying to boost motivation in struggling students.</p><p>Although theories of learning and limited evidence suggest that teaching and supervisory roles should enhance learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we failed to find evidence to support that hypothesis. Most likely, asking residents to imagine themselves in a supervisory role lacked the authenticity and urgency required to stimulate learning. Future studies could potentially enhance task value by having the virtual supervisor explain to the medical student why learning a specific module topic might be important during residency training; this could be done within a learning module or within self-assessment questions. Alternatively, a higher stakes virtual teaching role with higher acuity patients (e.g. a senior resident supervising inpatient rounds) may improve the task value of the intervention. It is also possible that learning in this study was enhanced but that the timing or measurement of this outcome was inadequate to detect the difference.</p><p>Task value motivation was the measure for this study, however, changes in other factors (e.g. feelings of well-being, fatigue, symptoms of burn-out) were not measured. There is some conflicting evidence on whether measures of well-being are associated with medical knowledge and motivation to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A future study could integrate measures of well-being into its motivational assessments.</p><p>The present findings indicate that an instructional variation can influence motivation and that motivation is associated with performance. While certainly not definite, these findings show some promise and suggest the need for further research in the area of motivationally-directed instructional design.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although there was a significant improvement in motivation, posttest knowledge scores were similar between module formats. We note that well-done negative studies contribute to the field by demonstrating what does not work in a particular situation. It is unlikely that we missed an important effect due to inadequate power, since we achieved our target sample size, and since the confidence intervals surrounding the observed difference exclude our a priori meaningful difference. This study was conducted in a single academic institution, and the baseline motivational characteristics of these participants may not reflect those of internal medicine and family medicine residents nationwide. If the residents in our sample had higher baseline motivation, it could lead to a ceiling effect (i.e., smaller potential difference between residents). As noted above, the virtual nature of the supervisory role lacked the authenticity and urgency of a real-life supervisory experience.</p><p>Additional strengths of this study included minimizing allocation bias by randomization and using motivation and knowledge assessment instruments whose scores had been validated for use in this learner population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings that putting residents into a supervisory role may increase motivation, and that higher levels of motivation are associated with better test scores suggests that motivation may prove a viable target for future efforts to improve learning. Topic-specific motivation may be more amenable to enhancement than overall motivation. Further investigation into the relationship between motivational enhancements and knowledge outcomes is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MTW developed modules, consented participants, collected data, and wrote/edited the manuscript.
