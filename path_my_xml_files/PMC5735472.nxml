A total of sixty patients of either sex in the age group of 30&#x02013;60, in good physical status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] Class I or II) scheduled for abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia (GA) were selected for the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups, Group A and Group B of thirty patients each. Patients with neurological deficits, neuromuscular disorders, bleeding disorders, and those with obvious spinal deformity were excluded from the study. At preoperative visit, the patients were familiarized with the visual analog scale (VAS) and explained the pain assessment procedure. All patients were given tablet diazepam (5 mg) at night before the day of surgery and 2 h before surgery. In the operating room, baseline parameters were recorded, intravenous line was secured. Injection fentanyl (&#x003bc;g/kg) was given intravenously as a premedication before induction of anesthesia. Standard anesthesia technique was followed. Patients were induced with injection propofol 1% (2 mg/kg). Intubation was carried out by endotracheal tube of appropriate size after relaxation with injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Maintenance of anesthesia was carried out by oxygen, nitrous oxide (33.3% and 66.7%, respectively) and halothane (0.4%&#x02013;0.6%) on controlled ventilation using a closed circuit with circle absorber. Muscle relaxation was maintained by injection vecuronium in incremental doses intraoperatively.</p><p>Once under GA, the patients were positioned in left lateral position with the spine flexed. Under strict asepsis, the intervertebral spaces between L2-3 and L3-4 were identified. A 18 gauge Tuhoy needle was introduced in the epidural space through the midline of interspaces. In Group A patients, preemptive analgesia is given by a bolus dose of injection neostigmine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) + injection buprenorphine (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and in Group B patients, injection ketamine (1 mg/kg) + injection buprenorphine (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) diluted in normal saline up to 10 ml were injected into the epidural space through the Tuhoy's needle. A graduated catheter size 20 gauge was passed in the epidural space through the needle and secured to the back after taking out the Tuohy needle. Patients were placed back in supine position and surgery allowed to proceed. Toward the end of surgery, effect of relaxant was reversed with injection neostigmine and injection glycopyrrolate in standard doses.</p><p>The following parameters were monitored in the postoperative period: heart rate (bpm), blood pressure (BP) (mmHg), respiration (/min), drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, respiratory depression, pain score, and top up dose. The above parameters were assessed postoperatively, two hourly for first 6 h and then four hourly in a 24 h assessment period.</p><p>The severity of pain was assessed using a VAS in the postoperative period. The scale had markings from 0 to 100 with 0 depicting no pain and 100 the worst imaginable pain. Epidural top up was given when the level of pain score rose above 40. The epidural top up was carried out with injection buprenorphine (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and the study was terminated in those patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Sixty patients in good physical status (ASA Class I or II) undergoing lower abdominal surgery were selected for the study.

They were comparable in age, weight, and physical status. The standard protocol of anesthesia was followed in both the groups. Group A comprising thirty patients received preemptive analgesia with epidural buprenorphine (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and neostigmine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), whereas Group B comprising thirty patients received preemptive analgesia with buprenorphine (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and ketamine (1 mg/kg).</p><p>Two patients from Group A had to be withdrawn from the study after 4 h and 18 h, respectively after surgery because of severe pain while one patient was withdrawn from Group B after 4 h postoperatively because she developed hallucination.</p><p>Demographic and operative data of the two groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data and operative data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-821-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Patient demographic data and anesthesia time were not statistically different between the Groups A and B (age 46.1 &#x000b1; 9.2 and 48.2 &#x000b1; 6.1 years, weight 59.7 &#x000b1; 7.3 kg and 58.8 &#x000b1; 6.9 kg, height 151.2 &#x000b1; 4.7 and 150.6 &#x000b1; 5.0 cm, anesthesia time 109.8 &#x000b1; 9.3 and 109.4 &#x000b1; 8.8 min, surgical duration 90.7 &#x000b1; 10.5 and 89.4 &#x000b1; 8.3, respectively).</p><p>Preemptive analgesia was given to each patient after induction of general anesthesia but before surgical incision.

Their vital parameters, pain scores, requirement of top up analgesia doses and side effects were observed over a period of 24 h after surgery and then compared to find out the more effective and safer combination.</p><p>Each of the drugs, buprenorphine, ketamine, and neostigmine are known to affect the cardio-respiratory system individually. In the present study, the combination of buprenorphine and neostigmine had no significant effect on the postoperative heart rates, respiratory rates, and BP which remained within normal limits. Chung <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the combination of intrathecal morphine and intrathecal neostigmine for postoperative analgesia and found that it did not produce significant difference with regard to BP and heart rate,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Nelson <italic>et al</italic>. studied a similar combination of intrathecal sufentanil and intrathecal neostigmine and reported that the patient hemodynamic variables were unaffected.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, the present study showed no significant effect on postoperative heart rates, respiratory rates and BPs when the combination of buprenorphine and ketamine was used. This was substantiated by the study of Edwards <italic>et al</italic>. who used combination of intravenous morphine and ketamine for postoperative analgesia and reported no significant effect on postoperative heart rates, respiratory rates, and mean arterial pressure.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In the present study when the two combinations were compared for their effect on postoperative vital parameters, no significant difference was found as can be expected from the results of the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Neostigmine and ketamine produce analgesia by different mechanisms. The present study revealed that the combination of buprenorphine and neostigmine produced significant analgesia over the period of observation since the VAS pain scores reduced significantly from 54.6 &#x000b1; 6.3 at 2 h to 8.1 &#x000b1; 8.9 at 22 h postoperatively. Likewise, Dirksen and Nijhuis also showed that intrathecal morphine and neostigmine provided intense analgesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Chung <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that the combination of intrathecal morphine and intrathecal neostigmine resulted in significantly lower VAS pain scores.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that the combination of intrathecal morphine and intrathecal neostigmine resulted in better analgesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, Naguib and Yaksh reported no synergy between intrathecal morphine and neostigmine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Preoperative epidural coadministration of a low dose of ketamine with midazolam is more effective in relieving postoperative pain than using ketamine alone.

However, analgesic effects were less pronounced than for epidurally administered morphine or morphine-neostigmine. Adding neostigmine to epidurally administered morphine did not potentiate opioid-induced analgesia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>However, when the VAS pain scores of the two groups were compared, no significant difference was found in the present study suggesting that both the combinations produced a similar degree of postoperative analgesia.</p><p>In this study, only 2 out of 30 patients (6.7%) of Group A required top up doses at 4 h and 18 h respectively.

Chung <italic>et al</italic>. have also reported that patients receiving intrathecal morphine and intrathecal neostigmine experienced less severe nausea, vomiting and had significantly lower incidence of pruritus and none of them developed respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. also reported fewer side effects with the above combination.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In the case of the group receiving the buprenorphine and ketamine combination, the most common side effect was again drowsiness (cumulative incidence 28.3% with maximum incidence at 2 h) followed by nausea and vomiting (cumulative incidence 15.6% and 7.8%, respectively). In this group too, none of the patients developed pruritus, respiratory depression, or urinary retention. However, one case had hallucinations Choe <italic>et al</italic>. in a similar study reported the incidence of complications such as nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, somnolence, respiratory depression, and hallucination as 1, 5, 2, 4, 0, and 0, respectively.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Wong <italic>et al</italic>. also reported reduced incidence of side effects when combination of morphine and ketamine was used.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Javery <italic>et al</italic>. in their study reported fewer side effects when the combination of morphine and ketamine was used for intravenous PCA.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, drowsiness was the most common side effect in both the groups followed by nausea and vomiting. There were no cases of pruritus, respiratory depression or urinary retention. However, the present study did not reveal any significant difference between the two combinations with respect to the incidence of the side effects.</p><p>The present study revealed that both combinations (buprenorphine + neostigmine and buprenorphine + ketamine) when given epidurally as preemptive analgesia produced significant postoperative pain relief. There was no significant difference between the combinations with respect to their effect on cardiorespiratory system, postoperative analgesia or incidence of side effects. The requirement of top-up doses in both the groups could not be analyzed statistically because of the small number of cases requiring it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that addition of neostigmine or ketamine to buprenorphine in preemptive epidural analgesia can significantly enhance the postoperative analgesia qualitatively with reasonable safety and economy. In addition, lack of clinically and statistically significant side effects makes the above two combination of drugs an important tool in the armamentarium of anesthesiologist in the field of postoperative analgesia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are
