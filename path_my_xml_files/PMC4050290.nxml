Between April 2004 and October 2012, 125 cases of TEVAR were performed. The analysis focused on patients who required coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA). We analysed mortality and morbidity with special attention to the rates of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and spinal cord ischaemia (SCI) in the early and midterm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 125 patients, 53 (42&#x000a0;%, group A) required an intentional coverage of the LSA to obtain an adequate proximal seal for the endograft; the remaining patients constituted group B. None of the patients in group A had protective LSA revascularisation prior to TEVAR. The primary technical success rate was 79.2 vs. 90.3&#x000a0;% (group A vs. group B, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.08), and the primary clinical success rate was 77.4 vs. 82&#x000a0;% (group A vs. group B, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53). The 30-day mortality rate was 11.3 vs. 11.1&#x000a0;% (group A vs. group B, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97). The 30-day morbidity was 7.5 vs. 13.9&#x000a0;% (group A vs. group B, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4). CVA occurred in 1.9&#x000a0;% of group A patients, compared to 1.4&#x000a0;% of patients from group B (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82). The SCI incidence rate was 0 vs. 1.4&#x000a0;% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.39). The mean follow-up of group A was 24.1&#x000a0;months (range 2&#x02013;64.6&#x000a0;months, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;19). Additionally, the 1-year estimated survival was 85.5&#x000a0;%, and the 3-year estimated survival was 78&#x000a0;%. There were no midterm CVAs; one event of SCI occurred in the seventh post-operative month in group A.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our analysis, although retrospective and based on one institution experience, shows a realistic population of TEVAR patients. We prove that TEVAR with coverage of LSA origin can be accomplished with minimal neurological morbidity in this patient population. The study shows that LSA revascularisation is not mandatory before endograft deployment, especially in emergency settings. We also prove that although zone 2 TEVAR extends the proximal landing zone, it does not prevent type IA endoleaks from appearing. A multicentre randomised control trial with higher number of patients is necessary for proper, robust conclusion to be established.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>TEVAR</kwd><kwd>Thoracic endovascular aortic repair</kwd><kwd>Aorta</kwd><kwd>Aneurysm</kwd><kwd>Dissection</kwd><kwd>Left subclavian artery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has rapidly become an accepted treatment option for numerous aortic pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An important requirement for successful endografting is confirming the health of the aorta in the landing zone where the graft is deployed. Left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage is necessary to achieve the proximal seal in up to 50&#x000a0;% of patients treated with TEVAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The management of LSA revascularisation in this cohort of patients remains a matter of debate. A 2009 consensus from the Society of Vascular Surgery described the quality of the existing evidence on the performance of subclavian revascularisation in patients undergoing TEVAR as low (2C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A 2011 literature review from the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, which resulted in the formulation of recommendation of prophylactic LSA revascularisation in elective patients, was based on numerous and heterogeneous series with small samples of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies in support of routine preoperative LSA revascularisation show that the coverage of the LSA during TEVAR is associated with an increased risk of stroke, paraplegia and arm ischaemia. Other studies have shown that coverage of the LSA without prophylactic revascularisation is not associated with increased morbidity, supporting those results promoting selective LSA revascularisation during TEVAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The decision on the LSA coverage was based on preoperative contrast enhanced computed tomography (CTA) of the neck and thorax, evaluating the anatomy of the thoracic aorta, aortic arch and carotid and vertebral arteries. The anatomy of the circle of Willis was not routinely assessed. To further evaluate the cerebrovascular anatomy, doubtful elective patients in this subgroup underwent preoperative carotid and vertebral artery duplex Doppler ultrasonography. Three-dimensional MPR image reconstructions were performed to obtain centreline measurements of the aortic lumen. In patients who did not undergo supplemental preoperative imaging, the arch vessel anatomy was evaluated intraoperatively before S-G deployment. In elective cases, a proximal landing zone of &#x02265;15-mm length was required. In emergency cases, however, a &#x02265;10-mm proximal aortic &#x0201c;neck&#x0201d; was deemed suitable. In cases with shorter necks, the decision to cover the LSA was made. To classify the proximal landing zones, the aortic arch map with zones 0&#x02013;4 by Ishimaru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] was applied. In cases that required zone 0 TEVAR, patients would initially attain aortic debranching by the implantation of a bifurcated bypass from the ascending aorta to the brachiocephalic trunk and LCCA; later, during the same procedure, the S-G would be deployed in zone 0. Patients requiring zone 1 deployment underwent right-to-left carotid-carotid bypass procedures using an 8-mm Dacron graft.</p><p>We practice the strategy of conditional prophylactic revascularisation of the LSA in patients with patent LIMA-LAD bypass, dominant left vertebral or hypoplastic right vertebral artery, patent left arm dialysis fistula or axillo-femoral bypass graft. Additionally, intraoperative indications for LSA revascularisation include symptoms of acute left arm ischaemia.</p><p>From 2004 to 2009, our endovascular team consisted of a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist, and the procedures were performed in an interventional radiology suite. From 2009 to the present, a team of vascular and cardiac surgeons has been performing elective cases using a mobile C-arm (Siemens ARCADIS Avantic), while emergency cases are performed in an interventional radiology suite using an Siemens Artis zee C-arm (vascular surgeon and radiologist) unless aortic debranching is required (in those cases, the procedures are performed in the surgical theatre with the use of mobile C-arm).</p><p>In total, 63&#x000a0;% of procedures were performed under general anaesthesia, and 37&#x000a0;% were performed using loco-regional anaesthesia and sedation.

Post-operative neurological assessments occurred every 2&#x000a0;h in the first eight post-operative hours and then every 4&#x000a0;h in uncomplicated cases (by either treating or on-call surgeon or anaesthesiologist).

Secondary success was obtained in two patients (3.8&#x000a0;%). The first of these was a female patient treated on an emergency basis for aortic transection due to vehicle trauma. She required additional subclavian-carotid transposition and forearm fasciotomy for acute left arm ischaemia, which developed after emergency TEVAR with LSA coverage (procedure performed in hypovolemic shock). Another patient was also treated on emergency basis (complicated acute type B aortic dissection). In this case, where zone 2 deployment was intended, post-deployment aortography revealed the coverage of LCCA origin (accidental zone 1 deployment).

In our population, the extension of landing zone to zones 0&#x02013;2 by Ishimaru did not completely prevent type IA endoleakage, with a tendency to increased type IA endoleak rate (9.4 vs. 4.2&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.41) in this group.</p><p>Chimney technique as well as scallop or multilayered prosthesis is an alternative for TEVAR with LSA coverage. These procedures require long-lasting technical preparation so they cannot be used in emergency cases. Another alternative may be the use of multilayered stents&#x02014;however, nowadays, it delivers a lot of questions and has as many followers as opponents. The effectiveness of these method requires further investigation and trials; it cannot be recommended as a routine approach to this particular pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Due to the extensive circulation provided by the LSA, coverage of the LSA can theoretically lead to grave complications, such as spinal cord ischaemia or cerebrovascular incidents, or to usually better tolerated chronic left arm ischaemia or subclavian steal syndrome. Although infrequent, acute upper extremity ischaemia has also been reported in the setting of LSA coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, such risks may be justified, especially in emergency situations in order to prevent mentioned endoleakage. In our population, there was a significant predominance of acute cases in group where LSA origin was covered (52.8 vs. 29.2&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007).</p><p>The management of intentional LSA coverage, particularly in elective setting, remains a matter of debate. Reports of a low incidence of left arm ischaemia shifted the pendulum towards the liberal coverage of the LSA as an attractive means of extending proximal landing zone in the early years of TEVAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This complication, if it occurs, is well-tolerated in the vast majority of cases; if necessary, revascularisation may be implemented in an elective setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Still, reports of devastating neurological complications and studies showing an increased incidence of CVA and SCI have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], calling for a reconsideration of the liberal LSA coverage policy.</p><p>However, the problem of additional risks associated with an extra procedure (LSA revascularisation) remains, and its necessity has been disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In fact, a high rate of complications, such as stroke (6.6&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and phrenic nerve injury (12.6&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], has been reported. The most recent analysis published by Madenci et al. revealed a combined CVA and death rate of 5.3&#x000a0;% for isolated LSA reconstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>There was an attempt to standardise such care, and the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] proposed recommendations based on selected trials and meta-analyses. Internally, the SVS recommendation graded the level of evidence as low&#x02014;2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a literature review from 2011, the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] strongly recommends prophylactic LSA revascularisation in elective patients. Still, level I evidence is non-existent.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine the real-life results (tertiary centre providing aortic care to a population of ~2.3 million) of a selective LSA revascularisation strategy based on absolute indications only.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>CVA</title><p>In our group of patients with LSA coverage, one stroke occurred in a patient with an unintentional occlusion of left common carotid artery origin. It appears that this stroke (ischaemic focus in left frontal lobe) was directly related to left common carotid artery occlusion and not to LSA coverage.</p><p>However, a significant number of case series and meta-analyses have revealed an increased incidence of CVA in patients with LSA coverage without revascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and stroke protection by pre-TEVAR restoration of LSA flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The reason for this is not clear, as many series did not report whether the strokes were in the posterior or anterior circulation. Posterior circulation strokes may indeed result from hypoperfusion caused by LSA coverage. However, anterior circulation strokes are instead often the result of embolisation caused by increased instrumentation in the aortic arch, which often is the case in zone 2 TEVAR procedures. Therefore, LSA coverage may be just an indirect marker of more advanced aortic disease with a higher hazard of embolisation. In fact, several recent papers explaining the reported stroke territory were found to support this theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The embolisation theory may also explain why numerous authors found LSA revascularisation to be ineffective in reducing the stroke rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, recent analysis by Maldonado et al. revealed that LSA revascularisation may even be harmful to certain patients (fourfold higher stroke incidence in females with LSA revascularisation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In our studied group, there were no other complications than the aforementioned stroke, meaning that neither embolisation strokes from the anterior circulation nor hypoperfusion strokes from the posterior circulation occurred.</p><p>Only 34&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) of our patients were aged older than 70&#x000a0;years, making a relatively young population with a median age of 61. Secondly, only 43.4&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23) of patients had thoracic aortic aneurysm. Those two facts may indirectly indicate that our population had a low grade of either arch atheroma or thrombus and may explain the low incidence of CVA (an increased chance of CVA due to significant arch atheroma in patients &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;years of age was previously postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>SCI</title><p>Our population of patients with LSA coverage without prior revascularisation had no SCI after a 30-day observation.

The median length of the covered aorta in group A was 205&#x000a0;mm; however, the number of patients with a coverage of &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mm may be more important. In our population, only 33.9&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) of patients had segments longer than 200&#x000a0;mm covered, which may partially explain our good results. Additionally, none of our patients had more than two elements implanted; only the implantation of more than three elements significantly increases the risk of paraplegia, according to the EUROSTAR investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>We did not observe the influence of prior abdominal aortic repair on an increased early rate of SCI in the covered-LSA non-revascularised group. We had five patients with prior AAA surgery in the covered-LSA group, and none of them had SCI. However, all of these cases were elective. Czerny recently postulated that the coverage of two vascular territories in situations of hemodynamic instability may increase the chance of SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The elective setting and no hemodynamic instability of these five cases may explain why no SCI occurred. Furthermore, hypogastric artery status would provide valuable additional insight into these cases; however, we have no such information in our case notes, hampering any conclusions.</p><p>Another factor playing a role in the explanation for the low SCI rate is that none of our patients of group A had renal insufficiency, which is known to be an independent risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the follow-up period, we recorded one case of paraplegia, which occurred in the seventh post-operative month. The paraplegia was due to spinal ischaemia with an ischemic focus at the level of T6&#x02013;T8 and occurred in a patient who had an increased risk of early SCI based on the presence of one known risk factor (prior AAA open repair). In the follow-up CT, just before the occurrence of the paraplegia, a fresh type IA endoleak was found. We assume that, in this case, distal migration might have occurred (endoleak IA); the Adamkiewicz artery might have been occluded, resulting in paraplegia. The patient is ambulatory with crutches and is on a waiting list for proximal TEVAR extension.</p><p>Our results show that the implementation of a strategy of selective LSA revascularisation within a real-world, consecutive TEVAR population resulted in a low incidence of neurological complications. Low number of incidents did not allow to conduct a multivariate statistical analyses regarding SCI and CVA, which is a clear limitation of this study. Even if a relatively small sample size and heterogeneous pathology group may have biased our data, our per-procedure conclusions still stand.</p><p>However, we do foresee the necessity of further multicentre studies that report the combined morbidity of TEVAR with prophylactic LSA revascularisation vs. the morbidity of TEVAR without LSA revascularisation (preferably with all of the patients&#x02019; data included on an intention-to-treat basis) as the next step in solving the on-going debate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our analysis, although retrospective and based on one institution experience, shows a realistic population of TEVAR patients. We prove that TEVAR with coverage of LSA origin can be accomplished with minimal neurological morbidity in this patient population. The study shows that LSA revascularisation is not mandatory before endograft deployment, especially in emergency settings. We also prove that although zone 2 TEVAR extends to the proximal landing zone, it does not prevent type IA endoleaks from appearing. A multicentre randomised control trial with higher number of patients is necessary for proper, robust conclusion to be established.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d30e1887"><title>Conflicts of
