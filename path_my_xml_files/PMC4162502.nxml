During the treatment period, lung function and asthma control measures with placebo were generally worse in FAO+ versus FAO&#x02212; patients. Budesonide was effective on most end points in both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients. In contrast to FAO&#x02212; patients, FAO+ patients were unresponsive to formoterol monotherapy in both study populations. Consistently greater improvements in most end points (including worsening of asthma as predefined by specific lung function parameters or clinical symptoms) were observed moving from formoterol to budesonide to budesonide/formoterol in both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients, with generally greater than additive effects on lung function with budesonide/formoterol in FAO+ patients. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: FAO+ patients tended to be more impaired and at greater risk for an asthma event versus FAO&#x02212; patients. While FAO+ patients were non-responsive to formoterol monotherapy, they retained responsiveness to budesonide and had the greatest lung function and control responses to budesonide/formoterol that were similar to or greater than responses of FAO&#x02212; patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Airflow limitation</kwd><kwd>airway inflammation</kwd><kwd>budesonide</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>formoterol</kwd><kwd>inhaled corticosteroid</kwd><kwd>lung function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="ss1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and variable airflow obstruction [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients meeting a conventional asthma definition but with persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (hereafter: fixed airflow obstruction [FAO]) are well recognized by practicing clinicians and asthma researchers. The prevalence of FAO in severe or difficult-to-treat asthma ranges from 55% to 60% based on the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) to forced vital capacity (FVC) using a post-bronchodilator threshold of &#x02264;70% [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FAO in asthma has been attributed to structural changes due to airway remodeling [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>].</p><p>There is no accepted definition of FAO in asthma. The following two definitions have been recommended for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where the persistence of post-bronchodilator airway obstruction is a defining feature: FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c; 0.70 [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c; lower limit of normal (LLN) [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Neither definition has been extensively clinically validated. However, the LLN definition may reduce misclassification of FAO because the LLN value is derived from reference equations specific to the population under study, taking into account age, sex and ethnicity [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The reliability of the LLN definition depends on appropriate selection of reference equations and accurate interpretation of pulmonary function results [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Use of the LLN definition may be particularly important in younger patients to improve the likelihood of early identification of FAO that might be missed using a fixed threshold of &#x0003c;0.70 [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present a description of baseline demography, current asthma control characteristics and treatment outcomes from two 12-week pivotal US Food and Drug Administration asthma trials spanning a broad range of asthma severity. These trials were selected because they are the only ones that included placebo, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist (LABA) and ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination arms within the same trial. Patients were stratified <italic>post hoc</italic> according to FAO status based on FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;LLN (with data for FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;0.70 presented in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary material</xref>). The two trials were analyzed separately because of differences in patient severity and the run-in period (budesonide versus placebo). The findings from this descriptive analysis show that patients with FAO tend to have a longer duration of disease and to have more severe asthma based on asthma control characteristics at study entry compared with asthmatic patients without FAO. Patients with FAO did not respond to LABA monotherapy and were most responsive to ICS/LABA combination therapy, where a more than additive effect on lung function was observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="ss3" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients, study design and treatments</title><p>This <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis included data from two previously reported double-blinded, double-dummy randomized, 12-week studies (study I: NCT00651651 [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; study II: NCT00652002 [<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) conducted in patients with mild-to-moderate (study I; aged &#x02265;6 years) or moderate-to-severe (study II; aged &#x02265;12 years) asthma with a smoking history of &#x02264;10 pack-years. At screening, patients must have demonstrated reversibility from baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x02265;12% and &#x02265;0.20 L in both studies. Asthma was defined according to standard American Thoracic Society criteria [<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; asthma severity was based on ICS dose before entry and an FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted value of &#x02265;60% to &#x02264;90% in study I and &#x02265;45% to &#x02264;85% in study II. Both studies included 2-week run-in periods (study I: placebo; study II: budesonide pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] 160 &#x000b5;g twice daily; both studies: albuterol as-needed) and 12-week randomized treatment periods, including the following treatments: budesonide/formoterol pMDI (study I: 160/9 &#x000b5;g twice daily; study II: 320/9 &#x000b5;g twice daily), budesonide pMDI 320 &#x000b5;g + formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) 9 &#x000b5;g twice daily (study II only; not presented in this report), budesonide pMDI (study I: 160 &#x000b5;g twice daily; study II: 320 &#x000b5;g twice daily), formoterol DPI (both studies: 9 &#x000b5;g twice daily) and placebo (both studies). In both studies, patients were eligible for randomization if they had documented daytime or nighttime asthma symptom scores &#x0003e;0 (where 0 indicates no symptoms and 3 indicates severe symptoms) on &#x02265;3 of 7 consecutive days during the run-in period. To maintain blinding, patients received a pMDI and a DPI containing active treatment or placebo. Study protocols were approved by an institutional review board for each of the clinical sites and conducted in conformance with guidelines for the ethical treatment of human subjects, good clinical practice and applicable local regulations.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>FAO definitions and LLN equations</title><p>Patients were classified as FAO+ or FAO&#x02212; based on a single determination of post-albuterol lung function performed at screening according to two definitions: (1) FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c; LLN (FAO+) or &#x02265;LLN (FAO&#x02212;) [<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and (2) FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &#x0003c;0.70 (FAO+) or &#x02265;0.70 (FAO&#x02212;) [<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary material</xref> for changes in FVC outcomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Figure E2</xref>). Lung function, as assessed by changes from baseline in predose FEV<sub>1</sub> after 12 weeks of therapy was lower for FAO+ versus FAO&#x02212; patients receiving placebo in both studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Slight overall improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> were observed for placebo-treated patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (study I), irrespective of FAO status, whereas patients with moderate-to-severe asthma (study II) experienced a sharp decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub>. This difference is explained by the fact that there is no change in background therapy moving from the run-in to the placebo treatment period for study I (i.e. as needed SABAs throughout); whereas, there is a step-down from low-dose budesonide run-in to placebo for study II. While LABA monotherapy is not an endorsed treatment step for asthma, it is notable that FAO&#x02212; patients showed substantial improvements in lung function with formoterol, approaching those seen with budesonide in study I (mild-to-moderate patients). In contrast, it is notable that in FAO+ patients, lung function was essentially non-responsive to formoterol monotherapy in both studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients showed nearly equivalent improvement in lung function with budesonide monotherapy in both studies; the magnitude of improvement was smaller for study II, in which patients had received low-dose budesonide as part of their run-in. Budesonide/formoterol combination therapy produced the largest lung function improvements in FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients in both studies, with a consistently greater-than-additive effect observed with combination treatment relative to budesonide and formoterol alone in FAO+ patients that generally was not observed in FAO&#x02212; patients.

</p><p>As expected, improvement in the percentage of asthma control days was lowest and withdrawals due to predefined asthma events were more common in the placebo group relative to the other treatment groups in both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients in both studies. In FAO+ patients, the greatest improvements in asthma control days were observed in the budesonide/formoterol group compared with either monocomponent or placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Among FAO&#x02212; patients, improvements in asthma control days were greatest with budesonide/formoterol in those classified as moderate-to-severe (study II) and were fairly similar, albeit slightly lower, with budesonide/formoterol versus budesonide in mild-to-moderate patients (study I). Withdrawals due to predefined asthma events were more common in FAO+ versus FAO&#x02212; patients treated with placebo or formoterol monotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Withdrawals due to predefined asthma events decreased with increasing intensity of treatment for FAO+ patients in both studies, with the lowest rates observed for budesonide/formoterol. This relationship was also true for FAO&#x02212; patients classified as moderate-to-severe (study II) but not for those classified as mild-to-moderate (study I), for whom budesonide led to slightly fewer withdrawals for a predefined asthma event than combination therapy. FAO+ patients had consistently better treatment outcomes with budesonide/formoterol pMDI versus all other treatments in both studies.</p><p>Treatment outcomes, based on rescue medication use and percentage of awakening-free nights, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>. Mild-to-moderate (study I) FAO+ patients displayed higher rescue medication use during placebo treatment but contrastingly larger positive treatment responses to all active therapies compared to FAO&#x02212; patients. In moderate-to-severe patients (study II), the treatment responses to budesonide/formoterol and formoterol alone for rescue medication use were fairly similar between FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients, but responses to budesonide alone were lower in FAO+ than FAO&#x02212; patients. In both studies, reductions in rescue medication use were greatest with budesonide/formoterol pMDI, irrespective of FAO category. Awakening-free nights invariably improved with all active therapies compared with placebo, irrespective of disease severity or FAO status, with modestly larger effects for the budesonide-containing arms compared with formoterol.

FAO was determined during their screening evaluation for participation in two randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapy. In this descriptive <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of data from two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies, FAO defined by a screening post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio below the LLN was relatively common, with a prevalence of 24% in patients previously classified as having mild-to-moderate asthma (study I) and 40% in those classified as having moderate-to-severe asthma (study II). In both studies, FAO+ patients were more likely to be male and have a longer asthma duration compared with FAO&#x02212; patients, consistent with a previous report from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimen study [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the present analysis, baseline lung function was lower and rescue medication use higher in FAO+ versus FAO&#x02212; patients, consistent with a greater degree of impairment. These findings are consistent with results from previous analyses showing associations between the presence of FAO and physician-identified severe asthma [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and lower FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted values [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Asthma symptom scores in the present analysis were similar in FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients. This finding may have resulted from the narrow range and relative imprecision of the Likert-based symptom scoring used (0 = none to 3 = severe) and belies the differences observed in baseline rescue medication use. In addition, the correlation between asthma symptomatology and lung function is generally weak [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, formoterol alone had essentially no effect on treatment-averaged FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC in FAO+ patients, differentiating them physiologically both from FAO&#x02212; patients, who did demonstrate physiologic improvements with formoterol, and from patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who generally respond well to formoterol [<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. FAO+ patients remained responsive to budesonide for most end points, highlighting the importance of anti-inflammatory treatment in this population. As lung function outcomes for formoterol were similar to placebo in FAO+ patients, one would expect the efficacy of the combination of budesonide and formoterol to be driven by budesonide alone. Interestingly, however, the fixed combination of budesonide and formoterol resulted in a greater effect on lung function than the monocomponents in both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients, and these effects were more than additive in FAO+ patients. This notion is consistent with results of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing cooperative, additive and synergistic anti-inflammatory and bronchoprotective effects between formoterol and budesonide [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref>].</p><p>Following patients over time also gives insight into the effect of FAO status on future risk of adverse outcomes, best seen in the placebo arms and in the differential responsiveness to active treatments. Prospective evaluation of asthma control days and withdrawals due to asthma events in the placebo arm suggest that FAO+ patients are at increased future risk relative to FAO&#x02212; patients. A stepwise improvement in these composite asthma control metrics was observed in FAO+ patients moving from formoterol to budesonide to budesonide/formoterol. This response to budesonide/formoterol was similar for FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients with respect to these metrics.</p><p>There are several limitations to this analysis. The <italic>post hoc</italic> nature of the analysis and relatively small FAO+ subgroups preclude formal statistics; therefore, these data must be considered hypothesis-generating only. Therefore, any conclusions rest on the magnitude and consistency of the effects between the two studies. Differences in run-in treatment between the two studies (placebo in study I and budesonide in study II) limit direct comparison of baseline variables assessed during the run-in period and changes in efficacy outcomes between the two studies.</p><p>Other potential limitations involve the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC assessment, which was based on a single screening visit assessment; FAO status was not defined after treatment that could have optimized lung function. Additionally, the albuterol dose used to determine screening post-bronchodilator lung function (two to four puffs) and the timing of spirometry (15&#x02212;30 min after bronchodilator) could vary. Therefore, it is possible that some patients may have been misclassified with respect to FAO status because of day-to-day variability in FEV<sub>1</sub> or less than maximal bronchodilation based on a single spirometry test. Furthermore, it is possible that patients originally classified as FAO+ at screening could have switched to FAO&#x02212; during the 12-week study period. However, since both trials were placebo-controlled and evaluated responses to three different active medications, post-randomization classification of FAO would not have been possible without biasing the impact of FAO status on treatment outcomes.</p><p>The 12-week duration of the studies also may have been too short to attain an optimal effect of ICS treatment on efficacy outcomes. The exclusion of races other than Caucasian, African&#x02013;American and Mexican&#x02013;American based on the LLN equations used limits generalization of the findings to some populations.</p><p>In conclusion, stratification of asthma patients according to post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC and a LLN cutoff as determined at the onset of two randomized, controlled clinical trials identified clinically distinct populations based on demography, baseline control and subsequent responsiveness to asthma controllers. FAO+ patients were more likely male with longer asthma duration and were more impaired based on pulmonary function and rescue medication use. Budesonide and budesonide/formoterol combination therapy showed efficacy in both FAO+ and FAO&#x02212; patients in both studies, whereas FAO+ patients were distinctly non-responsive to formoterol monotherapy treatment. The most positive treatment outcomes generally were observed with the fixed combination of budesonide and formoterol, irrespective of FAO category, with a greater than additive effect of budesonide/formoterol treatment observed in FAO+ patients. The findings from this analysis support treatment of patients with FAO+ asthma based on current asthma guidelines [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although more aggressive asthma management may be necessary in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Tom Uryniak, MS, from AstraZeneca LP for helpful comments and statistical oversight.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> The authors thank Scientific Connexions, who provided medical writing support funded by AstraZeneca LP (Wilmington, DE).
