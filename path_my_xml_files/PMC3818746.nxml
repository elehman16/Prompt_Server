importance, researchers have investigated the merits of several exercise methods and
instruments for the activation of the latissmus dorsi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Representative exercises for strengthening the latissimus dorsi are
pull down, pull up, and rowing exercises. Previous studies which investigated the latissmus
dorsi muscle activation have reported that it depends on grip width, expert instruction, and
forearm orientation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Signorile et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a wide handgrip position
produces a greater latissmus dorsi muscle activation than other handgrip positions.
Sperandei et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated three
positions of pull down, the scapular plane, the frontal plane using a V-shaped bar, and the
behind the neck position. Clinical studies have also used different methods for the
measurement of latissmus dorsi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pull down in the standing position and body lifting in the
seated position have commonly been used to activate the latissmus dorsi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no study has investigated the effect of foot placement on
the latissmus dorsi and low back muscle activities during pull-down exercise. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to examine the effects of foot placement on the latissmus dorsi
and low back muscle activities during pull-down exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 10 males aged 20&#x02013;27&#x02005;years (23.2 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;years, mean&#x000b1;SD) whose average
height and weight were 175.6 &#x000b1; 2.3&#x02005;cm and 66.2 &#x000b1; 4.6&#x02005;kg, respectively. The subjects had no
history of musculoskeletal disorders or pain associated with the upper extremity in the past
6 months. The EMG data were collected using a Biopac MP150WSW (Biopac System, Santa Barbara,
CA, USA). Surface electrodes were placed at an oblique angle over the latissmus dorsi muscle
on the right side, approximately 4&#x02005;cm below the inferior tip of the scapula and midway
between the spine and lateral edge of the torso, and for the L4 paraspinal muscle on the
right side 2&#x02005;cm, laterally from the L4 spinous process. The subjects performed pull-down
exercises with 4 foot placement conditions. Condition 1 was standing with their feet one
shoulder-width apart, condition 2 was standing with their feet 120% shoulder-width apart,
condition 3 was standing with the right foot placed anteriorly and the left foot posteriorly
one shoulder-width apart, and condition 4 was standing with the left foot placed anteriorly
and the right foot posteriorly one shoulder-width apart. From the standing position,
subjects grasped the two bar of pulley. Subjects then tried to pull-down with their arms,
caudally, without flexing the elbow or depressing the shoulder. The exercise load was the
50% of the body weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each isometric
exertion was maintained for 5 seconds, and the middle of three seconds was used for further
analysis. Data were normalized as percentages of the maximal voluntary isometric
contractions value against normalized data. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Bonferroni correction was performed to
identify specific differences between multiple pairwise comparisons among the 4 conditions.
The results were considered significant for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05, and SPSS version 18.0
(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The activities of the latissmus dorsi muscles significantly increased in the order of
conditions 1 (45.9 &#x000b1; 13.3%) and 2 (42.9 &#x000b1; 12.3%) &#x0003c; condition 4 (52.0 &#x000b1; 12.0%) &#x0003c;
condition 3 (56.2 &#x000b1; 10.2%) (p&#x0003c;0.05). The EMG activities of the L4 paraspinal muscles were
significantly different, with the activities of condition 1 (46.2 &#x000b1;16.0%) and condition 2
(49.5 &#x000b1;19.6%) being significantly greater than those of condition 3 (33.8 &#x000b1;11.7%) and
condition 4 (36.5 &#x000b1;15.5%) (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study investigated the effects of foot placement on the latissmus dorsi and low back
muscle activities during pull-down exercise. Our results show that the activities of the
latissmus dorsi muscles significantly increased in the order of conditions 1 and 2 &#x0003c;
condition 4 &#x0003c; condition 3. Condition 3 was standing with the right foot placed anteriorly
and the left foot posteriorly one shoulder-width apart. The latissmus dorsi is a very broad
muscle that originates at the lower six thoracic vertebrae, the lumbodorsal fascia, the
sacrum, and the blade of the ilium; it inserts, along with the teres major, on the medial
edge of the humerus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study showed
that extension of the ipsilateral leg generates gluteus maximus activity, which tightens the
thoracolumbar fascia. The stress of the thoracolumar fascia is transmitted to the
ipsilateral latissmus dorsi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results
also show that the activities of the L4 paraspinal muscles were significantly different,
with conditions 1 and 2 being significantly higher than those of conditions 3 and 4.
According to recent reports, continuous exercise training with poor posture or method can
result in low back pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects with LBP
have been shown to have altered trunk muscle activation patterns which are activated highly
in L4-L5 level back muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Foot
placement is associated with the size of the base of support (BOS) of the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pull-down exercise requires
anterior-posterior translation along the line of the center of gravity of body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we suggest that the selection of
foot placement is an important factor for effective strengthening of the latissmus
dorsi.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
