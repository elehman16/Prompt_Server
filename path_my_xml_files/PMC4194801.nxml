It aims to recruit a total of 500 patients with AD; 250 in the nilvadipine group and 250 in the placebo group. Participants will be randomised to receive nilvadipine, an 8&#x02005;mg overencapsulated, sustained release capsule, or a matching overencapsulated placebo (sugar pill) for a period of 78&#x02005;weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome measure in this study is the change in cognitive function as assessed by the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 12) from baseline to the end of treatment duration (78&#x02005;weeks). There are two key secondary outcome measures, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). If a statistically significant effect is seen in the primary outcome, CDR-sb will be considered to be a coprimary end point and only the DAD will contribute to the secondary outcome analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study and all subsequent amendments have received ethical approval within each participating country according to national regulations.

Furthermore, ideally, any novel drugs or compounds tested would have a demonstrated safety profile in order to expedite the path to clinical application.</p><p>Calcium antagonists or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first introduced over 25&#x02005;years ago as coronary vasodilators for the treatment of coronary heart disease, and have since achieved notable recognition in the treatment of arterial hypertension.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Nilvadipine (trade name: Nivadil), a dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist, is currently licensed to treat patients with hypertension.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, recent research has highlighted other properties of certain CCBs, including nilvadipine, suggesting that they are protective not just against stroke-related dementia, but also independently against AD.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Research to date has suggested that the AD preventive effect of DHP CCBs, may not be mediated through their antihypertensive effects, but rather via an anti-&#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) mechanism where the accumulation of A&#x003b2; in the brain is reduced by altering A&#x003b2; production in the brain and A&#x003b2; clearance across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). Paris <italic>et al</italic> investigated the effects of a number of commonly used antihypertensive DHPs and non-DHPs on A&#x003b2; production both <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> and found that not all DHPs are equal. Nilvadipine and amlodipine were found to significantly lower A&#x003b2;40 as well as A&#x003b2;42 production <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, other DHPs and non-DHPs had little effect or even increased A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 production <italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using transgenic mouse models of AD (Tg PS1/APPsw) highlighted nilvadipine reduced levels of A&#x003b2; in the brain and, furthermore, nilvadipine enhanced A&#x003b2; clearance across the BBB. In addition to these properties, nilvadipine has shown efficacy against a broad range of AD pathological mechanisms, including &#x003c4;-phosphorylation, reduced cerebral blood flow and neuroinflammation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Studies have found that nilvadipine is distributed extensively throughout the body, including the brain and has been shown to have a cerebrocirculatory enhancing effect.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Nilvadipine has also been shown to protect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from <italic>in vivo</italic> oxidation in patients with hypertension with high risk of atherosclerosis and to inhibit the generation of cytokines derived from activated T lymphocytes in collagen disease complicated with essential hypertension.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Several epidemiological studies with different calcium channel antagonists have been conducted to determine their potential usefulness in the management of AD. In the Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) trial, which involved active treatment with the DHP CCB nitrendipine in over 2400 patients, there was a 55% reduction in the incidence of AD.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Ageing also found a strong trend towards reduced relative risk of AD in patients treated with DHP CCBs, with no lowered risk observed in the non-DHP CCB treatment group.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Furthermore, nilvadipine has been shown to have favourable effects on cognitive function with stabilisation of cognitive decline and reduced conversion to AD in patients with hypertension with mild cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A study by Kennelly <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> provided preliminary evidence suggesting the potential efficacy in the treatment of AD. A 6-week open label study demonstrated that nilvadipine was well tolerated in patients with AD.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A nilvadipine slow release 8&#x02005;mg formulation did not reduce blood pressure (BP) in non-hypertensive patients with AD, but appropriately lowered BP in hypertensive cases. No patient started on nilvadipine requested or required discontinuation of the medication throughout this study, highlighting that nilvadipine is well tolerated in patients with AD and has demonstrated safety as a licensed antihypertensive treatment.</p><p>In summary, this study will investigate the safety and efficacy of nilvadipine as a disease-modifying treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate AD over a period of 18&#x02005;months across nine countries in Europe including Ireland, Germany, Greece, France, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Sweden and the UK.</p><p>Overall, the aim is to build on the initial studies of nilvadipine as a treatment for AD by investigating its efficacy and establish its safety profile in a phase III double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of nilvadipine compared with placebo. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive 8&#x02005;mg of nilvadipine or placebo daily for 78&#x02005;weeks of treatment. Patients will initially undergo a screening assessment to confirm eligibility. This will be followed by a baseline visit (week 0), when each patient is randomised and will receive the first dose of study medication. Patients will then undergo assessments at weeks 6, 13, 26, 39, 52, 65 and 78 (&#x000b1;7&#x02005;days) after beginning treatment. A final follow-up assessment will be undertaken at 82&#x02005;weeks (study end point).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate AD based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association, Inc (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria are suitable for treatment with nilvadipine.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref> for details of study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

In previous studies the change in ADAS-Cog score was normally distributed with a mean score of 7 and SD of 11 for the placebo group and with a mean score of 3.5 and SD of 9 for the experimental group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To observe such a difference between the two groups, 175 experimental participants and 175 control participants must be recruited to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with a probability (power) of 0.9. The type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is a two sided 0.05. To account for an attrition rate of 30%, the total sample size per group is 250. Since the power calculation assumes a 50% smaller decline in the experimental group compared with the placebo group for the ADAS-Cog, we could make the same assumption for the CDR-sb. If used as a single primary end point, the CDR-sb has similar power to the ADAS-Cog, because, historically, the mean to SD ratio is very similar between these two outcomes, and because we are assuming a fixed percentage effect relative to placebo. So if we assume independence of the two outcomes, which each have a 90% probability of success, then the probability of succeeding on both primary outcomes is 0.9*0.9=0.81, indicating that the power for achieving both outcomes simultaneously is more than 80%. As the change from baseline on the ADAS-Cog and CDR-sb are somewhat correlated, this is a conservative estimate of the power for this study to be pivotal.</p><p>The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses will use a mixed-model repeated measures analysis for the change from baseline, including data from all postbaseline visits, with terms for baseline score, site and treatment group. The linear contrasts on the LS-Means of the treatment effects will be used to perform the between-group comparisons. The primary and key secondary statistical analyses will be performed once, after data collection has been halted and the database has been finalised. No interim analyses will be performed.</p><sec id="s3a1"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The primary analyses will consist of a gatekeeper approach with the following stages:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>First, the p value for between-group comparison of the ADAS-Cog outcome will be compared with 0.05.

If significance is not achieved the secondary analyses will proceed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Third, if significance is achieved in steps 1 and 2, then an analysis will be undertaken using time as a continuous numerical variable, on ADAS-Cog.

If significance is achieved in both of these measures, then the study will have provided evidence of a delay of disability. If significance is achieved in neither the secondary analyses will proceed.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the case of step 1 of the primary analysis not achieving statistical significance, steps 2 and 3 will still be performed, but any significant outcomes will be for discussion purposes only.</p><p>The primary statistical analysis will be carried out on the intent-to-treat population, which will include all randomised patients.

Nilvadipine is a licensed medication for high BP in several European countries including Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal and the UK and it has a reliable safety profile.

Physical examination and routine laboratory blood tests will be undertaken at the screening visit. A routine evaluation of general health and well-being will be conducted at baseline and at all subsequent visits also.</p><p>BP measurements will be carried out at each visit. For any patient who develops elevated BP during the study or who presents with elevated BP at screening, add on therapy with a non-centrally acting ACE inhibitor will be considered in consultation with the trial clinician and the patient's GP.</p><p>All adverse events will be assessed and reported, including: Adverse Events or Adverse Experiences (AE); Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR); Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions (UAR); Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR); and Suspected Unexpected SAR (SUSAR).</p><p>Additional safety measurements may be conducted more frequently if clinically indicated or at the discretion of the site investigator.

The direct and indirect costs of AD and other dementias amount to more than &#x020ac;440&#x02005;000 million each year.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is estimated that by 2050, 1 in 85 of the population worldwide will have AD and that approximately 40% of these cases will need the level of care equivalent to a nursing home. Even modest therapeutic advances that lead to small delays in Alzheimer's onset and progression could significantly reduce the global and European burden of the disease and the level of care required by patients. While there are symptomatic-based drug therapies such as cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate antagonists available for AD, these medications do not stop the disease process or prevent neuronal degeneration. Therefore there is a clear unmet medical and public health need for the development of new treatments and it is imperative that the scientific community strive to discover disease modifying treatments that can be introduced at the earliest possible stage of neurodegeneration.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>There is convincing scientific evidence for an antiamyloid effect of nilvadipine, with reduced A&#x003b2; production, enhanced A&#x003b2; clearance from the brain and improved cortical perfusion in mouse models of AD, highlighting potential disease modifying benefits.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This study will help to establish if such disease modifying effects will be evident in human subjects also.</p><p>Research to date has shown that nilvadipine has a good safety profile and is well tolerated in patients with AD, facilitating the inclusion of older adults with a range of comorbidities in this study and the results from this study will provide further information about the efficacy and safety of Nilvadipine in patients with AD.</p><p>If this trial is successful, nilvadipine would represent a significant advance in the treatment and management of patients with AD and would have a major impact on the health and social care costs incurred in Europe by this neurodegenerative disorder.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Trial status</title><p>Enrollment for the trial began in May 2013 and the recruitment period will continue until December 2014.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e469" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006364.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the guidance of Prof Robin Jacoby, Dr. Paul Aisen, Dr. Suzanne Hendrix and Maurice O'Connell of the NILVAD Scientific Advisory Board, during preparation of the study protocol.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Dr Suzanne Hendrix, Prof. Robin Jacoby and Dr Paul Aisen.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BL, SK, Fiona Crawford, and MM made substantial contributions to the initial study conception and study design.
