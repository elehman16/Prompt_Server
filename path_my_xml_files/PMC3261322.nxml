However, the extent to which striatal DA function in METH predicts recovery has not been evaluated. Here we assessed whether striatal DA activity in METH abusers is associated with clinical outcomes. Brain DA D2 receptor (D2R) availability was measured with PET and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride in sixteen METH abusers both after placebo and after challenge with 60 mg oral methylphenidate (to measure DA release) to assess if it predicted clinical outcomes. For this purpose METH abusers were tested within 6 months of last METH use and then followed up for 9 months of abstinence. In parallel, 15 healthy controls were tested. METH abusers had lower D2R availability in caudate than controls. Both METH abusers and controls showed decreased striatal D2R availability after MPH and these decreases were smaller in METH than in controls in left putamen. The 6 METH abusers who relapsed during the follow up period had lower D2R availability in dorsal striatum than controls and had no D2R changes after MPH challenge. The 10 METH abusers who completed detoxification did not differ from controls neither in striatal D2R availability nor in MPH-induced striatal dopamine changes. These results provide preliminary evidence that low striatal DA function in METH abusers is associated with a greater likelihood of relapse during treatment. Detection of the extent of DA dysfunction may be helpful in predicting therapeutic outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>methamphetamine</kwd><kwd>dopamine release</kwd><kwd>positron emission tomography</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>early withdrawal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Several preclinical studies have been reported on the deleterious effects of methamphetamine (METH) to dopamine (DA) cells.

Studies investigating the recovery of DA brain neurotransmission after METH have shown results that vary from complete recovery to persistent long lasting changes. In rats, a marked reduction in baseline DA levels and amphetamine induced increases in DA release were observed one week after METH administration with recovery to normal values 12 months post treatment.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Significant, though not complete, recovery in DA function after METH administration was reported in a rodent study that showed marked depletions in DA (30% of controls) one week after METH that recovered 7 months post treatment (80% of controls).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Similarly, imaging studies in non-human primates have shown significant recovery of DAT in animals exposed to METH 12&#x02013;15 month post treatment.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Our human positron emission tomography (PET) study showed increased DAT after protracted (12&#x02013;17 months) abstinence.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, one non-human primate study documented striatal DA reductions still evident after 4 years post-METH treatment.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Both preclinical and clinical data provide evidence that METH is toxic to DA cells but that some of the damage may recover with detoxification. However, all of the clinical studies in METH users are based on findings showing decreases structural markers of DA terminals (transporters). In this study we used PET and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride to evaluate changes in extracellular DA in the striatum, which allowed direct assessment of the function of DA cells. PET with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopridehas been used to study the involvement of DA in drug reward and addiction in the human brain.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This includes studies that investigate the relationships between the ability of various drugs to modulate DA and their reinforcing effects, both in non-dependent and drug dependent individuals.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Using [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride, these studies have shown that stimulant drugs (i.e. methylphenidate, amphetamine) increase DA in striatum in the human brain and that these responses are attenuated in drug-addicted subjects (review<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>). In this study PET imaging was performed after placebo and after oral methylphenidate (MPH, 60 mg).

Written informed consent was obtained after the experimental procedure was explained to the subjects. METH abusers (3 female and 13 male, 39.2&#x000b1;4.9 year old) were recruited from HUCLA and PVAMC. METH was the subjects&#x02019; primary drug of abuse via the smoked or intravenous routes with a use frequency of at least 5 times/week and 0.5 g/day. Subjects that met a minimum 12-month history of METH abuse, DSM IV diagnosis for METH dependence, and a minimum 2-week period of detoxification and desired to stop using METH were recruited for the study. The control group (2 female and 13 male, 37.2&#x000b1;4.3 year old) was chosen to match the age range of the METH group. Exclusion criteria for both groups were: Present or past history of neurological or DSM IV Axis I psychiatric disease (apart from METH dependence), past or present history of affective disorder or ADD/ADHD, abuse or dependence of drugs other than METH (excluding nicotine), medical illness that can affect brain function, past or present history of cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, scores on the Hamilton Depression Scale &#x0003e; 15, which may indicate clinical depression. Urine screening tests for psychoactive drugs were performed to corroborate lack of drug use.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Study design</title><p id="P6">Each subject was tested with two [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride scans [once after placebo and once after 60 mg of oral methylphenidate (MPH), which was be given an hour prior to [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride] to measure D2R availability and DA cell function. To avoid the carry over effects of MPH on subsequent scans, the [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET scan was done first after placebo administration, and two hours later after MPH administration. Blood samples were obtained to measure plasma MPH concentration prior to and at 30 and 60 min after MPH. The plasma concentration of MPH was analyzed at Dr. Thomas Cooper's laboratory (Nathan Kline Institute, New York). In addition, cardiovascular response (continuously recording vital signs and EKG) and self-report rating of drug effects (high, anxiety, restlessness, alertness, drug effect) to pharmacological doses of MPH were obtained prior to and at every 5 minutes after placebo and MPH administration.</p><p id="P7">After the scan visits, the METH abusers were followed up in outpatient treatment facilities with random urine screening tests for psychoactive drugs for the 9 months that followed their PET scan study. All enrollees attended the same substance abuse day treatment program weekly. The program consists of an intensive outpatient drug rehabilitation program that includes group and individual therapy and educational group sessions. The program includes early recovery skills and relapse prevention techniques. Family counseling is also available. Anger management and domestic violence awareness and prevention programs are also available at the center for up to 52 weekly sessions. The subjects received behavioral and psychological treatments. The subjects did not receive any medical treatments during the rehabilitation process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PET Scanning</title><p id="P8">The PET scans were carried out on an HR+ Siemens tomograph using the 3-D acquisition mode.

After a transmission image obtained for attenuation correction, scans were started immediately after injection of 5&#x02013;10 mCi of [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride and were carried out for a total of 60 minutes. The following scanning sequences were used: 15 &#x000d7; 1 min.; 3 &#x000d7; 5 min.; 2 &#x000d7; 15 min.

The ROI in dorsal striatum (caudate, putamen), ventral striatum and cerebellum were outlined by superimposing boundaries from a neuroanatomical atlas using a template<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Briefly, the regions of interest were initially outlined on the individual&#x02019;s summed baseline [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride image (images obtained between 15&#x02013;60 min) and were then projected into the dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride images to generate time&#x02013;activity curves for the striatal regions (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum) and cerebellum. These time&#x02013;activity curves for tissue concentration, along with the time&#x02013;activity curves for unchanged tracer in plasma were used to calculate [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride&#x02019;s transfer constant from plasma to brain (K1) and the total tissue distribution volume (V<sub>T</sub>). V<sub>T</sub> corresponds to the equilibrium measurement of the ratio of tissue concentration to plasma concentration in striatum and cerebellum using a graphical analysis technique for reversible systems<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The ratio of V<sub>T</sub> in striatum to that of V<sub>T</sub> in cerebellum corresponds to BP<sub>ND</sub> +1 where BP<sub>ND</sub> is the in vivo binding potential (nondisplaceable). BP<sub>ND</sub> is proportional to the number available binding sites Bavail/Kd.

Plasma MPH concentration after oral administration were compared between the groups using Students&#x02019; t test. The effects of the MPH on the cardiovascular responses and behavioral self-reports were tested by comparing the scores obtained prior to the drug administration (placebo and MPH) and the averaged scores obtained between 70&#x02013;100 min after oral administration using a repeated measures ANOVA. Pearson product moment correlations were used to assess the relationship between the MPH-induced changes in BP<sub>ND</sub> and the behavioral effects of the MPH. Using these statistics, we also tested whether clinical indices as cigarette smoking, years of METH use, amount of METH use and days of last METH use affected placebo or MPH-induced DA release in the abusers and as a function of abstinence vs. relapse.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>D2R image template</title><p id="P11">A spatial normalization template matching the average D2R image contrast in the brain was developed using V<sub>T</sub> images from 34 healthy control subjects.

All images were carefully inspected to ensure whole brain coverage and exclude images with potential artifacts. A 12-parameter affine transformation with 16 nonlinear iterations was used to register the images to the PD.mnc Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template provided with the SPM2 package. The dimensions of bounding box of the output volumes were 90:90, 126:90, and 72:108 along x, y, and z, respectively, and the voxel size was 2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;2 mm<sup>3</sup>.

The V<sub>T</sub> ratio images were included into a repeated measures ANOVA model with two conditions (placebo and MPH) and two groups (METH abuser and control) for the group analyses in SPM2. Corrections for multiple comparisons were performed via the random field theory, an approach that is less conservative than the traditional Bonferroni method. Imaging voxels that were significantly different (p &#x02264; 0.005, minimum cluster size = 100 voxels) between conditions were identified. The statistical significance of condition &#x000d7; group interactions effects in the striatum were corrected for multiple comparisons using small volume corrections with a 10-mm diameter spherical volume in SPM. Only regions with corrected p-values &#x02264; 0.05 at the cluster-level were considered significantly.

The DA increases were not correlated with self-ratings of high, which is consistent with our prior studies showing that MPH-induced DA increases are only associated with the &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; after intravenous but not after oral administration.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The difference between the intravenous and oral administration of MPH with respect to their reinforcing effects most likely reflects the fact that the intravenous route leads to DA changes that are much faster than those observed after oral administration. Thus, the failure of oral MPH to induce a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; is likely due to slower pharmacokinetics (slower brain uptake). This is because the speed with which drugs of abuse enter the brain is a key parameter that affects their reinforcing effects; the faster their brain uptake the more intense their reinforcing effects.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p id="P21">The METH users showed lesser DA increases with MPH administration at early withdrawal than the controls. Since DA increases induced by MPH are dependent on DA release (a function of DA cell firing), it is likely that the difference may reflect decreased dopaminergic cell activity in the METH abusers. While evaluating the results of PET studies based on the competition of [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride by endogenous DA, it is critical to remember that the results merely reflect the fraction of D2R that is vacant and thus capable of binding the tracer. As a consequence, any reduction in D2R measured with this technique could reflect either <italic>decreases</italic> in levels of D2R and/or <italic>increases</italic> in DA release (competing for binding with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride for the D2R availability) in striatum (including nucleus accumbens). The <italic>increases</italic> in DA release could include pre-existing DA that was present prior to MPH administration or a combination of pre-existing DA plus DA that is released following MPH administration. If the presynaptic neuron in a METH abuser releases smaller amounts of DA (but fires at the same rate) the same observation would be seen. Other potential reasons for MPH-induced reductions in [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride binding were decreased DA affinity for the D2R or decreased efficacy of MPH to prevent DA reuptake. However, the fact that the METH abusers and other drug-addicted subjects (i.e. cocaine and alcohol) show blunted reductions in specific binding (indicative of decrease DA release) when administered MPH indicates that these individuals had both a reduction in the levels of D2R as well as a decrease in DA release in striatum.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Each deficiency would contribute to the overall decreased sensitivity in drug-addicted subjects to natural reinforcers.</p><p id="P22">In this study the METH abusers who showed greater DA increases after MPH administration during early withdrawal stayed sober and returned for the follow up visit. In contrast the METH users who showed no DA increases after MPH during early withdrawal relapsed. A similar association was recently reported by a study in cocaine abusers that showed lower baseline striatal D2R availability and MPH-induced DA increases in cocaine abusers who relapsed versus those who did not.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Moreover in a prior study these same investigators had shown a negative correlation between the DA increases induced by amphetamine administration and their choice of cocaine over money; the lower the DA increases the more likely they were to select cocaine over a monetary reinforcer<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Since the study also reported reduced DA increases in cocaine abusers when compared with controls, this could indicate that drug-addicted subjects with the most severe decreases in brain dopaminergic activity are the ones more likely to choose drugs over other reinforcers (such as money). Therefore, the failure of DA depleted METH users to stay sober could occur because these individuals have a greater deficit in their ability to shift their reward directed behavior to natural reinforcers. In this study we found the METH users who relapsed had a blunted DA response to oral MPH in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen). During the development of drug addiction, drug-seeking behavior progresses from seeking the rewarding effects of drugs to being triggered and maintained by drug-associated cues and stressful environments.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Prolonged drug seeking in vulnerable individuals results in habitual compulsive drug using behavior<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and in increased DA release in dorsal striatum triggered by conditioned drug-cues.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In human cocaine abusers increases in DA elicited by cocaine-cues in the dorsal striatum are associated with the degree of drug craving and addiction severity.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The dorsal striatum is also a major site that appears to be involved in relapse after prolonged abstinence from cocaine self-administration.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Greater deficits in dorsal striatal DA transmission in METH abusers might promote habitual drug use and a loss in the ability to stay sober.</p><p id="P23">Limitations for this study are the relatively small sample sizes and even though we found group differences between relapse and control groups, we cannot ascribe a direct relationship between D2R availability and the prediction of relapse. Prospective studies in a larger number of METH abusers are needed to determine the sensitivity of striatal DA measures in predicting relapse vs. abstinence. In this study we excluded METH abusers with any history of an axis I disorder other than METH dependence, which limits the generalization of our findings since co-morbidity in METH abusers is high. Also, most of the METH abusers were cigarette smokers and continued to smoke throughout the study, which might have confounded the comparisons with controls most of whom were non-smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P24">The results revealed lower baseline striatal D2R availability and DA release in METH abusers than controls, which replicates our prior studies. We also show that METH abusers with better DA function during the early withdrawal period were more likely to stay sober at follow up than those with low striatal DA function. This coupled with similar findings in cocaine abusers<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> suggest that poor DA function may be a biomarker that predicts a greater likelihood for relapse and a greater addiction severity. Thus early detection of the extent of DA dysfunction may be helpful in predicting clinical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P25">The PET study was carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
