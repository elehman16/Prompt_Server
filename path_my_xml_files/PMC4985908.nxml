A low-volume (2&#x02005;L) hypertonic polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid solution (PEG-Asc) has been introduced, but its possible dehydration effects have not been quantitatively studied. We compared the efficacy and safety including the dehydration risk between hypertonic PEG-Asc and isotonic PEG regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This was an observer-blinded randomised study. Participants (n=310) were allocated to receive 1 of 3 regimens on the day of colonoscopy: PEG-Asc (1.5&#x02005;L) and water (0.75&#x02005;L) dosed with 1 split (PEG-Asc-S) or 4 splits (PEG-Asc-M), or PEG-electrolyte solution (PEG-ES; 2.25&#x02005;L) dosed with no split. Dehydration was analysed by measuring haematocrit (Ht).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cleansing time using the hypertonic PEG-Asc-S (3.33&#x000b1;0.48&#x02005;hours) was significantly longer than that with isotonic PEG-ES (3.05&#x000b1;0.56&#x02005;hours; p&#x0003c;0.001). PEG-Asc-M (3.00&#x000b1;0.53&#x02005;hours) did not have this same disadvantage. Successful cleansing was achieved in more than 94% of participants using each of the 3 regimens. The percentage changes in Ht from baseline (before dosing) to the end of dosing with PEG-Asc-S (3.53&#x000b1;3.32%) and PEG-Asc-M (4.11&#x000b1;3.07%) were significantly greater than that with PEG-ES (1.31&#x000b1;3.01%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These 3 lower volume regimens were efficacious and had no serious adverse effects. Even patients cleansed with isotonic PEG-ES showed significant physiological dehydration at the end of dosing. The four-split PEG-Asc-M regimen is recommended because of its shorter cleansing time without causing serious nausea.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>UMIN000013103; Results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COLONOSCOPY</kwd><kwd>ENDOSCOPY</kwd><kwd>ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary box</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>A hypertonic low-volume polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid solution (PEG-Asc, 2&#x02005;L) has been introduced to decrease the volume of isotonic polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ES, 4&#x02005;L) that patients are required to drink for bowel preparation before colonoscopy.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>Patients either spent 2&#x02005;days taking the split dose the day before and on the day of procedure, or spent 1&#x02005;day taking the same-day full dose.

A 4&#x02005;L volume of PEG-ES is frequently used but the regimen is a burden to patients because of the long cleansing time and large dose volume. Low-volume regimens which were introduced to reduce the volume that patients must drink are now more frequently used; one of these low-volume regimens is polyethylene glycol-ascorbic acid solution (PEG-Asc; Moviprep).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;10</xref> For example, 2&#x02005;L of PEG-Asc can be taken either divided as 1&#x02005;L on the evening before and 1&#x02005;L on the morning of the procedure (split dosing), or taken as 2&#x02005;L on the day of the procedure (same-day dosing). It is also recommended that patients drink a further 1&#x02005;L of clear liquid to prevent the feelings of thirst and dehydration.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>PEG-Asc contains higher amounts of PEG (1.7-fold) compared with PEG-ES and sodium sulfate (1.3-fold), NaCl, KCl, and ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. PEG, sodium sulfate and excess ascorbic acid are not absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> and exert an osmotic action in the colon that causes increased laxative effects. While the extent of dehydration using hypertonic PEG-Asc has not yet been clarified, it has been suggested that isotonic PEG-ES causes little fluid exchange across the colonic mucosal membrane.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A recent MRI study demonstrated that the intake of PEG-Asc causes distention of the ascending and transverse colons, stimulating colonic motility and resulting in defecation; this prevents the total colon volume increasing beyond an average of 1.2&#x02005;L.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Hence, an intake volume of &#x0003c;2&#x02005;L of PEG-Asc on the day of colonoscopy would be an attractive regimen if it were still efficacious.</p><p>In the present study, we explored the effects of lower volume PEG-Asc same-day regimens using either a four-split dose or a one-split dose on efficacy and safety including dehydration. We used isotonic PEG-ES solution with no-split dose as a control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was conducted in Akita Red Cross Hospital, Akita, Japan from December 2013 to July 2014.

The success rates of bowel preparation with these three regimens were more than 94%. Although there was a tendency for more &#x02018;excellent&#x02019; ratings in the PEG-Asc-S (76%) and PEG-Asc-M (75%) groups than in the PEG-ES group (65%), the distributions of overall cleansing evaluation of excellent, good and poor between three regimens were not significantly different. Compliance was considered to be good because patients did not have to eat a prepacked low-residue diet, take laxative medicines or take a part or full dose of the cleansing regimen on the day before colonoscopy. Fasting on the morning of the colonoscopy was very important. Guidance for patients to follow the exact intake schedule may be another important aspect that resulted in the very high success rates using these lower volume regimens.</p><p>Generally, a shorter time for bowel preparation is preferable because it decreases the burden on patients. The PEG-Asc-S regimen with one-split dosing is recommended in Japan. The time necessary for completion of dosing with hypertonic PEG-Asc-S was significantly longer than that with isotonic PEG-ES. The present new PEG-Asc-M regimen with four-split dosing overcame the inconvenience of the long time required with PEG-Asc-S.</p><p>Another advantage of the four-split dosing is that it appears to have prevented the occurrence of severe nausea. Three patients in the PEG-Asc-S group and two patients in the PEG-ES group had nausea due to fullness of the stomach and therefore discontinued dosing; however, no patient in the PEG-Asc-M group had nausea that resulted in the discontinuation of dosing.</p><p>The extent of dehydration that occurs during bowel cleansing with hypertonic PEG-Asc is supposedly greater than that with isotonic PEG-ES; however, this has so far not been adequately investigated. Furthermore, it has been suggested that isotonic PEG-ES causes little fluid exchange across the colonic mucosal membrane, thereby limiting the potential for systemic electrolyte disturbance.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the present study, the three blood test parameters of Ht, red blood cell and haemoglobin were significantly greater at the end of dosing than at baseline. The mean percentage changes in these three parameters from baseline to the end of dosing in the PEG-Asc-S group and PEG-Asc-M groups were significantly greater than in the PEG-ES group. These changes in Ht reflect physiological dehydration, as no patients showed pathological dehydration-related adverse effects such as cognitive dysfunction.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Cleansings with hypertonic PEG-Asc with one-split and four-split dosing have greater physiological dehydration effects than isotonic PEG-ES. However, even isotonic PEG-ES has physiological dehydration effects during cleansing.</p><p>The Ht changes from baseline to the end of colonoscopy in the PEG-Asc-S, PEG-Asc-M and PEG-ES groups (&#x02212;0.65%, &#x02212;0.54% and &#x02212;2.47%, respectively) indicate that rehydration occurred during colonoscopy. As patients did not have breakfast on the day of colonoscopy, the Ht value at baseline would reflect a slightly dehydrated state. The value of &#x02212;2.47% in the PEG-ES group would reflect the non-dehydrated state at the end of colonoscopy. In other word, patients in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups at the end of colonoscopy were 2% more dehydrated than those in the PEG-ES group. This suggests that patients treated with PEG-Asc should intake additional water after colonoscopy to cope with the physiological dehydration.</p><p>The percentage changes (in absolute values) of blood urea nitrogen from baseline to the end of dosing in the PEG-ES group were significantly greater than that in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups, and the difference between the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups was not significant. The cleansing almost completely evacuates stools from the bowel, which results in a decrease in blood urea nitrogen, possibly with the same degree of decrease in all three groups. Dehydration during the cleansing would increase blood urea nitrogen, with larger increases in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups compared with the PEG-ES group. These defecation and dehydration effects may explain the trend of the percentage changes in blood urea nitrogen at the end of dosing in the three groups.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of lower volume 1.5&#x02005;L PEG-Asc with one-spilt and four-split dosing and 2.25&#x02005;L PEG-ES with no-split dosing resulted in very high success rates in bowel cleansing with no serious adverse effects. The new regimen of 1.5&#x02005;L PEG-Asc with four-split dosing significantly shortened bowel cleansing time compared with one-split dosing. The Ht, red blood cell and haemoglobin values are sensitive dehydration indicators. The physiological dehydration associated with PEG-Asc was significantly greater than that with PEG-ES at the end of dosing and even patients cleansed with isotonic PEG-ES showed significant physiological dehydration at the end of dosing. Patients treated with PEG-Asc are suggested to intake additional water after colonoscopy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Tokiko Itoh, Akita Red Cross Hospital for her assistance with data management and Masafumi Nomura, Center of Gastroenterology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Japan and Hibiki Ohtani, Division of Gastroenterology, Japan Community Health Care Organization, Hitoyoshi Medical Center, Hitoyoshi, Kumamoto, Japan for their evaluation of cleansing scores.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> HY, HM, KY, RT, EH, YT, MN, RH and YY contributed to the study's concept and designs.
