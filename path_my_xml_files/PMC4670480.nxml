The pathogenesis of CD is not well characterised, although environmental, genetic and microbial factors leading to a dysregulated immune response are all thought to play key roles. Elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) may be observed both at disease onset and during times of flare.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Evolving treatment goals for CD include inducing and maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission (also termed &#x02018;deep remission&#x02019;),<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> avoiding prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, improving patient quality of life, and reducing hospitalisations and surgeries.</p><p>The use of agents directed against TNF&#x003b1; has made a significant impact on the management of patients with CD. However, most efficacy data with these agents are limited to that collected during relatively short-term (up to 1 year) clinical trials. Due to the chronic relapsing and progressive nature of CD, clinical trial data over longer durations of treatment (i.e. several years) are desirable to demonstrate both long-term efficacy and safety of these agents.</p><p>Adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF&#x003b1;, has been shown in randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials to be effective for the induction and maintenance of remission and to achieve mucosal healing in patients with moderately to severely active CD.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The Phase III adalimumab maintenance trial CHARM (Crohn's Trial of the Fully Human Antibody Adalimumab for Remission Maintenance) was followed by a long-term, open-label extension, ADHERE (Additional Long-Term Dosing With HUMIRA to Evaluate Sustained Remission and Efficacy in CD), which collected efficacy and safety data for up to 4 years of treatment with adalimumab. Previous reports from ADHERE demonstrated that 2 years of treatment with adalimumab was associated with maintenance of stable rates of clinical remission, fistula healing, decreased hospitalisations and improved patient quality of life.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A later analysis of patients receiving corticosteroids at the start of adalimumab therapy in CHARM demonstrated stable rates of corticosteroid-free remission for up to 3 years.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this current report, we present the extended long-term efficacy (including maintenance of clinical response and remission, fistula healing and corticosteroid-free remission) and safety of adalimumab through 4 years of therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>CHARM and ADHERE trials</title><p>Detailed methods and patient demographics of the CHARM and ADHERE trials have been published previously.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Briefly, CHARM was a 56-week, multicentre, phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active CD. Adult patients with a diagnosis of CD for at least 4 months and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) between 220 and 450 received open-label induction with adalimumab (80 mg at week 0, 40 mg at week 2). Patients enrolled in CHARM could have received previous treatment with another anti-TNF antagonist. CD-related medications were to remain stable during CHARM, with the exception of corticosteroids, which could be tapered at the investigator's discretion beginning at week 8. Patients who experienced a flare after they tapered their dosages of steroids could have their corticosteroid dosages increased to the dosage prior to the start of the taper. Adjustments (increases or decreases) in other CD-related concomitant treatments, including initiation of a treatment a patient was not taking previously, were allowed in ADHERE following at least 3 months of open-label adalimumab exposure. At week 4, patients were randomised to receive placebo, either 40 mg adalimumab weekly or 40 mg every other week. After week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare or nonresponse could move to open-label treatment with 40 mg every other week, and then to 40 mg weekly for continued flare or nonresponse. At the end of CHARM, patients could enter the open-label extension ADHERE trial. Enrolment in ADHERE was conducted on a rolling basis as subjects completed CHARM, so the duration of participation in ADHERE varied. Patients still on blinded therapy at the end of CHARM received adalimumab 40 mg every other week upon entry to ADHERE. Patients on open-label adalimumab every other week or weekly continued on the same regimen. During ADHERE, patients on every other week adalimumab could move to weekly dosing for disease flare or for nonresponse. Termination of the ADHERE study occurred at each study site upon country and local (if applicable) regulatory and reimbursement approval of adalimumab for CD, and opening of the adalimumab long-term registry (PYRAMID) for enrolment. All sites were terminated in December 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The long-term effect of adalimumab treatment (CDAI over time, clinical remission and clinical response through week 212 of adalimumab treatment) was assessed in the all-adalimumab mITT population from CHARM, which consisted of patients who achieved at least a 70 point reduction in CDAI from baseline with open-label induction therapy and were randomised to any adalimumab every other week or weekly (randomised responders; <italic>n</italic> = 329). Patients who responded to open-label induction therapy who were randomised to 40 mg every other week (<italic>n</italic> = 172) were also analysed separately. Efficacy endpoints evaluated in CHARM and ADHERE (which initiated study enrolment in 2003) were primarily based on CDAI (i.e. clinical remission or clinical response). Reflective of the standard of care for CD at the time, mucosal healing was not assessed in either study. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI &#x0003c;150, whereas clinical response was defined as a decrease in CDAI of &#x02265;100 points from baseline (CR-100). Maintenance of clinical remission and clinical response beyond 1 year was assessed in patients who enrolled in ADHERE and who were in clinical remission (<italic>n</italic> = 145) or CR-100 (<italic>n</italic> = 172) at week 56 of CHARM. Fistula healing (defined as complete healing of draining fistulae, assessed using gentle compression during physical examination) through 4 years was assessed for all adalimumab-randomised patients (regardless of response to induction therapy) with fistula(e) at the baseline of CHARM (<italic>n</italic> = 70). Corticosteroid-free remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150 without concomitant corticosteroids) was assessed in randomised responders regardless of baseline corticosteroid use (<italic>n</italic> = 329) and also for randomised patients taking corticosteroids at the baseline of CHARM, regardless of response to induction therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 206). Maintenance of corticosteroid-free remission beyond 1 year was determined for two groups of patients who were in corticosteroid-free remission at week 56 of CHARM: randomised responders (<italic>n</italic> = 147) and all randomised patients who used corticosteroids at CHARM baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 53). Initiation of corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (defined as azathioprine, 6-mercatopurine or methotrexate) in the randomised responder population (<italic>n</italic> = 329) was also analysed throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical assessment</title><p>CDAI was collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, followed by every 4 weeks through week 56 of CHARM<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and at 12-week intervals during ADHERE.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Adverse events were recorded for any patient receiving at least one dose of adalimumab (<italic>n</italic> = 854) (including open-label induction therapy in CHARM) through 4 years of treatment (or up to 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab, if treatment was prematurely discontinued) to assess long-term safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The CDAI over time was analysed using a nonlinear model using four-parameter log-logistic function. Categorical endpoints were analysed using three methods, as-observed, last observation carried forward (LOCF) and a hybrid nonresponder imputation (hNRI). The time patients spent in ADHERE varied because of the rolling enrolment from CHARM, different timing of study site closure and movement of patients to commercial drug. As not all patients who completed CHARM participated in the study for the full 4 years, NRI was used to analyse results for the all-adalimumab mITT population through year 3, whereby patients with missing data (for any reason, including study termination) were assumed not to have achieved the endpoint. After year 3, missing data for patients who were documented to have moved to commercial adalimumab were analysed using the LOCF method, and patients with data missing for any other reason were assumed to not have efficacy. An additional analysis of clinical remission was conducted on the patients randomised to adalimumab every other week using three imputation methods: one as described above; one using the same imputation rules, except that patients who received dose escalation were also assumed to not have achieved remission from that point forward; and an as-observed analysis for patients who remained on every other week dosing throughout the study. NRI was used to assess corticosteroid-free remission through year 4 and maintenance of corticosteroid-free remission from week 56 of CHARM. LOCF was not used to analyse corticosteroid-free remission because it was possible for subjects to initiate corticosteroids between study visits when remission was assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient disposition</title><p>Detailed patient demographics from CHARM and disposition data from CHARM and ADHERE have been reported previously<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Briefly, patients were representative of patients with long-standing moderately to severely active CD, with a mean baseline CDAI of 313.

The safety database of 854 patients comprised 1669.7 patient-years of exposure to adalimumab. The exposure-adjusted rates of all categories of adverse events were consistent with the 2-year exposure report.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The most common category of adverse events was infection. Abdominal and anal abscess were the most common serious infections reported, with incidence rates of 0.7 and 1.0 events/100PY respectively. Almost all opportunistic infections were candidiasis, with oral candidiasis occurring most frequently (0.9 events/100PY), and no new cases of tuberculosis were observed since the 2-year report. After 4 years of adalimumab treatment, the rate of demyelinating disease was 0.2 events/100PY, with no new events reported since the 2-year exposure report. No events of heart failure were observed. There were 53 liver-related AEs reported, the majority (<italic>n</italic> = 48) of which were abnormalities or increases in liver function tests. No cases of hepatic failure were observed. The overall incidence rate through year 4 of any malignancy was low and remained stable since the 2-year exposure report (1.6 events/100PY).

Long-term maintenance of clinical remission (including corticosteroid-free remission) and response was achieved in clinically meaningful proportions of adalimumab-treated patients with CD. In addition, for patients presenting with draining fistulas or those using corticosteroids at baseline of the CHARM trial, long-term fistula healing and corticosteroid-free remission were maintained through 4 years of treatment. Taken together, these results underscore the long-term efficacy of adalimumab maintenance therapy.</p><p>One important observation is that three different analysis methods, as-observed, LOCF and the more stringent hybrid NRI, were used to measure various categorical endpoints, with each analysis method producing distinct results. Larger differences between LOCF and hNRI were observed at later time points. The lower percentages observed with hNRI analysis at later time points can be explained by classifying those patients who left the study for any reason (except those who were documented to move from study drug to commercially available adalimumab after week 156 of follow-up) as nonresponders. However, as noted in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>, it is important to mention that not all of these patients left the trial due to loss of response to adalimumab. The true estimate of potential efficacy at each time point is likely to lie somewhere between the values determined by the least conservative (as-observed) and the most conservative (hNRI) analyses.</p><p>Maintenance of remission was also evident in the subset of patients randomised to the approved 40 mg every other week maintenance dose of adalimumab, with slightly higher rates of remission observed when patients who escalated to weekly dosing were included in the analysis. This finding is consistent with a previously published report from CHARM that showed that patients who dose escalated were able to regain efficacy.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recently published analysis from CHARM suggested that weekly dosing may be associated with greater efficacy than every other week dosing in patients with elevated CRP who have lost response to treatment with a prior anti-TNF agent.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In addition to efficacy, it is important to examine safety of prolonged anti-TNF therapy to provide clinicians with information to aid determination of the benefits and risks of this strategy. Adverse events of special interest with TNF antagonist therapy include serious infections and malignancies.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The most commonly reported adverse event category over 4 years of adalimumab exposure was infections. The incidence rates of any infections, opportunistic infections and serious infections were stable over time. Similarly, the incidence rate of any malignancies remained low and was stable over time, suggesting no cumulative risk associated with ongoing adalimumab exposure. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with adalimumab for CD did not reveal any new safety signals. The overall safety data for 4 years of adalimumab therapy for CD were consistent with long-term safety data representing nearly 12 years of adalimumab exposure across multiple indications.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Patient selection for biological therapy is an important consideration to gain the greatest benefit of therapy over a prolonged duration of time. The LOCF analysis found that 80% of patients who achieved remission with adalimumab therapy at 1 year continued to be in remission over the next 3 years. A previous analysis found that patients with disease duration of less than 2 years had the greatest likelihood of achieving remission at 1 year in CHARM and the higher rate of remission persisted through the 3 years of data evaluated.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These patients also had a trend towards fewer adverse events. Additional factors associated with a greater likelihood of remission included elevated CRP at baseline and no prior treatment with an anti-TNF agent. Selection of patients with short disease duration and evidence of active inflammation for adalimumab treatment would likely lead to greater rates of long-term efficacy than those reported here.</p><p>The length of time that a clinician should continue maintenance therapy with TNF antagonists for patients with CD remains a key point of discussion. Although data from the STORI trial<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> suggested that infliximab withdrawal was successful in approximately half of patients with CD in stable remission, given the progressive and lifelong nature of CD, physicians should carefully consider the risks and benefits of different approaches in the long-term use of biologics. It is possible that patients in deep remission are at lower risk of future relapse.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Long-term treatment strategies, including withdrawal of either an anti-TNF agent or concomitant immunomodulator therapy, need further evaluation.</p><p>The long-term follow-up of this study provides beneficial information about remission and response rates over time. However, a few limitations of the study exist. First, the analysis of the long-term efficacy of adalimumab was complicated by the varying duration of follow-up, with not all patients reaching the week 212 visit due to study termination. We attempted to overcome this by analysing the data using different imputation methods for missing data. A second limitation of this long-term efficacy study is that assessment of mucosal appearance was not collected in CHARM and ADHERE. With the increasing interest in the concept of mucosal healing, data regarding the long-term efficacy of adalimumab on mucosal healing or disease progression using a digestive damage score (such as the recently developed Lemann score)<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> are of interest, but could not be analysed using this data set as endoscopic or radiographic imaging data were not collected in CHARM and ADHERE. Finally, there is increasing interest in the correlation of serum drug levels of anti-TNF agents and antibodies against these agents and efficacy, but samples for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters were not collected during CHARM or ADHERE.</p><p>In summary, these data suggest a substantial clinical benefit with long-term adalimumab therapy for patients with moderately to severely active CD. The rates of adverse events were stable with long-term treatment up to 4 years.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><italic>Declaration of personal interests</italic>: R Panaccione has received consultant and/or lecture fees from AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Axcan Pharma (now Aptalis), Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Centocor, ChemoCentryx, Eisai Medical Research Inc, Elan Pharmaceuticals, Ferring, Genetech, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.
