It has been postulated that the response to thrombolytic therapy may therefore be different among stroke patients with intra-arterial obstructions of differing x-ray attenuations. A few cohort studies have suggested that measurement of intra-arterial x-ray attenuation at the location of an obstruction on baseline non-contrast CT may help to predict recanalization following treatment with intravenous thrombolysis in stroke [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There has, however, been very little assessment of whether the improved rate of recanalization translates to an improvement in functional outcome following stroke [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To our knowledge, the importance of x-ray attenuation of arterial obstructions for predicting outcome has never been assessed in a randomized-controlled trial testing intravenous thrombolysis.</p><p>The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) was a large multi-center, randomized-controlled trial which tested intravenous thrombolysis (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) given within 6 hours of ischemic stroke [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Baseline and follow-up brain imaging was performed for all IST-3 patients. In some centers, CT or MR angiography was also routinely obtained pre-randomization [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In this post-hoc subgroup exploration of IST-3 trial data we wished to investigate, in patients with ischemic stroke and an angiographically-proven intra-arterial obstruction at baseline, whether the x-ray attenuation of the obstruction is predictive of six-month functional outcome. We also aimed to measure short-term changes in the attenuation of arterial obstruction following treatment with intravenous rt-PA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>The Third International Stroke Trial</title><p>IST-3 was an international, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial of intravenous rt-PA in ischemic stroke. Ethical approval for IST-3 was granted by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committees, Scotland (MREC/99/0/78) and by local ethics committees. Research was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient enrolment, data collection, image analysis and adherence to CONSORT recommendations have been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, patients with acute stroke of any severity, with no upper age limit, were eligible for inclusion in the trial if intravenous rt-PA (alteplase) could be started within 6 hours of stroke onset and CT/MR imaging had excluded both intracranial hemorrhage and any structural stroke mimic. Written informed consent was obtained for all patients. Stroke severity prior to randomization was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Clinical stroke syndrome at baseline was assessed with the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project (OCSP) classification [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After entry of baseline data, patients were randomized to receive intravenous rt-PA (0.9mg/Kg) or control. Patients were followed by postal questionnaire or telephone interview at six-months and functional status assessed with the Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS).

There was no pre-defined requirement for thin-slice sections and all acquired data including spiral volumes were accepted. CT or MR angiography (CTA and MRA, respectively) were also collected if available; the published protocol for the IST-3 angiography substudy specified minimum acquisition standards [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Only IST-3 patients who had CTA or MRA performed within 2 hours of baseline non-contrast CT are included in this present analysis. We recorded time from stroke onset to baseline scan. Follow-up non-contrast CT imaging was also performed for all patients at 24&#x02013;48 hours; follow-up delay was also recorded. Follow-up angiography was not mandatory in the IST-3 angiography substudy [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Image analysis</title><p>A single neuroradiologist independently evaluated all baseline angiography in IST-3, blind to treatment allocation, clinical details and outcome, to identify patients for subgroup analysis, i.e. those with a filling defect on angiography that could be assessed on the corresponding non-contrast CT. Previous IST-3 scan reading panel assessments were not used for this report. Image analysis was also performed blind to any subsequent imaging or other scan reads. Image evaluation was performed using standard DICOM software (Digital Jacket, DesAcc, Bellevue, WA, USA). Results were entered into a database using a pre-validated structured proforma (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bric.ed.ac.uk/research/imageanalysis.html">http://www.bric.ed.ac.uk/research/imageanalysis.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Angiography was assessed using the IST-3 angiography score [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: 0 = occluded, 1 = minimal patency (some contrast penetrates obstruction but none or only a minimal amount enters distal artery), 2 = patency &#x0003c;50% of the lumen at the point of obstruction and a) only partly filling (&#x0003c;half) or b) incomplete filling (but &#x0003e;half) of the major branches of the affected artery, 3 = patency &#x0003e;50% of the lumen and filling of most of the branches of the affected artery, 4 = normal. We have previously demonstrated inter- and intra-observer reliability for the IST-3 angiography score in the assessment of CTA; inter-observer agreement was substantial for both (Krippendorff&#x02019;s Alpha = 0.66 and 0.63, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We stratified angiographic obstruction by the three largest intracranial arterial segments involved: internal carotid artery (ICA), main stem of middle cerebral artery (MCA), sylvian branch of MCA, anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), vertebral artery (VA) and the basilar artery (BA). To assess the extent of ischemia on baseline non-contrast CT we calculated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) for all patients [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Intra-arterial x-ray attenuation was measured on the non-contrast CT with reference to the concurrent abnormal CTA/MRA. Simultaneous parallel viewing of the non-contrast CT and the CTA/MRA allowed for attenuation measures (Hounsfield Units, HU) to be taken from within the same location on non-contrast CT that corresponded with the filling defect on angiography (i.e. the obstruction). Patients were excluded from the study if the obstruction was insufficient to allow for attenuation measures to be performed (i.e. minor stenosis without a discrete measurable filling defect). In addition to analysing the obstruction, we also obtained attenuation measures within the equivalent contralateral normal artery if possible (for example, the opposite MCA at an equivalent location) and also within the basilar artery. We therefore measured intra-arterial attenuation at three intra-cranial locations for most patients (one obstructed artery and two normal controls). At each location, three separate elliptical regions of interest were applied by hand, to include as much of the intra-vascular area as possible but taking care not to include the arterial wall or any surrounding tissue; a mean attenuation value of the three readings was later calculated. Attenuation measurements were performed following x2 magnification of images (<xref rid="pone.0145683.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The subjective appearance of arterial obstruction on baseline non-contrast CT was also noted as either isoattenuating to normal vessels or hyperattenuating (if obstruction appeared brighter than adjacent or equivalent contralateral arteries but non-calcified [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). We measured the length of hyperattenuated arterial obstructions on non-contrast CT. We calculated HU ratios for each patient to assess attenuation of the obstruction in relation to normal background intra-arterial attenuation as: mean obstruction HU &#x000f7; mean normal vessel HU. We repeated obstruction attenuation measurements, in the same location, on follow-up non-contrast CT. We calculated change in attenuation of the obstruction between the two scans.</p><fig id="pone.0145683.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145683.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Intra-arterial HU measurement technique.</title><p>For each intra-arterial measurement location (level of obstruction, contralateral normal vessel, basilar artery), 3 elliptical regions of interest were applied by hand on a magnified image.

Since age, baseline stroke severity and time to treatment are such powerful predictors of outcome after ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis, it is perhaps not surprising that we have been unable to show that measuring the attenuation of arterial obstruction adds predictive value for decisions about intravenous rt-PA treatment.</p><p>The value of measuring arterial obstruction attenuation on CT to select patients for treatment is conflicting. Two non-randomized studies (both around 100 patients) found no association between the attenuation of arterial obstruction and outcome after thrombolysis [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Three smaller cohort studies have however demonstrated with highly consistent results that intravenous thrombolysis more often resulted in successful arterial recanalization in patients with highly attenuating obstructions at baseline. Puig et. al. (n = 45) demonstrated a mean relative HU (equivalent to mean HU ratio in our study) of 1.57 for patients achieving recanalization versus 1.11 for those without recanalization (p&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, Moftakhar et. al. (n = 90) demonstrated a mean relative HU of 1.58 in patients that recanalized versus 1.39 in those that did not (p = 0.01) [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Finally, Niesten et. al. (n = 88) demonstrated a mean relative HU of 1.54 in patients that recanalized versus 1.29 in those that did not (p&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We unable to assess recanalization following treatment with intravenous rt-PA as follow-up angiography was not mandatory in IST-3. The apparent discrepancy between our results and these three cohort studies may indicate that success of recanalization therapy is not the only predictor of outcome. Indeed the literature assessing relationships between the attenuation of obstruction and success of endovascular thrombus retrieval, has demonstrated that while recanalization is more likely with hyperattenuating obstructions, where reported, this does not translate to a proportionally improved functional outcome [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, some authors have identified significant differences in arterial obstruction attenuation when stroke cohorts are stratified by etiological stroke subtype. For example, cardioembolic thrombus may be more attenuating than atherothrombotic thrombus [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but such results have not always been replicated [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and a large retrospective analysis of over 8000 patients failed to demonstrate an independent association between hyperattenuating thrombus and stroke etiology [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We similarly did not find any association in IST-3 between clinical stroke subtype (which may vary with differing underlying etiologies [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) or the presence of atrial fibrillation and the attenuation of arterial obstruction.</p><p>Our secondary analysis assessing the change in attenuation of arterial obstruction from baseline to short-term follow-up CT is consistent with the hypothesis that the HU of obstruction may reduce more rapidly in patients given intravenous rt-PA than controls; however, the observed difference in attenuation was non-significant. This result is also consistent with IST-3 data showing that intravenous thrombolysis accelerates the removal of the hyperattenuating artery sign (evident at baseline in over 700 patients), a recognised surrogate for intra-arterial thrombus [<xref rid="pone.0145683.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Our study has limitations. In a large pragmatic multicenter trial like IST-3 there is inevitably some variability in scan parameters and protocols but, nevertheless, the study design closely represents normal working practice. We cannot however exclude the possibility that x-ray attenuation of arterial obstructions was under-estimated due to partial volume effects of thick CT slices for some patients. Similarly, partial volume effects may have reduced the accuracy of attenuation measurements in some cases. IST-3 angiography was performed only in some centers and may therefore be biased toward patients for whom it could convey the greatest perceived benefit. Though our total patient numbers for this assessment are similar to previous work, our analyses are underpowered. But as a randomized-controlled trial, IST-3 provides an unbiased assessment of the relationships between the use of intravenous rt-PA and functional outcome and our estimate of the rt-PA effect on outcome in this subgroup is not substantially different from that reported in the full IST-3 trial.
