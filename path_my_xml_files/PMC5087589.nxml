The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of small-group learning models in teaching fundamental EBM skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention consisted of an EBM bootcamp divided into four 2-hour sessions across 4-week rotations. Residents worked in small groups of three to four to explore fundamentals of EBM through interactive dialogue and mock clinical scenario practice.

In the three academic years between 2013 and 2015, 40 incoming interns participated in the educational intervention. The workshop series, referred to as &#x0201c;EBM bootcamp&#x0201d;, was integrated into the Introduction to Family Medicine rotation, held each year during the interns&#x02019; first month in residency.</p><sec><title>The workshop</title><p>EBM bootcamp was divided into four 2-hour sessions spread across the 4-week rotation. Residents worked in small groups of three to four to explore the fundamentals of EBM through interactive dialogue and mock clinical scenario practice. The overarching educational goal of the training was to identify clinically relevant questions and then formulate evidence-based answers. At the end of the training, learners were expected to be able to: 1) ask clinically relevant answerable questions, 2) find the evidence by searching the medical literature, 3) assess the quality of the evidence, 4) summarize medical articles, and 5) synthesize a conclusion to present an evidence-based answer. Details of training objectives and activities will be provided by the authors upon request. The principal investigator, who was also the instructor in the workshop, completed the grading of the learners&#x02019; assessments. The Indiana University Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved this study which was exempted from participant consent as the study reports on educational activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness was evaluated using pre- and post-assessments. At the start of the workshop, participants reported their prior experiences with EBM in medical school, their evidence-based resource use in clinical practice, their literature-reading habits, and their prior experience presenting in journal clubs or similar activities.</p><p>Assessments included both subjective and objective components. Interns completed a pre-test self-assessment and an EBM skills test at the start of the workshop series and again 4 weeks after completing the workshop. The self-assessment tool explored three primary domains of EBM: 1) formulating clinical questions, 2) searching the literature, and 3) identifying appropriate study designs. On the EBM skills test, the residents were presented with a clinical scenario and were asked to formulate a question, identify and summarize an article that addresses the question, and finally, explain their choice of best study design. Attitudes toward EBM were also assessed before and after the workshop. Besides this intervention, no further EBM training was taught between the completion of the course and the post test. The study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the university&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board. The assessment tools, adapted from the original Fresno test,<xref rid="b20-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> are available in Supplementary materials. Supplementary materials contain the rubric used to evaluate resident responses. We adapted the Fresno test since some of the skills assessed by the original test (such as validity, significance, etc) were beyond the objectives of this training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Performance on the EBM exercise was analyzed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare each item before and after the training. Self-efficacy for using patient, intervention, comparison, and outcomes,<xref rid="b22-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> identifying resources, and summarizing articles were evaluated on Likert scales. A self-efficacy score was generated from the summation of the Likert scale ratings for these three items. We used Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare before and after scores.</p><p>We used regression analysis to examine the correlation between the self-assessment and EBM tests scores (dependent variables) and the residents&#x02019; characteristics, prior experiences, and baseline attitudinal indicators (independent variables). In addition, we used regression analysis to explain the improvement of scores using multiple models. We used a <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 as a cutoff to determine statistical significance. STATA 14 was used for the quantitative analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 40 residents out of a potential 43 (93.0%) participated in the EBM bootcamps over the 3 years of the study. The three interns excluded from the study started residency 2&#x02013;3 months late and thus could not participate in the training. The final analysis included all residents except in the case of the post-workshop assessment, for which two tests were lost. The baseline characteristics of the participants, the self-assessment scores, and the EBM skills test scores are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-amep-7-611">Table 1</xref>. When examining predictors of baseline performance, the practice of reviewing journals weekly was significantly associated with the EBM test score (<italic>P</italic>=0.02).</p><sec><title>Individual self-efficacy</title><p>There was a significant improvement of 3.28 points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in the average self-assessed EBM skills score (from 9.66 to 12.95, out of a maximum score of 15). Improvement in the self-assessment score was inversely correlated with baseline self-assessment: the lower the baseline scores, the higher the improvement (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-amep-7-611">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>EBM skills assessment</title><p>There was a significant improvement of 1.68 points (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in the average EBM skills test score (from 6.02 to 7.71, out of a maximum score of 9). Similar to the self-assessment scores, improvement on the EBM skills test was inversely correlated with baseline scores (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-amep-7-611">Figure 2</xref>). There was no correlation between subjective and objective score improvement (<italic>r</italic>=0.06, <italic>P</italic>=0.73).</p></sec><sec><title>Attitude toward EBM</title><p>All residents (100%) agreed or strongly agreed that EBM is important for a physician&#x02019;s clinical practice. This view did not change after the training.</p></sec><sec><title>Resident evaluation of the workshop</title><p>The vast majority of residents (97.37%) agreed or strongly agreed that the EBM bootcamp was helpful in improving their EBM skills. Similarly, a majority of residents (86.84%) agreed or strongly agreed that the workshop series should always be a component of the orientation. The majority of residents (84.21%) said they would most likely use the skills learned during the series in their daily practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The small-group EBM workshop yielded improvements in both EBM test scores and perception of skills. The workshop was highly acceptable to the residents. Residents with the lowest initial scores appeared to gain the most benefit from the intervention. The fact that poor initial performers on both tests improved more than their peers suggests that this brief intervention may help get everyone &#x0201c;up to speed&#x0201d; with EBM skills at the start of residency.</p><p>Our study is consistent with previous research examining the impact of focused training on EBM skills and knowledge.<xref rid="b4-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b23-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For example, Dinkevich et al found a marked improvement in pediatrics interns&#x02019; EBM skills after 3 or 4 weekly seminars.<xref rid="b23-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In their literature review, Hecht et al documented the effectiveness of various methods for learning EBM such as journal clubs, conferences, workshops, and courses.<xref rid="b5-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, many such studies are undermined by significant potential bias.<xref rid="b4-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> While our study does not compare different approaches, it is unique in documenting the effectiveness of one important learning method. The SGL model employed in this workshop series has many advantages for residents beyond the mastery of EBM basic skills. SGL facilitates working in teams, an essential skill for today&#x02019;s residents and practicing physicians.<xref rid="b19-amep-7-611" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Although our study was conducted at a single center and may thus not be generalizable to all other settings, including all the residents of three cohorts lend substance to the conclusion. Our study used a pre-and post-design, which does not provide strong evidence for causal inference between the intervention and the outcomes. However, the short period of time (4 weeks only) between the pre- and post-assessments and the absence of any other exposure to EBM concepts during this time support the validity of the findings. Future studies should use a multi-center experimental design to compare small-group learning to more commonly used methods such as didactic teaching to determine the best option in EBM education.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A small-group workshop yields improvements in skills and self-efficacy in EBM for starting residents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work would not have been possible without funding from the IU Health Value Grant (VFE-319).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-amep-7-611"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Rohwer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Volmink</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What are the effects of teaching evidence-based health care (EBHC)?
