A multilayer extended-release bead methylphenidate capsule (provisional name Aptensio XR&#x02122;, MPH-MLR) with unique release properties is being investigated for the treatment of ADHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy (primary) and safety and tolerability (secondary) of MPH-MLR compared with placebo in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years with ADHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a parallel, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, forced-dose, phase III study in which patients were randomized to placebo or MPH-MLR 10, 15, 20, or 40&#x000a0;mg given once daily. There were four study phases: (1) 4-week screening/baseline; (2) 1-week, double-blind treatment (DBP); (3) 11-week, open-label, dose-optimization period; and (4) 30-day follow-up call. During the open-label dose-optimization period all patients started with MPH-MLR 10&#x000a0;mg, unless the investigator deemed it necessary to begin at a higher dose, and were titrated to an optimized dose (10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60&#x000a0;mg; all given once daily) based on response and adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of DBP in ADHD Rating Scale, 4th Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) total score. Secondary endpoints included changes in ADHD-RS-IV subscales and Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Improvement Scale (CGI-I) at the end of the DBP. The primary analysis was an analysis of covariance including terms for treatment, site, and baseline ADHD-RS-IV total score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 221 patients completed the DBP. The primary endpoint had a statistically significant difference among treatments (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0046) and sites (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0018), and baseline covariate made a significant contribution (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). As the MPH-MLR dose increased, the ADHD-RS-IV total score improved; the 20 and 40&#x000a0;mg doses were statistically different (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0145 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0011, respectively) from placebo. Females responded differently than did males (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0238); there was a significant difference among treatments for males but not for females, partly because only one-third of subjects were female and partly because some females who received placebo had considerable improvement during the DBP. Similarly, the ADHD-RS-IV subscales and CGI-I scores at the end of the DBP also showed more improvement as the dose of MPH-MLR increased. During the open-label phase, ADHD-RS-IV total scores improved (mean change from baseline &#x02212;22.5) and correlated as the dose of MPH-MLR increased; CGI-I scores also improved. No unexpected AEs were noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dose-related improvements in ADHD-RS-IV scores that exceeded those of placebo were observed in patients treated with MPH-MLR.

The practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends medication, including psychostimulants, for the management of ADHD in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a psychostimulant medication that is used extensively for the management of ADHD in children and adolescents. Many formulations of MPH are available to address the unique needs of this population.</p><p>Available extended-release (ER) formulations of MPH provide different portions of the total dose as the immediate-release (IR) component (20, 22, 30, and 50&#x000a0;%), as well as different durations of action, allowing the prescriber to tailor therapy to individual needs and responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Inter- and intra-patient variabilities have been described with these agents and contribute to the need for MPH dose titration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Response to treatment for ADHD is individualized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; thus, new formulations of MPH continue to be investigated.</p><p>A novel ER formulation that incorporates multilayer beads comprising 37&#x000a0;% of the labeled dose as IR MPH into ER capsules (MPH-MLR; Aptensio XR&#x02122;)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> has been developed. Once-daily MPH-MLR is administered orally as intact capsules or the capsule can be opened and sprinkled on food, such as applesauce. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that following once-daily MPH-MLR administration, a biphasic release profile of MPH is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The initial maximum (peak) concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) occurs approximately 2&#x000a0;h post-dose. A moderate decline in MPH concentration occurs until approximately 5&#x000a0;h after dose administration and then a second <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> occurs at about hour 7. Overall, MPH-MLR produced a better fluctuation index (less variability) than IR MPH (Ritalin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA) administered three times daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Intra-subject coefficients of variation were slightly higher (44&#x02013;136&#x000a0;%) for MPH-MLR during the first 2&#x000a0;h post-dose in the absorption phase compared with the IR product (20&#x02013;112&#x000a0;%) on day 1 of a 4-day steady-state pharmacokinetic study, but were quite similar after reaching <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and demonstrably tighter through day 4 for MPH-MLR (28&#x02013;56&#x000a0;%) compared with the IR reference comparator (26&#x02013;108&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Clinical benefit of MPH-MLR, measured in children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years in a laboratory classroom setting, was evident from at least hour 1 (first assessment point) through to the hour 12 final study assessment point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>To better understand the potential application of MPH-MLR in the outpatient setting, the pharmacokinetic profile of MPH-MLR must be linked with clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of MPH-MLR compared with placebo in the clinic setting as measured by the clinician-administered ADHD Rating Scale, 4th Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years with ADHD.

Each symptom is rated on a scale of 0&#x02013;3: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;never or rarely; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;sometimes; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;often; and 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;very often. A total score is calculated from a sum of individual scores with total score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 54 (maximal impairment). Scoring can also be broken into subcategories of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. During the double-blind and open-label phases, clinician raters were instructed to do their best to perform ratings on the same children and adolescents.</p><p>The CGI is a clinician-administered tool used to assess the symptoms of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The tool provides a scoring of initial severity on the CGI&#x02013;Severity Scale (CGI-S) from 1 to 7; subsequent improvements over time during treatment are rated using the CGI-I. Scoring for the CGI-S is as follows: 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal, not ill at all; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;borderline ill; 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mildly ill; 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderately ill; 5&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;markedly ill; 6&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severely ill; and 7&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;among the most extremely ill patients.

The same model was applied to the ITT population as a sensitivity analysis. Subjects not completing the double-blind phase had the decrease in total score set to zero for the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy analysis was a follow-up to the primary analysis using the efficacy population, and each MPH-MLR dose level was compared to placebo using Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparison to control procedure with the family-wise type I error (two-sided) rate set at 0.05. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the ITT population. Secondary analyses analyzed the ADHD-RS-IV subscales and CGI-I during the double-blind phase using the efficacy population.

The two highest MPH-MLR doses yielded significant improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV total score and CGI-I compared with placebo. Although the two lower MPH-MLR doses did not show improvement that was significantly different from placebo, the five treatments descriptively indicated more improvement with higher MPH-MLR doses. The study was not powered to demonstrate a significant difference from placebo for every MPH-MLR treatment group. The finding that the two lowest-dose groups were not significantly different from placebo during the double-blind phase may reflect that only 3.5&#x000a0;% of patients had dose levels of 10 or 15&#x000a0;mg at the end of the open-label (dose-optimization) phase.</p><p>MPH-MLR composition (37&#x000a0;% immediate release) in a 10 or 15&#x000a0;mg tablet would result in 3.7 or 5.55&#x000a0;mg of MPH being immediately available, respectively. Treatment improvement in all patients with ADHD would not be expected at these doses. Rather, lower doses are important for dose optimization in the naturalistic clinic setting to permit slow titration to efficacy; this is particularly important for treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and younger patients. The randomization forced-dose schedule used in this study did not account for age or previous medication use.</p><p>It is difficult to directly compare ER formulations of MPH across independent clinical research studies as study designs and outcome measures vary. However, evaluations of other ER MPH formulations using the ADHD-RS-IV have reported improvements similar to those observed in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study of MPH-MLR, when each patient&#x02019;s dose was optimized, the mean ADHD-RS-IV total score was 13.5 for a decrease of 22.5 from baseline. Similarly, at the end of the open-label period of a randomized controlled study using MPH ER oral suspension (MEROS) in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years, those patients receiving MEROS had improved from a mean (SD) of 39.3 (7.6) at baseline to 12.6 (6.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a phase III study of MPH transdermal system (MTS), ADHD-RS-IV was assessed in children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Significant improvements in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were reported for children randomized to MTS as well as to the active comparator [osmotic-release oral system (OROS)] compared with placebo over the 7-week study period. ADHD-RS-IV scores improved from 43.0, 43.9, and 41.9 to 18.18, 12.8, and 32.1 for MTS, OROS, and placebo, respectively.</p><p>We found improvements in ADHD-RS-IV and CGI-I appeared to be dose-related, although the 10 and 15&#x000a0;mg doses did not achieve statistical significance during the 1-week double-blind phase. Further statistical analysis did not identify a relationship between the optimal dose at the end of the open-label period and body weight. However, a separate analysis using a population pharmacokinetic model including data from this study showed a correlation between body weight [ranging from 20 to 80&#x000a0;pounds (9&#x02013;36&#x000a0;kg)] and change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although additional studies are needed to investigate this relationship, this information may be useful to clinicians who are initiating therapy with MPH-MLR.</p><p>One treatment goal of pharmacotherapy for ADHD is to provide children and adolescents with the ability to function more effectively. Since school is one of the key settings for this age group, functionality in children and adolescents with ADHD has often been evaluated in the laboratory school setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. MPH-MLR was evaluated in this setting in a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study that included 20 children aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Once-daily administration of MPH-MLR resulted in significant decrease in Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0001) compared with placebo, suggesting that symptoms of ADHD in the studied children improved with treatment. The current study conducted in a less-structured clinic setting adds to these previously published data.</p><p>When administered once daily, MPH-MLR was safe and well-tolerated during the fixed-dose, double-blind phase. Overall, there were no new or unexpected safety signals identified in the study and reported AEs are consistent with the known AE profile of MPH. While there are many psychostimulants available on the market, the unique release pattern of MPH-MLR offers clinicians another option for their patients with ADHD.</p><p>Strengths of this study included the large number of patients from multiple sites and use of validated efficacy measures to evaluate response to treatment. However, study participation criteria, particularly the exclusion of patients with a co-morbid psychiatric condition requiring medication treatment, although similar to other ADHD clinical trials, limit the generalizability of the findings to the general population of children and adolescents with ADHD. Also, fixed dosing used during the double-blind phase might have resulted in study patients who were over- or under-treated with MPH-MLR. The double-blind period was short and, overall, the study duration was only 12&#x000a0;weeks, thus limiting a clear understanding of long-term efficacy. The brief washout period (2&#x000a0;days), while equaling or exceeding at least five half-lives for ADHD medications patients may have been using prior to study entry, may have resulted in inflated baseline scores for some patients as it is possible that there were residual pharmacodynamic changes at receptor sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, the use of MPH-MLR in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years with ADHD led to improvements in ADHD-RS-IV scores that were larger than those observed in placebo-treated patients during a 1-week double-blind evaluation in a dose-related pattern. Improvements continued over a subsequent 11-week open-label study period. No new safety signals were observed. Results indicate that MPH-MLR is a viable treatment option, with a release profile that differs from currently marketed psychostimulants, significantly improving symptoms of ADHD, with an AE profile comparable to other MPH products.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>Rhodes Pharmaceuticals L.P. has received conditional acceptance from the US FDA to use the name Aptensio XR&#x02122; for this ER MPH product.</p></fn><fn><p>Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01239030.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>This research was funded by Rhodes Pharmaceuticals L.P.
