In addition, the 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+placebo and 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX groups demonstrated clinical efficacy that was at least as effective as MTX for these key secondary endpoints. Serious adverse events were similar among treatment groups.

The randomisation sequence was stratified by serological status (presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies) and by geographical region. TCZ or placebo was administered intravenously every 4&#x02005;weeks. MTX/placebo was initiated at 7.5&#x02005;mg/week (to accommodate local recommendations of some countries at the time of study design), and was increased to a maximum of 20&#x02005;mg/week by week 8 in patients with ongoing swollen or tender joints.</p><p>The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Patients with features of poor prognosis were enrolled: inclusion criteria included Disease Activity Score using 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) &#x0003e;3.2, swollen joint count &#x02265;4 (66 joint count), tender joint count &#x02265;6 (68 joint count), ESR &#x02265;28&#x02005;mm/h or C reactive protein &#x02265;1&#x02005;mg/dl, positive RF or anti-CCP antibodies or one or more erosion of hands, wrists or feet attributable to RA based on a central radiographic reading. Before baseline, DMARDs were withdrawn for appropriate washout periods (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207628/-/DC1">supplementary appendix</ext-link>). Patients could continue treatment with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or oral corticosteroids (&#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day prednisone or equivalent), provided the doses had been stable for at least 2 or 4&#x02005;weeks before baseline, respectively, and remained stable throughout the study. Patients could withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.

Key secondary endpoints included assessment of ACR response criteria, radiographic efficacy by the van der Heijde&#x02013;modified total Sharp score (mTSS), quality of life using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS) and physical function assessment by the Health Assessment Questionnaire&#x02013;Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score. Exploratory/post hoc analyses included evaluation of Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI &#x0003c;2.8) remission and ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) preliminary criteria for remission. Serum levels of TCZ were measured. Safety was evaluated by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis of efficacy was performed on the intent-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one TCZ/placebo infusion). The safety population included all patients who received at least one TCZ/placebo infusion and had at least one post-dose safety assessment.</p><p>Overall, the study required 1128 patients (282 per arm) to provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in DAS28-ESR remission (DAS28-ESR &#x0003c;2.6) rate in the primary comparison between 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX and placebo+MTX (assumed DAS28 remission rates were 26% and 16%, respectively, under the null hypothesis of no treatment difference) in a two-sided test with a 5% significance level. The study was not powered to detect differences between TCZ groups. The sample size was not inflated to account for withdrawals as the primary analysis implemented a non-responder imputation approach that accounted for withdrawals.</p><p>Primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated sequentially in a fixed hierarchy of statistical testing (with prioritisation of the primary comparator group, 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX) to reduce the occurrence of false-positive conclusions resulting from multiple testing (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207628/-/DC1">supplementary appendix</ext-link> table S1). For the primary endpoint and dichotomous response variables (eg, ACR responses), TCZ groups were compared with the placebo+MTX group using logistic regression, adjusted for stratification factors (serological status and region) within the model. Patients who withdrew or for whom a DAS28-ESR score or an ACR20/50/70 response could not be determined were considered non-responders.</p><p>Changes from baseline in radiographic scores at week 52 were compared between the TCZ and placebo+MTX groups using non-parametric Van Elteren analysis stratified by region and serological status using linear extrapolation for missing data. Other continuous variables (eg, HAQ-DI score) were analysed using analysis of covariance that included treatment group, baseline score and baseline stratification factors. Non-radiographic continuous endpoints used a combination of last-observation-carried-forward and no imputation for missing data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient population</title><p>In total, 1162 patients were randomly assigned, and 920 (79%) completed 52&#x02005;weeks of treatment; 96.1% of patients assigned to 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX, 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX or placebo+MTX achieved MTX doses of 15&#x02005;mg/week or higher (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-207628/-/DC1">supplementary appendix</ext-link>, results and tables S2&#x02013;S4). Although overall withdrawal rates were similar among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015207628F1">figure 1</xref>), withdrawals in the placebo+MTX group were driven primarily by non-safety&#x02013;related reasons (most notably insufficient therapeutic response and treatment refusal); withdrawals in the TCZ groups were driven primarily by safety (AEs, most notably laboratory abnormalities), with the highest incidence in the 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX group, in which 47 of 291 patients (16.2%) experienced an AE that led to withdrawal (see Safety).</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2015207628F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition. *Five patients (two in the placebo+MTX group, two in the 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX group and one in the 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX group) did not receive study treatment and were excluded from analysis populations. Withdrawals in the placebo+MTX group were mainly driven by insufficient therapeutic response and refused treatment; withdrawals in the TCZ combination therapy groups were mainly related to safety (primarily hepatic transaminase elevations). Two patients randomly assigned to the placebo+MTX group received TCZ at the baseline visit and were allocated to the 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX group for safety analysis.

The study entry criteria specifically targeted patients with active disease and features of progressive disease (baseline mean DAS28-ESR ranged from 6.6 to 6.7; approximately 90% of enrolled patients were seropositive for RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies), which is the target population for whom early use of intensive therapy, such as with a biological agent, may be appropriate.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Although the study was not powered to detect differences in treatment effects between the TCZ arms and all doses/regimens of TCZ demonstrated clinical benefit compared with MTX alone, the 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX group consistently achieved the best outcomes across all efficacy measures. For the duration of the 52-week study, the 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX regimen (the primary comparator) significantly improved clinical outcomes and functional ability (measured by HAQ-DI score) and inhibited joint damage progression compared with the MTX-alone regimen. The primary endpoint was met: 45% of 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX patients achieved DAS28 remission at 24&#x02005;weeks compared with 15% of placebo+MTX patients. Of interest, in contrast to the humanised monoclonal anti-TNF antibody adalimumab,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the addition of MTX to TCZ did not result in TCZ serum levels significantly higher than levels attained with TCZ monotherapy. Although the underlying mechanisms that drive serum levels of a biological treatment in the context of combination with MTX versus monotherapy are not fully elucidated, our findings suggest that synergy between IL-6 inhibition and MTX action, rather than higher serum drug levels, drives the higher clinical response observed with TCZ+MTX. Exploratory analyses across other disease remission measures (ACR/EULAR Boolean and Index remission, CDAI remission), which were of clinical importance despite their not being validated in a clinical trial setting, also showed that improvement with 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX was at least equal to improvement with MTX alone. Analysis of CDAI remission is of particular interest because this composite disease activity measure does not include an acute-phase reactant, and it demonstrates that control of disease activity in TCZ-treated patients with early RA was independent of the direct pharmacodynamic effect of TCZ in suppressing the synthesis of acute-phase reactant proteins.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Early radiographic progression contributes to long-term disability, and prevention of structural joint damage is an important therapeutic goal early in and throughout the course of the disease.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Baseline radiographic joint damage was low in all treatment groups, reflecting the early stage of RA in the study population. This finding is consistent with other trials in early RA populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Throughout 52&#x02005;weeks, patients treated with TCZ experienced less radiographic progression than patients treated with MTX monotherapy, with the greatest joint damage inhibition in the 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX group. Of note, mTSS progression was low overall, even in the comparator MTX monotherapy arm, as has been observed in other early RA trials.</p><p>The recommended starting dose for intravenous TCZ in the USA and Canada is 4&#x02005;mg/kg,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> in contrast to 8&#x02005;mg/kg used in the rest of the world; 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ monotherapy has also demonstrated efficacy in patients with RA.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate these TCZ dose regimens in the early RA population. Both 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+placebo and 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX achieved DAS28 and ACR efficacy responses consistently at least equal to those observed with placebo+MTX. These regimens also demonstrated suppression of radiographic structural joint damage, with 77% (8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+placebo) and 63% (4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX) relative reduction in mTSS to week 52 compared with rates seen in the MTX+placebo group. Numerically greater inhibition in structural joint damage was observed with 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX than with 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ monotherapy or 4&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX. Therefore, although 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX is the most effective treatment, both 4&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX and 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ monotherapy represent good alternative treatments for subsets of patients, such as those unable to tolerate MTX or the higher 8&#x02005;mg/kg dose because of contraindications or adverse reactions.</p><p>Several other biological agents have proven efficacy in the early RA population. Because of differences in study design, comparisons across trials are difficult. Nevertheless, TCZ appears to demonstrate benefits in patients with early RA (in regard to DAS28 remission, ACR responses and radiographic endpoints), compared with patients treated with MTX alone, that are generally consistent with those observed in previous studies of biological therapies in similar populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although a number of head-to-head comparison studies of different biological agents have recently been published,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> these have generally been performed in patients who have more established RA and who have responded inadequately to previous DMARDs. It would be of interest to conduct such studies in more treatment-naive patients with early RA.</p><p>AEs observed in the TCZ groups were consistent with the known safety profile of TCZ; no additional safety signals were observed, and the most frequently reported AE was infection in all TCZ groups and in the placebo+MTX group. However, a numerically higher incidence of certain events (infections, malignancies, myocardial infarctions and deaths) was reported in the 4&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX group than the other groups. Although patients in the 4&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX group were marginally older than the other patients, there were no imbalances in any other baseline demographic or disease characteristics. The significance of, and reason for, these small numerical differences are unclear. Changes in laboratory parameters (eg, increased hepatic transaminase levels and decreased neutrophil and platelet counts) have been reported for TCZ.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref> Consistent with the known effects of TCZ and of MTX on transaminase levels, more patients in the TCZ+MTX groups than in either monotherapy group experienced ALT elevations, though AST elevations were similar between TCZ+MTX and TCZ monotherapy. Importantly, most elevations occurred at a single time point, were not sustained and did not result in any clinical sequelae (no serious hepatic events were reported). Thrombocytopenia was similar between TCZ+MTX and TCZ monotherapy groups. Consistent with intravenous TCZ dosing, one hypersensitivity reaction was reported in the 4&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX group and one was reported in the TCZ monotherapy group. Rates of AEs resulting in premature withdrawal in this study ranged from 12% in the 4&#x02005; mg/kg and TCZ monotherapy arms to 20% in the 8&#x02005; mg/kg TCZ+MTX arm; these proportions were higher than in previous studies of TCZ,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref> which were conducted in more treatment-experienced populations. The higher withdrawal rates might have resulted from the protocol-mandated requirement for withdrawal in response to transaminase elevations (if three consecutive doses of intravenous study drug were missed because of transaminase elevations, the patient was withdrawn).</p><p>This study had some limitations. The blinded nature precluded dose modification of intravenous TCZ/placebo, MTX dose was limited to 20&#x02005;mg/week and laboratory abnormalities were managed, according to protocol, by interruption or discontinuation of intravenous dosing. These conditions may not reflect actual clinical practice. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these results are generalisable to patients with early RA that is less severe.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study support the effectiveness and clinical benefit of TCZ in MTX-naive patients with early progressive RA. The greatest benefit was afforded by 8&#x02005;mg/kg TCZ+MTX; the other TCZ regimens were at least as effective as MTX in improving signs and symptoms and physical function and in inhibiting joint damage.
