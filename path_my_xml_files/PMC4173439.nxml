Rocuronium has an onset of action comparable to succinylcholine when used in doses &#x0003e; 0.9 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It has the shortest onset time of all the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents currenly available.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Rocuronium has little or no adverse cardiovascular effects, nor does it cause histamine release. For these reasons, it may be preferred over succinylcholine in compromized patients in whom haemodynamic or other changes are to be minimized. Doses of rocuronium usually used for RSI (1 mg/kg) allow rapid paralysis (30 to 60 s) but the duration of action is prolonged (upto 1 h), making it unsuitable in difficult airway scenarios in the unavailability of sugammadex. Even if available, the benefit of having sugammadex reversing a large dose of rocuronium will come at a cost which will be substantial. For an average 75 kg patient reversal of profound blockade with 4 mg/kg sugammadex requires two 2 mL vials (&#x00373;119.28).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Also the foreseeable problem of a patient who has recently received sugammadex, who needs a surgery for re-exploration for instance has not been addressed.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In theory, use of low doses of neuromuscular blocking agents shortens the time for recovery from neuromuscular block and reduces the requirement for anticholinesterase drugs. The ED95 dose of rocuronium is 0.3 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] But low doses may also compromise the intubating condition. The aim of the study was to compare intubating conditions, onset of neuromuscular blockade and its clinical duration following two doses of rocuronium (0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg) or succinylcholine (1.0 mg/kg) administered in adult patients undergoing elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation at 60 s and 90 s following administration of rocuronium 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg and at 60 s following administration of succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg. Duration of action, hemodynamic response and incidence of postoperative sore throat were also noted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study.

</p><p>Clearance for performing the study was obtained from the Department Ethical Committee. Written and informed consent was taken from the patients who were willing to volunteer for the study. All patients received tablet diazepam 0.1 mg/kg body weight to a maximum of 10 mg as premedication on the evening before surgery and 3 h before induction of anesthesia on the day of surgery. Tablet ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg was given at midnight on the day before surgery and 3 h before surgery.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to one of five groups using a computer-generated randomization table.</p><p>Group R3/60: Patients received intravenous rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg body weight, intubated at 60 s.</p><p>Group R3/90: Patients received intravenous rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg body weight, intubated at 90 s.</p><p>Group R6/60: Patients received intravenous rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg body weight, intubated at 60 s.</p><p>Group R6/90: Patients received intravenous rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg body weight, intubated at 90 s.</p><p>Group S/60: Patients received intravenous succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg body weight, intubated at 60 s.</p><p>Observer one conducted the preoperative evaluation of the patient and prepared the drugs for administration. He/she monitored neuromuscular transmission during the first 10min following administration of the neuromuscular blocking agent and noted the time of onset of neuromuscular blockade (marked by a train-of-four count of 0) and duration of neuromuscular blockade (from abolition of all four twitches onTOF till return of first twitch on TOF sequence). The incidence of sore throat at 24 h following the surgery was also evaluated by bserver one.</p><p>Observer two, who was blinded to the study drug and the neuromuscular monitoring, performed laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation and graded the intubating conditions.</p><p>Basic preinduction monitoring was established using a five electrode electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP). Neuromuscular monitoring, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) and anesthetic agent monitoring was established following induction of anesthesia. Surface electrodes of a peripheral nerve stimulator were placed over the ulnar nerve at the wrist on the hand with the intravenous access. The NIBP cuff was applied over the otherarm.</p><p>Patients were preoxygenated for 3min with 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 5 L/min using a circle absorber system. Intravenous fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg was given to all patients at the start of preoxygenation. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol 2 mg/kg with the dose being titrated until the loss of response to verbal commands. The ability to &#x0201c;mask ventilate&#x0201d; was confirmed before administration of a bolus dose of a muscle relaxant (rocuronium or succinylcholine corresponding to the study group). Anesthesia was maintained with 100% oxygenand 2% isoflurane by mask ventilation using a respiratory rate of 10&#x02013;12 breaths/min and tidal volume of 8&#x02013;10 mL/kg body weight.</p><p>Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, and pulse oximetric saturation were recorded for the first 3 min after intubation. Neuromuscular monitoring was done using a peripheral nerve stimulator to stimulate the ulnar nerve at the wrist using surface electrodes placed along the course of the nerve. The hand was stabilized such that only the thumb was allowed to move while the other fingers were immobilized using a tape.</p><p>A screen was used to cordon the area where neuromuscular transmission was being monitored. To avoid observer bias, the consultant anesthesiologist who performed the tracheal intubation (Observer two) was blinded to the muscle relaxant used or the response to the train-of-four stimulus at the time of intubation. Using the peripheral nerve stimulator, supramaximal square wave impulses of 0.2 ms duration were delivered in aTOF sequence at 2 Hz for 2 s. Visual and tactile evaluation of the baseline evoked mechanical response of adductor pollicis muscle was then noted. A repeat TOF stimulation was used once every 12 s to follow the time course and depth of neuromuscular blockade.</p><p>Laryngoscopy was performed by the consultant anesthesiologist 60 or 90 s after administration of the neuromuscular blocker as dictated by the group to which the patient was assigned. The duration of laryngoscopy and intubation was restricted to 30 s. If diaphragmatic or limb movement occurred at the time of endotracheal intubation, then this was recorded and propofol administered as a rescue drug in a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Assessment of intubating conditions</title><p>Intubating conditions were assessed clinically by Observer two according to the following three criteria:</p><p>

To evaluate overall intubating conditions, we used three parameters, ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord position at laryngoscopy and reaction to tracheal intubation and cuff inflation. Though there have been previous studies on low dose rocuronium and intubating conditions, those studies had been done in different clinical scenarios using varying induction agents and opioids.</p><p>In our study on low-dose rocuronium, we chose agents that are most commonly used in most institutions for induction of general anesthesia, that is fentanyl, propofol, and isoflurane, and maintenance with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane. We also studied exactly which factor out of the three parameters actually lead to overall intubating condition being clinically unacceptable in the different groups. In our study, only 35% patients in R3/60 group and 60% patients in R3/90 group had clinically acceptable intubating conditions. However, the percentage of clinically acceptable intubating condition were 80% and 100%, respectively, in the R6/60 and R6/90 groups. The factor that contributed to intubating condition being not acceptable clinically was the reaction to intubation. This is an important finding because most of the patients in R3/60 or R3/90 groups had easy or fair laryngoscopy and had vocal cords in either abducted or intermediate position through which an endotracheal tube could be passed without any vocal cord trauma. But it was the reaction to intubation that made the overall intubating condition clinically unacceptable. We had the recorded heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure at the time of intubation and for the first 3 min thereafter to know the effect of reaction to intubation in the different groups. Repeated measures of ANOVA was used to analyze these parameters that showed comparable trends in the five groups.</p><p>Also the incidence of sore throat post operatively was minimal in both the R3/60 and R3/90 groups. That implies that in an anticipated difficult airway scenario where succinylcholine is contraindicated, the placement of the endotracheal tube can be successfully done even with low-dose Rocuronium without having postoperative sore throat even though the overall intubating condition will be graded as clinically unacceptable, due to the reaction to intubation.</p><p>The intubating conditions in the low-dose rocuronium groups in our study were in contrast to those of Tullock <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] where patients had good to excellent intubating scores in 100% patients intubated with rocuronium 350 &#x003bc;g/kg at 150 s following anesthetic induction with alfentanil and propofol. Our results were also different from the results of a study done by Barclay <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with low-dose Rocuronium. In their study, 18/20 (90%) who were intubated using Rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg following induction of anesthesia with alfentanil and propofol had optimal intubating conditions when assessed at 2 min.</p><p>Intubating conditions in the R3/90 group in our study were in contrary to the results of a study done by Siddik-Sayyid <italic>et al</italic>. where they found excellent intubating conditions in 90% patients, comparable to 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine, when anesthesia was induced with remifentanil 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg and intubation performed 90 s after rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Only 25% patients in R3/90 group in our study had excellent intubating conditions, which is strikingly different.</p><p>The intubating conditions in the 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium groups were also in contrast to the study done by Schlaich <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] where intubating conditions were assessed 3 min after induction of anesthesia with remifentanil 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ kg/ min, propofol 2 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/ kg rocuronium and showed good or excellent intubating conditions in 30 out of 30 patients.

Studied intubation conditions at 90 s following two different low doses of rocuronium (0.15 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg) during remifentanil and propofol anesthesia[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in children aged 3&#x02013;12 years and concluded that 95.5% had a clinically acceptable intubating condition in the 0.3 mg/ kg group, which was in glaring contrast to that of ours, even though the study group was adults in our study.</p><p>De Miranda <italic>et al</italic>. in their comparative study between one and two effective doses (ED95) of Rocuronium for tracheal intubation in adult patients concluded that both doses of Rocuronium, 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg provided clinically satisfactory parameters of tracheal intubation in elective procedures[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that was again absolutely different to that of our study. Thus, even though previous studies done by different authors concluded that Rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg can be used to provide clinically acceptable intubating conditions, our findings were completely different from those studies. The strikingly different findings could be because of the different induction agents and opioids used in the previous studies, which may lead us to conclude that the same Rocuronium 0.3 mg/kg can give different intubating conditions, depending on the induction methods.</p><p>The results of our study were similar to the one done by Kirkegaard-Nielsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In their study, after premedication with midazolam, and induction with fentanyl and propofol, 11 out of 20 patients had unacceptable intubating conditions when intubation was done at 60 s.</p><p>Lam A compared intubating conditions, and the onset and offset times of Rocuronium bromide and succinylcholine.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] He concluded that Rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (when used with propofol and fentanyl for induction) provides intubating conditions comparable to succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg at 60 s, which was a similar finding as that of our study. The actual onset and offset times, however, were significantly longer with rocuronium. The author concluded that Rocuronium is suitable for surgical procedures greater than 30 min eliminating the need for an additional relaxant to succinylcholine.</p><p>In our study, the median onset time of neuromuscular blockade in R 0.3 group was 5.08 min, which was much more than in the study done by Meistelman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In their study, the onset time at adductor pollicis using 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium was 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 min.</p><p>In our study, there was no difference in the incidence of sore throat in the various groups 24 h into the postoperative period. There was no sore throat even in the clinically unacceptable intubating condition patients probably because most of those patients had vocal cords in either abducted or intermediate position, through which the endotracheal tube could be passed without trauma. These findings were also similar to that of Mencke <italic>et al</italic>. on the incidence of postoperative sore throat and hoarseness comparing Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.0 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Following anesthetic induction with fentanyl, propofol, and isoflurane in oxygen.</p><p>
