Concern has, however, been raised about complications that may be related to the use of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) and aortic cross-clamping. It has been hypothesized that when coronary artery by-pass grafting is performed without the use of CPB, the rate of serious complications is reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial is designed as an open, randomized, controlled, clinical trial with blinded assessment of end-points. Patients at or above 70 years of age, referred for surgical myocardial revascularisation, are included and randomised to receive coronary artery by-pass grafting either with or without the use of CPB and aortic cross-clamping. Follow-up is performed by clinical, biochemical, electrocardiographic, and angiographic data that are evaluated by independent committees that are blinded with respect to the result of the randomisation. End points include mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, graft patency, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. The trial is performed in four different Danish, cardiac surgery centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00123981</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Conventional Coronary Artery By-pass Grafting (CCABG) using CPB has for decades been applied to obtain myocardial re-vascularisation and, hence, improved quality of life and survival. It does, however, bear a risk of death, stroke, myocardial infarction and other serious complications.</p><p>During recent years, an equivalent operation performed on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass (Off-pump Coronary Artery By-pass Grafting, OPCAB) has gained popularity helped by the advent of mechanical stabilization devices and improved surgical techniques. Observational studies suggest that this technique is associated with a lower incidence of stroke, per operative arrhythmias and even mortality than conventional CCABG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This is especially the case in elderly patients and patients with significant co-morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Only few randomised, controlled trials have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and most of these included mainly or only low-risk, relatively young patients. These studies have documented the safety and efficacy of OPCAB compared with CCABG, but none of the trials has had the statistical power to determine whether the rate of serious complications is lower after OPCAB operations. In contrast to earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], one recent study found graft patency to be significantly lower after OPCAB than after CCABG operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>We find that there is a need of a larger scale randomised trial to compare the results of CCABG and OPCAB operations, especially in elderly patients.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>Primarily, to compare the incidence of death, stroke and myocardial infarction after CCABG and OPCAB procedures in a population of elderly patients. Secondly, to compare quality of life and graft patency, and cost-effectiveness after CCABG and OPCAB.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>An open, randomised Danish multicentre trial of patients 70 years of age or above, admitted for surgical, first time myocardial re-vascularisation. The design involves blinded evaluation of outcome measures and interim analyses.</p><sec><title>Participating centres</title><p>The study will be performed at the cardiac surgery units of Aalborg Hospital, Aarhus University Hospital, Gentofte Hospital, Odense University Hospital, and Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark.</p></sec><sec><title>Approval to start</title><p>Patients will be enrolled in the study based upon written informed consent in accordance with Helsinki Declaration II. The study plan has been approved by the local ethical committees and the national ethical committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial surgeon's requirements</title><p>Before being certified to participate, the surgeons must at least independently have performed 25 CCABG and 25 OPCAB procedures each procedure including anastomoses to the marginal tbranches of the left coronary artery. This territory is the most challenging to graft. Therefore, all surgeons fulfilling this criterium will first have performed a significant number of other coronary artery by-pass operations and have an intermediate level of experience reflecting common clinical situations. Based upon these criteria and on documented results of the operations, surgeons must also be certified by the ethical and safety data committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients age seventy years or above admitted for first time coronary artery by-pass operation without other planned surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>- Patient not willing to participate in the study</p><p>- The patient cannot understand given information or answer questionnaires relevantly due to intellectual or linguistic deficiency</p><p>- Preoperative knowledge that aortic cross clamping is not safe due to calcification e.g. from CT-scan.</p><p>- Preoperative cardiac conditions demanding CPB.</p><p>- Re-do cardiac surgery.</p><p>- Acute operation defined as patient requiring operation before the beginning of the next working day after first being presented to the surgeon.</p><p>- Any other reason why the operating surgeon does not believe that the patient can be operated safely either using CPB or without CPB.</p><p>- Inclusion in study not possible for logistic reasons</p></sec><sec><title>Consent and inclusion procedure</title><p>After written and oral information is given by the project nurse at the ward at time of admission for coronary artery by-pass grafting, the patient has to give oral and written consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>The operating surgeon enters patients in a central database accessed by the internet. Before being able to randomise, the surgeon has to enter a preoperative plan including which coronary arteries are to be grafted, the conduit type and whether a single, sequential, or y-graft is planned. Having done this the patient is subsequently randomised either to OPCAB or CCABG by the on-line system</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>For practical end ethical reasons, neither the patient nor doctors or nurses are blinded with respect to the type of treatment used. Events will, however, be evaluated by an independent committee that will be blinded.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>900 patients including 450 patients randomised for OPCAB and 450 randomized for CCABG.</p></sec><sec><title>Power calculations</title><p>The incidence of the primary, combined end-point is estimated to be 8%. This estimate is based on literature as well as on historical data from the participating centres from the period 2001&#x02013;2003. Based on earlier, observational studies of elderly patients undergoing coronary revascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we hypothesize that this incidence can be reduced to 4% by avoiding cardiopulmonary by-pass. With a margin of 0.5% in risk difference a test of non-inferiority of OPCAB compared to CCABG based on 900 patients will have a statistical power of 82%.</p></sec><sec><title>Operations and anaesthesia</title><p>The coronary artery by-pass operations are performed either with or without the use of CPB according to the result of randomisation. Operative protocols are used to limit the variations of technique, although leaving some room for variations according to the discretion of the individual surgeon and the tradition of each participating unit. The operative protocols are given in Appendix 1. When judged vital for the outcome of the patient, conversion from one group to the other can be decided by the operating surgeon at any time during the operation. Equally, anaesthetic protocols are followed in order to limit the variations between the units (Appendix 2)</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative treatment</title><p>Postoperative treatment of included patients with acetyl salicylic acid, clopidogrel, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, amiodarone and heparin will be performed according to detailed protocols (Appendix 3)</p><p>In case deviation from the protocol is deemed necessary, such altered strategies are to be duly noted and accounted for.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p><italic>At preoperative conference: </italic>Evaluation of whether the patient meets the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria.

Information on death will be obtained from the Civil Registration System, which keeps electronic records on all changes in vital status, including change of address, date of emigration, and date of death for the entire Danish population.</p><p>Information on hospitalizations for myocardial infarction and stroke will be obtained from The National Registry of Patients, which retains key information on all patients discharged from non-psychiatric hospitals in Denmark since 1977, including outpatient diagnoses, and patients dying during their admission. The files of the registry include information on the civil registry number of the patient, date of discharge, and up to 20 discharge diagnoses, assigned exclusively by the physician at discharge according to the Danish version of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Full medical records including results of paraclinical examinations and tests will be retrieved and reviewed according to standardized internationally accepted criteria for all patients who die and/or are registered with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or stroke during the study period. All data will be presented for the independent monitoring committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>A combined end-point of death + stoke + myocardial infarction within 30 days postoperatively.

Data analysis will be performed in accordance with the principle of intention-to-treat. An interim analysis will be performed for monitoring the accumulating data during the planned study period, i.e., after half of the patients have been recruited. The O'Brien-Fleming approach will be used in these analyses. At the interim analysis a p-value below 0.5% will be considered significant, while a p value below 4.8% will be considered significant after conclusion of the study. In this manner, a 5% level of significance is sustained. For the 6 months and 3 years data, Kaplan-Meier plots will be used for graphic comparisons between groups and log- rank test for numerical comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in the conception and design of the study protocol, drafting or revising of the manuscript, and have approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Appendices</title><sec><title>Appendix 1</title><sec><title>A Standard off-pump (OPCAB) procedure</title><p>1.

Stroke</title><p>The World Health Organization's definition of stroke is used, i.e., an acute disturbance of focal or global cerebral function with symptoms lasting more than 24 hr or leading to death of presumed vascular origin.</p><p>Patients with the following ICD-10 discharge diagnosis codes in the Danish National Patient Registry are considered possible cases of stroke:</p><p>I 61 Intracerebral haemorrhage</p><p>I 63 Ischaemic stroke</p><p>I 64 Non-specified stroke</p><p>Patients with subdural haematoma, epidural bleeding, retina infarction or infarction caused by subarachnoidal bleeding, trauma, infection, surgery (not related to CABG or OPCAB surgery) or a intracerebral tumor are not classified as stroke patients. Moreover the definition does not include patients with only non-specific symptom, e.g. isolated dizziness or headache or asymptomatic patients with infarctions identified only by brain imaging.</p><p>Diagnostic work-up: In case of clinical symptoms of stroke or transient cerebral ischemia (TCI), symptoms should be noted in the patient file and the neurologist on duty should be asked to make a formal examination of the patient. All possible cases of stroke or TCI should undergo a brain imaging procedure, preferably a MR-diffusion scan. Should a MR-diffusion scan not be possible, efforts should be made for the patient to have a CT scan 3&#x02013;7 days after the start of symptoms (even if a CT scan has been made in the acute phase).</p></sec><sec><title>C. Graft patency</title><p>The coronary angiogram is evaluated by two different cardiologists. The grafts are rated A: Open, B: Stenotic (more than 50%), O: Occluded, each for the 1) distal anastomosis, 2) proximal anastomosis og 3) length of the graft. Discrepancies are settled by conference.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The trial has received funding from The Danish Heart Foundation, the Danish Centre for Health Technology Assessment, The Danish Research Council for Health Sciences, Tove and John Girott's Foundation, Medtronic, Guidant, Getinge AB.</p><p><italic>Trial Organisation</italic></p><p>Study group</p><p>Kim Houlind, M.D., Ph.D (Principal investigator), Bo Juul Kjeldsen M.D., Ph.D, Susanne Madsen M.D., Bodil Steen Rasmussen M.D., Ph.D, Susanne Holme M.D., Poul Erik Mortensen M.D.</p><p>Steering Committee</p><p>Poul Erik Mortensen M.D. (Chairman), Vibeke Hjortdal MD, D.M.Sc., Ph.D, Gert Lerbjerg M.D., Uffe Niebuhr M.D., Soren Aggestrup, M.D., Susanne Holme M.D., Per Hostrup Nielsen M.D., Jorn Sollid M.D., Jorgen Videb&#x000e6;k M.D., D.M.Sc., Kim Houlind M.D.</p><p>Ethical and safety committee</p><p>Paul Sergeant, MD, Ph.D. (Chairman), Elisabeth Stahle, M.D., D.M.
