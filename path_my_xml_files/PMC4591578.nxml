Recent data from the USA indicate that the prevalence of prediabetes is 34.6&#x000a0;%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is 19.4&#x000a0;%, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is 5.4&#x000a0;% and that of IFG and IGT is 9.8&#x000a0;% in the adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The epidemic of prediabetes is likely to compound the existing diabetes crisis as many individuals with IGT will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the future. It is estimated that approximately 316 million people worldwide are with IGT and this is predicted to rise to 471 million by 2035. According to the estimates of International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2013, India alone has 65.1 million people living with diabetes; this places India second to China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Plants provide an excellent source of drugs and a large proportion of currently-available drugs have been either derived directly or indirectly from plant sources. Present literature suggests the existence of more than 800 plants that may possess hypoglycemic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The use of medicinal plants in most developing countries, as a normative basis for the maintenance of good health, has been observed extensively. There is a growing global interest in herbal and other forms of traditional medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>An effective strategy to restrict global impacts of T2DM is by limiting the number of prediabetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It&#x02019;s our focus to identify new effective therapeutic agents, with relatively low cost and low toxicity that can be used regularly to control a progression of T2DM in the prediabetic population. Thus, dietary supplements that can modulate glucose homeostasis and potentially improve lipid parameters would be desirable. Although numerous herbs are reported to possess antidiabetic activity, a significant amount of research and traditional usage suggests that Fenugreek seeds (<italic>Trigonella foenumgraecum</italic>) are among the best in terms of safety and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Seeds of Fenugreek are a rich source of fiber and have multiple benefits in patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Research in the past two decades has shown that Fenugreek seeds help to lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes. Its role as an antidiabetic, by reducing fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in human subjects was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Fenugreek is currently available as a nutraceutical with claims to reduce hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Patients, who already manifest abnormalities of glucose handling, could benefit from a low-risk, inexpensive, food-based intervention aimed at normalizing their metabolic milieu. From the literature it is observed that Fenugreek is a dietary supplement that may hold promise in this regard. Though the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of Fenugreek were evaluated in animal and human models with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], no study has been reported in prediabetics. The present study assesses the ability of Fenugreek to prevent T2DM in prediabetics having IGT/IFG. The objective of present study is to determine whether Fenugreek can prevent the outcome of T2DM in non diabetic people with prediabetes. If pharmacotherapy for prediabetes is initiated, it is important to realize that any therapy will require a long-term commitment by both subject and provider. In addition, it is important to review with the patient that there are limited data demonstrating the long-term health benefits of pharmacological intervention compared with lifestyle intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore the present Fenugreek interventional study was carried out for a period of 3&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The institutional ethics committee reviewed and approved the research protocol and the informed consent vide review letter No. IRB/NIMS/080/2010.

A prediabetes condition does not necessarily develop into diabetes if controlled well. Progression to diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapeutic modes. There are several effective pharmacological regimens with encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] however these regimens are either not usually economically accessible or not well tolerated by all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hence a need to focus on indigenous, inexpensive food-based regimens.</p><p>Traditional plant medicines are used throughout the world as alternative therapies to control diabetes. Although numerous herbs are reported to possess some degree of anti-diabetic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], a significant amount of research, as well as traditional usage suggest that Fenugreek may be among the best in terms of efficacy and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Though many studies evaluated the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of Fenugreek in animal and human models with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, no study is reported in prediabetes till date. Further this is a first study conducted employing a commercially debitterized Fenugreek powder in the prevention of diabetes in subjects with IFG/IGT. The rate of progression to diabetes during the intervention in controls and Fenugreek group is determined in the present study.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Progression to diabetes</title><p>It was observed that the conversion rate from IFG and IGT to diabetes by the end of 3&#x000a0;years reduced significantly in Fenugreek group when compared to controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At 3&#x000a0;years, glucose levels have normalized in 18.52&#x000a0;% of controls and 34.62&#x000a0;% of Fenugreek subjects. In a 11-year follow up study it was stated that many people with prediabetes (a quarter or more) may revert to normal glucose tolerance on long term, and after a protracted follow-up, only about 50&#x000a0;% of people with IGT or IFG will develop diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study the conversion rate from IFG and IGT to diabetes in controls was similar to the study quoted above.

The studies reported above were done in type 2 diabetes subjects and it cannot be assumed that Fenugreek actually increases insulin resistance in prediabetes, because the serum insulin levels in our study subjects were within the normal range. In addition, the HOMA-IR level in the Fenugreek group at the end of 3&#x000a0;years was within the normal insulin resistance category (&#x0003c;3). Regression analysis outcome of diabetes in Fenugreek group was positively associated with serum insulin (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and negatively associated with HOMA IR (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Fenugreek may exert its therapeutic effect through its alkaloids content by modulation of insulin secretion. The amino acid 2S,3R,4S, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, purified from Fenugreek seeds, showed insulinotropic effects which increased peripheral glucose uptake <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths, limitations and avenues of the study for future research</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized controlled study conducted in men and women, having different life-styles and socio-cultural backgrounds but satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned. Though the sample size had diversified demographics, their anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters were similar at baseline. This study could target large populations more cost effectively. So far there was no systematic long term study in prediabetes and as such this is a conventional intervention, carried out for the first time in a different group of population (prediabetes). No study until now has reported the incidence conversion rate to diabetes with the interventional Fenugreek powder in prediabetes. The strength of this intervention lies on the complexity of data analysis which illuminates the statistical correlation between independent risk factors towards the onset or progression to diabetes.</p><p>Our estimate of the effect of the intervention can be considered conservative for two reasons. First, data was analyzed according to the intention-to-prevent principle, even though some subjects in the intervention group did not follow the recommendations about Fenugreek consumption. Second, for ethical reasons, all subjects assigned to the control group also received general health advice and counseling on dietary patterns at base line and at annual follow-up visits and may have benefited from this advice.</p><p>Participants who dropped out before the end of the 1&#x000a0;year intervention period were not included in the analysis because if their last observation had been carried forward, the differences between the two groups would have been artificially maintained over the follow-up period. Carrying the last observation forward assumes that assigning a no-change status is a conservative analysis, which is not the case, because weight change over time is nonlinear.</p><p>Despite of supplying debitterized processed Fenugreek powder to the study group, few subjects have skipped their doses due to its unacceptable palatability. Because of this reason they were advised to consume it along with some flavoring agents. This perhaps, could alter the plasma glucose levels and was found to be one of the limitations of the study. Though there were many reasons for subject dropouts, one of the reasons was their unwillingness towards the consumption of Fenugreek on long term basis due to its undesirable taste. In addition, subjects did not receive any incentives during the study due to which there was a lost to follow-up and the dropout rate in study group was recorded as 13.5&#x000a0;%.</p><p>An alternative prediabetic intervention study can be carried out with the supplementation of tulsi with Fenugreek, which can be used to mask the bitter taste of Fenugreek. In addition, the role of Fenugreek in different population groups should also be carried out.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides evidence for the use of Fenugreek to delay the onset of diabetes in subjects with prediabetes. Fenugreek powder is useful to lower the blood glucose in prediabetes. From the results it can be concluded that Fenugreek showed hypocholesterolemic effects by reducing LDLc levels but without affecting serum TG, HDLc levels. Our results strongly suggest that the enhancement of serum insulin levels is due to insulinotropic effects. In conclusion, our results show that hypoglycemic effects are due to increasing levels of serum insulin and we suggest here that the mode of action of Fenugreek may be caused by their contents of alkaloids.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBP</term><def><p>Diastolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPG</term><def><p>Fasting plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDLc</term><def><p>High density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOMA</term><def><p>Homeostasis model assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICMR</term><def><p>Indian Council of Medical Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDF</term><def><p>International Diabetes Federation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFG</term><def><p>Impaired fasting glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGT</term><def><p>Impaired glucose tolerance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDLc</term><def><p>Low density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT</term><def><p>Oral glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>Odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPPG</term><def><p>Post prandial plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRR</term><def><p>Relative risk reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>Systolic blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TG</term><def><p>Triglycerides</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VLDLc</term><def><p>Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHR</term><def><p>Waist to hip ratio</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>GA screened and examined all the recruited subjects, researched and analyzed data, and wrote and edited the manuscript.
