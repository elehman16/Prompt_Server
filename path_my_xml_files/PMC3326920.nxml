The drugs used in the management of hyperlipidemia are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitors. Of these, statins and fibrates have shown greater promise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Bile acid sequestrants in a dose-dependent manner lower the total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein (LDL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] At a higher dose, they cause bloating and dyspepsia, which limit their compliance.
