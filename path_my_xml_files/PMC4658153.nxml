In orthopedic practice, low back pain (ICD-10 diagnosis M54) was the most common reason for a consultation in 2013, with 42.9% of cases. In general practice, low back pain is in third place when considering all diseases (14.9%) [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most guidelines recommend the management of non-complicated low back pain in primary care as sufficient therapy [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prolonged, disabling pain should be diagnosed and treated with multimodal therapy [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is empirical evidence for the effects of intensive multimodal therapy (&#x02265;100h) using a &#x0201c;functional restoration&#x0201d; approach [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Usually, multimodal therapy in Germany is an inpatient therapy and requires referral and an interdisciplinary diagnostic assessment before treatment starts.</p><p>The treatment algorithm for managing low back pain first recommends:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>consultation in a multimodal setting for an interdisciplinary assessment after 8&#x02013;12 weeks of pain,</p></list-item></list><p>and/or</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>4&#x02013;6 weeks out of work due to low back pain,</p></list-item></list><p>and/or</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>significant indication of a risk of chronicity [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>In reality, patients in multimodal therapy report suffering from low back pain for many years and reveal a long history of consultations and various treatments. Most of these patients already report seriously reduced physical and emotional functioning due to low back pain [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Existing studies revealed several predictors of reduced pain intensity in patients with chronic low back pain following multimodal Therapy (MMT) [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Predictors were average pain intensity, improved functional capacity due to treatment, affective distress, and shorter absences from work. Furthermore, pre-admission healthcare utilization predicts the success of MMT. Hildebrandt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], for example, reported an association between medical consultations before MMT and reduced pain intensity one year after MMT. Likewise, in the study of Gross &#x00026; Battie [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the number of pre-admission healthcare visits was the most robust predictor of delayed recovery and recurrence of low back pain.</p><p>The present study aims to evaluate an intensive, three-week inpatient MMT for patients with chronic low back pain, focusing on the impact that the amount of healthcare utilization has on the outcome of MMT. The aims and hypotheses are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Evaluating the effectiveness of MMT: Compared to waiting group, patients receiving MMT were expected to improve significantly from pre- to post-treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prospective evaluation at three- and twelve-month follow-ups: We hypothesized that patients would improve significantly in pain-related and psychological variables following MMT.

The main aim of the MMT was to improve functional capacity, reduce pain intensity, improve emotional functioning and well-being, and increase the patients&#x02019; knowledge of bio-psycho-social pain mechanisms and pain-related coping-strategies.</p><p>An interdisciplinary therapeutic team (physicians, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists, and pain nurses) performed an individually-adjusted treatment within a standard schedule (eight hours a day, six days a week). Regular team meetings for the evaluation of individual treatment progress were carried out. Medical treatment consisted of modification of analgesic medication and also frequently withdrawal of medication in case of lack of effectiveness or an increasing burden of side effects. Behavioral management included education (pain and psychological factors), biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral therapy (group therapy once a day, individual therapy once a week) offered by psychologists. Furthermore, patients received physiotherapy (physical exercise and &#x0201c;work hardening&#x0201d;) and active training sessions (e.g., Nordic walking) offered by trained physiotherapists.</p><p>All patients of the MMT group underwent pre-treatment multidisciplinary pain assessment. This included physical examination, functional testing, and further investigations to exclude red flags (e.g. MRI-scan, second opinion of orthopedic-neurological and neurosurgical physician). Moreover psychological-, psychosomatic- or psychiatric diagnostic factors have been evaluated. The assessment team consisted of physicians (specialized in pain management), psychologists/psychotherapists, pain nurses, and physiotherapists. Based on the medical and psychological findings, an individualized treatment was recommended by the assessment team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Materials</title><p>The primary outcome was pain intensity (assessed using NRS, see below).

<italic>German Pain Questionnaire of the German Section of the IASP</italic> (DSF: [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). The DSF was used for assessing socio-demographic and pain-related characteristics.</p><p>
<italic>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</italic>. Pain intensity was assessed by the NRS 0&#x02013;10 (0 = &#x0201c;no pain at all&#x0201d; to 10 = &#x0201c;strongest imaginable pain&#x0201d;).</p><p>
<italic>Pain duration</italic>. The duration of pain was assessed as the number of months since the first appearance of back pain.</p><p>
<italic>Number of consulted medical specialist groups</italic>. Participants were asked to indicate the use of specialists for their back pain symptoms from a list of 11 medical specialist groups (e.g., general physician, neurologist, orthopedist, psychiatrist, and pain therapist) [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Number of types of treatment used</italic>.

<italic>General Depression Scale (ADS</italic>: [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]<italic>)</italic>. The ADS is a self-report scale for assessing depressive symptoms in their emotional, motivational, cognitive, somatic, and interpersonal manifestation. The short form used for this study contains 15 items (4-point Likert-scale). Sum scores of &#x02264; 22 are considered normal [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</italic> (HADS: [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], German version:[<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). The HADS was developed to determine the levels of anxiety and depression in individuals with physical health problems. Only the anxiety scale was used for the present study to avoid highly-correlated covariates. As a depression scale we used the ADS instead (see above). The HADS anxiety scale contains seven items (4-point Likert-scale). Sum scores of &#x02264; 7 are considered normal [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Marburg Questionnaire of Habitual Well-Being</italic> (MFHW: [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). The MFHW is a one-dimensional questionnaire to assess positive characteristics of well-being (e.g., &#x0201c;I can enjoy my life&#x0201d;). It comprises seven items (5-point Likert-scale). The maximum sum score of 35 indicates high levels of well-being. Sum scores &#x02264; 10 within pain patients are rated as abnormal [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Socio-demographic characteristics, pain duration, and pre-admission healthcare utilization were assessed once at the first consultation at the pain center.

Socio-demographic variables were complete. Scores of outcome variables (NRS, MFHW, HADS, and ADS) were completed at t<sub>1</sub> (when therapy began). Healthcare utilization variables had few missing values: eleven of the 155 patients revealed no information about pre-admission consultations with medical specialists. Five patients had received different treatment types before MMT without specifying the number. Long-term treatment with opioids was unclear in one case. We tested the &#x0201c;missing complete at random (MCAR)&#x0201d; hypothesis using socio-demographic variables, the four outcome variables at the assessment time points t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>, and t<sub>4</sub>, and healthcare utilization variables.

The means refer to the intent-to-treat sample (N = 155). Missing data were imputed (see above).

Dependent variables were post-treatment measures of pain intensity, general well-being, anxiety, and depression. The explanatory variables were healthcare utilization (number of consulted medical specialist groups, number of types of treatment received and long-term opioid treatment).

Primary and secondary outcomes at end of MMT and the waiting period, respectively, were lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The effect sizes ranged from high (general well-being) to moderate (pain intensity and depression) and small (anxiety). These results are consistent with other evaluation studies of MMT with a treatment intensity of a minimum of 100 hours and a functional restoration approach (see e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). According to reviews which reported mostly small to moderate effects of MMT on pain intensity and disability (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) we found a large effect on well-being and moderate effects on pain intensity and depression. At pre-treatment, a multidisciplinary team assessed the suitability of MMT in our study. A specific motivation of the individual patient to undergo an activating multimodal therapy was explicitly considered within this assessment. Careful pre-treatment interdisciplinary assessment has been shown to improve both MMT and other pain treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, we found long-term effects of the MMT, although the post-treatment effect decreased at the three-month follow-up in relation to pain intensity and psychological variables. However, pain intensity, depression, anxiety and well-being at the three-month follow-up were significantly better than at the beginning of the MMT. The effect sizes were at least small (pain intensity, anxiety, and depression) and/or moderate (general well-being). This tendency continued up to the twelve-month follow-up. The effect sizes remained small for pain intensity and anxiety, and moderate for general well-being. In contrast, depression scores at the twelve-month follow-up had increased nearly up to the pre-treatment level. General well-being turned out to be the most salient factor through to follow-up after twelve months. It seems that patients could improve their handling of the painful condition due to MMT and could better accept high levels of pain intensity.</p><p>Patients consulting the pain center showed a high amount of pain-related burden. They also reported a large number of consulted medical specialist groups as well as types of pre-admission treatments. First, patients usually consulted a general practitioner (79.4%) or an orthopedist (76.1%). In the third and fourth place neurologists/neurosurgeons (31.6%) and pain therapists (34.2%) were consulted. This result is in line with other German and European studies (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). In Europe, chronic pain patients consult more general practitioners (70%) than orthopedists (27%) [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This might be related to a &#x0201c;gate-keeping system&#x0201d; in some European countries. In contrast, the German system provides barrier-free access to any medical specialist. This might explain the high rate of orthopedists consulted [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>With regard to pre-admission healthcare utilization we found that the number of patients who had consultations with pain management specialists was 34.2% in the sample. Breivik <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) reported much lower rates for Germany. Among the European countries, Germany and Norway showed the fewest number of pain management specialist consultations, with 10% and 8% respectively. Italy and France were in the top positions with 42% and 40%, respectively, which represents chronic pain patients with at least one consultation [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The elevated rates in our study might be due to the special population of patients with long-term disabling low back pain.</p><p>The treatment that patients received before attending the pain center predominantly consisted of medication, physiotherapy, massage, and local injections. These are almost exclusively passive procedures, which overall are not recommended by the current guidelines for the management of low back pain (e.g., the German national guidelines, [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Massage, for example, is explicitly not recommended for chronic pain conditions [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but still seems to be a common treatment in Germany. Of German chronic pain patients, 46% reported having received massage treatment, in contrast to 15% in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Physiotherapy reflects a wide range of different procedures, ranging from passive mobilization to supervised active exercises. Accordingly, it is impossible to assess the conformity of physiotherapeutic treatment with the existing guideline recommendations. An earlier study with participants of the New German Back School [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] revealed a similar pattern of predominantly passive treatments in the history of the patients. In this study, participants with relatively low pain-related burden were surveyed in a secondary preventive setting. The most common procedures participants reported were also massage (39.8%), medication (30.7%), and local injections (25%). Physiotherapy was in the fourth position with 23.9%. Taken together, the results indicate a general pattern of high utilization of passive treatments in the management of low back pain. This is in opposition to current guideline recommendations (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]).</p><p>At last associations between the effectiveness of MMT and pre-admission healthcare utilization were examined. Results of the structural equation model indicate that, with an increasing number of different types of treatments received before MMT, a more negative treatment outcome has to be expected in pain intensity, general well-being, and depression after therapy. This corresponds with findings of previous researchers [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143139.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This result leads to the conclusion that MMT patients should be treated with MMT in an earlier state of the pain treatment process. In Germany, actually, the opposite way is required by the current guidelines. All outpatient treatment opportunities for low back pain have to be exploited before attending MMT.</p><p>It could be considered whether patients with an elevated use of different treatment types might have higher scores in pain-related and psychological factors already prior to treatment. For our analyses this assumption does not hold because we statistically-controlled for baseline pain-related and psychological factors. Furthermore the generalizability is limited by the fact that we considered baseline measures only. It is still possible that these patients will have worse pain conditions in earlier stages of their treatment history. On the other hand, patients with elevated numbers of treatment types might generally have less benefit from pain treatments, including MMT. This leads to the suggestion that patients would benefit more from attending MMT in an earlier stage of healthcare utilization.</p><p>Several limitations must be noted. The generalizability of the results is potentially limited. The sample consisted of consecutively-included patients from only one pain clinic.</p><p>Due to the waiting setting (treatment as usual), there was no real control group for the whole study period. Therefore no comparison with other treatments or pain conditions was possible. The waiting subgroup was a naturally formed group, and no randomization could be applied. But we found no differences with regard to pre-test values between waiting group and intervention group. Additionally, selection effects were handled by controlling pre-treatment measures in the statistical model and computation of adjusted means. A further limitation refers to the assessment of pain disability which is an important outcome measure in therapy with pain conditions (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0143139.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Unfortunately, pain disability could not be considered for evaluation caused by a questionnaire fault in the Pain Disability Index scales at follow up. However, we were able to assess pain intensity as a pain-related outcome measure.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The treatment effects of the MMT suggest that patients with chronic low back pain benefit from the intensive three-week inpatient MMT. This underlines the importance of treating low back pain with relation to physical as well as psychological aspects. The association between treatment effect and number of different pre-admission pain treatment types suggests that patients would benefit more from attending MMT in an earlier stage of healthcare utilization, thus avoiding elevated use of multiple treatment types.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143139.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>SPSS Data file.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143139.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0143139.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
