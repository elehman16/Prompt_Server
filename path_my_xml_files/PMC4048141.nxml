The majority of patients with MDD are diagnosed by and receive treatment from a primary care physician<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; of note, primary care physicians prescribe 62% of all antidepressant medications.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Additionally, there is a higher incidence and prevalence of major depression in patients with chronic medical conditions that are commonly seen in primary care settings, including diabetes, pulmonary disease, heart disease, or arthritis.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Patients with depression and chronic medical illness have significantly more medical symptoms, as well as higher morbidity and mortality than patients with chronic illness alone.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The perception that patients presenting to primary care settings have less severe and less chronic depressive illness than patients presenting to specialty care has been largely debunked; newly diagnosed patients presenting to primary or specialty care have been shown to have generally similar depression characteristics including illness severity and psychiatric comorbidity.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Although specialty care patients are twice as likely to have made a prior suicide attempt, suicidal ideation is reported by about half of patients in both settings.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Approximately half of all patients who present with MDD in either primary or specialty care settings also have high levels of comorbid symptoms of anxiety.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Of particular interest to primary care physicians, in an analysis of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) database, treatment with open-label citalopram in the first treatment step was shown to produce equivalent outcomes in primary (n = 1,091) and specialty care settings (n = 1,785).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In this highly representative sample of outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD, the likelihood of response or remission, and the time to reach the outcome, were similar regardless of treatment in a primary or specialty care setting.</p><p>The presence of even mild residual depressive symptoms after acute treatment of MDD increases the likelihood of relapse, recurrence, and poorer outcomes.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Additional factors that are associated with posttreatment residual symptoms include more severe depression, comorbid anxiety, chronicity, and medical comorbidities,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> which are characteristics of MDD that are likely to be seen in a primary care setting.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Deconstructing depression into symptom components may be a valuable way to monitor persistent, minor, or residual depressive symptoms in both clinical research and practice.</p><p>Novel post hoc categorical shift analyses using pooled data from 2 phase 3 studies<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> were used to compare improvement in symptoms of depression and anxious depression in patients treated with vilazodone 40 mg or placebo. Instead of the traditional mean change from baseline assessment, depressive symptom improvement and anxious depression were evaluated by a shift from more to less severe symptom categories to provide a more intuitively descriptive assessment of patient improvement.</p><p>In patients treated with vilazodone, improvement across symptom domains was evident by statistically significant shifts to less severe symptom categories. This finding is noteworthy since almost all patients were in at least mild to severe individual symptom categories at baseline, with most patients (70%&#x02013;87%) having more severe symptom ratings. Depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and fatigue are among the most common residual symptoms following depression treatment.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Significantly more vilazodone-treated than placebo-treated patients improved to a less severe symptom category on the MADRS items that correspond to these symptoms (apparent and reported sadness, reduced sleep, and lassitude). For most symptoms, patients receiving vilazodone were at least 1.5 times as likely as patients receiving placebo to shift to minimal or no symptoms, suggesting that patients receiving vilazodone had clinically relevant improvements in depressive symptoms.</p><p>Even though more than 80% of the patients in this analysis had anxious depression at baseline, significantly more vilazodone-treated than placebo-treated patients achieved the threshold for no anxious depression (HDRS-17 anxiety/somatization score &#x02264; 7) at end of study; patients receiving vilazodone were 1.5 times as likely as patients receiving placebo to shift from anxious depression to no anxious depression. Significant shifts to lesser symptom severity were also demonstrated on the inner tension item, the MADRS single item that most closely corresponds to the symptom of anxiety, in patients with mild to severe or moderate to severe symptoms at baseline. Improvements in anxiety-related measures may be clinically important since patients with MDD and comorbid anxiety have greater functional impairments, more severe course of illness, and increased risk for suicide than patients with MDD alone.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Limitations include the post hoc nature and pooled design of these analyses; of note, the primary trials were not specifically designed to analyze single symptoms. Additionally, multiple comparisons were not controlled for, and the conventional <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05 to indicate statistical significance was used. Analysis of the completer population may underestimate or overestimate treatment benefits since those who dropped out of the study may have done so due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. Duration of full-dose treatment was limited by the dose titration schedule, which meant that patients only received the full vilazodone 40-mg daily dose during the final 6 weeks of the 8-week trial. Additionally, somatic symptoms that frequently complicate diagnosis and treatment of MDD were not evaluated in this analysis since the MADRS assesses only core symptoms and cognitive features of depression. Inclusion/exclusion criteria may also limit the ability to generalize these findings to a more diverse population. Additionally, because significant suicidality was a criterion for exclusion from the study, the sample size for the group of patients with a baseline score &#x02265; 4 (moderate to severe symptom category) on the MADRS suicidal thoughts item was too small to evaluate (placebo: n = 3, vilazodone: n = 4); however, significant improvement was demonstrated in favor of vilazodone versus placebo on the suicidal thoughts item for patients with a baseline score &#x02265; 2 (mild to severe symptom category).</p><p>Strengths of these analyses include the availability of a robust data set from 2 similarly designed large clinical trials, which allowed pooling of data. Despite the inherent limitations of pooling data, doing so for these analyses created a large sample size that allowed for increased statistical power to evaluate MADRS single items and subgroups. The category shifts analysis presents a novel way to evaluate symptoms of depression; tracking symptom improvement from a categorical perspective of worse to better may be a more intuitive way to assess patient well-being than mean change from baseline on a depression rating scale.</p><p>The progression from clinically symptomatic MDD to wellness is marked by the resolution of many symptoms of depression and comorbid anxiety that impair mood and functioning. In these analyses, individual symptom improvement, evaluated by a shift from symptomatic depression or anxious depression to minimal or no symptoms, was observed in a significantly greater proportion of vilazodone-treated patients compared with placebo. These results suggest that vilazodone treatment is associated with clinically relevant changes across depression symptoms in adult patients with MDD.</p><p><bold><italic>Drug names:</italic></bold> citalopram (Celexa and others), vilazodone (Viibryd).</p><p><bold><italic>Funding/support:</italic></bold> Support for this publication was funded by Forest Laboratories, Inc, New York, New York.</p><p><bold><italic>Role of the sponsor:</italic></bold> Forest Laboratories, Inc, contributed to the design and interpretation of this study and preparation, review, and approval of the manuscript.</p><p><bold><italic>Potential conflicts of interest:</italic> Dr Culpepper</bold> has served as an advisor to or consultant for Boehringer Ingelheim, Forest, Janssen, Jazz, H.
