Integral for hemoglobin synthesis, iron also plays an important role in many cellular processes; particularly, oxygen transport and storage, generation of energy through oxidative phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0108042-Beard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and enzyme function affecting intracellular metabolism <xref rid="pone.0108042-Deli1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition, iron assists immune function, DNA synthesis, the functioning of neurotransmitters and the formation of myelin, and is therefore critical for normal brain function and cognitive development <xref rid="pone.0108042-Rattehalli1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Iron status is influenced by both intake from dietary sources and iron loss through sweat and urine <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, gastrointestinal bleeding, menstruation and trauma. In athletes, exercise stress may exacerbate iron loss due to foot-strike hemolysis associated with running <xref rid="pone.0108042-Telford1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Iron deficiencies are common in athletic populations, and frequently manifest through feelings of lethargy, a lack of energy and lowered perceived ability to train and perform <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In clinical terms, iron deficiency is often classified as serum ferritin values below &#x0003c;22 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with iron deficiency anemia diagnosed when iron stores are exhausted (serum ferritin &#x0003c;15 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and consequently hemoglobin (Hb) levels fall below 12 g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0108042-Suominen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, even amongst the medical literature there remains wide debate as to the most appropriate thresholds for diagnosis and when to begin supplementation, particularly in athletes <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nielsen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Iron supplementation, typically via the oral route, is commonly used for the treatment of iron deficiency. Recently, carbohydrate-encased intravenous (IV) compounds such as ferric carboxymaltose have proven successful in treating iron-deficiency anemia <xref rid="pone.0108042-LysengWilliamson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and improving fatigue <xref rid="pone.0108042-Favrat1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> in an outpatient setting. Krayenbuehl et al. <xref rid="pone.0108042-Krayenbuehl1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> examined the effect of IV iron (III)-hydroxide sucrose on fatigue in non-anemic, premenopausal women with serum ferritin &#x0003c;50 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> using a placebo-controlled blinded design. Reduced feelings of perceived fatigue were observed following treatment but without concomitant changes in hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), leading the authors to speculate that the non-hematological functions of iron, namely its involvement in the formation of key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism <xref rid="pone.0108042-Ackrell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108042-McLane1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, were responsible for the observed benefits of the iron treatment.</p><p>Indeed, the chosen delivery route (intravenous as opposed to oral), and subsequent bioavailability of the supplemented iron may also be a contributing factor to relatively novel findings of the Krayenbuehl study <xref rid="pone.0108042-Krayenbuehl2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, Garvican et al. <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> compared the efficacy of 6 weeks of oral versus IV iron supplementation in distance runners with &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; (initial serum ferritin &#x0003c;35 &#x000b5;g.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and transferrin saturation &#x0003c;20%, or serum ferritin &#x0003c;15 &#x000b5;g.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or &#x0201c;suboptimal&#x0201d; (serum ferritin &#x0003c;65 &#x000b5;g.L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) iron status. Whilst both forms of supplementation improved iron status, the increase in serum ferritin was greater in the IV treated group and improvements in hemoglobin mass (Hbmass), maximal aerobic power (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and run time to exhaustion were evident only in the IV treated athletes with initial &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; iron status. Increases in Hbmass were not observed in the &#x0201c;suboptimal&#x0201d; group suggesting that their iron stores did not limit erythropoiesis or aerobic capacity. Unfortunately, neither subjective measures nor performance <italic>per se</italic> were formally assessed by Garvican et al. <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, so conclusions about any other potential benefits (non-hematological or otherwise) of IV iron therapy for an athletic population could not be drawn.</p><p>At present, the optimal iron status for overall wellbeing and training ability (that is, over and above that which is required for erythropoiesis) in athletic populations is unclear. Previous investigations of the benefit of oral supplementation for endurance performance in athletes without a clinical iron deficiency, i.e. &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; iron status, have been equivocal <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nielsen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and as a result, routine supplementation for iron-replete individuals is not encouraged. However the recent findings of Krayenbuehl et al. (2011) suggest that IV iron supplementation may afford some potential benefits unrelated to erythropoiesis or oxygen transport, due to its high bioavailability <xref rid="pone.0108042-Macdougall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> compared with oral supplements <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, which may have consequences for athletic performance and thus permit the topic to be revisited. Nonetheless, the ethical and potential health implications (both long and short term) of IV iron supplementation for athletes considered &#x0201c;clinically normal&#x0201d; in terms of iron status should also be considered, particularly in regard to risk of toxicity and iron overload, and notwithstanding the difficulty in determining the appropriate IV iron dose for such individuals.</p><p>Given the efficacy of the newer formulations of iron (as opposed to oral supplementation) at improving fatigue in clinical settings <xref rid="pone.0108042-Krayenbuehl2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Favrat2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of intravenous iron supplementation on perceived fatigue, mood disturbance, training ability and running performance in non-anemic athletes with clinically normal serum ferritin levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by both the Australian Institute of Sport Human Ethics Committee and the University of Canberra Human Research Ethics Committee.

Each injection was performed by a medical practitioner via an indwelling venous cannula in the forearm after first flushing with 2 ml of 0.9% saline. All participants were monitored for heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and temperature by medical staff prior to administration, and every five minutes for 15 minutes afterwards in case of any adverse reactions. Throughout each injection, the participant's arm was shielded using a screen with the injection solution prepared out of sight. In addition to all athletes, all research staff associated with the testing and training sessions were blinded to the treatment groups and were unable to access blood results, nor preside over the injections. Thus, only the medical staff administering the injections had access to grouping allocation information.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Fatigue and Mood Questionnaires</title><p>Participants were assessed fortnightly for six weeks for their perceptions of fatigue and mood disturbance using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) <xref rid="pone.0108042-Mendoza1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) <xref rid="pone.0108042-Terry1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Terry2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108042-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Supplementation had no acute effects on 3000 m running performance; however iron supplemented athletes decreased their 10&#x000d7;400 m training set time at week 2, and recorded improvements in their perceptions about their preparedness to train, which collectively may indicate a potential training benefit of IV iron for the treatment group.</p><p>The most widely accepted clinical threshold for iron deficiency is 22 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0108042-Suominen2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, where storage iron is exhausted but transport and functional compounds are maintained. When ferritin stores fall below 22 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, functional compounds become compromised, including but not limited to hemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes <xref rid="pone.0108042-Suominen2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, the &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; level for serum ferritin is still unknown in terms of athletic performance and an athlete's ability to train and recover between sessions over weeks or months. Uncertainty is due largely to discrepancies in the literature regarding the effect of iron supplementation, particularly in athletes with &#x02018;normal&#x02019; iron status <xref rid="pone.0108042-Deli1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and hampered by a wide variety of supplementation methods and protocols <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nielsen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the present study, we specifically recruited subjects with clinically normal ferritin levels (30&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), whose Hbmass was therefore unlikely to be compromised <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, in order to investigate possible non-hematological effects of IV iron supplementation; that is, those unrelated to erythropoiesis or oxygen transport, such as subjective wellbeing and training ability.</p><p>Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose supplementation increased serum ferritin throughout the supplementation period. Further, serum ferritin remained elevated by approximately double the pre-treatment levels two weeks following the final injection. However, Hbmass and [Hb] did not change, confirming previous research <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> but also indicating that the observed reductions in fatigue and mood disturbance in the iron treatment group, compared to placebo, were unlikely to be related to oxygen-carrying capacity.</p><p>When storage iron is&#x0003e; 35 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, erythropoiesis and thereby oxygen transport, are unlikely to be affected <xref rid="pone.0108042-Garvican1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, it is possible that if the amount of iron available for the formation of enzymes and compounds associated with muscle metabolism is insufficient, then endurance performance may also become impaired <xref rid="pone.0108042-DellaValle1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Since it would appear that the supplemental iron provided in the present study was not required for the formation of Hb, it is possible that the available iron may have been shuttled towards oxidative enzymes for intracellular metabolism and electron transport <xref rid="pone.0108042-Beard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, in the present study, 3000 m running time was not acutely improved following each injection; indicating neither a direct performance advantage following IV iron administration nor a placebo effect of an injection. Further, although subtle improvements in the 10&#x000d7;400 m training set were observed in the IRON group at week 2, overall our results do not provide compelling evidence for any performance advantage arising from increasing ferritin stores. Of note, however, is the observation that 3000 m performance was worse in the PLACEBO group at week 4, and as a result the IRON group performed significantly better. These findings provide tentative evidence that the IRON group performed more consistently throughout the study, and may be related to improved perceptions of fatigue and well-being as opposed to effects at a metabolic level.</p><p>The presence of blood lactate, a gross indirect measure of anaerobic metabolism, reflects the contribution of each of the body's energy systems with which an exercise effort is undertaken. A decrease in BLa within the IRON group was observed following the week 2 and week 6, 3000 m time trials, which is similar to previous findings <xref rid="pone.0108042-LaManca1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108042-Pedlar1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, whilst PLACEBO recorded higher BLa for comparable run times. Hinton et al. <xref rid="pone.0108042-Hinton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> report that as a result of iron deficits, the oxidative capacity of the muscle is reduced and therefore the workload at which the ventilatory threshold and blood lactate accumulation occurs is lower <xref rid="pone.0108042-Hinton1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Some studies have reported no change in BLa following supplementation <xref rid="pone.0108042-Klingshirn1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Fogelholm1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, but discrepancies in time course of treatment and the chosen modality (most have involved oral supplementation), dosage and study design may have influenced these results. The iron recipients in the present study may thus have improved aspects of their lactate metabolism <xref rid="pone.0108042-Beard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Pedlar1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as a result of treatment effects at a metabolic level, although further investigation is required to confirm this notion.</p><p>Iron deficiency without anemia can result in a greater energy expenditure during a simulated time trial <xref rid="pone.0108042-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> as well as lower exercise tolerance and a more prolonged recovery from exercise <xref rid="pone.0108042-Newhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The IRON group decreased their average 10&#x000d7;400 m time shortly after the second injection, even though their 3000 m and all-out 400 m times did not improve. These results partially support the notion of resilience to an exercise bout and weakly suggest the iron supplemented group may have displayed a greater ability to complete consecutive training sessions whilst carrying potential fatigue from a prior effort. It is possible that improved iron stores may result in greater coping ability and enhanced recovery before the next session, which may in turn facilitate augmented wellbeing and ability to train more effectively, although further research is required.</p><p>There is evidence that iron insufficiencies impact mental function and emotional health as a result of reduced neurotransmitter activity in the brain and central nervous system <xref rid="pone.0108042-Beard1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Iron therapy can result in improved cognitive function <xref rid="pone.0108042-MurrayKolb1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and has been associated with improvements in memory, energy and mood <xref rid="pone.0108042-Yehuda1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, as well as improvement in subjective feelings of physical fitness and performance <xref rid="pone.0108042-Nachtigall1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This is supported by data in the present study where the recipients of IV iron reported improvement in total fatigue and total mood disturbance, in addition to an improvement in their training diary scores relating to readiness to train, energy levels and ease of getting out of bed. By contrast, some studies have reported that iron supplementation has no significant effect on deficiency symptoms, mood state <xref rid="pone.0108042-Risser1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> or quality of life <xref rid="pone.0108042-Vaucher1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. The discrepancy may be due to the oral treatment modality examined by earlier researchers, which may not deliver enough bioavailable iron for substantial cognitive improvements.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Despite careful pair matching of subjects based on initial ferritin, Hbmass and performance characteristics, the PLACEBO group reported lower fatigue scores on the one of the two questionnaire scales (BFI) at the start of the study. The BFI is a tool typically used to assess cancer-related fatigue but has been used previously in a non-athletic population to assess iron related fatigue <xref rid="pone.0108042-Krayenbuehl2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; whereas the BRUMS was developed for assessment of mood (including fatigue) in performance environments. The difference in baseline scores using the BFI highlights that the presence of fatigue symptoms is not solely related to initial ferritin level. Nonetheless, when the difference in change scores of both scales (BRUMS and BFI) was analyzed, a superiority of the IRON group over the PLACEBO group was observed, indicating a possible role of supplemental iron in the reduction of perceived fatigue and an improvement in overall mood. It should also be noted that whilst improvements were observed in the self-reported training diary scores of the IRON group, this method of reporting is only typically used in an applied sport model as opposed to a clinical setting.</p><p>No clear acute or chronic benefits of iron supplementation on 3000 m running performance were observed although consistently similar performances were evident throughout which was not the case in the PLACEBO group. Measuring a true maximal effort of an individual as well as obtaining optimal performance on a particular day, remain inherently difficult <xref rid="pone.0108042-Gore1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The very nature of simulated performance testing means that is nearly impossible to mimic real-life competition through a time trial or simulated laboratory test, which may explain some early research reporting no improvement in performance post-supplementation even in iron-deficient participants <xref rid="pone.0108042-Klingshirn1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Fogelholm1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108042-Peeling1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. A further limitation to consider is that our total monitoring period was possibly too short, particularly since we did not follow the 10&#x000d7;400 m training set at two weeks post injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Implications</title><p>This study demonstrated improvements in fatigue and mood disturbance in the IRON group during a 6 week training period. Whether or not such improvements in fatigue and mood (potentially arising from elevated ferritin levels) may lead to better training quality and subsequently improved performance over a longer period of time cannot be determined from this study. However, the long term or repeated use of iron supplementation in athletes who are not iron deficient should not be advocated. In the short-term, the efficacy of IV Iron supplementation for athletes with moderate ferritin levels also requires careful consideration, because a performance improvement remains unclear. For this reason the data in this study do not provide strong evidence for IV iron supplementation in athletes with clinically normal ferritin levels, especially when taking into account the ethical and potential health implications of sustained iron supplementation for iron replete individuals. Specifically, the potential risk of toxicity and iron overload following IV administration must be acknowledged, particularly since the primary route for regulating whole body iron stores is bypassed using this method, allowing ferritin levels to be elevated rapidly. Therefore, IV injections should not be administered without first assessing existing iron stores, and careful consideration of the total dose to be given, and its likely impact on whole body iron stores, is required. IV iron should only be administered under medical supervision, with patients closely monitored for adverse reactions. Follow-up tests should also be conducted to ensure ferritin levels do not exceed healthy limits. Lastly, researchers need to be acutely up to date with any changes to the World Anti-Doping Agency code when planning future research with elite athletes <xref rid="pone.0108042-Howman1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Four weeks of IV ferric carboxymaltose supplementation doubled serum ferritin, and decreased feelings of fatigue and mood disturbance in non-anemic athletes with initial ferritin levels in the clinically normal range of 30&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> without associated changes in Hbmass. Running performance was not acutely affected by iron supplementation, but there was some evidence from self-reported training diaries that participants felt more able to train. Together, these results indicate a potential psychobiological influence of iron supplementation on feelings of mood and fatigue in athletic populations with clinically normal serum ferritin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would sincerely like to thank the staff from AIS Physiology, AIS Medicine, and AIS Biochemistry for their assistance during data collection, as well as the athletes for their participation in the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0108042-Beard1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
