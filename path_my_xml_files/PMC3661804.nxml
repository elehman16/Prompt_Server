Seventy-one community-dwelling older adults and 151 younger adults were randomized to attend a structured behavioral group, an attention control group, or one-to-one education.</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We measured A1C, self-care (3-day pedometer readings, blood glucose checks, and frequency of self-care), and psychosocial factors (quality of life, diabetes distress, frustration with self-care, depression, self-efficacy, and coping styles) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both older (age 67 &#x000b1; 5 years, A1C 8.7 &#x000b1; 0.8%, duration 20 &#x000b1; 12 years, 30% type 1 diabetes, 83% white, 41% female) and younger (age 47 &#x000b1; 9 years, A1C 9.2 &#x000b1; 1.2%, 18 &#x000b1; 12 years with diabetes, 59% type 1 diabetes, 82% white, 55% female) adults had improved A1C equally over time. Importantly, older and younger adults in the group conditions improved more and maintained improvements at 12 months (older structured behavioral group change in A1C &#x02212;0.72 &#x000b1; 1.4%, older control group &#x02212;0.65 &#x000b1; 0.9%, younger behavioral group &#x02212;0.55 &#x000b1; 1.2%, younger control group &#x02212;0.43 &#x000b1; 1.7%).

Meta-analyses of small diabetes education studies suggested that these interventions improve self-care and glycemic control, particularly when a behavioral intervention is incorporated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and supported that group-based education improves diabetes control in both the short and the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). These findings have been confirmed in a recent randomized controlled trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although these studies have led to much emphasis on improving diabetes self-management and adherence to diabetes treatment prescriptions, minimal attention has been focused on the diabetes education needs of older adults.</p><p>Roughly 27% (&#x0223c;11 million) of all adults aged &#x02265;65 years have diabetes, the majority (90&#x02013;95%) of whom have type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Despite the large numbers of older adults with diabetes, how to best provide diabetes self-management support to this group remains unclear because of limited randomized controlled trial data. Older adults (aged &#x02265;60 years) often are underrepresented in diabetes education interventions because of subtle changes in their functional, cognitive, and psychosocial statuses, which may affect diabetes self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Consequently, evidence-based guidelines for this age group are not well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Although their physical and mental capacities may deteriorate over time, older adults&#x02019; ability to learn and manage diabetes may not diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, thorough and systematic evaluation of diabetes education interventions for older adults is needed to provide evidence-based clinical care. In a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), we examined whether community-dwelling older adults (aged 60&#x02013;75 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes would benefit from self-management interventions similarly to younger and middle-aged adults. We also examined whether older adults would benefit from group versus individual self-management interventions.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Design</title><p>This report describes a secondary analysis of data from a three-arm, parallel design randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of a highly structured behavioral diabetes intervention in improving glycemic control in patients with long-duration, poorly controlled diabetes through comparisons with standard group education and individual education. The methods are reported in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The highly structured experimental arm comprised a five-session (over 6 weeks), manual-based group diabetes education program of specific cognitive behavioral strategies and techniques for implementing self-care behaviors. Highly structured behavioral information included detailed self-care goal setting facilitated by the educators and modeling of behavior and problem-solving skills to help participants to identify and address barriers to self-care. For example, each participant was required to check his or her glucose levels 6&#x02013;8 times a day. During the classes, educators discussed glucose logs with the goal of helping participants to learn how food, medication, and exercise affected their glucose levels and possible actions they could take when levels were out of range. Additionally, each week, participants set broad goals (e.g., lose weight) and then more-specific goals (e.g., lose 1 lb this week). Participants wrote detailed steps for how they planned to accomplish each goal. At the next class, participants evaluated whether they performed the steps and whether the steps worked. If the steps did not work, participants reformulated their plans. The attention control arm consisted of a 5-session (over 6 weeks) manual-based, standard group diabetes education program. The attention control arm was matched to the structured experimental arm for <italic>1</italic>) group classes, <italic>2</italic>) diabetes education content (nutrition, exercise, medication, foot care, etc.), and <italic>3</italic>) length of time and amount of contact with educators. The individual control arm comprised unlimited one-to-one sessions with diabetes educators for 6 months during which participants could discuss any aspect of their diabetes self-management. All education was facilitated by separate teams of experienced certified diabetes educators (nurses and dietitians).</p><p>The highly structured experimental arm was held in the behavioral research laboratory classroom, and the attention and individual control arms were held in the Joslin Clinic. All group sessions were separated by type of diabetes. Written curriculum, preapproved education materials, separate educator trainings, investigator observation of group education, and separate teams of trained, experienced diabetes educators prevented carryover of the education strategies and ensured integrity of the interventions. The Joslin Diabetes Center Committee on Human Subjects approved the protocol and all recruitment procedures and materials. All participants provided informed, written consent before participation.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Adults aged 18&#x02013;75 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (A1C &#x02265;7.5%) for at least 2 years, free of severe complications, and taking insulin or oral medications for 1 year were eligible for enrollment. Exclusion criteria were an inability to read and speak English; current or unplanned pregnancy; initiation of insulin treatment within 1 year; participation in diabetes education 6 months earlier; untreated proliferative retinopathy; severe complications of diabetes, including renal disease (albumin/creatinine &#x0003e;300 &#x003bc;g/mg); severe peripheral diabetic neuropathy, severe peripheral vascular disease, or severe arthritis that prevented brisk walking; symptomatic severe autonomic neuropathy; and a history of severe, unstable myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or other severe cardiac disease; or severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure &#x02265;160/90 mmHg). Other exclusion criteria were dementia, mental retardation, organic mental disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, drug or alcohol abuse, and eating disorders. These exclusions were made to avoid confounding factors related to severe comorbidities, concurrent significant changes in mental status, and the effects of ongoing psychiatric treatment. Individuals with treated or stable major depression were eligible for participation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed through telephone screening, medical chart review, and a screening visit. Eligible participants were scheduled for a baseline and a randomization visit.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Randomization</title><p>Block randomization by type of diabetes was used to randomize participants to one of the three study groups.

The data show that compared with the younger adults in this study, the older adults received equal glycemic benefit from participating in self-management interventions, and this finding did not differ by type of diabetes. Moreover, older adults showed the greatest glycemic improvement in the two group interventions, with both groups achieving clinically significant improvements in A1C (&#x02265;0.5%). Of note, both older and younger adults in the group conditions maintained their A1C improvements similarly at 12 months postintervention. Finally, the diabetes self-management interventions had a positive impact on older and younger participants&#x02019; diabetes self-care and psychosocial outcomes.</p><p>Improving diabetes self-management is important for improved health outcomes and reducing the economic burden of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

However, the majority of diabetes education programs are designed for younger patients or more recently diagnosed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). As a result, only minimal progress has been made in the development of and evidence for successful interventions for older adults with diabetes, despite the emphasis on improving diabetes education interventions over the past 15&#x02013;20 years.</p><p>In the present study, we showed that older adults (aged 60&#x02013;75 years) compared with younger adults with diabetes received equal glycemic and psychosocial benefits from participating in self-management interventions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these older adults were able to participate fully and improve glycemic control in both group and individual diabetes education. These findings are consistent with other diabetes education outcomes among older adults with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). We also showed that older adults, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, received equal or more benefit from participating in group diabetes education classes compared with individual education. One possible explanation for this finding was the intensity of the group interventions. Participants randomized to group education received five 2-h sessions over 6 weeks that were devoted to nutrition, medication management, exercise, and blood glucose monitoring. Many interventions do not match the frequency and duration of education that we provided in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Limitations to the study include the homogeneity of the study sample with regard to race/ethnicity (&#x0223c;18% minority), education, and participant self-selection. Finally, we did not recruit adults aged &#x02265;76 years because these individuals may present with unique clinical (e.g., comorbidity, complications) and functional (e.g., impairment, disability) challenges that require special attention. For example, older diabetes patients are at greater risk for several geriatric syndromes, including depression, cognitive impairment, injurious falls, neuropathic pain, and urinary incontinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). These syndromes can have a deleterious effect on diabetes self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), health status, and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, the value of group versus individual diabetes education needs to be evaluated in the age &#x02265;76 population. Importantly, future diabetes behavioral interventions need to address changes in older adult functional, cognitive, and psychosocial states and how best to assess and address these factors.</p><p>Diabetes self-management intervention is an important component of diabetes care for older adults. Importantly, the findings suggest that older adults up to age 75 receive equal or more benefit from participating in group versus individual interventions, and compared with younger adults, older adults receive equal glycemic benefit from participating in group diabetes education. Thus, clinicians can safely recommend group diabetes education classes for older patients with poor glycemic control. As the U.S. population ages and develops diabetes at a rapid rate, more high-quality research is needed to understand how normal aging processes influence how older adults learn about and take care of diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
