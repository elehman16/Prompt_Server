Disability was assessed using change in single (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS], timed 25-foot walk [T25FW], and 9-hole peg test [9HPT]) and composite disability measures (EDSS/T25FW, EDSS/9HPT, and EDSS/T25FW/9HPT).

The 3-part composite measure was associated with more CDP events (41.4% and 63.9% of patients at 12 and 24 months, respectively) than the 2-part measure (EDSS/T25FW [38.5% and 59.5%, respectively]) and any single measure.

Combination endpoints were defined as progression by EDSS or T25FW, 9HPT or T25FW, or by EDSS or T25FW or 9HPT. The PASAT was not included in this analysis of the PROMiSe database because of the potential for practice effects occurring from repeated administration. Moreover, the test may have limited measurement reliability, is sometimes difficult to administer, has been used less frequently in recent MS trials, and is not anticipated to be featured in future trials.</p><p>As per the PROMiSe study protocol, worsening of the EDSS was defined as a change from baseline of &#x02265;1 point (for baseline EDSS 3.0&#x02013;5.0) or &#x02265;0.5 points (for baseline EDSS 5.5&#x02013;6.5).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Worsening of the T25FW was defined as an increase of &#x02265;20% compared with baseline or as the inability to complete the T25FW after baseline due to worsening disability (increase of EDSS to 7.0 or higher).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Worsening of the 9HPT was defined as an increase of &#x02265;20% compared with baseline (calculated as the average across 4 trials: 2 in the dominant hand and 2 in the nondominant hand) or as the inability to complete the 9HPT after baseline due to worsening disability.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> For each measure, rates of unconfirmed disability progression (UDP) and of 3-month CDP were determined.</p><p>Two trial methodologies were evaluated: cumulative and cross-sectional.

For summaries by month, 1 month was defined as 28 days. For confirmed disability events, patients who experienced a worsening event in the measure of interest that could not be confirmed due to the patient's discontinuation from the trial prior to the confirmation visit were censored at the time of the worsening. Other patients who did not experience the progression event were censored at their last day in the study. Cross-sectional progression rates were determined by comparing baseline and follow-up disability measures. Patients missing any of the 3 disability measures at baseline, the time point of interest, or the corresponding confirmation assessment were excluded from the analysis. The relative percentage contribution of each disability measure to disease progression rates observed for the combined EDSS or T25FW or 9HPT measure was derived by determining the number of individual patients progressing on 1, 2, or all 3 outcomes measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 316 patients were assigned to receive placebo in the PROMiSe study; 314 of these patients had a postbaseline EDSS assessment, and these patients constituted the population for the cumulative analyses presented here.

The 3-part combination measure (EDSS or T25FW 20% or 9HPT 20%) was associated with more 3-month CDP events (41.4% and 63.9% of patients as 12 and 24 months, respectively) than the 2-part measure (EDSS or T25FW 20% [38.5% and 59.5%, respectively]), and more progression events than any single measure (EDSS, 14.9% and 32.4%, respectively; T25FW, 33.5% and 52.0%, respectively; 9HPT, 8.4% and 18.0%, respectively).</p><p>Minimal changes in the 9HPT 20% outcome were noted over the course of the PROMiSe trial. As such, this measure may be less suitable than EDSS and T25FW 20% when used alone; however, 9HPT may still have utility as part of a composite measure. Moreover, future studies should explore thresholds other than 20% worsening on performance measures such as 9HPT.</p><p>A marked difference was noted between cumulative and cross-sectional progression rates, which may inform the design of PPMS trials. Cumulative progression rates were generally higher than cross-sectional rates, but more strikingly, there was a greater difference between unconfirmed and CDP using the cumulative approach. Based on our results, the normative approach to use CDP in classic randomized controlled trials is supported. Failure to confirm disability progression may have a neurobiological basis or may be due to measurement unreliability; it would be preferable to exclude these from pivotal trial analyses in both cases. For trials using the cross-sectional approach, measures of UDP may still be feasible. Such studies would be resource-sparing and less burdensome for participants, but would have acknowledged data sparsity and methodological limitations.</p><p>The observations presented here add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that combining specific disability measurements may be more useful in the clinical trial setting for assessing progression in patients with PPMS than single measures.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In a retrospective database study of 181 patients with progressive MS (primary 47% of patients and secondary 53% of patients), combining change in T25FW with EDSS was significantly more predictive of patient prognosis than EDSS alone.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> An earlier retrospective database study of 161 patients with PPMS found that when comparing single measures or 2-instrument combinations involving EDSS, T25FW, and 9HPT, T25FW/9HPT predicted the greatest number of progression events after 1 year (46% of patients progressed compared with 17%, 34%, and 20% for the individual measures, respectively), and the combination of T25FW/EDSS predicted the greatest number of progression events after the second year (57% of patients progressed compared with 32%, 46%, and 24% for the individual measures, respectively).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> An evaluation of data from the 96-week Olympus (rituximab) trial<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in the 147 patients with PPMS randomized to placebo found that a combined measure consisting of EDSS/T25FW/9HPT was associated with more CDP events than did any single or dual combination measure.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Progression rates at 96 weeks were 61.9% and 54.8% for those patients with an initial confirmed progression event at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Confirmed progression rates for EDSS alone were 38.5% and 30.4%; for T25FW alone the rates were 51.0% and 44.5%; and for the 9HPT alone the rates were 21.1% and 17.4%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Most recently, the large, prospective INFORMS (fingolimod) study, comprising patients with PPMS treated for at least 3 years, reported that a composite of EDSS, T25FW, or 9HPT predicted more progression events (80.3% cumulative probability of CDP) than any of the individual components alone (EDSS 58.7%, T25FW 70.0%, and 9HPT 41.3% of patients) among those randomized to placebo.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Although those previous published studies offer similar conclusions to this study regarding the relative utility of outcome measures, they differ in several important ways that distinguish them from our analysis of the PROMiSe data set. The retrospective database study included both primary and secondary progressive patients with MS, was primarily focused on outcomes of early vs late changes on clinical scales, included patients who were exposed to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during the course of the study, did not set a minimum disability criterion as per EDSS for study entry, and included less-frequent patient assessment.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Similarly, the earlier study likely included patients exposed to DMTs, while its entry criteria included an EDSS threshold score of 2.0&#x02013;6.5, representing a less-disabled patient population than that of the PROMiSe study.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The same EDSS criteria applied to the Olympus study, whereas none of these 3 studies, nor the INFORMS study, compared confirmed with unconfirmed progression or offered a cross-sectional analysis of disease progression data.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Two other recently published studies address similar themes and arrive at compatible conclusions to those of this study.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In one of these studies, however, the patient population consisted entirely of those with secondary progressive MS,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> whereas the other had a lower EDSS inclusion threshold (1&#x02013;7), allowed inclusion of patients who had been treated with DMTs as recently as 3 months prior to study entry, and was intended as a validation study of a novel disability score (CombiWISE); that scoring measure, in addition to EDSS, T25FW, and 9HPT, also includes the Scripps Neurological Rating Scale.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> And, as with the previously noted studies, neither unconfirmed disease nor a cross-sectional analysis was included in the design of these studies.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, this study offers several unique features that make it a potentially valuable contribution to the literature, such as reflecting the untreated natural history of PPMS by including only patients receiving placebo, including patients with more severe disability, comparing confirmed and unconfirmed disease progression, and including a cross-sectional analysis.</p><p>There is an unmet need for controlling disease progression in patients with PPMS. For these patients, individual measures of disease progression may limit the potential to assess the benefit of new agents to the extent that the composite measures have higher event rates. Based on the observations presented here and those from previous studies, future studies of agents for the treatment of PPMS may benefit from either using T25FW 20% as a single outcome measure or using T25FW 20% in combination with the EDSS as a primary efficacy endpoint rather than EDSS alone, particularly if higher event rates over shorter exposure periods are sought. It is largely unknown whether specific disability outcomes would differentially detect treatment effects or whether this would differ according to the mechanism of the treatment under study.</p></sec>
