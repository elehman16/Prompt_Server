However, despite treatment, addictions such as alcohol dependence are characterized by high relapse rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For 1-year outcomes across alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drug abuse, more than 85% of patients relapse within 1 year of treatment.</p><p>Many factors are implicated in the genesis, escalation and maintenance of addiction. Here some known predictors of alcohol use are discussed before we introduce a relatively new approach to target some of these mechanisms in order to reduce drinking behavior. A multi-factorial approach is adopted to gain insight into possible mechanisms of change regarding this approach.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Mediators, moderators and predictors of alcohol use and relapse</title><p>Addiction can be conceptualized as a cyclic process of anticipation, intoxication, and withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The anticipation stage is considered a key element of relapse and often takes the form of intense craving. Craving refers to a compelling or intense urge, desire or intention to ingest a drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. High baseline levels of alcohol craving may define a subtype of alcohol dependence that is less responsive to treatment and predict the chance of relapse after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition to craving itself it may be interesting to look at related concepts, such as desire thinking and rumination, which seem to augment craving.</p><p>Desire thinking refers to the elaboration of cognitions and imagery in working memory which may escalate craving intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It correlates with escalating levels of drinking status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Desire thinking is regarded as a specific type of perseverative thinking, such as rumination or worry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, rumination predicts long term outcomes of addiction treatment in alcohol-dependent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Rumination increases craving in alcohol-dependent drinkers but not in problem and social drinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. So both desire thinking and rumination increase or intensify craving. Since rumination results in increased negative affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it is no surprise that both low positive and high negative affect are associated with relapse in addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So when levels of desire thinking and rumination are reduced, craving and negative affect may also be reduced, which would result in lower relapse rates.</p><p>In addition to these subjective processes, automatic implicit processes such as attentional biases have also been implicated in the maintenance of addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since alcohol attentional biases have a reciprocal excitatory relationship with craving, reductions in attentional bias should predict reductions in craving and drinking behavior. Whereas craving, desire thinking, rumination and negative affect are typically measured by subjective participant report, the strength of implicit processes may be measured more objectively in paradigms using changes in reaction times as primary outcome.</p><p>Other known predictors of alcohol treatment outcome which will be assessed in this study are baseline alcohol consumption, dependence severity, employment, gender, psychopathology rating, treatment history, motivation, socioeconomic status/income and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Increased self-efficacy during treatment predicts a positive treatment outcome while an excess of self-efficacy can be inconsistent with the actual ability of a patient to resist use and may result in drop-out.</p><p>In sum, there is a large body of research on predictors of alcohol treatment outcome. These factors should be taken into account when aiming to reduce relapse rates since they can help identify at an early stage which interventions may have the highest clinical effectiveness over time. In addition, they provide important targets for direct intervention.</p><p>In this study we focus on an approach which targets episodic drug memories to reduce craving, alcohol consumption and relapse rates: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research on EMDR in addiction</title><p>EMDR is a structured treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The core of the procedure entails the identification and reactivation of specific memory representations in working memory while the patient follows the therapist&#x02019;s horizontal hand movements with her or his eyes. Since this taxes working memory and working memory is limited in capacity, the eye movements compete for attention with the reactivated memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Every 30 seconds, the patient reports spontaneous associations, which form the focus of attention during a new set of eye movements. Over time the memory representation gets less vivid and emotionally charged (&#x02018;desensitisized&#x02019;) while a new, more adaptive self-perspective tends to arise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The EMDR procedure can also be used to desensitize dysfunctional positive memory representations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or that of anticipated events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Research has clearly demonstrated EMDR&#x02019;s effect in the treatment of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Some have suggested that, on the basis of an emerging body of research, EMDR may be regarded as a general model for psychotherapy for a wider range of conditions, such as addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, research on the efficacy and effectiveness of EMDR on addiction is still limited, consisting mostly of anecdotal reports or case studies of substance-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] as well as behavioral addictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although most of these reports and case studies found positive results, some found mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] or negative results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The interpretation of results is further complicated by the fact that different approaches were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>To date, one RCT has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Detoxified, in-patient alcohol dependent patients received TAU plus two one-hour sessions of EMDR targeting memory representations of intense craving or relapse. Controls received TAU only. Decreased craving at 1-month follow-up, as well as a lower relapse rate at 1- and 6-month follow-up were found in the experimental group. However, the sample size was small (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;34), attrition was high, assessment depended fully on self-report and treatment was applied by the researcher. This raises questions about the actual efficacy and effectiveness of EMDR. In addition, although no adverse effects were reported, this study showed that relapse or study drop-out rates may still be substantial and should be taken into account when determining the feasibility of the treatment.</p><p>In sum, although limited data and methodological issues prohibit firm conclusions, further research on the efficacy of EMDR in addiction is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective &#x02013; effects of treatment on drinking behavior</title><p>This study examines the efficacy and effectiveness of EMDR&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU versus TAU only on drinking behaviour in a sample of alcohol dependent participants.</p><p>We operationalize drinking behavior as: a) changes in number of heavy drinking days (days on which&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5 standard drinks of alcohol are consumed); b) time to first alcohol drink (only relevant if abstinence was reached before the previous assessment); c) changes in total drinks consumed in the past 30 days; and d) changes in average drinks per occasion in the past 30 days (total drinks divided by drinking days).

The authors state that self-efficacy should not be considered a stable quality of a person, but depends on the situation in which the person finds oneself. Three correlated dimensions were found: environmental factors, negative mood and positive mood. SELD scores correlated as expected with severity of drug use. Although it is a reliable and valid instrument to measure self-efficacy in substance users, test-retest reliability and predictive validity remains to be established.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Measurements &#x02013; effects on quality of life</title><sec id="FPar14"><title>EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]</title><p>The EQ-5D is a short (14 VAS scales (0&#x02013;100)) generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient-report questionnaire which assesses 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Responses in each dimension are divided into three ordinal levels coded: no, moderate or extreme problems. Test-retest reliability and convergent validity are satisfactory in different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] but the EQ-5D may show a moderate ceiling effect, thus indices seem less responsive for detecting meaningful clinical differences in alcohol-dependent patients compared to other instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar15"><title>Community reinforcement approach happiness scale (CRA-HS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>])</title><p>The CRA-HS is a multidimensional instrument that examines a wide variety of life areas on 10-point Likert scales. It forms the foundation of a CRA treatment plan and is used to determine individuals&#x02019; current &#x0201c;happiness&#x0201d; in terms of satisfaction or quality of life. It casts light on the severity of problems for each area and subsequently can be used to evaluate treatment outcome by repeatedly assessing changes that occur during treatment. The instrument encompasses life areas such as drinking (or illegal drug use), household, job/education, money management, social life, personal habits, romantic relation, family relationships, legal issues, emotional life, communication, health and general happiness. Preliminary results show that the instrument has overall satisfactory internal consistency and sensitivity to changes over a follow-up period of a month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, scores correlated with the level of rewarding activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Measurements &#x02013; safety, acceptability and feasibility of treatment</title><p>All regular care providers, EMDR therapists involved in the study, treatment supervisors and physicians have been instructed to report adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) which may arise during treatment. At T1 all regular therapists are e-mailed with questions about possible SAE that may have gone unreported between T0 and T1. In addition, all participants are questioned about possible AE and SAE at all time-points. Finally, participants in the EMDR&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU group keep a daily diary during EMDR treatment in which they are instructed to report (S)AE.</p><p>At each time-point participants answer questions about opinions and expectations regarding the treatment (be it TAU or EMDR&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU) they received, the credibility and burden of treatment. In addition, at the end (completed or not) of each EMDR treatment, the EMDR therapist is required to answer some exit-questions regarding the feasibility of the treatment for this particular participant. More generally, before the first and after the last EMDR treatment in the data collection phase EMDR therapists fill in a questionnaire about their opinions and expectations regarding the EMDR training and supervision, the credibility and burden of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Fidelity checks</title><p>EMDR therapists receive one full and two half-days of training in the EMDR treatment protocol. All EMDR therapists will be supervised by an EMDR consultant to guide optimal application of the treatment protocol. Monthly, two-hour group supervision supports the EMDR therapist for the whole duration of the data collection phase. Between supervision sessions, the consultant is available for consultation by email. All EMDR treatment sessions will be videotaped. A random selection will be rated for treatment fidelity by several independent raters with EMDRIA approved basic training. Deviations from the protocol will be reported to the consultant and EMDR therapist.</p><p>Since participants are randomized and TAU is therefore assumed equal in both groups, no fidelity checks are done regarding TAU.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Analyses</title><p>All analyses will be executed using SPSS. Summary tables will be provided for all baseline, end of treatment and follow-up variables. Data will be summarised using frequency tables (with confidence intervals when applicable), and descriptive statistics (mean, median, interquartile range, number and percentages of participants and two-sided, 95% confidence intervals when appropriate).</p><p>Changes in the number of heavy drinking days in the past 30 days will be used to analyze the efficacy and effectiveness of EMDR. Since this primary outcome variable is continuous, a repeated measures ANOVA will be carried out with 2 group (EMDR&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU versus TAU) and 4 time (pre-, post-treatment, 1 and 6 month follow-up) factors. Randomization stratum will be used as a covariate. Effect sizes will be calculated.</p><p>All allocated participants will be included in the primary analysis (intention-to-treat, ITT). Since an ideal ITT requires a complete set of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], multiple imputation (or a similar strategy) will be used for missing data, if possible. In addition a per-protocol (PP or completers) analysis will be done. ITT analyses will provide insight into the effectiveness of the treatment in real life whereas PP analysis gives insight into the efficacy or the ability for the treatment to reach its intended effect under ideal circumstances.</p><p>Repeated measures of continuous secondary variables such as time to first alcohol consumption, number of total drinks consumed and average drinks per occasion in the past 30 days, severity of the dependence, level of rumination, negative affect, desire thinking, craving, coping self-efficacy, quality of life, biomarkers will be analyzed by carrying out a repeated measures ANOVA with 2 group (EMDR&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU versus TAU) and 3 (post treatment versus 1 versus 6 month follow-up: time to first drink variable derived from TLFB data) or 4 time (pre- versus post-treatment versus 1 versus 6 month follow-up: all other data) factors.</p><p>Distribution of premature treatment termination (PTT), a categorical variable, will be analysed using chi-square tests. A range of baseline clinical characteristics potentially associated with subsequent PTT will be examined. A logistic regression analysis will be conducted to examine the relative contribution of key variables to PTT status. A Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curve will be used to illustrate the distribution of PTT prior to the completion threshold at session 5.</p><p>Group equivalence will be analyzed using independent t-tests to compare the experimental with the control group on continuous baseline or pretreatment measures of severity and duration of alcohol dependence, motivation to change, coping self-efficacy, quality of life, craving, desire thinking, rumination, negative affect and biomarker levels of GGT and CDT. Group equivalence of categorical variables, such as level of education, history of other substance use, specific contents of TAU use of anti-craving, abstinence enforcing or other psychoactive medication during the study treatment phase and co morbidity will be analyzed using chi-square tests.</p><p>Variables such as use of anti-craving, abstinence enforcing or other psychoactive medication, time-in-treatment, craving, rumination, negative affect and desire thinking at T0, may be used as covariates after determining correlations with other primary and secondary outcome measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT aims to extend previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] by including a larger number of participants, using reaction time tasks and bloodsamples in addition to participant-report questionnaires and scales, excludes the principal investigator from treatment and data-collection and uses an outpatient instead of an inpatient setting. A strength of the study is that it is a multi-site trial, enhancing the internal and external validity of the interventions. Another strength is that the exclusion criteria are limited, enhancing the generalizability of findings. In addition, by identifying mediators, moderators and predictors of treatment outcome theoretical models of relapse may be expanded.</p><p>The main goal of the study is to determine whether EMDR, when added to TAU, reduces drinking behavior and relapse rates further than TAU only. Even a relative small effect size may be relevant, when achieved with a limited dose of EMDR. In addition, EMDR may provide an important adjunct to current treatment options for patients suffering from craving, negative affect and rumination. In both cases the quality of life is expected to improve.</p><p>Finally, the study is aimed at establishing whether the application of EMDR aimed at addiction is feasible and safe in this patient population, even when patients still use substances. Clinicians may be hesitant to use EMDR in this population because they fear triggering craving and subsequent relapse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>Currently recruiting participants and started with data collection.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACRA</term><def><p>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUDIT</term><def><p>Alcohol use disorders identification test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDT</term><def><p>Carbohydrate-deficient transferrin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIDI</term><def><p>Composite international diagnostic interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRA</term><def><p>Community reinforcement approach</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRA-HS</term><def><p>Community reinforcement approach happiness scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV-TR</term><def><p>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTQ</term><def><p>Desire thinking questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMDR</term><def><p>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D&#x02122;</term><def><p>EuroQol - 5 dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACT</term><def><p>Function assertive community therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GGT</term><def><p>serum &#x003b3;-glutamyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAT</term><def><p>Implicit association task</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MATE</term><def><p>Measurements in the addictions for triage and evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDFT</term><def><p>Multidimensional family therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>M.I.N.I.-plus</term><def><p>M.I.N.I. international neuropsychiatric interview-plus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PACS</term><def><p>Penn alcohol craving scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PANAS</term><def><p>Positive and negative affect schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PANAS-SF</term><def><p>Positive and negative affect schedule &#x02013; short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTQ</term><def><p>Perseverative thinking questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTSD</term><def><p>Posttraumatic stress disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p>Research assistant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCQ-D</term><def><p>Readiness to change questionnaire - dutch version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SELD</term><def><p>Self-efficacy list for drug users</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLFB</term><def><p>Timeline followback</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WM was primarily responsible for the design of the study and drafted the manuscript.
