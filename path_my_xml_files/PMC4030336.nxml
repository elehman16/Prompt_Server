Tinea corporis and tinea cruris is the dermatophytosis of glabrous skin and groin, respectively.</p><p>Topical preparations with good local bioavailability are the commonly used and preferred first line agents in the treatment of localized dermatophytosis. Their improved efficacy aims to shorten the treatment period with fewer side effects. Ease of application, enhanced patient compliance, and minimal recurrences also add to the therapeutic response.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Newer topical antifungal agents like eberconazole, sertaconazole, luliconazole, etc., also belong to azole group of antifungal agents.</p><p>Eberconazole is a novel topical broad spectrum fungistatic imidazole derivative with a mode of action similar to that of other azole antifungals, namely inhibition of fungal lanosterol 14-demethylase. It has been shown to have broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity to be effective in dermatophytosis, candidiasis, and infection by other yeasts such as <italic>Malassezzia furfur</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Terbinafine hydrochloride is one of the fungicidal allylamine group of drugs with broad spectrum of antifungal activity. It interferes with fungal sterol biosynthesis at an early stage. It also inhibits squalene epoxidase, leading to intracellular accumulation of toxic squalene and fungal cell death.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge there is no study available at present that compares the clinical efficacy of topical terbinafine and eberconazole cream in treatment of tinea corporis and tinea cruris. The present study aims to compare the clinical response of topical eberconazole, a fungistatic agent with terbinafine cream, which is fungicidal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized control trial with two arms compares the clinical efficacy and side effects of topical terbinafine hydrochloride 1% vs eberconazole nitrate 1% cream in the treatment of localized (&#x0003c;20% involvement) tinea corporis and tinea cruris. The trial was conducted at the Dermatology department of J. N. Medical College &#x00026; AVBRH, Sawangi during the period December 2010 to November 2011. Patients were randomized into group A (odd numbers) and group B (even numbers): Group A (treated with terbinafine cream) and group B (treated with eberconazole cream). A total of 42 patients were enrolled in the study, 22 in group A and 20 in group B. However, seven patients of group A and five patients of group B were lost to follow-up. Therefore, the final sample size was of 30 patients with 15 patients each in group A and group B. Patients in group A and B were treated with topical 1% terbinafine hydrochloride and 1% eberconazole nitrate cream respectively, twice daily for 3 weeks. The inclusion criteria included untreated patients of dermatophytosis of all age groups, involvement of less than 20% of body surface area, and patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by KOH mount. Exclusion criteria were patients of resolving dermatophytoses, patients already on topical and systemic antifungal treatment, involvement of more than 20% body surface area (BSA), and patients with immunosuppressive disease or on immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>Diagnosis was made on clinical and mycological (KOH and culture) grounds. All the patients had similar demographic features with regards to age, sex, and duration of disease. They were followed up every week to note the efficacy and any adverse effects such as local erythema, swelling, stinging sensation, or increased itching for a total duration of 3 weeks. The patients were graded for improvement in signs and symptoms of each clinical parameter, namely, itching, erythema, papules, pustules, vesicles, and scaling. The overall improvement was graded as grade I (25% improvement), grade II (50% improvement), grade III (75% improvement), and grade IV (100% improvement). KOH mount and culture was done weekly up to 3 weeks to assess mycological cure. Fungal culture was done on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide.</p><p>We performed the mycological assessment at baseline, at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> week and also with minimal scales available at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> week.</p><p>Mycological cure was defined as negative KOH and culture. Complete cure was defined as mycological cure with complete absence of clinical signs and symptoms.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using Student's paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests from the data obtained.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In both terbinafine and eberconazole groups, a statistically significant complete cure (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) was observed between baseline to 2<sup>nd</sup> week, as well as baseline to 3<sup>rd</sup> week.</p><p>But individually in both groups statistically non significant results were observed in complete cure when comparison was done between 2<sup>nd</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> week (NS, <italic>P</italic> = 0.317, 0.317; <italic>P</italic> = 0.083, 0.157).</p><p>On comparison between these 2 groups, it was observed that eberconazole nitrate 1% cream [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>] was as effective as terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">d</xref>] at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> (NS. <italic>P</italic> = 0.608, 1.00), 2<sup>nd</sup> (NS. <italic>P</italic> = 0.291,0.55) and 3<sup>rd</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 1.00, 1.00) week with statistically non-significant clinical [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>] and mycological values [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Terbinafine treated (T.
