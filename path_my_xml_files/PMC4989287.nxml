T2DM prevalence has risen dramatically from around 1&#x000a0;% in the 1980s to now over 10&#x000a0;% and is expected to continue rising. Despite the growing disease burden, few people with T2DM are achieving adequate management targets to prevent complications. Health system infrastructure in China is struggling to meet these gaps in care, and innovative, cost-effective and affordable solutions are needed. One promising strategy that may be particularly relevant to the Chinese context is improving support for lay family members to care for their relatives with T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We hypothesise that an interactive mobile health management system can support lay family health promoters (FHP) and healthcare staff to improve clinical outcomes for family members with T2DM through medical assessment, regular monitoring, lifestyle advice and the prescribing of guidelines recommended medications. This intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 80 communities (40 communities in Beijing and 40 rural villages in Hebei province) and 2000 people with T2DM. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation.</p><p id="Par3">The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving &#x02265;2 &#x0201c;ABC&#x0201d; goals (HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0&#x000a0;%, blood pressure (BP) &#x0003c;140/80&#x000a0;mmHg and LDL cholesterol &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mg/dl or 2.6&#x000a0;mmol/L) at the end of follow-up (Diabetes Care 36(Supplement 1):S11-S66, 2013). Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients achieving individual ABC targets; mean changes in HbA1c, BP, LDL, renal function (serum creatinine and urinary albumin), body mass index, quality of life (QOL, EQ-5D), and healthcare utilisation from baseline; and cost-effectiveness/utility of intervention. Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed process and economic evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Discussion</bold></title><p id="Par4">The Chinese government has prioritised prevention and treatment of diabetes as 1 of 11 National Basic Public Health Services. Despite great promise for mHealth interventions to improve access to effective health care, there remains uncertainty about how this can be successfully achieved.

It is home to the largest number of diabetics in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The health system has struggled to keep pace with this rapid rise in disease burden. Despite well-established evidence on effective strategies to reduce death and disability from diabetes, its uptake into routine medical care remains limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In China, it has been estimated that fewer than 10&#x000a0;% of diabetes patients are achieving target HbA1c, blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A study from Chaoyang, the biggest district in Beijing, estimated that only about 2&#x000a0;% of patients with hypertension or diabetes received standard care or management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exclusive reliance on a highly trained medical workforce to address this is not sustainable. Innovative, scalable implementation strategies are therefore urgently needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evidence of self-management and interactive technology interventions for T2DM</title><p id="Par7">One promising solution is to increase self-management support and build the capacity of lay family members to provide improved diabetes care. Systematic reviews of self-management strategies have demonstrated improvements in diabetes outcomes with reductions in HbA1c of about 0.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is also growing evidence of the contribution of information technology (IT)-based interventions (internet, mobile, decision support and telemedicine) to improving diabetes self-management. A recent systematic review of 104 studies (60 randomised trials) demonstrated improvements in outcomes in 73&#x000a0;% of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite these promising outcomes, most self-management and lay-support interventions have generally been restricted to high-income countries. Given the highly varied health system and socio-cultural contexts in China, there are major opportunities to generate evidence of effectiveness from self-management and family-based diabetes interventions that are supported by IT strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Working with family health promoters</title><p id="Par8">Support for people with chronic diseases in China is traditionally provided by children and grandchildren. Although family members are highly motivated to care for relatives, much of this care is variable in quality and not evidence-informed. In 2008, the family health promoter (FHP) project was commenced, in which a voluntary family member received training in chronic disease management and took responsibility for maintaining the health of the whole family. Community health service practitioners were engaged to deliver professional support to these FHPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Significant improvements in behaviour change, blood pressure and blood glucose control were achieved. In a study involving 11,192 family members, the FHP intervention was associated with a 29.3&#x000a0;% improvement in knowledge scores at 6&#x000a0;months which was sustained at 12-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Two randomised controlled trials (102 patients in Beijing and 220 patients in Zhejiang) showed that FHP-based disease management significantly lowered fasting plasma glucose by 0.7&#x000a0;mmol/l compared to usual care (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Publicly praised by the Beijing government, the FHP initiative was recognised as a &#x0201c;Beijing Government Serving People Project&#x0201d; and has planned to train at least 20,000 FHPs each year since 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite the success of the trials, the scale-up phase of the programme is experiencing difficulty in sustainability, primarily due to excessive demands on medical staff to support its uptake. Key problems include: (1) a requirement of staff to attend a 12-class training workshop; (2) competing demands with routine clinical work and (3) provision of training and ongoing support to FHPs once enrolled in the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Previous research using mobile health</title><p id="Par9">Mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to address these three questions. In 2012, there were 380 million smartphone users in China, now surpassing the USA to become the leading country for active Android and iOS subscribers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a recently completed pilot study in two rural China provinces, we found that around 90&#x000a0;% of patients&#x02019; close family members have access to mobile phones, and over 50&#x000a0;% of these are smartphones. The SimCard study tested whether training village doctors in the use of an Android application could help support the management for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The intervention was tested in Tibet and rural India in a recently completed 47 village cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) and demonstrated a 24&#x000a0;% improvement in prescribing of recommended medications. In India, a trial is currently underway of a multifaceted system involving training community health workers to perform village-based CVD risk screening using an Android tablet and uploading data for review and management by the treating primary healthcare doctor. The intervention is being tested in a stepped-wedge cluster RCT involving 18 primary healthcare centres, 54 villages and over 15,000 people at high CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In Australia, the TORPEDO trial of a provider-focussed decision support system and quality improvement intervention found a 10&#x000a0;% absolute improvement in CVD risk factor measurement and a 17&#x000a0;% improvement in guideline recommended prescribing of medicines to people at high CVD risk who were not taking these medicines at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In this study, we harness these previous initiatives to offer an innovative strategy for addressing the diabetes epidemic in China&#x02014;SMARTDiabetes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Research methods</title><p id="Par11">SMARTDiabetes will be conducted in two phases, and specific aims are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12">Phase 1: intervention development<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par13">To conduct a comprehensive barriers analysis of the existing Family Health Promoter project to understand the opportunities and constraints experienced by patients with T2DM and their families in accessing high quality health care</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">To develop an evidence-based appraisal of best practice recommendations for the management of T2DM and develop these into a health management algorithm</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">To take a user-centred design approach with urban and rural patients, family health promoters and medical staff to develop and field-test the health management &#x02018;app&#x02019;</p></list-item></list>

Normalisation process theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and behaviour change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used to provide an overarching framework to help guide and structure our approach to understanding intervention impact. This will help identify factors that promote and inhibit the incorporation of a complex intervention into routine practice. This is a critical aspect of the project as it will build on the findings of the previous FHP research in determining the scalability of the model. NPT identifies four main components: (1) coherence (sense-making), (2) cognitive participation (engagement), (3) collective action (work done to make the intervention happen) and (4) reflexive monitoring (appraisal of the benefits of the intervention). The broad questions which we will explore under each of these components are outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Normalisation Process Theory constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Coherence (i.e. sense making by participants)</td><td>Cognitive participation (i.e. commitment and engagement by participants)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Is the intervention easy to describe?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Is it clearly distinct from other interventions?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Does it have a clear purpose for participants?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Is there a shared sense of its purpose?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;What are the benefits and for whom?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Are these benefits likely to be seen as valuable?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Will it fit with the overall goals and activity of the community health service?</td><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Are target user groups likely to think it is a good idea?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Will they see the point of the intervention easily?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Will they be prepared to invest time, energy and work on it?</td></tr><tr><td>Collective action (i.e. the work participants do to make the intervention function)</td><td>Reflexive monitoring (i.e. participants reflect on or appraise the intervention)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;How did the intervention affect the work of user groups?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;How compatible was it with existing practices?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;What effect did it have on clinical care?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Did staff/FHPs/patients require extensive training in order to use it?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;What impact did it have on division of labour, resources, power, and responsibility between different professional and community groups?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Did it fit with the overall goals and activity of the community health service?</td><td>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;How did users perceive the intervention once it had been in use for a while?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Was it likely to be perceived as advantageous for patients or staff?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Was it clear what effects the intervention had?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;Were users/staff able to contribute feedback about the intervention once it was in use?<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022;&#x02003;How adaptable was the intervention on the basis of user experience and feedback?</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par43">We will take a case study approach in which a purposive sample of community clusters will be selected to maximise variation in characteristics such as size, urban/rural, health service characteristics and baseline performance for the primary outcome. Based on prior experience, we expect that around 12 case communities will be established from the total sample of 80 communities. Several data sources will be obtained in order to inform the impact of the intervention at each of these case study sites and will comprise site-specific analyses of trial data, usage analytics of the website and mobile applications, quantitative satisfaction and feasibility surveys using validated instruments such as the standardised system usability scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with health service staff, FHPs and patients. Survey and interview instruments will be iteratively developed, guided by our overarching theories and tested prior to implementation. A mixed methods analysis of quantitative and qualitative data will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team comprising the lead academics and service managers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par44">The economic evaluation will have a trial-based component and a modelled evaluation of long-term costs and outcomes. Intervention costs will be based on salaries, training and software development. As we do not expect an effect of the intervention on survival, the (trial-based) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be determined by average differences in utility (from the EQ5D questionnaire) observed between treatment arms in the trial. To capture costs and outcomes beyond the trial, a decision-analytic model will be developed to enable long-term morbidity, quality of life and survival to be simulated. The model will specify a number of health states (such as myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, type 2 diabetes with and without micro and macro-vascular complications, death and no disease) between which individuals cycle each year over a lifetime. It will draw on the literature and available databases to determine the transition probabilities between health states and the cost and quality of life associated with each. All patients will simulate progression across states until death. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained will be determined by then folding back the model to determine the average costs and outcomes, discounted at appropriate rates, accrued in both treatment arms. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to determine the robustness of base case estimates to assumptions used in the economic evaluation. This will better inform policy makers as to the resource consequences of rolling out this programme to scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par45">Phase 1 of the study will commence mid-2016.

In 2015, around 50 billion yuan (US $8.2 billion) was allocated to support these services and policy makers are seeking solutions to address diabetes-related disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Despite great promise for mHealth interventions to improve access to effective health care, there remains uncertainty about how this can be successfully achieved. These uncertainties pose substantial dilemmas for health system planners, particularly in limited resource settings. Our proposal will comprehensively explore the challenges of implementing well-established evidence into practice.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par47">The strengths of the study are that it explores the challenges of implementing a complex intervention, taking into consideration policy, healthcare providers and consumer perspectives.</p><p id="Par48">The main limitation is that it is conducted in one rural and one urban region of China, and the findings may not be immediately generalizable to other health system contexts particularly where electronic health record infrastructure varies and access to smartphone technology may be limited. The focus of the study on integrating the intervention within the existing primary healthcare system, which is broadly similar across China, will help to mitigate this and enhance the relevance to other regions with similar health system structures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Significance</title><p id="Par49">The proposed project involves key decision-making partners from the Management Center for Community Health Services in two provinces which will be critical for potential scale-up considerations. Although focusing on T2DM, the platform developed and the model of care proposed could support the management of multiple chronic diseases. Consequently, we expect the findings to advance locally relevant knowledge on strategies to support the health system in both urban and rural areas of China. This research is at the intersection of policy, industry, health care providers and consumers and seeks to ensure that the evidence generated has the maximum potential to inform decision-making for system planners. It has the potential to close significant gaps in treatment experienced by many millions of individuals with diabetes in China.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Abbreviations</title><p id="Par50">BP, blood pressure; EHR, electronic health record; EQ5D, European Quality of Life 5-Item questionnaire; FHP, family health promoter; HbA1C, glycated haemoglobin; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; QOL, quality of life; RCT, randomised controlled trial; T2DM, type 2 diabetes</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>DP is supported by a NHMRC post-doctoral fellowship (ID 1054754).
