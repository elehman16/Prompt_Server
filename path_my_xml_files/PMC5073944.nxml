Unfortunately, in spite of effective treatments, adherence to the regular use of drugs and other nondrug treatments, such as lifestyle improvement, is often poor. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an educational, supportive intervention &#x02013; in the form of a Blood Pressure Management Application (BPMAP) &#x02013; on self-management in patients with primary hypertension on controlling the determinant factors of hypertension, and on adherence to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A two-arm, parallel-design randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted on 30 to 60&#x000a0;year-old patients with primary hypertension who are attending the Tehran Heart Center. One hundred and thirty-two (132) patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control (usual method) groups. The most important inclusion criteria are, having primary hypertension and being pharmacologically treated for it, and not having developed the complications of hypertension, such as myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and cardiac insufficiency. The participants should be able to read Persian and be able to use the application.</p><p>The most important outcomes of the study include adherence to treatment, weight control, and regular monitoring of blood pressure which are assessed in the primary assessment (baseline data questionnaire) and again at the 8<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks. The intervention is a mobile application that has capabilities such as reminders and scientific and supportive information.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This application has been programmed to reduce many of the nonadherence factors of hypertension treatment. Therefore, the findings may contribute to a rise in adherence to treatment. If proven to have an appropriate impact, it may be extended for use in the national hypertension control plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study was registered in the Iran Randomized Clinical Trial Center under the number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir/searchresult.php?keyword=&#x00026;id=12211&#x00026;number=2&#x00026;prt=8262&#x00026;total=10&#x00026;m=1">IRCT2015111712211N2</ext-link> on 1 January 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1638-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>m-Health</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Adherence to treatment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Tehran University of Medical Sciences.</institution></funding-source><award-id>94-02-102-29524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ashoorkhani</surname><given-names>Mahnaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. The death rate caused by CVD is expected to reach 23.6 million by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hypertension (HTN) is second only to obesity in its contribution to the etiology of CVD. With every 10&#x000a0;mmHg elevation in blood pressure (BP), the risk of CVD increases by 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Adherence to drugs, weight loss, smoking cessation, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet plan and a low-salt diet, and taking appropriate exercise &#x02013; particularly aerobic &#x02013; are among the most important factors of disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In spite of effective medical treatments for HTN, patients&#x02019; level of adherence to regular drug use has been reported at only 30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% at the international level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Some of the reasons for nonadherence to treatment are: the drugs&#x02019; side effects; the patient&#x02019;s disbelief in the efficacy and benefit of therapy; lack of motivation; the absence of bothersome physical symptoms in some patients; lack of knowledge and appropriate behavior toward drug therapy and dietary regimens; miscommunication between the patient and physician; the complexity of therapy; inadequate attendance for follow-up on the part of the patient, and certain psychological issues such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The widespread use of smart phones enables their use &#x02013; in the form of mobile applications &#x02013; for beneficial medical and health-related purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nowadays, clinical applications can be used in smart phones as they have the following capabilities; audio-visual communication, Short Message Service (SMS), multimedia, medical sensors, the ability to connect to various devices for registering vital signs, such as electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, BP monitoring, the automatic transfer of data to registry systems, and the ability to connect to the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Here, we intend to evaluate the impact of an intervention aimed at overcoming the many barriers of adherence in HTN. The intervention has been designed in the form of the Blood Pressure Management Application (BPMAP) software application to enhance self-management in the control of the disease and to improve adherence in patients with primary HTN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p>The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of the BPMAP mobile application on self-management in hypertensive patients. The application has been programmed to enhance individuals&#x02019; knowledge of the disease, its subsequent problems and methods of control, regular use of drugs, observance of the low-sodium and DASH diets, level of physical activity, smoking cessation, and weight loss. The assumption here is that this application can enable individuals to better control the determinant factors of HTN and reduce the possibility of its complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-design clinical trial intended to demonstrate the impact of 6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; use of the BPMAP application on self-management in hypertensive patients, on their adherence to treatment, and the control of their risk factors for HTN.</p><p>The protocol is guided by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 Statement (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>The participants will be selected from the patients attending the Tehran Heart Center Clinic. The Tehran Heart Center is a tertiary-care, educational subspecialty center for CVD affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences. It has 460 beds and is one of the most well- equipped, specialized care centers for CVD in the region. Annually, an average 113,316 outpatients, 23,879 inpatients and 4331 open-heart surgery candidates are treated at the center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The outcomes of the study (adherence to treatment, weight loss, regular BP monitoring) will be evaluated at the primary assessment (baseline data questionnaire) and again at the 8<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The procedure of the study evaluating the impact of the Blood Pressure Management Application (BPMAP) </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1638_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The participants will have these applications for 6&#x000a0;months and the aforementioned measurements will be registered in it. Reminders for dose and time of drug intake, date of clinical visit, and other reminders will be activated. The users will be provided with the scientific information and skills required to identify the disease and its methods of control by the mobile application.</p><p>The participants in the comparison arm will receive the usual standard care based on the Joint National Committee (JNC) guideline. The usual care includes, measuring the patient&#x02019;s BP, necessary assessments based on the patient&#x02019;s history and circumstances, the specialist physician&#x02019;s judgment, medication prescription, and other medical measures. The number of appointments and assessments in each group will be the same. The intervention and control participants&#x02019; appointment days will differ and the members of one group will not be in touch with those of the other.</p><p>The BPMAP application contains educational content that is meant to raise the level of knowledge in hypertensive patients regarding its complications and methods of control. Moreover, it contains supportive measures such as important reminders for time of drug use, smoking cessation, and weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p>The software will be installed on the mobile phone and its operation will be taught individually. The patients will work with the application in the presence of the research team, and any existing problems will be resolved. Since BP measurement will take place at the individual&#x02019;s home and with a personal sphygmomanometer, the patients&#x02019; personal sphygmomanometers will be calibrated at the same time that the application is installed. In case there is a large difference in readings, or if the sphygmomanometer is faulty, the patient will be advised to change it. The strategies foreseen for adherence improvement include reminders set at defined intervals in the form of pop-up messages. In order to monitor adherence, the data collected on the server will be used.</p><p>In addition to the application, a server has been designed in which the users&#x02019; activities will be collected. Items such as the duration the application has been left open by the user, the sections used by the user (in addition to registering their time and duration), and BP registration, etc. will be registered. Every time the user&#x02019;s mobile is connected to the Internet, the data will be uploaded and saved on to the server. These data can be used as a proxy of adherence to the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary outcomes/clinical</title><p>The preintervention clinical measurements will be taken at weeks 8 and 24.

To ensure the validity of data, data entry will take place through double entry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The qualitative findings of the study will be described using frequency and percentage frequency, and the quantitative findings will be described using mean and standard deviation. To analyze the effectiveness of the main outcome variable of the study, we will use analysis of covariance (comparison of mean changes in score of the adjusted questionnaire &#x02013; based on the baseline score at the beginning of the study and other possible confounding factors) at a confidence interval of 95&#x000a0;%. This approach will be repeated for all the quantitative variables.</p><p>The remaining qualitative variables of the study will be compared by the chi-squared test between the two groups. The main approach of the study will be intention-to-treat. The final results will be analyzed per protocol. Lost data will be replaced through multiple imputation techniques.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of controlling and treating HTN is to prevent complications such as cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular and other diseases. Luckily, there are effective treatments for HTN. The JNC HTN treatment management guideline &#x02013; compiled approximately every 4&#x000a0;years by the American Heart Association &#x02013; is the basis of the standard treatment of HTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition to adherence to treatment, hypertensive patients need to self-manage their health behaviors such as weight loss, smoking cessation, eating a low-sodium diet, and appropriate exercise &#x02013; particularly aerobic. However, in spite of the availability of medication patient adherence to regular drug intake has been reported at only 30&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to the WHO&#x02019;s 2002 report, drug compliance in the long-term treatments of chronic diseases overall among developed countries is only 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Any of the following reasons may contribute to this noncompliance: treatment of asymptomatic patients, drug side effects, the patient&#x02019;s disbelief in the effectiveness and benefit of treatment, lack of motivation, insufficient awareness of the individual of the disease and its physical complications, lack of adequate knowledge and practice on the required drug treatment and nutritional diet, miscommunication between the patient and physician, the complexity of treatment, the cost of treatment, insufficient attendance for follow-up on the part of the patient, and the existence of certain psychological problems such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The emergence of smart phones has made its application in various fields possible, including that of medicine. The use of mobile-based technologies in health-related topics is on the rise owing to their easy application, low cost, accessibility unbound by time and place, and overcoming the issue of distance in access to services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here we will use the BPMAP application to enable, identify and self-manage and optimally control the determinant factors of HTN and overcome the barriers to adherence to treatment. The content of the program has been designed according to the constructs of a behavior-change model, the PRECEDE model. These constructs include: (1) predisposing factors such as knowledge and attitude, (2) enabling factors, which are those factors that prepare the ground for the behavior change, and (3) reinforcing factors, which are those factors that result in the adoption of a different behavior and a rewarding of persistence of that particular behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Among the limitations of this study is the self-report nature of the questionnaire and the need to register the measurements in the application. The necessity of owning a smart phone is another limitation. Some of the strengths of the study are: (1) using the mobile phone as an intervention tool, a technology that is ubiquitous and has no temporal and spatial limitations, (2) safeguarding individuals&#x02019; privacy at the time of data delivery and reception of feedback appropriate to the individuals&#x02019; data, (3) sampling of both control and intervention groups from the same medical center, and (4) the low cost of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is at the recruitment stage.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional files</title><p>
