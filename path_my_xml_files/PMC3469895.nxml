It is a marker of the general iron level and is associated with the inflammatory response.</p><p>As the etiology of ECC is multifactorial, and the effect of iron on the development of dental caries and concentration of this metal in noncarious as well as carious teeth remains controversial, the aim of this study is to explore a possible association between ECC and serum levels of iron and ferritin in children aged 24&#x02013;71 months in Rafsanjan, Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was received from the Research Ethics Board of the Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences. Two hundred and four children (117 boys and 87 girls) aged 24&#x02013;71 months were recruited with convenient sampling method for this double-blind, cross-sectional study. The children were in-patients at the Ali-en-Abetaleb Hospital, Rafsanjan, Iran, hospitalized for uncomplicated medical problems, including mild viral infection and dehydration and simple bone fractures between September 2008 and June 2010. All participants&#x02019; parents signed a consent form and responded to a structured questionnaire with items regarding as age, gender and general health conditions. The children were selected among children who did not have diseases and conditions and did not take medicines affecting the serum iron level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The inclusion criteria were assessed and eligibility for study participation determined through responses to the questionnaire, interview with children's parents, and discussion with the treating pediatrician.</p><p>Blood samples (approximately 2 mL) were collected by an expert nurse in the morning and used to determine serum levels of iron and ferritin levels (Pishtaz Teb Co, Tehran, Iran). Dental examinations were carried out according to the World Health Organization criteria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] by one of the authors (MS). The examinations were performed at hospital bedside using a disposable plane mouth mirror (Atlas Teb Co, Tehran, Iran) and a penlight. Cotton rolls were used to remove any plaque or debris, where necessary. Teeth with less than two-thirds of the crown erupted were excluded. To assess the caries experience, the decayed, extracted due to caries, and filled primary teeth (deft) index was used. A tooth was diagnosed as decayed (&#x0201c;d&#x0201d; component) if its color was changed and there was any evidence of cavitated or noncavitated dental primary caries or recurrent caries adjacent to already filled teeth. The &#x0201c;e&#x0201d; component included extracted teeth and decayed teeth indicated for extraction due to caries, and the &#x0201c;f&#x0201d; component included restored teeth without caries. White spots were not considered as decayed. It was not practical to take radiographs. The dental examiner was not aware of the serum iron or ferritin levels at the time of clinical examination.</p><p>Data analysis included Pearson's correlation coefficient and <italic>t</italic>-test using SPSS-16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

ECC is a multifactorial, transmissible, and dietobacterial disease,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and diet plays a critical role in the development and clinical features of this infection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Nutritional anemia and dental caries are still among the most prevalent diseases in some developing countries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In this study, 8.8% of children had serum iron content below the normal limits of 50&#x02013;120 &#x003bc;g/dL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Anemia can be prevented by fortification of food with iron. Animal studies have demonstrated that iron supplements, such as iron&#x02013;sucrose that has been used for prevention of anemia, are able to reduce the incidence of caries in rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The concept that two major public health problems could be alleviated by the addition of iron to sucrose is attractive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Based on our results, there was an inverse significant association between deft index and serum iron levels. A similar study in Iran showed a significant correlation between the DMFT index and low iron intake; the DMFT index of children with iron deficiency was much higher than in those with adequate iron intake.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In children, the presence of extensive dental caries will pose challenges for chewing and may negatively impact absorption of nutrients in the gut due to poorly masticated food. It is reasonable to assume that the same dietary factors that cause iron depletion (high consumption of beverages and low meat intake) will predict dental caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Dietary diversification involves promotion of a diet with a wider variety of naturally iron-containing foods, especially red meat, poultry, and fish.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Heme iron from meat is better absorbed by the body than nonheme iron, which is found in dairy products, vegetables, and fruits. There is evidence that children who eat little to no meat or poultry and drink large amounts of juice and milk or snack on cookies or candy are at risk for iron depletion, because their large calorie intake from these other sources prevents them from eating other foods for nutritional needs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] It seems children with dental caries, particularly occlusoproximal lesions, avoid consumption of diets containing meat due to meat fibers being entrapped in the cavities and a sense of discomfort. Therefore, ECC may be a risk marker for iron deficiency anemia, so assessment of serum iron levels in ECC patients is appropriate to avoid the harmful health effects of anemia in developing children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Serum ferritin is an acute-phase protein; its level is an indicator of body-iron stores and may be normal or elevated in infective, inflammatory, or malignant disease. A normal serum ferritin level does not entirely rule out iron deficiency, which could be present even with a normal concentration of serum ferritin (normal limits; 7&#x02013;140 ng/mL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Our study has shown that there was no association between serum ferritin levels and deft index, which is similar to the findings of another study that showed no difference in serum ferritin levels between groups classed as having &#x0201c;active dental caries&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;inactive dental caries.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Iron ions will be precipitated on the enamel surface as thin acid resistant coatings containing gels and crystals of hydrous iron oxides. In addition, by adsorbing salivary calcium and phosphate ions these iron compounds seem to be able to nucleate the formation of apatites, thus mediating a replacement of minerals, which have been dissolved during the acid phases of the caries process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The severity of ECC is directly related to the early establishment of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and iron could have a protecting effect in the human oral cavity from its pathogenicity &#x02013; in other words iron can be significant inhibitory effect on growth of this microorganism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Clearly, ECC is a complex disease that requires careful and extensive investigation. It is still a serious public health problem. Nevertheless, it is a preventable and infectious disease and its control should be a priority.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Since iron deficiency has permanent effects on growth and development, pediatric and general dentists should recommend assessment of iron level in ECC patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>One of the main limitations of this study was that we could not take blood sample from healthy children in the community because of ethical reasons. But we forced ourselves to select hospitalized children who did not have diseases and conditions and did not take medicines affecting the serum iron level.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our findings showed that there was an inverse association between the serum iron level and ECC. As our study was cross-sectional, whereas the concentration of serum iron is variable with time in children, further investigation of this association over time, using a longitudinal study design may be appropriate.</p><p>An inverse, statistically significant association was demonstrated between serum iron levels and caries experience in a cohort of young children aged 24&#x02013;71 months. To avoid the harmful sequelae associated with iron deficiency anemia, particularly amongst developing children, testing for iron deficiency anemia should be considered for children affected by ECC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to the staff of Division of Pediatrics at Ali-en-Abetaleb Hospital and to Dr. A Talatof for their support of the conduct of this project.
