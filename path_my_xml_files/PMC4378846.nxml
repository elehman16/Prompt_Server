Such strategies should consider alternative therapeutic trial designs for small anticipated sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Bayesian approach begins by formally characterising prior opinion which is then updated with collected data using Bayes theorem to obtain a posterior opinion to inform clinical practice. It can be particularly useful when the sample sizes required by traditional frequentist designs are infeasible [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120981.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. But what is a Bayesian prior? And how do you elicit one? Accounts have been given of Bayesian prior elicitation in the context of designing randomised controlled trials [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (RCTs). The findings of a Bayesian prior elicitation exercise have been cited to motivate conduct of an RCT evaluating warfarin for the treatment of rheumatic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, such methods have yet to become part of routine practice for paediatric trials. This paper describes the novel approach that was taken to elicit expert prior opinion to inform the design of an RCT for a rare disease affecting children, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). A full account of the statistical aspects of the proposed approach is given elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The aim of the current paper is to provide further practical details on the steps taken to plan and carry out the Bayesian prior elicitation meeting so this process can be replicated by clinical trialists in other rare disease studies.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Polyarteritis nodosa and the MYPAN trial</title><p>Childhood PAN is a rare and severe multi-systemic vasculitic disease that affects approximately 1 per million children [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; a full clinical description is provided elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120981.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Untreated, mortality is close to 100% [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; with aggressive immunosuppression mortality is 4% [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A comprehensive literature search of published and unpublished studies relating to the treatment of PAN was undertaken (full details of the search strategy and databases searched are available upon request); an important finding was that there are no published or currently recruiting RCTs relating to PAN in children. All of the paediatric reports identified were uncontrolled study designs i.e. cohort and single-case studies, that rate as low-level evidence. Conclusions based on RCTs in adults with PAN [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with important implications for children are: a) treatment of severe PAN requires corticosteroids combined with intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC); b) despite therapy, mortality associated with PAN in adults remains high at 4&#x02013;22%; treatment-related toxicity contributes to this; c) adverse events (disease and treatment-related) affect 54&#x02013;100% patients; and d) avoidance of CYC in children is desirable if alternatives exist since complications associated with CYC include infertility and malignancy.</p><p>The MYPAN study (Mycophenolate mofetil for childhood PAN) is an open-label non-inferiority RCT of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) versus CYC for the treatment of PAN in children (4&#x02013;18 years), currently being set up. <xref rid="pone.0120981.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> compares the design of the MYPAN trial with that of the MYCYC trial, an RCT comparing MMF with CYC for remission induction in ANCA-associated vasculitis. The primary endpoint of the MYPAN study is disease remission within six months of randomisation using a standard definition [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to its lower risk of infertility/malignancy, MMF would be favoured [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] <italic>unless</italic> the 6-month remission rate on MMF was more than 10% (absolute difference) smaller than that on CYC. A definitive frequentist trial would require 513 patients per arm to have 90% power to declare MMF non-inferior to CYC at the 2.5% one-sided significance level when remission rates on both treatments equal 70%. Previous experience suggests it would take well over 30 years to reach this sample size [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0120981.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thus explaining why a paediatric trial for PAN has never been performed.

Invitations were sent to society email lists for the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.printo.it/">www.printo.it</ext-link>), the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Rheumatology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bspar.org.uk/">www.bspar.org.uk</ext-link>), the British Association for Paediatric Nephrology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.renal.org/BAPN">www.renal.org/BAPN</ext-link>), and the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://espn.cardiff.ac.uk/">http://espn.cardiff.ac.uk/</ext-link>), and also to 81 paediatric clinics treating PAN identified via Orphanet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.orpha.net/">www.orpha.net</ext-link>). Initial expressions of interest were received from 25 eligible respondents, of whom (for logistical reasons) 15 were eventually able to attend the meeting. The Expert Group comprised the following co-authors of this manuscript: MWB, CB, AC, RC, JD, PD, DE, MF, MJ, SM, NM, A-MM, JP, A van R-K and OS. Participating experts were drawn from across the EU and Turkey (see author affiliations).</p><p>No patients were involved in the Bayesian prior elicitation meeting. Instead, all participants were expert investigators who had volunteered to participate in the meeting (and are co-authors of this manuscript). Since participants were true investigators, rather than subjects involved in research, we did not require ethics approval for the elicitation exercise. We therefore followed the same process as other expert consensus exercises and did not seek written consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Selection of the specific quantities to be elicited</title><p>Expert opinion was sought on the probability that a patient satisfying the entry criteria of the MYPAN trial would succeed according to its primary endpoint. The probability of success for a patient treated with CYC was denoted by p<sub>C</sub>, and expert views on the value of p<sub>C</sub> were elicited directly. The corresponding probability of successful treatment with MMF was denoted by p<sub>M</sub>, the value of which was derived indirectly from expert clinicians using questions about the relative merits of the two drugs. In statistical terms, this relative efficacy was expressed as the log-odds ratio defined by &#x003b8; = log<sub>e</sub>{p<sub>M</sub>/(1&#x02014;p<sub>M</sub>)}&#x02014;log<sub>e</sub>{p<sub>C</sub>/(1&#x02014;p<sub>C</sub>)}. We interpret &#x003b8; as a treatment effect, that is, a measure of the advantage of MMF over CYC for improving the chance of disease remission within 6-months. Positive values of &#x003b8; indicate that the chances of remission are higher on MMF than CYC (superiority); values of &#x003b8; close to 0 indicate equivalence of efficacy. The non-inferiority margin of &#x003b4; = 0.1, meaning that MMF would be preferred if p<sub>M</sub>&#x02014;p<sub>C</sub> &#x02265; &#x02013;0.1, was fixed in advance of the meeting by the clinical trial management group since this difference was felt to be clinically important, and was similar to the definition of non-inferiority used in a previous vasculitis trial (see below and <xref rid="pone.0120981.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Mathematical modelling of beliefs and uncertainties</title><p>Opinion on the value of p<sub>C</sub> was uniquely defined by two parameters designed to elicit the experts&#x02019; choice for the most likely value of p<sub>C</sub>, and their level of uncertainty about this value. These values were sought by asking the experts two questions (Q1 and Q2 in <xref rid="pone.0120981.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Opinion on the relative efficacy of CYC and MMF (&#x003b8;) was modelled as a normal distribution, the parameters of which were determined by asking experts two questions (Q3 and Q4 in <xref rid="pone.0120981.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). From the resulting opinions about p<sub>C</sub> and &#x003b8;, treated as independent, a consistent opinion about p<sub>M</sub> was derived. The nature and strength of stated beliefs were characterised through the mean and mode of the distributions of p<sub>C</sub> and p<sub>M</sub>. To illustrate this, <xref rid="pone.0120981.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> summarises the prior distributions for two experts with extreme opinions about p<sub>C</sub> and p<sub>M</sub> relative to the rest of the group. Experts were asked two further questions to verify that the elicited opinion reflected their personal beliefs. Especially useful to the clinicians when considering their prior belief was the calculation of the <italic>effective sample size</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (ESS) of a prior distribution; in other words, providing clinicians with the numbers of patients in a hypothetical clinical trial that would be required to statistically generate that level of certainty they had expressed for the parameters. For further details about these calculations, see [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The elicitation process was iterative, and the mathematical models and bespoke computer software allowed for quick and clear graphical representations of their densities. The consequences of adding hypothetical data sets to form posterior distributions were also shown. The computer program [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was written in R [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] using the Shiny package [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to create a user-friendly, interactive, interface. Software was tested on statistics students (seeking opinions on quantities that they understood) and clinical experts (PB, DE), which led to improvements and modifications.</p><fig id="pone.0120981.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120981.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Range of prior opinions elicited before introduction of the MYCYC data.</title><p>

<xref rid="pone.0120981.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> illustrates the sequence of activities undertaken during the two day meeting and the time allocated to each. Four statistical facilitators were available throughout the two days to support the elicitation process. The meeting began with an overview of PAN [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the evidence supporting treatment options including the findings of RCTs in adults [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0120981.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). A talk by one of the statistical facilitators (JW) introduced Bayesian reasoning, credibility intervals and representation of treatment differences as log-odds ratios. A practice session was then held. A glass jar containing 60 small wooden blocks, coloured either pink or black, was briefly shown to the experts who were then asked for their opinions about the proportion of pink blocks in the jar. Specifically, they were asked for the most likely proportion of pink blocks (interpreted as the most likely value of their prior distribution) and for a value, p<sub>L</sub>, between 0 and 1, which they believed the true proportion of pink blocks exceeded with probability 0.75. Using software similar to that to be used for the real elicitation, opinions were represented through graphics, summaries and ESSs. Having chosen a prior, the wooden blocks were transferred to a black bag, and four volunteers in turn each drew a sample of five, announced the number of pinks, and replaced them. The emerging posterior distribution was displayed. This exercise allowed the principles of the elicitation process and of the Bayesian method to be rehearsed in a neutral setting. The purpose of the statistical training was to standardise the experts&#x02019; understanding of Bayesian methods so that they could interpret and check the goodness-of-fit of the prior distributions determined during the formal elicitation process.</p><fig id="pone.0120981.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120981.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Flow diagram illustrating the sequence of activities undertaken during the MYPAN prior elicitation meeting and the time allocated to each activity.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0120981.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Elicitation of opinions</title><p>Each expert was given a structured questionnaire designed to systematically ascertain prior opinion regarding outcomes for treatment with CYC and MMF (<xref rid="pone.0120981.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Experts completed their questionnaires independently, and then met individually with statistical facilitators to discuss their answers. The R program was used to display the consequences of the answers provided. Changes to answers were allowed following discussion with facilitators, until the expert was happy that the model truly reflected their opinion.</p><p>Consensus prior distributions for &#x003b8; and p<sub>C</sub> were then sought, allowing the group to decide how to weight competing opinions. This was preferred to an automatic mathematical aggregation of individual prior distributions that would require the relevant competencies of participating experts to be quantified, or to working with multiple priors that would lead to multiple posterior distributions and no clear trial conclusion. A nominal group technique process of reaching consensus began with each expert individually commenting to the group on their answers to the structured questionnaire, starting with those with extreme values. Technical misunderstandings were identified and corrected. Lengthy and constructive discussions took place, with the ESS for the opinion about &#x003b8; being particularly influential in leading to a reduction in the certainty expressed for this parameter. Potential results for the 40 patients in the MYPAN study were considered, and the corresponding posterior distributions displayed to show the relative influence of the prior and the data. Overnight reflection was allowed, and a final consensus (agreed by the majority as reflecting their opinion) was reached on the morning of the second day of the meeting.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Presentation of related trial results: the MYCYC trial</title><p>Once prior distributions had been determined for the parameters of interest, further information was presented to the experts. This concerned the soon-to-be published MYCYC trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00414128">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00414128</ext-link>) involving 132 adults and 8 children.

Individually they were tasked with completing another structured questionnaire (<xref rid="pone.0120981.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) designed to elicit opinion about the relationship between probabilities of response for MYPAN and MYCYC patients on CYC or MMF. Individuals&#x02019; answers were displayed on flip charts. Consensus was reached after each expert had explained their views. After consensus had been reached on the relationship between the results of the two trials, key results from MYCYC were presented and key points of comparison between the MYCYC and MYPAN trials were further highlighted. Prior distributions from the first day were then updated by including the influence of the MYCYC results; a full account of the statistical approach used to incorporate these historical data into the prior distributions is provided in [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Revisions to opinions about the relationship between the two trials were invited. A final consensus about beliefs in the response probabilities in the MYPAN population was then reached. Opinion about the allocation ratio that should be used in the MYPAN trial was sought but views about the total sample size were not since this number was considered fixed by the maximum feasible number of patients that could be recruited within the timeframe of the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec015"><title>Results</title><p>Experts&#x02019; final responses to the first structured questionnaire are available online (<xref rid="pone.0120981.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).

Based on the consensus answers of the experts (<xref rid="pone.0120981.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), the most likely value of the remission rate for CYC was 0.70 (90% probability that p<sub>C</sub> lies between 30% and 91%); this opinion equated to an ESS of 5 patients on CYC. The most likely remission rate on MMF was 0.65 (with 90% probability that p<sub>M</sub> lies between 21% and 90%).

Incorporating the consensus relevance of these data (<xref rid="pone.0120981.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) resulted in the modified opinions summarised in <xref rid="pone.0120981.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.

Historically, this has been a major barrier in rare paediatric autoimmune diseases and almost certainly explains why a clinical trial for PAN in children has never been undertaken. We have adopted a Bayesian clinical trial design to overcome this barrier, and describe the process for elicitation of expert prior opinion to inform the design of the MYPAN trial, the first RCT for childhood PAN.</p><p>Recently, guiding principles in relation to good practice for prior opinion elicitation have been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0120981.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and where possible we have adopted these. Using a formal Bayesian prior elicitation exercise we have established that the most likely rates of disease remission within 6 months on CYC and MMF are 74% and 71%, respectively. These findings are likely to remain the state of knowledge until they can be updated with data received from MYPAN. Posterior distributions will quantify the uncertainty about disease remission rates that remains once the MYPAN data are available. This uncertainty means that conclusions about whether MMF is non-inferior to CYC are unlikely to be definitive. However, it would take a prospective randomised trial recruiting over 500 patients per arm to achieve that. That said, for a rare disease like PAN, clinically informative results can still be obtained.</p><p>Our results revealed that experts can be quite uncertain of absolute effects of treatments, but more convinced of their relative merits. In other words, for MYPAN, experts were uncertain about the precise value of p<sub>C</sub> but more confident that p<sub>M</sub> would not be too dissimilar. If the actual data from MYPAN confirm the prior, then confidence in those opinions will grow and this in turn would have an appreciable impact on the treatment approaches that would subsequently be adopted. If the data are at odds with the prior, this will be reflected in a clear and documented change in opinion: the prior is not so strong that contradictory evidence is dismissed.</p><p>In the prior elicitation meeting, experts accepted the Bayesian paradigm as a framework for representing their prior knowledge and uncertainty. We canvassed opinion from a pan-European group of experts. However, as the experts were volunteers, their views may not be representative of those who did not accept the invitation to participate.</p><p>In conclusion, the methodology developed for this exercise allows formal and structured learning about the treatment of childhood PAN to begin, and to be updated by MYPAN and studies beyond that. We suggest that this methodological template could be applied to trial design for other rare diseases, and is of particular relevance to rare autoimmune conditions that currently lack a good evidence base for treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120981.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Structured questionnaire designed to systematically ascertain prior opinion regarding outcomes for treatment with CYC and MMF.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120981.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120981.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Structured questionnaire designed to ascertain expert opinion on the relevance of the MYCYC results to those of MYPAN.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120981.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120981.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Individual experts&#x02019; final answers to Q1-Q4 and consensus answers agreed by the group before results from the MYCYC trial were revealed.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120981.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120981.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Clinical trials in adults with polyarteritis nodosa.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120981.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120981.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Individual experts&#x02019; answers to four questions eliciting their beliefs about the relevance of the MYCYC trial results for informing opinion about 6-month remission rates in the MYPAN trial.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120981.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the following for input into the organisation of the Bayesian priors meeting, and other supportive roles: Prof Paula Williamson; Dr Nicola Ruperto; Ms Emma Bedson; Mr Lawrence Brown; Ms Heather Granville; Ms Irene Gregorini; Ms Elisa Patrone; Ms Karen Dahlsveen; Ms Sarah Simpson; and Dr Stuart Bell.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0120981.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Department of Health.
