The vaccine was developed to protect against cancer and precancer beyond what is already provided by the current quadrivalent vaccine (qHPV vaccine), which targets the high risk (HR) (i.e., cancerous) HPV types 16/18. The 9vHPV vaccine additionally targets the 5 next most common HPV types found in cervical cancer worldwide (HPV 31/33/45/52/58). Both the 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines also protect against the low risk (i.e., not likely to cause cancer) types 6/11 responsible for 90% of genital warts cases.</p><p id="p0010">In a pivotal Phase III efficacy study, the 9vHPV vaccine prevented approximately 97% of cervical, vaginal and vulvar pre-cancers caused by HPV 31/33/45/52/58. The vaccine also generated antibody responses to HPV6/11/16/18 that were non-inferior to those generated by the qHPV vaccine and had a favorable safety profile <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1].</xref></p><p id="p0015">Approximately 90% of cervical cancers worldwide are attributed to infection with the 7 HR HPV types targeted by the 9vHPV vaccine (i.e., HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58) <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A previous study of women in Brazil, Mexico, India and China also found that approximately 90% of cervical cancer cases in these countries are attributed to the 9vHPV types, with some minor regional variation in the proportion of these cancers attributed to HPV 31/33/45/52/58 (12&#x02013;19% variability) <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Similarly, a previous study using qHPV clinical trial data found that approximately 85% or more of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and approximately 50% of CIN1 lesions are attributed worldwide to the types targeted by the 9vHPV vaccine <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, regional data on the proportion of CIN and AIS attributed to the 9vHPV vaccine types are sparse. Such data are essential for estimating the regional impact of HPV vaccines on the rates of cervical lesions. For example, the greatest impact of HPV vaccination is expected in low- and middle-income countries where the current qHPV and bivalent HPV vaccines targeting HPV16/18 are estimated to potentially reduce cancer risk by 40&#x02013;50% at 70% vaccine uptake and where well organized screening programs are lacking <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref></p><p id="p0020">Using data from the qHPV vaccine clinical trials, we estimated the proportion of CIN1-3 in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> attributed to the 14 HPV types tested in the trials (HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59), as well as the proportion attributed overall to the 9vHPVvaccine types (6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) and by the 9vHPV vaccine&#x005f3;s constituent qHPV types (6/11/16/18) and 5 new types (31/33/45/52/58).</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Objective</title><p id="p0025">The objective of this analysis was to determine the proportion of low and high grade cervical lesions (CIN1-3) attributed to the 9vHPV vaccine types (6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58), to the qHPV types (6/11/16/18), to the 5 new types targeted by the 9vHPV vaccine (31/33/45/52/58), as well as to 5 other measured non-vaccine HR HPV types (35/39/51/56/59), across the 5 regions studied.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Study designs and population</title><p id="p0030">Data from 3 randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of the qHPV vaccine were used in this analysis.

Participants in the trials were followed for approximately 4 years. As Protocols 013 and 015 enrolled only a small percentage of women above the age of 23, the age range for Protocol 019 was chosen to overlap with these studies. The proportions of subjects enrolled from the following regions for the younger and older age groups, respectively, are: North America (13%, 14%), Latin America (32%, 42%), Europe (51%; 13%), Asia (2%; 31%) and Oceania (2%, only included for women aged 15&#x02013;26 years).

An endo/ectocervical swab (one specimen) and a combined labial/vulvar/perianal swab were obtained from all subjects across the trials. Prevalence of HPV infection at day 1 was assessed in the vaccine and placebo arms combined to increase precision (given the randomized nature of the trials, it is expected that the placebo arm infection prevalence will be similar to the prevalence in the combined trial arms). In each study, day 1 swabs were tested for 14 HPV types (6/11/16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59) using a PCR-based assay as previously described <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Cervical neoplasia diagnosis</title><p id="p0045">All biopsies and excisional procedure specimens were tested for the 14 HPV types as previously described <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

For example, if one were to derive an apportionment for two CIN3 lesions found to test positive for HPV16 and 51, and if there were nine CIN3 lesions with HPV16 only and a single CIN3 lesion with HPV51 only, then [2*9/(9+1)] or 1.8 of these 2 multiple infected lesions would be attributed to HPV16 and [2*1/(9+1)] or 0.2 attributed to HPV51.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>3)</label><p id="p0075"><italic>Hierarchical:</italic> A modified version of the hierarchical attribution estimate of Wentzensen et al. was also performed for lesions with more than one HPV type detected <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Notwithstanding this regional variance between the qHPV vaccine types and the 5 new types, our study shows that the majority (71&#x02013;85%) of pre-cancerous cervical lesions (CIN2/3) in all the regions studied are attributed to 9vHPV vaccine types.</p><p id="p0155">These regional HPV attribution results are consistent with a worldwide study of 8977 HPV-positive invasive cervical cancers, in which there was also minimal regional variation <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

One study was a population-based study of 5378 cervical lesions conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 5 catchment areas across the US among women aged 21&#x02013;39 between 2008 and 2011. The other study was also population-based and included 21,297 females aged 13&#x02013;90 (mean ages at CIN2 and CIN3 diagnosis: 25 and 28, respectively) who had cervical biopsies in New Mexico between 2006 and 2009. The attribution of CIN2/3 to the high risk 9vHPV vaccine types was 75% (65.3% for CIN2 and 86.2% for CIN3/AIS) in the CDC study, while in the New Mexico study, the attribution of CIN2 and CIN3 to any 9vHPV vaccine type was 65.9% and 82.3%, respectively <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Similarly, we estimated that 76% of CIN2 lesions in women aged 15&#x02013;26 are attributed to the high risk 9vHPV vaccine types in North America and 79% of CIN2/3 lesions in women aged 24&#x02013;45 (in all regions combined) are attributed to these types <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3</xref>). While we also found that 97% of CIN3 lesions in women aged 15&#x02013;26 in North America are attributable to the high risk 9vHPV types, our sample size was small (<italic>n</italic>=35). Our estimate of 90% attribution of CIN3 lesions in all regions combined was within 4&#x02013;6% of the CDC and New Mexico studies for CIN3. The estimates of attribution of CIN2 and CIN3 to individual HPV types (e.g., 16/18) varied among these 3 studies, and they also varied by region in our study. The reason for this variation is not clear. Importantly however, when attribution of these lesions is assessed for the high risk 9vHPV vaccine types combined, the differences among the studies and regions are minimal.</p><p id="p0160">Both our study and the New Mexico study <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> also evaluated CIN1 attribution to the 9vHPV types. We found that among women aged 15&#x02013;26 years, approximately 44% of CIN1 was attributable to the 9vHPV types in North America, and 46&#x02013;50% of CIN1 in all regions combined in both age groups studied. In contrast, the New Mexico study found that only 25% of CIN1 lesions were attributed to the 9vHPV vaccine types overall, whereas in the age 26 years old and under, the attribution of CIN1 to the 9vHPV vaccine types was 30&#x02013;35%.</p><p id="p0165">Since diagnostic criteria and terminology varies in real world practice, a strength of our study is the adjudicated consensus diagnosis of CIN1-3 lesions by an expert pathology panel, reasonably ruling out important potential misclassification of our lesion grades.

The proportional attribution methods showed that the 7 high-risk types contained in the 9vHPV vaccine contributed to 85%, 83% and 81% of CIN2/3 in North America, Latin America, and Europe respectively. In women aged 24&#x02013;45 years, these types contributed to 71%, and 78% of CIN2/3 in Asia and Latin America, respectively. Several studies have now shown good consistency between the proportional and hierarchical attribution methods. For example, in the CDC study described above the proportional and hierarchical attribution methods yielded the same estimates for the attribution of HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 to CIN2/3 (~75%).</p><p id="p0175">Under the proportional attribution method, the next most common HPV types (other than the 9vHPV vaccine types) that have been found in invasive cervical cancers at a proportion of &#x0003e;1% are: HPV35 (1.9%), HPV39 (1.6%), HPV51 (1.3%), HPV59 (1.1%), and HPV56 (0.83%) <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In our study, these types collectively contributed to 7%, 8% and 9% of CIN2/3 in North America, Latin America, and Europe in women aged 15&#x02013;26, respectively. In women aged 24 to 45, these types contributed to 2%, and 11% of CIN2/3 in Asia and Latin America. In 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded there was sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity to humans for the 7 high-risk HPV types in the 9vHPV vaccine in addition to these 5 HPV types which are not contained in the 9vHPV vaccine <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Less evidence was available for HPV68, and 7 other phylogenetically related types (HPV26/53/66/67/68/70/73) were considered possibly carcinogenic <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These conclusions are supported by a recent Swedish study that estimated the HPV type-specific risks of CIN2 and CIN3 using a randomized primary HPV screening trial with 14.6 years follow-up. In that study, substantial differences were found in risk of CIN2 and CIN3 between different oncogenic HPV types &#x02013; HPV16/18/31/33/45/52/58 together contributed to 73.9% of CIN2/3 lesions whereas HPV39/51/56/59/66/68 had risks of &#x0003c;10% <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Collectively, these data inform HPV screening and vaccination strategies.</p><p id="p0180">We found approximately 8% of CIN2/3 lesions to be negative to the 14 tested HPV types across all regions and age groups with the exception of Asia, where 21% (9 of 42) of the CIN2/3 lesions in women aged 24&#x02013;45 were negative to all of the 14 tested types. As we cannot determine if our HPV negative lesions are attributed to a non tested type, we included all lesions in our analyses, irrespective of their HPV status. When considering only HPV positive lesions in women aged 15&#x02013;26, the 7 high-risk types contained in the 9vHPV vaccine contributed to 92%, 89.7% and 88.0% of CIN2/3 cases in North America, Latin America, and Europe, respectively. In women aged 24&#x02013;45 years, these types contributed to 90.9%, and 85.0% of CIN2/3 lesions in Asia and Latin America. These estimates of 9vHPV attribution are closer to the de Sanjos&#x000e9; worldwide study of 8977 HPV-positive invasive cervical cancers <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Also, the proportion of our samples that were HPV positive is generally consistent with that study, in which 8%, 18%, 13%, and 12% of cancers were HPV negative in North America, Central South America, Europe, and Asia, though the study tested for 30 HPV types <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19].</xref></p><p id="p0185">The study has some limitations.

Although this study provides data from 27 countries in 5 regions, some regions had small numbers of lesions and not every country was represented for each region. Thus the proportion and hierarchical attribution methods were only applied to regions/countries where more than 20 lesions were detected. Very few AIS lesions were detected across each region. Of the 24 total, 23 (95.8%) were attributed to the 9vHPV vaccine types.</p><p id="p0190">According to recent literature from 5 countries with organized cervical screening programs (the US and 4 Nordic countries), the incidence of CIN2/3 is approximately 10 or more times higher than the incidence of cervical cancer <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

Irrespective of region, if future 9vHPV vaccination programs are effectively implemented in HPV na&#x000ef;ve adolescents and young women, a substantial number of cervical lesions could be prevented in settings where HPV immunization programs have yet to be implemented, as well as in settings currently implementing qHPV (HPV6/11/16/18) and/or bivalent (HPV16/18) vaccines. 9vHPV vaccination programs would also eliminate many invasive procedures (colposcopy, biopsy, excisional surgery of the cervix) associated with CIN treatment in countries with existing cervical cancer screening programs, and a substantial number of cervical cancers everywhere, including countries without screening programs. Broad immunization with the 9vHPV vaccine of adolescent populations may thus necessitate evaluation of optimal screening algorithms in HPV vaccinated women. Notwithstanding, and regardless of screening practices and vaccine uptake, our data suggest that the non-vaccine types 35/39/51/56/59 may still be responsible for some CIN1, and to a lesser extent CIN2/3.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Funding support</title><p id="p0200">This study was funded by <funding-source id="gs3">Merck and Co., Inc.</funding-source>, Kenilworth, NJ (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00092521, NCT00092534, and NCT00090220). <italic>This systematic review was designed, managed, and analyzed jointly by authors employed by Merck &#x00026; Co. and external authors who were not paid for their work.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0205">Xavier Castellsagu&#x000e9; reports having received institutional research grants from Merck and Co., Inc., Sanofi Pasteur MSD, GlaxoSmithKline, and Genticel, and occasional personal travel grant and speakers honorarium from Sanofi Pasteur MSD and Vianex</p><p id="p0210">Kevin A.
