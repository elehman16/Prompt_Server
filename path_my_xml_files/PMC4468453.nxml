Direct axonal damage may also play a role in nerve destruction in many cases.

ON was diagnosed by ophthalmologists on the basis of clinical presentation, presence Of decreased visual acuity and assessment of visual evoked potentials. Entry criteria were either gender, age between 15 and 50 years, unilateral ON, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level &#x0003c;20 ng/ml, nonfulfillment of the McDonald criteria for MS[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] at the time of inclusion in the study and a willingness to continue current medications for the duration of the study. Assessments of serum 25(OH)D level was carried out, and used to detect vitamin D insufficiency. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA). The normal range for serum 25(OH)D level was 30-100 ng/ml. Exclusion criteria were evidence of substantial abnormalities in neurological, psychiatric, cardiac, endocrinological, hematologic, hepatic, renal, or metabolic functions, use of medication that could influence the prognosis of ON (e.g., &#x003b2;-interferon) during the 6 months follow-up period, vitamin D supplement, any condition predisposing to hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency and pregnancy as determined by history, physical examination, and screening blood tests. Patients who demonstrated poor compliance with instructions to take vitamin D or the placebo, or who failed to attend for follow-up visits, OCT scanning, and 25(OH)D measurements during the study were excluded. Women of child-bearing potential were required to use a clinically-accepted method of contraception. Tenets of the current version of the declaration of Helsinki and standards of good clinical practice according to the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use were followed, the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (approval number 290090 dated April 28, 2011) and the nature of the trial was explained to all participants. After a detailed discussion with the neurologist, patients made a final decision and each participant provided written informed consent.

Seventy-four patients were assigned randomly to one of the two self-administer treatment groups. Twenty-two patients were failed to attend for follow-up visits. Fifty-two patients (4 [7.7%] men, 48 [92.3%] women) completed the study without interruption. Patients were randomized according to a preexisting list produced by a computer program differed from a random number generator only in that it assigned equal numbers of participants into each treatment group. All patients received an intravenous single daily dose of methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day) for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for 11 days. The first treatment group received a single dose of 50,000 IU adjunct vitamin D3 (trade name Vitamin D3, Zahravi Pharm. Co., Tabriz, Iran) per week in the form of oral pearls and continued for 6 months. The second group received a similar pearl-shaped placebo for 6 months. Compliance with the study treatment was verified by asking the patients about missed doses and by counting unused pearls. All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation to record demographic data, complete neurologic and medical history, the finding of physical and neurologic examination, and previous treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the patient allocation algorithm.

Participants underwent spectral domain OCT scanning of the macular area without dilating the pupil, using commercially available equipment (3D OCT-1000, Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) on the same day of the ophthalmic evaluation. RNFL images were acquired by taking three circular 3.4 mm scans, centered on the optic disc, the mean of which was used to express RNFL thickness. Macular thickness maps were acquired by making six radial scans centered on the fovea, and by construction of a map from these scans. OCT was performed twice at the baseline and follow-up visit, and the mean value at each visit was used for the purpose of statistical analysis. OCT was done within 72 h of ON symptoms present. Criteria for acceptable 3D OCT-1000 fundus images included an absence of large eye movements, defined as an abrupt shift completely disconnecting a large retinal vessel, a consistent signal intensity level across the scan, and an absence of black bands (caused by blinking) throughout the examination. Six months later the participants were again examined, with OCT measurements performed in a similar fashion to the first visit. No patient had any other known ophthalmological disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Patient evaluation</title><p>The trial was single-blinded in that patients were unaware of the type of treatment each patient received.

Participants were evaluated by a qualified neurologist (MS) at baseline and 6 months after the start of the therapy to evaluate the development of side-effects of the medications, compliance, and disease activity.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was mean changes in RNFL measurements from baseline to 6 months after receiving vitamin D or placebo as measured by the OCT.

However, because the percentages and reasons for patients being lost to follow-up were not different between the vitamin D supplemented and placebo group, it is unlikely that the dropout rate affected the outcome of our study. The efficacy should therefore be tested in a larger sample. The present results clearly need to be replicated and extended across multiple centers and investigators. The mean macular thickness increased from baseline to 6 months in the unaffected eyes (presumably a chance effect) while macular thickness decreased slightly in the affected eyes and it could be argued that the mean macular thickness in unaffected eyes &#x0201c;regressed to the mean.&#x0201d; Although substantial evidence supports the safety of even large dose of vitamin D, such evidence is based on studies of limited size and duration.
