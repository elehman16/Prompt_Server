Many surgical procedures have been attempted to achieve root coverage that include free gingival grafts, pedicle flaps such as semilunar coronally repositioned flaps (SCRFs) and guided tissue regeneration. The exposed root surface has undergone substantial alterations and may no longer serve as an appropriate substrate for cell attachment and fiber development. When the denuded root surfaces are treated with biomodifiers following mechanical instrumentation, the resulting surface favors both the attachment of fibroblasts and new connective tissue attachment.

This condition may be associated with a periodontal disease or related to mechanical factors such as tooth brushing.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The treatment of buccal gingival recession is a common requirement due to esthetic concern or root sensitivity in patients with high standards of oral hygiene, prevention and management of root caries and cervical abrasions. Conventional scaling and root planning alone cannot totally eliminate the etiological contaminants, but does produce a surface smear layer that may inhibit cell migration and attachment. Later, studies by Urist publicized the effectiveness of acid demineralization as an adjunct to mechanical removal of calculus and cementum for periodontal reattachment.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Since, then various etching agents such as citric acid,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] tetracycline (TTC),[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and phosphoric acid[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have been used at different concentrations and time intervals to selectively modify the contaminated root surface by exposing collagen fibers and creating a hospitable substrate which favors the migration and attachment of fibroblasts.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, Mariotti[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in a meta-analysis stated that the use and application of citric acid, TTC or EDTA to modify the root surface provides no clinical benefit to the patient with respect to reduction of probing depths (PDs) or gain in clinical attachment levels. In 2004, Maniscalco and Taylor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have shown a significant reduction in the nanobacterial (NB) count and lipid profile by using combination of EDTA and TTC to treat the calcific atherosclerotic disease and the nanobacteria were found to be sensitive <italic>in vitro</italic> to TTC and its action is enhanced by EDTA dissolving NB apatitic protective coat.</p><p>Numerous surgical procedures have been attempted to achieve root coverage that include free gingival grafts, pedicle flaps such as semilunar coronally repositioned flaps (SCRFs) and guided tissue regeneration. The decision to use the SCRF technique as designed by Tarnow was because of its advantages such as it does not alter the adjacent papillae or vestibular depth and creates no tension on the flap and sutures are not needed. As the use of combination of EDTA and TTC as root surface modifiers was never attempted before the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of this combination along with SCRF in the treatment of gingival recession.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was designed and conducted in the Department of Periodontology, Narayana Dental College and Hospital, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India, to evaluate the efficacy of EDTA + TTC in root biomodification along with SCRF.

However, these procedures inevitably leave a smear layer, which may influence periodontal tissue cells and inhibit new attachment. Therefore, the choice of root biomodification agents that ensure smear layer removal was critical for the successful outcome of periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The present study was conducted with an objective of evaluating the clinical efficacy of the combination of TTC and EDTA for root biomodification along with SCRF for the root coverage of &#x02265; 3 mm of gingival recession. In a study done by Bittencourt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that the SCRF can be successfully used to treat Class I gingival recession with 91% root coverage and 53% complete root coverage.</p><p>In the present study, a significant reduction in RH was observed. Even though recession reduction was seen in both groups, better coverage was seen in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). This may be attributed to the use of SCRF which is a sensitive technique, and its outcome depends on clot formation and stabilization.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the case group, the application of EDTA, which is a chelator with anticoagulant activity[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] might have retarded coagulation events because of its possible incomplete removal from the root surface.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Studies were done by Trombelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Pini Prato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have shown that a less favorable treatment outcome was observed in wide (&#x0003e;3 mm) and deep (&#x02265;5 mm) recession defects. Preoperative recession depth, the position of the gingival margin at the end of the surgery and the horizontal component of the recession defect which were considered as important factors in achieving complete root coverage.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Furthermore, the coronal displacement of the flap requires its relaxation and a passive adaptation without tension over CEJ for successful coverage.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, RW was measured at CEJ and at the apex that showed a significant decrease in both the groups. RW &#x0003e;3 mm was considered less favorable for root coverage.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Another factor for complete root coverage was the availability of thick gingiva in the recipient site as it harbors more patent vessels and eases surgical manipulation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to Baldi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] thick tissues could have a better chance of withstanding trauma and tension when compared to thin tissues. Tissue thickness of 0.8 mm is considered essential for complete root coverage.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Because, the amount of microvasculature is likely higher in thicker flaps when compared to thinner ones, which should increase the chance of flap survival.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>At 3 months post-surgery, the WKT was increased in both the groups. The granulation tissue that fills the semilunar area converts the same type of tissue that was present prior to the surgery; this explains the increase in WKT in the control group. This is in accordance with Bittencourt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the case group, the combination of TTC and EDTA have acted not only as an antimicrobial agent, but also a root conditioning agent, which may favor the root surface biocompatibility,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] new attachment of connective tissue and thus increase the WKT.</p><p>The improvement of clinical attachment level was seen in both groups. The presence of collagen substrate subsequent to acid demineralization of the dentin surface could influence the wound healing response and serve to enhance chemotaxis, migration and attachment of the cells necessary for connective tissue regeneration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the PD was reduced in both the groups. These improvements might simply reflect a change in the composition of periodontal tissues, rather than a true gain of new attachment. Improved gingival health may have contributed to the observed reduction of PD presumably by decreasing the edematous swelling of the marginal gingiva and/or by decreasing the penetrability of tissue by the probe as a result of an increase of collagen.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the plaque index scores were significantly reduced in both the groups. However, the patient maintenance is better in the control group because some patients complained of sensitivity in the case group which could have impaired their oral hygiene maintenance. The improvement in the case group could be due to the antimicrobial and bacteriostatic activity of TTC. This is in consistent with the study done by Raad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who showed that the activity of the combination of minocycline and EDTA in a suspension was shown to be synergic against Gram-negative bacilli.</p><p>The combination the minocycline and EDTA is not inhibited by the extracellular slime but has been shown to disrupt the slimy biofilm layer. The mechanism of action of EDTA in inhibiting biofilms formation is possibly through its chelating activity on calcium, which is a component essential to the maintenance of the extracellular biofilm matrix.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The gingival index scores were reduced in both the groups. This could be due to scaling and root planning performed in both groups and an additive factor of antimicrobial effect of TTC in the case group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It has been shown that the combination of TTC and EDTA had significantly reduced the NB count in calcific atherosclerotic disease and also effective in preventing catheter-related colonization, bacteremia, septic phlebitis, and endocarditis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In consideration of the improvement of clinical parameters, we used a combination therapy of TTC and EDTA in the hope of an additive or synergistic effect of the two agents, but it seemed to fall short of expectation.
