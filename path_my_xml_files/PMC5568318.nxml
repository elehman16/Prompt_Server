However, even patients who strictly follow a GFD often suffer from intestinal symptoms and malabsorption. Selective modulation of intestinal microbiota with prebiotics could remedy various symptoms associated with CD. The use of prebiotics in the treatment of intestinal diseases remains insufficiently investigated. To our knowledge, this study makes the first attempt to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation on gastrointestinal symptoms and nutritional status of children with CD. We hypothesized that adherence to a GFD supplemented with oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) would deliver health benefits to children suffering from CD without any side effects, and that it would alleviate intestinal inflammation, restore and stabilize gut microbial balance and reverse nutritional deficiencies through enhanced absorption of vitamins and minerals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to assess the impact of the Synergy 1 on paediatric CD patients following a GFD. We randomized 34 children diagnosed with CD into an intervention group receiving 10&#x000a0;g of the Synergy 1 supplement daily and a placebo group (receiving maltodextrin) during a 12-week nutritional intervention. Selected biochemical parameters, nutritional status and the characteristics of faecal bacteria will be determined in samples collected before and after the intervention. Analysis of vitamins and amino acids concentration in biological fluids will allow to assess the dietary intake of crucial nutrients. The compliance to a GFD will be confirmed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ-6) and the analysis of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase and faecal gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The identification of the beneficial effects of the Synergy 1 supplement on children with CD could have important implications for nutritional recommendations for CD patients and for alleviating the harmful effects of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov Registration Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03064997">NCT03064997</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12937-017-0268-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coeliac disease</kwd><kwd>Prebiotic</kwd><kwd>Oligofructose-enriched inulin</kwd><kwd>Gluten-free diet</kwd><kwd>Supplementation</kwd><kwd>Gut microbiota</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016/21/N/NZ9/01510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drabi&#x00144;ska</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research PAS</institution></funding-source><award-id>statutory founds of IAR&#x00026;FR PAS (GW20)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krupa-Kozak</surname><given-names>Urszula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par31">Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa resulting from an excessive immune response to a dietary gluten (mixture of proteins found in wheat, rye and barley) in genetically predisposed individuals, both children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The disease is relatively prevalent, and it affects approximately 1% of the general population, although the majority of cases remain undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to the inflammation of the small intestine, CD can also be manifested by other symptoms affecting different organs or tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The classical form of the disease involving intestinal symptoms and malabsorption (diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain) is more frequently diagnosed in children than adults. Unapparent manifestations of the disorder involving non-intestinal clinical symptoms such as anaemia, decreased bone mineral density and mental abnormalities are more common in older patients. Untreated CD could lead to chronic inflammation, malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) which requires complete abstinence from foods and grains that contain gluten (wheat, rye, barley) is regarded as the only proven and accepted therapy for CD. Research indicates that rigorous observance of GFD alleviates gastrointestinal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and restores gut health in CD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], however, compliance with GFD guidelines varies considerably from 80% to less than 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many CD patients who observe a strict GFD continue to experience symptoms of the disease. In 20&#x02013;80% of patients following a GFD, the mucosal lesions (Marsh II and III) were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] similar to intestinal epithelia impairment that is noted in newly diagnosed patients. In microbiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the diversity of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> bacteria was reduced in CD patients, which is associated with intestinal dysbiosis. According to Wacklin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], intestinal dysbiosis is linked with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in CD patients on a GFD. Iron deficiency and anaemia are also common complications in CD, and their prevalence ranges from 12% to 69% of newly diagnosed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lower bone mass density was determined in 74% of adult CD sufferers who stuck to a GFD for long periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Taking into consideration the abovementioned research results, it could be suggest that GFD alone may not effectively reverse the clinical symptoms and re-establish intestinal microbiota balance in CD patients, even if GFD is still considered the most rational treatment approach. For this reason, several new therapies have been proposed as an alternative to a GFD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] however, studies assessing the efficacy of the new treatments are expensive and are still at the research stage. Meanwhile, prebiotics as naturally-occurred plant-derived compounds seem to be promising and safe additive to a GFD demonstrating the beneficial influence on human health.</p><p id="Par32">Prebiotics selectively stimulate the growth and activity of potentially health-promoting strains of bacteria in the intestine, mainly <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Many studies report positive prebiotic-induced changes in the microbial composition alongside the beneficial health effects however, only few studies investigated the impact of prebiotics on patients with intestinal inflammation. Research investigating the effectiveness of prebiotics in managing chronic intestinal diseases is still in its infancy, but prebiotics&#x02019; ability to regulate the activity of gut microbiota could be harnessed to remedy various symptoms associated with CD. Data from the in vitro studies and the animal model studies, yet promising but do not allow to formulate a final conclusion about the effects of prebiotics therefore, the evidence for such beneficial effects in human subjects is urgently needed. Only few pilot human studies concerning the impact of prebiotics on intestinal inflammation is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Besides the fact that a limited number of such human studies have been performed, most of them have limitations as they investigated prebiotic effects in combination with the administration of other ingredients or did not include an appropriate control group. To fill this research gap, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to assess the influence of the oligofructose-enriched inulin on paediatric CD patients following a GFD.</p><p id="Par33">Based on the literature data, it could be hypothesized that the inclusion of prebiotics in GFD could be an easy to administer and cost-effective alternative treatment for CD. Balanced gut microbiota is a crucial determinant of health, and further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prebiotic supplements for CD patients. By presenting this research protocol we are counting on a productive discussion concerning a GFD and the possible dietary methods of its modulation aimed to increase the effectiveness of GFD in CD. The initiated dialog between researchers of various field of interest, including food scientists, dieticians, and gastroenterologists might give the rationale for the further interdisciplinary research, concerning the modulation of gut microbiota and the intestinal functionality induced by nutrients and functional dietary ingredients, in the wide context of the novel dietary strategies in health and disease. The establishment of the cooperation with other research centres may possibly result in the extensive multi-centre research concerning this interesting but scantly investigated subject.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research objective and hypothesis</title><p id="Par34">We hypothesized that adherence to a GFD supplemented with oligofructose-enriched inulin would deliver health benefits to children suffering from CD without any side effects, and that it would alleviate intestinal inflammation, restore and stabilize balance of a gut microbiota and reverse nutritional deficiencies through enhanced absorption of vitamins and minerals.

The participants from the experimental group received sachets containing 10&#x000a0;g of oligofructose-enriched inulin, whereas the participants from the placebo group received packages containing 7&#x000a0;g of maltodextrin. The packages with the appropriate supplement were distributed by a researcher who was familiar with the identity of the groups. The participants were instructed to consume the contents of one sachet daily for 3&#x000a0;months while closely following a GFD. The medium for suspending the supplement (water, juice or yoghurt) was chosen by the participants and could be changed during the trial. The participants were also provided with a questionnaire of compliance and adverse reaction, and were asked to record their daily intake of the supplement, any adverse reactions (gastrointestinal and other) and any other drugs taken during the trial. The participants who did not consume the supplement for more than 80% of the trial period were eliminated from the study. Before the end of the intervention, all participants were asked to complete a brief questionnaire assessing their mental wellbeing and stool characteristic (frequency and consistency). In the questionnaire, they were asked to provide information based on the observations made in the last week of the supplement intake.

Our plan was to recruit approximately 30 children (15 subjects per arm) with diagnosed CD on the assumption that the drop-out rate would reach approximately 20% (12 participants in each arm would complete the trial). The results obtained in the pilot study will be used to calculate the sample size for a fully-powered study that will be carried out in the future on paediatric CD patients receiving oligofructose-enriched inulin with GFD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par53">Anthropometric and demographic data will be analysed using descriptive statistical methods. The participants whose reported intake of the Synergy 1 supplement or the placebo exceeded 80% of the prescribed intake will be included in final analyses. Statistical analyses will be performed in duplicate and expressed as mean values and standard deviation (SD). The influence of prebiotic supplemented-GFD and placebo supplemented &#x02013;GFD on the measured parameters will be determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If the differences between experimental and placebo groups are statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), the data will be subjected to post-hoc comparisons with the use of Fisher&#x02019;s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. The side effects of supplementation will be expressed by the percentage of each effect noted in the experimental group or the placebo group. The average consumption of food products by CD children during the intervention trial obtained from FFQ-6 will be compared in the Kruskal-Wallis test. Data will be processed statistically using Statistica 12 software (StatSoft, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">The use of prebiotics in the treatment of intestinal diseases has been poorly researched. To fill this research gap and cater to the growing demand for studies of the type, we proposed a complex interventional study investigating the impact of the Synergy 1 prebiotic supplement incorporated into a gluten-free diet on the biochemical parameters and the nutritional status of children with CD. According to the literature, prebiotics, in particular supplements combining short-chain and long-chain polymers, deliver beneficial effects for patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease by inducing positive changes in the histology of the intestine (proliferation in crypts and Goblet cells, longer intestinal villi) and modulating endocrine and immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Prebiotics also have a great potential for improving and maintaining a healthy microbial balance in the intestinal lumen and on the surface of mucosa. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli play a key role in this process. Healthy gut microbiota increases resistance to gastrointestinal infections, and it could also have immunomodulatory effects.</p><p id="Par55">The described trial was inspired by the promising results of studies conducted on animal models as well as pioneering studies performed on human subjects. The results of several studies analysing the histological and biochemical parameters of animals with colitis suggest that prebiotics have anti-inflammatory properties. Prebiotic supplementation increased Bifidobacteria or Lactobacilli counts and, in selected studies, the concentration of butyrate in the intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Despite the beneficial effects of prebiotics on animals, their usefulness in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in humans has been investigated by very few studies. Welters et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover study of patients with stable asymptomatic pouchitis whose diets were supplemented with inulin. The cited authors reported a decrease in pouchitis disease activity index (PDAI) scores as well as a decrease in gut pH, faecal <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> counts and the content of secondary bile acids. In a different study, the administration of the Synergy 1 in combination with the <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> probiotic to patients with ulcerative colitis significantly increased the counts of Bifidobacteria colonizing rectal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The above was accompanied by a highly significant decrease in the levels of mucosal proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1a) and inducible &#x003b2;-defensins 2, 3 and 4 which are important markers of epithelial healing. Smecuol et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] recently found that inulin-type fructans (ITF) contribute to the proliferation of <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> probiotic strains which have a confirmed beneficial effect on patients with active CD.</p><p id="Par57">The described trial had certain limitations. Above all, sample size was not determined due to the absence of primary outcome data. However, the presented results can be used for retrospective calculations and to estimate the power of a full-size trial in the future. Another limitation is related to the participants&#x02019; characteristics, in particular the wide age span and differences in GFD duration. However, a protocol for reporting any effects observed in the group of available subjects was developed during this pilot trial. In a follow-up, full-size, multicentre study, a larger population will be investigated and differentiated according to age, duration of GFD and/or other parameters.</p><p id="Par58">Despite these limitations, the results of this study could contribute to the development of novel nutritional strategies for CD patients. The originality and novelty of the proposed trial rises from the fact that the influence of fructans-supplemented GFD in CD children will be analysed for the first time, therefore, it is relevant to scrutinize the impact of this dietary compound on a broad spectrum of biomarkers assessing several important health-associated aspects. If untreated or not properly treated, CD can provoke irreversible pathological changes that require costly and prolonged treatment and rehabilitation. Our findings could also have important implications for nutrition and supplementation guidelines for children with CD as well as protocols for nutritional management of CD which aim to alleviate the harmful effects of the disease.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par65">
