CTS are defined as the signs and symptoms that appear due to compression of median nerve within the carpal tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the previous studies, CTS prevalence has been reported between 0.1 and 0.5% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The primary step in the treatment of CTS, which is prevalent among the population and negatively affect the daily activities of the individuals, should be the identification of the etiological factor, if any, and accordingly deciding on conservative and/or surgical management. The diagnosis of CTS is based on the anamnesis, clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, and as well as electroneurophysiological verification of these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Conservative treatment of CTS includes splint wear, steroid injection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, vitamin B6, physical therapy agents, activity modifications, and job change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The superiority of these methods over each other is controversial. Moreover, there are studies reporting that alternative therapies such as exercise and yoga programs, low-level laser therapy, acupuncture, and massage therapy alleviate the symptoms in the patients with CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is known that massage therapy reduces pain, particularly in certain pain syndromes result from local sympathetic activation, by means of decreasing the sympathetic activity or increasing the serotonin level and vagal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>There are limited numbers of studies showing that the massage therapy remarkably alleviates the symptoms in the patients with CTS, and leads to an improvement in anxiety and depression scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in these studies there is no consensus or a complete explanation about the massage methods, longer duration of application, and the use of all massage modalities. While we were planning the present study, we intended to standardize the massage therapy that would be applied to the patients with CTS. We thought that if this therapy method has a standardized name, it would be easier to apply. In brief, we aimed to bring a more understandable and applicable technique to the literature instead of &#x0201c;massage therapy&#x0201d; in CTS. We compared our new technique with the splint wear, of which the efficacy in CTS has been proven with many studies. We aimed to show the applicability of this technique by means of analyzing the effects of the results on the symptoms and functional capacity of hand, as well as on the electroneurophysiological parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eighty-four patients between 31 and 65&#x000a0;years of age were included in the study that were admitted to the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Department of the Medical School of Gaziantep University between 2009 and 2010 and diagnosed with CTS.

Physical examination included Spurling test, Adson test, median and ulnar Tinel tests, Phalen test, and Carpal compression test. Motor and sensory examination was performed and deep tendon reflexes, as well as pathologic reflexes, were evaluated. Additionally, routine blood tests were performed. Patients were questioned in terms of the symptoms including pain, paresthesia, vasomotor symptoms, and loss of strength. Questioning for vasomotor symptoms included hyperemia in the hands and fingers, sweating or dry skin (xerosis), and bruising on the tip of the fingers with cold. Vasomotor symptom was considered positive in the presence of at least one of these symptoms. The symptoms and the physical examination findings of the patients were recorded.</p><p>The level of pain in all patients was questioned via the Patient Global Assessment (PGA, 0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;cm) and the Physician Global Assessment (MDPGA, 0&#x02013;10&#x000a0;cm). Hand grip strength was measured by Jamar Hand Dynamometer (Sammons Preston Inc., Bolingbrook, IL, USA).

The massage therapy was taught to the patients practically on the first day of their therapy from an experienced physical therapy and rehabilitation physician. On the other days, patients were asked to do the massage by themselves. Furthermore, in case they forgot, in order to remember the massage technique, a CD (compact disk) including visual clip of training was given to the patients. The patients were asked to attend the weekly follow-up visits. The patients who could not attend the follow-up visits were phoned and provided to do the massage completely. Those who attended the follow-up visits were asked to do the massage themselves under physician supervision. They were instantly intervened to correct their mistakes, if any.

Treatment primarily depends on the principal of patient&#x02019;s learning how to do self-massage under the physician supervision. It is possible to support the training either via face-to-face interview, or by telephone, or via education tools (CD, DVD).</p><p>MHMT begins with 30-s effleurage, continues with 60-s friction, 30-s petrissage, 30-s shaking, and ends with 30-s effleurage. It takes totally 3&#x000a0;min. This method provides rapid and effective approach to the hand and forearm tissues. It includes massage modalities consisted of effleurage, friction, petrissage, and shaking. Effleurage manipulation has muscle-relaxing effect and sedation effect on nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Friction manipulation accelerates the return flow with the pressure in the direction of lymphatic and venous drainage, thus, relieves the edema in the tissues with venous and lymphatic stasis, and plays a role in the treatment of the scar tissues and adhesions as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Petrissage manipulation causes the metabolic residues, which accumulate in the tired and atrophic muscles and under the skin as well, to join the circulation and improves the tonus and elasticity by means of preventing atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Shaking manipulation has pain-relieving effect and strengthens the atonic muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patient applies these manipulations him/herself; the physician acts only as a trainer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Application of &#x0201c;<italic>Madenci</italic>&#x0201d; hand massage technique manipulations: Effleurage: Thirty seconds, scrubbing the surface, from distal to proximal, on forearm.

We believe that the prevalence of CTS is higher among women, because the works such as house cleaning, knitting, and sewing are in their responsibility.</p><p>Splint was first used in CTS in 1947 with the study conducted by Roaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The pressure in the carpal tunnel is the lowest in neutral position and significantly increases when the wrist is in flexion or extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the present study, we compared the splint therapy, of which the validity and reliability is well known, with our massage technique. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and reliability of this massage technique; meantime, we applied splint and exercise program to all the patients in order to maintain the treatment CTS. However, we presumed that this massage technique would be as simple and easy to apply as the splint therapy used in the treatment of CTS. Therefore, we compared the results of the group applied splint and massage with the group applied only splint in order to determine the efficacy of this technique. The results revealed that improvement was higher in the group applied massage technique. Therefore, the new massage technique can be considered as a beneficial therapy method. Further studies conducted on larger patient groups are needed to show that this massage technique alone is also an effective and reliable therapy.</p><p>There are limited studies in the literature about massage therapy in CTS. Based on these data, we applied a new technique, which was easy to apply to the hands, included all massage modalities and had a name. Investigators have shown that massage therapy is not only beneficial in hands but also associated with significant decrease in pain scores in the locomotor diseases, particularly in fibromyalgia, back pain, arthritis, and migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Pugatch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found that serotonin was increased after the massage therapy in the patients who underwent massage therapy because of pain syndrome. In the present study, we did not measure the hormone levels of the patients; however, we used the scales developed to evaluate pain and functional capacity of the hand. We, therefore, thought that we could have an idea about the symptom severity and functional capacity of the hand via the questionnaires. We observed that the improvement in the group applied massage technique was higher than the group applied splint only.</p><p>Studies have suggested that massage plays a role in the reduction of the pain severity by decreasing the muscular tonus and increasing the local sympathetic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that &#x0201c;gate control mechanism&#x0201d; is also effective in the pain-relieving role of massage therapy and that massage therapy increases the level of oxytocin hormone, which has pain-relieving feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the study of Field et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] about efficacy of massage on CTS, they have suggested that significant improvement was observed in the massage group in terms of pain, anxiety, depression, hand grip strength, and median nerve peak latency scores; however, the increase in median nerve conduction velocity was not significant. Moreover, no statistically significant improvement was also found in any of the parameters in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most important difference between the abovementioned successful study and the present study was the massage technique that we used. Moreover, in the present study the duration of massage was 3&#x000a0;min. This shorter duration of massage may be advantageous during the busy days; thus, the time that the patients would use for therapy is of great importance. On the other hand, each massage modality has individual benefit. All of these effects can be provided also with MHMT. The compliance of the patient with the therapy and efficacy and reliability of the technique suggest that MHMT can be recommended as the first choice of therapy in the future likewise the splint technique.</p><p>In another study by Moraska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] about efficacy of massage on CTS, as a result, statistically significant improvement was obtained regarding symptomatic pain scores; whereas only the group that received CTS-related hand massage showed significant improvement regarding the scores of functional hand evaluation and hand grip strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This successful study suggested that local massage was likely to be effective in the treatment of CTS. In the present study, the significant improvement in pain scores in the massage group can be attributed to the local massage therapy performed via MHMT, particularly to the decreased pressure on the median nerve due to the decreased muscle tonus and the increased local sympathetic activity as well as the lymphatic and venous return resulted from effleurage process, and to the increased pain threshold via friction process. We believe that effectively and accurately applied massage can provide these benefits. In the present study, we also applied an effective and accurate massage in a short duration of time and the results confirmed us.</p><p>The mechanism of action of message shows parallelism with the benefits of ultrasound (US) which is among the physical therapy modality. US are primarily used to warm the tissues of muscle-skeletal system such as joint structures, muscle and tendon, and penetration into the deep tissues are associated with its frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the present study, the fact that the improvement in patient-related and electrophysiological parameters with the massage therapy was similar to that obtained with the US therapy suggested that both the thermal and mechanical effects of these two therapies had an important role on the treatment. In the literature, it has been shown that the conduction velocity is increased in the peripheral nerves due to the thermal effect resulted from US therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the present study, we thought that the massage therapy might have led to an increase in the nerve conduction velocity via the same effect.</p><p>In a study conducted by Akalin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with CTS, patients were performed splint and splint together with tendon and nerve stretching exercises. They reported statistically significant improvement in the clinical, patient-related, and neurophysiological findings in both groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the present study as well, all the patients were asked to do these exercises in order the outcomes not to be affected. The only difference was the massage technique in the massage group.</p><p>Boston Scale is used for the patient-based evaluation of the symptom severity and functional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the present study, we also used the Boston Questionnaire to observe the efficacy of splint and massage therapy. The symptom severity was decreased and the functional capacity was increased in both groups, being more significant in the massage group.</p><p>To the best our knowledge, the present study is the first and largest study in the literature conducted on the massage technique that will contribute to the treatment of CTS. As this new massage technique is easy for self-application, cheap, and practical, every patient with CTS can apply the massage to him/herself easily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Statistically more significant improvement was observed in PGA, MDPGA, hand grip strength scores, and electrophysiological parameters in the group applied MHMT as compared to the group applied splint therapy only.</p></list-item><list-item><p>After the treatment, statistically significant improvement was observed in certain electrophysiological parameters only in the massage group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MHMT can be considered as an alternative therapy in CTS because it does not require a special treatment area and equipment, the patient can apply by him/herself, and it rapidly and effectively reaches to the tissues in the forearm and in the hand.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In brief, MHMT is a non-invasive, cheap, and easily applicable treatment option with high patient compliance.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Greer BG, Jenkins WM, Roberts R (1992) Carpal tunnel syndrome: a challenge for rehabilitation.
