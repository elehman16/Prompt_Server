some elements of postural control. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty-seven women aged 65 to
74&#x02005;years were enrolled in this study. The subjects were divided into a Nordic Walking
group (12 weeks of Nordic walking training, 3 times a week for 75 minutes) and a control
group. In both study groups, a set of functional tests were conducted at the beginning and
at the end of the study: the Forward Reach Test (FRT) and the Upward Reach Test (URT) on a
stabilometric platform, and the analysis of gait parameters on a treadmill. [Results] The
NW group showed improvements in: the range of reach in the FRT test and the URT test in
compared to the control group. The length of the gait cycle and gait cycle frequency also
showed changes in the NW group compared to the control group. [Conclusion] A 12-week NW
training program had a positive impact on selected gait parameters and may improve the
postural control of women aged over 65 according to the results selected functional

increase the strength of large groups of muscles, mainly in the lower limbs, as well as
improve gait, balance, and coordination parameters<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the organized exercise systems only Tai-Chi has been
mentioned in this context, and the importance of physiotherapy is emphasized<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it has not been determined which
specific forms of rehabilitation activities should be undertaken in order to achieve
satisfactory results in this field.</p><p>Nordic Walking (NW) is a relatively new type of walking training. It involves marching
using poles, and is an adaptation of cross-country skiing. The main purpose of using the
poles is to involve the muscles that are not used during normal walking. This enables high
intensity exercises to be performed at a relatively low level of perceived exertion. NW is
also a form of physical activity which is recommended for the elderly. There is evidence of
its importance in the prevention and physiotherapy of musculoskeletal disorders, vascular
diseases, cardiovascular diseases and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Parkatti et al. reported that NW improved all health-related
components of fitness of the elderly based on functional tests, however, no improvement of
gait parameters was observed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Takeshima
et al. have confirmed the efficacy of a 12-week NW training program and its positive impact
on selected fitness parameters on the basis of a physical fitness test and a test on a force
platform<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, gait parameters were
not assessed. In another study it was demonstrated that NW training improved both the
strength and walking speed of the elderly, compared to the traditional walking training<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the impact of NW on postural
control has not been examined. Exercise is recommended to improve abnormal posture control
during walking, and the use of exercises focused on performing two independent tasks has a
particular impact on the improvement of gait parameters and postural control<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a set of objective tests were used to evaluate the fitness elements related
specifically to postural control, especially those used during daily routines, such as
reaching in various directions or bending the body and gait parameters. This study used a
force platform to evaluate performance in specific functional tests the Forward Reach Test
(FRT) and the Upward Reach Test (URT) to evaluate the changes in postural control during
reaching. Moreover, kinematic gait analysis was performed in order to assess the potential
impact of NW training on selected gait parameters. Our hypothesis was that a long-term NW
training would improve gait symmetry, lengthen the gait cycle, and decrease the frequency of
the strides made eliciting greater economy of energy and improvement in incorrect gait
patterns of the elderly. Gait analysis of this study mainly focused on assessment of
coordination and symmetry of gait. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of 12
weeks Nordic walking training on selected gait parameters and elements of fitness related to
postural control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study followed a randomized controlled trial design. The subjects were randomly
assigned to 2 groups: the experimental group (NWg) and the control group (Cg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The flow of participants through the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3733-g001"/></fig>). Next, the patients performed the baseline tests. The tests were conducted by
blinded assessors, in a single blind experiment; the person making the measurements did not
know to which study group a given subject belonged. Simple random sampling was used, with
unmarked envelopes and a 1:1 chance of drawing a group.</p><p>Sixty-seven volunteers who met the inclusion criteria, were enrolled in the study. The
inclusion criteria were: age between 65 and 74&#x02005;years, no regular physical activity in
leisure time, and a willingness to participate in the study. The exclusion criteria were:
age, regular forms of physical activity undertaken in leisure time, professional activity,
musculoskeletal dysfunctions preventing exercise and walking, acute inflammations possibly
associated with a disease, previous episodes of cardiac arrest, uncontrolled arrhythmias,
chronic heart failure (NYHA 3 and 4), uncontrolled and untreated high blood pressure (over
140/90&#x02005;mm/Hg at rest), uncontrolled asthma, diabetes with insulin treatment, liver or renal
failure, neoplastic disease or medical advice against taking exercise.</p><p>The level of physical activity of all subjects was assessed using a physical activity
questionnaires the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (7PAR)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, in order to compare the initial level of physical activity between
the groups at baseline.</p><p>All the patients were informed about the purpose and procedures of the study in detail and
gave their consent to participation in the study. The study received the approval of the
local Bioethical Committee of University of Medical Sciences No. 216/11.</p><p>The subjects of the experimental group and the control group performed the same set of
tests at the beginning and at the end of the 12-week training period.</p><p>The functional equilibrium tests performed on the force platform aimed to evaluate postural
control while reaching. The study used two reliable functional equilibrium tests: FRT and
URT. The tests were performed with the subjects standing on a force platform (CQ &#x02212; Stab
Poland) placed against a wall. Measuring tapes were stuck to the wall, in accordance with
the diagram presented in the study by Row et al<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The assessed parameters included the length of forward reach
(measured tape affixed horizontally) and upward reach (centimetre tape affixed at a
45-degree angle), and the forward displacement of the centre of pressure (COP) in relation
to the initial position of the patients, labeled point &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;. Point &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; was determined as the
vertical projection from the centimetre tape stuck to the wall onto the furthest point of
the foot on the force platform. These points were marked with a special tape, which the
subjects were not allowed to cross, and were identical for all measurements and subjects.
The position of the platform in the baseline and post-intervention tests was identical
(marked with a tape stuck to the floor), the position of the feet and the upper limbs also
remained unchanged (the tape stuck to the platform, the measuring tapes stuck to the wall).
The evaluated parameters included the forward displacement of the COP (the furthest point in
the computer diagram), and the forward and upward reach (forward or upward movement of the
fingers on the centimetre tape). Both in the baseline and post-intervention tests, the
patients performed the test 3 times and the best result, in which the patient reached the
furthest, was chosen for use in the analysis.</p><p>Gait parameters were evaluated on a Zebris FDM-T Treadmill (Zebris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Medical
GmbH, Germany). This treadmill has often been used as a research tool to examine the
elderly, and patients with neurological deficits<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects performed two trials
at baseline and post-intervention at a rate of 4&#x02005;km/h, which reflected their average walking
speed. The first trial lasted for 30 seconds and was supposed to prepare the patient for
walking on the treadmill, the second lasted for 5&#x02005;min and the results were used in the
analysis.</p><p>The subjects from of NWg performed a 12-week training programme. Training sessions were
held three times a week. A training session lasted for 75 minutes: 10 minutes of warm-up
activities with stretching, 60 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of &#x0201c;cool-down&#x0201d; activities
with stretching. Each session was performed in a group and was supervised by two
instructors. The walking distance and pace of the groups were gradually increased by the
instructors who took into consideration both the period of the intervention and the level of
perceived exertion of the participants (mean pace: 1st week: 4.2&#x000b1;0.2&#x02005;km/h; 12th week:
5.6&#x000b1;0.2&#x02005;km/h). The pace of walking was monitored by the instructors, using handheld
equipment (Polar GPS Sensor G5, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele). In each session, when
participants reached half the distance, they had short break during which they performed
breathing exercises. The participants in both groups received the recommendation, that they
should perform exercise, no less than 12 and no more than 14 points on the perceived
exertion scale<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects of Cg
received detailed instructions regarding walking training, which they performed unsupervised
over the next 12 weeks. Moreover, each CG subject was given a GPS sensor with instructions
to turn it on before starting a walk, and to turn it off after finishing the walk. Once a
month the data concerning the amount of training and the times of individual training were
checked. The subjects of both groups (NWg and Cg) were told not to take up any additional
forms of physical activity, and not to change their current eating and motor habits during
the course of the study. Before the start of the training, the subjects in NWg were taught
to the proper technique of walking with poles (a 2-hour instruction).</p><p>The distributions of continuous data were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk&#x02019;s test. As data
were not normally distributed, comparisons between the two study groups were performed using
the Mann-Whitney test. For paired variables, the Wilcoxon test was used. P-values &#x0003c; 0.05
were considered significant. The statistical analyses were conducted using the STATISTICA
2009 software package.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The subjects of both groups were similar in terms of the basic descriptive characteristics

of functional fitness of women over 65&#x02005;years of age. The evaluated parameters were
associated with postural control, balance and gait, i.e. the elements of fitness which may
play important roles in the prevention of falls. In most cases, the obtained results were
consistent with the research hypothesis and showed that Nordic walking has potential as a
form of exercise for the elderly.</p><p>Postural control disorders are an important factor contributing to the risk of fall<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control is defined as the ability
to control the body&#x02019;s position in space for the purposes of stability and orientation, and
is critical during standing balance and walking tasks<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Postural control was analyzed using a stabilometric platform,
which is often used in studies of the elderly and in neurology<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in
the present study it was used as an auxiliary tool to evaluate the displacement of the
centre of pressure (COP) during two functional tests, URT and FRT. These tests are commonly
used as a reliable method of measuring dynamic balance. Moreover, URT has been defined as
the more demanding test, reflecting everyday-life activities better than FRT<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Drawing on the experience of the authors,
the measurements were performed in a similar way, but facilitated by the placement of
coloured sticky tapes on the floor and the stabilometric platform, and measuring tapes on
the wall, which were not removed throughout the study in order to maintain a uniform
standard of research. The results suggest that only NWg subjects improved their range of
reach the both in the FRT and URT tests, however only significant found between NWg and Cg
was in the post-intervention changes from baseline in the URT test. No significant changes
in the forward displacement of the centre of pressure were observed, contrary to what had
been expected. Moreover, the average results indicate that there was a decreasing trend in
this result, which may suggest that during trials, the NWg subjects moved COP to their heels
and at the same time tried to reach forward and upward more boldly. It is possible that NW
training did not increase body control while moving COP forward during the URT and FRT
tests, but it could have improved muscle strength and trunk stability, thereby improving
postural control.</p><p>The URT or FRT tests help to evaluate the ability to maintain balance during a functional
task<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and perhaps, in the future, these tests should be incorporated
into a comprehensive assessment of dynamic balance and postural control. Parkatti et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, demonstrated a statistically
significant improvement in all the components of the fitness test for the elderly, apart
from the &#x0201c;backscratch test&#x0201d;. Similar results were reported by Lee et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and by Kukkonen-Harjula et al. in a study
in which the tested women showed improvements in most tests evaluating physical fitness, but
each time on the basis of a different set of tests<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In that study measurements of postural control were not taken into
account, and balance was assessed using the standing on one-leg time and walking backwards.
It seems that the strength of the trunk muscles plays a vital role in maintaining balance
when crossing the circumference of the support base, and during each phase of walking the
erector spinae and multifidus muscles are engaged<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. These muscles probably work in a similar way regardless of whether
we use poles or not, especially since opinions about the reduced burden on the legs and the
trunk during walking with poles were premature<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The evaluation of the involvement
of individual trunk muscles during NW calls for further investigation.</p><p>Studies suggest that gait parameters should be evaluated at least once a year<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, since selected gait parameters may become
an important index for determining the risk of falling. Our study results are promising,
because they demonstrate that in the Nordic walking group the length (cm) and time (sec) of
the gait cycle were increased and the frequency of strides decreased. Earlier studies have
demonstrated that walking training performed once a week, can improve gait speed and
performance during the &#x0201c;Timed up &#x00026; go test&#x0201d;<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the results of our study are consistent with other
findings that show that the use of different forms of unconventional walking (e.g. with
music or with exaggerated upper-body involvement) improves gait parameters<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The assumptions of the present study seem similar to those made by Takeshima et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In their study, it was suggested that NW
should be the recommended form of physical activity for improving fitness and reducing the
risk of fall in the elderly. In our study the evaluation of postural control by selected
functional tests gave promising results. However, it seems that the intervention had a
greater efficacy among elderly persons with high risk of falls or a history of falls.</p><p>Limitations of the study. The subjects of this study were only women (no man volunteered),
therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the entire population of the elderly and,
in order to draw definitive conclusions, the size of the experimental group needs to be
increased. The functional tests performed on the stabilometric platform were experimental.
For this reason, an objective and universally recognized functional test should be used at
the later stage of the study for the comparison of results. At this stage of the study there
was no supervised control group and it was difficult to determine whether walking would not
affect the results in a way similar to the Nordic walking training. Therefore, at a further
stage of the study, a group will be created which, instead of the Nordic walking training,
will perform traditional walking in a supervised form.</p><p>Finally, it is in our opinion that 12-week NW training has a beneficial impact on selected
gait parameters and may improve postural control, on the basis of results of selected
functional tests performed by women between the ages of 65 and 74.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubenstein</surname><given-names>LZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Tinetti</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>Panel on Prevention of Falls in Older Persons, American Geriatrics Society
