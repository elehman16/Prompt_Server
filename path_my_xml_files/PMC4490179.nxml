Prospective follow-up studies of treated SM and predictors of outcome are scarce. We have developed a CBT home and school-based intervention for children with SM previously found to increase speech in a pilot efficacy study and in a randomized controlled treatment study. In the present report we provide outcome data 1&#x000a0;year after having completed the 6-month course of CBT for 24 children with SM, aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years (mean age 6.5&#x000a0;years, 16 girls). Primary outcome measures were the teacher rated School Speech Questionnaire (SSQ) and diagnostic status. At follow-up, no significant decline was found on the SSQ scores. Age and severity of SM had a significant effect upon outcome, as measured by the SSQ. Eight children still fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SM, four were in remission, and 12 children were without diagnosis. Younger children improved more, as 78&#x000a0;% of the children aged 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years did not have SM, compared with 33&#x000a0;% of children aged 6&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years. Treatment gain was upheld at follow-up. Greater improvement in the younger children highlights the importance of an early intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Selective mutism</kwd><kwd>Follow-up</kwd><kwd>Behavioural intervention</kwd><kwd>Social phobia</kwd><kwd>Childhood anxiety</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Children with selective mutism (SM) are characterized by a consistent lack of speech in specific social situations in which there is an expectation for speaking (e.g. school) despite speaking in other situations (e.g. at home) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Age of onset is typically before age 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. SM is relatively rare, with a prevalence of about 0.7&#x02013;0.8&#x000a0;% in childhood, somewhat more frequent in girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and bilinguals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Selective mutism (SM) has over the years been found to co-occur with other anxiety diagnoses (particularly social phobia) and with neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. SM is also reported to run in families, and a family history study of 38 children with SM reported a clear excess of the personality trait of taciturnity in 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-degree relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Support for a familial relationship between generalized social phobia and SM was found in a large study of parents to children with SM (70 parent dyads) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As a result of new knowledge, SM has been classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-5, although upheld as a separate diagnosis from social phobia due to frequent comorbid language delays/disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>SM is considered to be hard to treat, and both medication and psychosocial treatments have been tried. With regards to medication, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of children with SM from 1994 found that those treated with fluoxetine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) were rated as significantly more improved than the non-medicated (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) at the end of the study period. However, most children in both groups were still very symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similar findings were reported in a retrospective 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;months naturalistic follow-up study that included 17 children diagnosed with SM (16 with comorbid social phobia). Those who received treatment with Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) showed greater improvement than unmedicated children (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7), but the diagnoses persisted in 16 of the children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The psychosocial treatment literature for SM has been dominated by case studies or case series including a wide array of treatment approaches. Furthermore, data are scarce both on the short-and long term outcome and predictors of outcome. The few existing long term outcome studies are usually retrospective, with few details provided about the given treatment. Using retrospective patient records, persisting communication problems were found in a substantial portion of 45 children with SM in a follow-up study (mean 12&#x000a0;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although SM improved, a high rate of psychiatric disorders was found in 33 adults with a childhood SM diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A severity indicator of SM, taciturnity in the family and, by trend, immigrant status, had an impact on psychopathology and symptomatic outcome in young adulthood. In a retrospective study of 25 children, 2 to 10&#x000a0;years after referral, those given individual programs with a behavioural component were more likely to have improved compared with those given standard school-based remedial programs. A further poor prognostic indicator was past or present mental illness in the immediate family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In spite of the reported psychiatric comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in children with SM, comorbidity as a predictor for remission of SM has, to our knowledge not been examined. Concerning comorbidity as a predictor of outcome in Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders, results are not conclusive to date. While a study of 173 children found that pretreatment comorbidity was not associated with differences in treatment outcome for the principal anxiety disorder diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], another study (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;124) found that both total-and non-anxiety comorbidity added to the prediction of diagnostic recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In 2006, a comprehensive review of the psychosocial treatment literature stated with some caution that CBT was recommended for SM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A study using a group CBT approach for children with SM (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5), that also included a second group for their parents (psychoeducation and advice on how to handle SM) administered over an 8-week period, reported symptom improvement post treatment in all participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An alternating treatment design was applied in nine children with SM showing greater effectiveness for exposure based practice compared with contingency management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Children, parents, and teachers rated outcome in terms of words spoken, and the reported effect sizes suggested improvement by children and parents, with somewhat less favourable teacher ratings. An established cognitive behavioural treatment for childhood anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] was used in a case study of an 8&#x000a0;year old boy with SM. Symptom improvement was notable after 21 sessions, and the gain was also maintained at 1 and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, CBT interventions especially adapted for children with SM have been elaborated. The behavioural components have been emphasized, as the symptom of muteness and the young age of onset of SM make the cognitive restructuring less feasible. An important factor related to treatment is that children with SM tend to be most symptomatic in the school environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], thus requiring extensive treatment involvement of and coordination with teachers. Furthermore, as children with SM often fail to speak to the therapist, a special strategy to secure early child engagement as well as parental involvement, is vital. Consequently, Lindsey Bergman developed an integrated behavioral therapy for SM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This treatment was conducted at the clinic with parental participation using graduated exposure tasks to the feared stimuli/situation (e.g. verbal communication). Therapists also remained in communication with teachers to ensure relevance of exposure tasks at school. A pilot Randomized controlled study of this treatment (RCT) including 21 children (4&#x02013;8&#x000a0;years of age) found improvement in number of words spoken at school compared to baseline (blind raters), although, significant group differences did not emerge. However, a significant increase of speech was found after treatment, with no change in wait-list controls, as rated by the teacher on the School speech questionnaire (SSQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, 67&#x000a0;% of treatment recipients no longer fulfilled criteria for SM, and clinical gains were maintained at 3&#x000a0;month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Diagnostic comorbidity was not assessed in this study, but significant reductions were reported in social anxiety symptoms per parent, but not per teacher, report.</p><p>In contrast to this clinic based treatment, our adaption of CBT for SM was the development of a school-based intervention, as children with SM tend to be most symptomatic in this environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To promote rapport with the child, increase parental engagement, and train on procedures later to be used at preschool/school, we started the treatment at home (three sessions), where these children feel most safe. To decrease the often co-occurring social anxiety, we used defocused communication as a general treatment principle. Central components of defocused communication are: to sit beside rather than opposite the child; to create joint attention using an activity the child enjoys rather than focusing on the child; to &#x02018;think aloud&#x02019; rather than asking the child direct questions; to give the child enough time to respond rather than talking for the child; to continue the dialogue even though the child does not respond verbally; and try to receive a verbal answer in a neutral way rather than praising the child. In line with recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we chose psychoeducation and behavioural interventions. The psychoeducation (including information about SM, and how to use defocused communication) was given by phone with the teachers and parents together to obtain a mutual understanding of SM and the child&#x02019;s level of functioning. The behavioural interventions consisted of stimulus fading in the form of gradually increased exposure, as well as contingency management (use of positive reinforcement for speaking behavior) to be applied in a joyful play activity inspired by the Selective Mutism Resource Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The behavioural interventions took place at preschool/school twice a week (each lasting half an hour) and followed six defined modules/speaking levels according to the progress of the child. The parents participated in the first module, the teachers from modules III to VI and peers/classmates from modules IV to VI. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes the six modules (a more thorough description of the intervention is available in the RCT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Predetermined treatment modules reflecting increasingly difficult speaking levels (I&#x02013;VI) to be obtained in the preschool/school setting from the baseline level of zero at T1; does not speak to adults (as defined by the diagnosis of SM in this study)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Modules</th><th align="left">Description of the goal to be obtained in each speaking level at school</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">I</td><td align="left">Speaks to the therapist (T) in a separate room with parent (P) present</td></tr><tr><td align="left">II</td><td align="left">Speaks to T in a separate room without P present</td></tr><tr><td align="left">III</td><td align="left">Speaks to one teacher in a separate room with T present</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IV</td><td align="left">Speaks to other teachers (and children) in a separate room with T present</td></tr><tr><td align="left">V</td><td align="left">Speaks to teachers (and children) in some settings without T present (speaks to some, but not all adults and/or in some groups in the classroom, but not in all larger settings, such as full class</td></tr><tr><td align="left">VI</td><td align="left">Speaks to teachers and children in all settings without T present (normal speech, indistinguishable from other children)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We found a highly favourable treatment outcome in a pilot efficacy study of seven preschool children diagnosed with longstanding SM (mean 20&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Six children spoke freely in all preschool settings after a mean of 14&#x000a0;weeks treatment, and treatment gains were maintained at follow-up 1&#x000a0;year after end of treatment. Four bilingual children were included in this study, counteracting bilingualism as a negative outcome predictor.</p><p>We also found a significant treatment effect in an RCT study, with no change in wait-list controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study 24 children, 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years of age, with a principal diagnosis of SM (24 with comorbid social phobia, 16 with additional diagnoses), were randomized to 3&#x000a0;months of treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12), or wait-list controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12). A time by age interaction favoured younger subjects.</p><p>After 3&#x000a0;months of waiting, the children in the wait-list group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12) received the same treatment, thus rendering a total of 24 children who were treated for a maximum of 6&#x000a0;months by local therapists (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) at community health clinics all over Southern Norway. The present article will focus on the follow-up results from this effectiveness study conducted 1&#x000a0;year after the end of 6&#x000a0;months treatment for these 24 children with the teacher-rated SSQ and diagnostic status as primary outcome measures.</p><p>Based on the follow-up results from our pilot study we did not expect a significant decline of effect at follow-up.</p><p>We also expected that the younger children would remain more improved, and that severity of SM would be associated with less symptom improvement (based on our previous studies, and the early retrospective follow-up literature, respectively).</p><p>Due to both the situational nature of SM, and our school-based intervention, we further hypothesized that the children would show increased speaking behaviour primarily on the SMQ school subscale, and not on the public or at home subscales.</p><p>We also wanted to investigate whether diagnostic comorbidity and familial SM had an impact. As our treatment addresses SM, with the use of defocused communication to decrease social anxiety, we did not expect a treatment effect on the high rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders, other than possibly social phobia. We did, however expect a negative effect of familial SM, based on the early retrospective follow-up literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This is a follow-up study conducted 1&#x000a0;year after the end of a cognitive behavioural treatment adapted for children with SM with data from the follow-up (T4), as well as from baseline (T1), and after three- (T2) and six (T3) months of treatment.

Furthermore, we found, as expected that younger children had greater improvement. This was shown both on our primary outcome measure (the teacher- rated SSQ), and by the fact that a greater proportion of the younger children (aged 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years) no longer met diagnostic criteria for SM. As expected, we also found that severity of SM, as measured by SSQ at baseline, had a significant effect upon outcome at follow-up, thus confirming findings from a retrospective long term outcome study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This finding is also in line with recent findings from the large childhood anxiety disorder treatment study (CAMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, although the participating children had a high load of familial social phobia and SM, in line with retrospective follow-up studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we could not confirm the effect of familial SM upon outcome in the present study.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, significantly improved speaking ratings were reported on all SMQ subscales, not only on the school subscale, as found in our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Due to a possibly less entrenched mutism in younger subjects, it seems plausible that a younger age at inclusion seems to predict more improvement in the preschool/school environment. Furthermore, an effect of age at inclusion is congruent with the earliest SM literature suggesting that an early intervention may have been particularly important for those who improved with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. As the effect of age at inclusion was not examined in the Bergman study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we cannot compare our findings on this matter.</p><p>However, compared with the Bergman study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we had a smaller percent who no longer fulfilled criteria for SM (50 versus 67&#x000a0;%, respectively). This could simply reflect weaker results, as the children in our study were treated by local therapists, without prior CBT experience. In the Bergman study, the therapists were CBT trained, working at one clinic under direct guidance by the principle investigator, resulting in an excellent treatment adherence. Unfortunately, no formal treatment adherence measure was included in the present study, excluding the assessment of possible outcome variance due to therapist differences in adherence.</p><p>Our results could also be influenced by other factors. First, our sample was approximately 1&#x000a0;year older, and seemed to have a more severe SM (as measured by lower SSQ at inclusion (mean 0.55 versus 0.81, respectively).</p><p>To define what constitutes a clinically meaningful symptom improvement, and the definition of the criteria for SM diagnosis, are both challenging issues. First, the present study found a significant statistical improvement in speaking behaviour. One could expect that the level of speaking should approach a normal speaking behavior to represent clinical meaningfulness. We found that the mean teacher reported SSQ results changed from a level between never to seldom (0.55) to a level between seldom to often (1.38). Although lower than what is expected in children without SM (a level between often to always), we would argue that this change represents a clinically significant improvement for a child with SM. Secondly, concerning the diagnostic criteria of SM, the DSM does not specify whether the &#x0201c;Consistent lack of speech&#x0201d; means that some speaking in class (like in smaller groups of students, alone with teacher, or with teachers and children in smaller groups) is sufficient to avoid SM diagnosis. In the present study, we chose to categorize the four children who at follow-up spoke freely in some, but not all school settings as still having SM, but in remission. Due to their need for accommodation from others in some situations and the resulting lack of independence, we considered this represented an impairment qualifying for a diagnosis. However, an important point is that the CGI-improvement score at follow-up indicated that these four children were more similar to the children who no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SM (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12), than to the children who were diagnosed with a definite SM (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8). If these four children were assigned to the no SM group, our results were comparable to the Bergman study. These issues also speak to the need for further refinement of the diagnostic criteria for SM. Even in the DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], it is not clear whether children with consistent lack of speech in some areas, but not others, would be considered to meet diagnostic criteria or not.</p><p>In line with a study on CBT for child anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], pretreatment comorbidity was not associated with differences in remission of SM after treatment. As expected, our intervention did not have an effect upon comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, which were frequent at both T1 and T4. Interestingly, however, five children who no longer fulfilled criteria for SM also showed remission of social phobia (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), consistent with the notion that for many children with comorbid SM and social phobia, these two &#x0201c;disorders&#x0201d; are one in the same.</p><p>Although the present study found a small, but steady improvement over time, the most improvement took place from T1 to T2 (after 3&#x000a0;months of treatment). Interestingly, this finding seems to be in line with the reported mean results in the Bergman study. We cannot say for sure whether this is to be expected, whether therapy could end at this time point, or whether it indicates that something else, or a more intensified treatment is necessary from T2. One could also always question whether the increased speech observed after 3&#x000a0;months is a result of treatment or not. A strong indication for the effect of treatment is the lack of change after 3&#x000a0;months in the waitlist controls in the two RCT-studies to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The children in the present study were not reported to have experienced much in the way of stressful life events from T3 to T4, or to have received any other form of treatment in the year following end of therapy with a likely effect on functioning.</p><p>Although the present study can show a significantly increased speech in the group as a whole, half the subjects continued to fulfill diagnostic criteria for SM. Comorbid anxiety disorders were still frequent, both in participants with and without SM. This study only included an intervention targeted specifically at SM. Whether a more broad intervention, including in particular specific exposure tasks for social phobia would be more effective, remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that a cognitive behavioural school-based treatment can be effective for SM in children aged 3&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years. The therapists used treatment including defocused communication as a general treatment principle, and a home and school-based intervention with gradual exposure to the feared situations in which speech is expected. Particularly promising is the fact that we could observe a significant effect in the hands of therapists who were not experts in SM. In addition, the favourable user satisfaction points to the feasibility of the intervention. Future research is needed to ascertain the active treatment components. For older children with SM, how to best utilize available school resources seems crucial to explore further, as also pointed out in the Bergman study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given the favourable results from this clinic-based study, we could hardly claim that a school-based intervention, such as ours, is necessary when treating SM. However, it gives direct access to the most important people (children and adults at school) related to the training of the child&#x02019;s speaking behavior, and one form of a particularly close cooperation with the school, is underscored in both studies. Another similarity is the emphasis put on child and parent engagement, and the use of gradually exposure to the feared stimulus (e.g. speaking).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p>The sample size is a limitation. Second, the outcome raters were not blind to whether treatment had taken place. Third, the lack of a blind assessment of treatment adherence is also a limitation.</p><p>Finally, in the present study, we chose a school based intervention, that is to work at the arena where the symptoms are most pronounced and thus most impairing for the child. However, this might represent a limitation, as this treatment may not be easily translated to a general practice in the office settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first prospective follow-up study conducted 1&#x000a0;year after end of a cognitive behavioural treatment for children with SM, in a reasonably large sample (e.g. in the context of SM). Clinical gains were maintained at follow-up. Although increased speech and global improvement was found after treatment, a substantial number of children continued to meet criteria for SM, and comorbid diagnoses were still frequent.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Clinical trials registration: NCT01002196.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The Norwegian Research Council funded this research.</p><sec
