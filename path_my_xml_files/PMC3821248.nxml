Hence, it has been quoted under the <italic>Pranayatana</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] as well as <italic>Mula</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] of the living body. It is also known as <italic>Jiva</italic> and <italic>Oja</italic> which indicates its importance; its <italic>Kshaya</italic> or diminutions have a great threat to the survival of the human being. <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> is a common condition and signs and symptoms of it can easily be identified.

Poor supplementation of Iron is also one of the major causes for <italic>Raktakshaya</italic>, <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> can also occur due to inadequate absorption or utilization of Iron which can be understood in the terms of <italic>Agnimandya</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In current study, patients affected by <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> due to impairment of <italic>Raktadhatvagni</italic> were selected and improvement in classical signs and symptoms of <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> and <italic>Agnimandya</italic> were assessed.

Among various causes of the ailment, malnutrition is at prime place. More than 50% of Indian population is affected by this disease. Because of this it is included in the national health program. Many of the patients attending the OPD of any health institute for any disorder found to be anemic. One of the important causes of the disease is poor metabolism and utilization of iron for production of Hb.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Hypothetically it can be said that improvisation of the <italic>Jatharagni</italic> and <italic>Dhatvagni</italic> would be useful in this condition.</p><p>In the present study, majority of patients were having age group of 30-39 years. A maximum of 84.78% female patients were found in this group. Particularly, females of this age are prone for maximum psychological stress, and have to concentrate on their families due to which proper nutritional diet or even regularity to take the diet may be ignored that manifests <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> through hypo functioning of <italic>Agni</italic>. Maximum patients of this study were from lower income group and also having age of 20-40 years.</p><p>56.52% patients had primary education. Because of lack of education people were found unaware to the seriousness of the problem and were not following the instructions of their family doctors to have nutritious food or food supplements. Because of low income they were unable to spend money for medicines or food supplements and so, <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> was found maximum in those patients. Maximum patients (32.61%) had <italic>Kapha-Vata Prakriti</italic>. Both of these <italic>Doshas</italic> have nature to vitiate <italic>Agni</italic> either to <italic>Manda</italic> state or to <italic>Vishama</italic> state. As both of these states are abnormal, digestion and absorption of food cannot be done properly.</p><p>Due to improper function of <italic>Jatharagni</italic>, <italic>Dhatvagnis</italic> get vitiated which results in decrease of <italic>Dhatu</italic>. 69.48% patients had <italic>Avara Abhyavaharana Shakti</italic>, 67.79% patients had <italic>Avara Jarana Shakti</italic>, 71.74% patients were observed to have the habit of <italic>Atiguru Bhojana</italic>, 65.22% of the total patients were habitual to take <italic>Atisnigdha Bhojana</italic> to be the etiological factors of disease <italic>Raktakshaya</italic> due to <italic>Jatharagnimandya</italic>.</p><p>Though the given treatment was not directly affecting the <italic>Raktadhatu</italic>, Group A patients show statistically significant improvement in maximum symptoms of <italic>Raktakshaya</italic>. This proves the hypothesis that improvement in <italic>Jatharagni</italic> helps in correcting <italic>Dhatvagni</italic> and on this line increase, decrease or vitiation of <italic>Dhatus</italic> can be managed. Significant increase of Hb without giving any iron contained medicine also helps the hypothesis. This proves that corrected <italic>Dhatvagni</italic> converts and combines available iron for the synthesis of Hb effectively. S.TIBC was found significantly increased in treated group, which means in these patients&#x02019; secretion of transferrine has been increased significantly. According to modern patho-physiology, this may be interpreted in terms of anemia, particularly due to inadequate supply of iron but according to the Agni principle this indicates increase of <italic>Rakta Dhatvagni</italic> as due to increased transferrine iron can be combined and converted into Hb effectively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] This also can be understood in terms of <italic>Raktadhatu Utpatti</italic> and <italic>Poshana</italic>.</p><p>The mode of action of the drugs under trial can be understood on the basis of inherent properties of the individual components.
