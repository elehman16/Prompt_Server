injury, and surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most significant
complications, resulting in increased mortality, prolonged hospital
stay and often the need for further surgery. Our aim was to determine
whether high dose dual antibiotic impregnated bone cement decreases the
rate of infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A quasi-randomised study of 848 patients with an intracapsular
fracture of the hip was conducted in one large teaching hospital
on two sites. All were treated with a hemiarthroplasty. A total
of 448 patients received low dose single-antibiotic impregnated
cement (control group) and 400 patients received high dose dual-antibiotic impregnated
cement (intervention group). The primary outcome measure was deep
SSI at one year after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of deep SSI was 3.5% in the control group and 1.1% in
the intervention group
(p = 0.041; logistic regression adjusting for age and gender). The
overall rate of non-infective surgical complications did not differ
between the two groups (unadjusted chi-squared test; p &#x0003e; 0.999).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of high dose dual-antibiotic impregnated cement in these
patients significantly reduces the rate of SSI compared with standard
low dose single antibiotic loaded bone cement.</p><p>Cite this article: <italic>Bone Joint J</italic> 2016;98-B:1534&#x02013;1541.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fractured neck of femur</kwd><kwd>Trial</kwd><kwd>Cement</kwd><kwd>Randomised</kwd><kwd>Antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>odf2nlm-version</meta-name><meta-value>1.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>price</meta-name><meta-value>$2.00</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>principal-institution</meta-name><meta-value>Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>Hip</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>A fracture of the hip is the most common serious orthopaedic injury<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and as the incidence
of osteoporotic fractures increases, the burden on healthcare systems
continues to grow.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> According
to The National Hip Fracture Database, in 2015, in England and Wales,
more than 22 000 people had a cemented hemiarthroplasty following
a fracture of the hip.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The
current annual cost of all fractured hips to the National Health
Service and social care services is &#x000a3;1.7 billion, estimated to increase
to &#x000a3;2.2 billion by 2025.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Surgical site infection (SSI) remains an important complication
of the treatment of these fractures. It results in increased mortality
(30% at 90 days), prolonged stay in hospital, further revision operations,
the increased use of antibiotics and extended follow-up and rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> SSI is the third
most commonly occurring healthcare-associated infection, accounting
for 16% of reported infections.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Rates
of infection of between 1.3%<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and
9%<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> for hemiarthroplasty have
been reported around the world. In England, this rate has been reported
to be 4.06% by Wilson et al.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Parenteral antibiotics
in total hip arthroplasty (THA) have been shown to reduce SSI from
3.3% to 0.9%<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and
antibiotic loaded cement, combined with systemic antibiotics is
considered to be the most effective prophylaxis against deep infection.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Hemiarthroplasty of the hip can be cementless<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or cemented. However,
both the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and British Geriatric
Society (BGS) have endorsed<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the
use of cemented implants as described in two recent studies.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Rates of SSI are higher in frail patients with a fracture of the
hip than in those undergoing THA, even though the operating times
and antibiotic prophylaxis are similar. It has been suggested that
this increase is related to the grade of surgeon,<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> the comorbidities
of the patients<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and
the lack of preparation of patients who sustain a fracture as they
present as an emergency.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However,
in a study of 540 000 patients with
a fracture of the hip, it was concluded that the risk of mortality
in these patients was linked to the fracture itself and the post-operative
complications rather than to pre-existing comorbidity.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>We have conducted a quasi-randomised controlled trial to compare
the clinical effectiveness of low dose single-antibiotic <italic>versus</italic> high
dose dual-antibiotic impregnated cement in patients with an intracapsular
fracture of the hip. The null hypothesis was that the rate of SSI
at one year after hemiarthroplasty does not differ between patients
undergoing surgery using standard low dose antibiotic impregnated cement
and those in whom high dose dual-antibiotic impregnated cement is
used.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a two hospital, two arm, patient and assessor blinded,
quasi-randomised controlled trial with group treatment allocation.
Full details of the trial have been described previously,<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> to ensure consistency,
methodology and outcome measure reporting, but no outcomes have
been published. The trial is registered as ISRCTN25633145. The patients
were eligible if they were aged &#x0003e; 18 years, medically fit for an
operation and suitable for a cemented hemiarthroplasty, could provide
informed consent and fulfilled the criteria for the study (as previously
described).<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>Patients were recruited between May 2008 and November 2012 from
all acute admissions at Wansbeck General Hospital and North Tyneside
General Hospital, part of Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation
Trust. Potential participants were screened and, if eligible, recruited
under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) protocols.<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Specific ethical approval
was gained for patients with impaired mental capacity, for whom
consent was obtained from their next of kin or, if they were unavailable,
by a senior member of nursing staff who was not involved in the
study. The decision regarding capacity was made by a senior member
of the medical staff and confirmed by the treating orthopaedic consultant.</p><p>More than 95% of patients in each unit underwent surgery within
48 hours (NHFD report 2012).<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Allocation
to the treatment group was based on the date that surgery was performed
providing one treatment for the whole calendar month at each centre.
The following month this process was reversed to ensure comparable
groups. It was not practical to attempt individual randomisation
due to the lack of specific local support. Participating surgeons
were not blinded to the allocation of treatment; however, the patients and
all other staff involved in assessment of outcomes were blinded.</p><p>The forms of treatments were hemiarthroplasty with low dose single-antibiotic
(current standard of care) or high dose dual-antibiotic impregnated
cement. Pre-operatively, all patients followed the same pathway
from the Accident and Emergency department to the ward and had the
same preparation. Patients were allocated to surgery according to
the preferred surgical approach of the operating surgeon. All procedures
were performed with a standard hemiarthroplasty stem, cement mixing
system and volume of cement. Post-operatively all patients underwent
the same exercises, supervised by physiotherapists, and unless the&#x000a0;surgeon
specifically advised otherwise, all patients were fully weight-bearing
immediately. Administration of analgesia and the type of anaesthesia
were not stipulated.</p><p>The control group received high viscosity cement with low dose
single-antibiotic (Palacos R + G, 0.5 g of Gentamicin; Heraeus Medical,
Heraeus Medical Division, Newbury, United Kingdom), which was inserted
using a retrograde technique with a cement gun and a cement restrictor.</p><p>The intervention group received cement impregnated with high
dose dual-antibiotics, consisting of 1g Clindamycin and 1g of Gentamicin
(Copal G+C, Heraeus Medical Division),<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> using the same technique.</p><p>During the study there was a change in prophylactic parenteral
antibiotics to reduce the risk of acute renal failure. At the start
of trial the regimen was single dose Gentamicin (4.5 mg/kg) and this was
changed to single doses of Gentamicin (3 mg/kg) and Teicoplanin
(400 mg) on 1 February 2009.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The primary outcome measure was deep SSI based on the definitions

complete data on SSI post-discharge, patients were asked to report
problems with wound healing 30 days after the operation using the

to 1% for a two-sided 5% level of significance and 80% power, for
the selected binary outcome we needed a total of 848 participants,
assuming a chi-squared test as the definitive analysis.</p><p>Baseline demographical and comorbidity data were summarised to
check comparability between treatment arms. Additional comorbidities
that have been shown to increase the rate of SSI were also recorded,
such as diabetes<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and rheumatoid
arthritis.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Due
to concerns about the (sub-optimal) method of randomisation that
was used, we undertook formal statistical testing of differences
in baseline characteristics between treatment arms to assess whether
there was any evidence of systematic imbalance introduced by the
randomisation procedure. Independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests
and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test or chi-squared tests were used, with significance
set at the 5% level.</p><p>The main analysis assessed differences in the primary outcome,
deep SSI, on an intention-to-treat basis between treatment groups
using logistic regression analysis of complete data, adjusting for
the age and gender of the patients. Regression coefficients were
considered to be significant at p &#x0003c; 0.05 (5% significance level).
A per-protocol analysis was also undertaken as an analysis of sensitivity
to assess the effects of deviations from the protocol. Also the
overall number of infections, either deep or superficial were analysed
in a similar manner to assess the total number of SSIs in the patients.
Differences between the groups for other secondary outcomes including
mortality and critical care stay and post-operative complications
were assessed using chi-squared and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests as appropriate.
Length of stay was compared between groups using a Mann-Whitney
U test. All analyses were undertaken using the statistical software
R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1210 patients were eligible for inclusion; 362 were

performed the operations. An orthopaedic consultant was the lead
surgeon in 154 (18.2%) of them, trust doctors in 55 (6.5%), and

Analysis of SSI data excluded all patients who

</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Secondary outcomes</title><p>When data were combined such that deep or superficial SSIs were
counted, the rates were 5.3% (95% CI 3.4% to 8.2%) in the control
group and 1.7% (95% CI 0.7% to 3.8%) in the intervention group (Table III).
An analogous analysis to that undertaken for deep SSI alone gave
estimates of the unadjusted odds ratio from Fisher&#x02019;s exact test
of 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.79) and adjusted OR from logistic regression
of 0.30 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.71); p-values from these two analyses
were 0.009 and 0.010, respectively, providing reasonably strong
evidence that the total number of infections both deep and superficial
differed significantly between groups.</p><p>Repeating the analyses on a per protocol (as treated) basis as
a sensitivity analysis, gave similar estimates of ORs and inferences
for both deep SSI and combined superficial and deep SSI data; the
adjusted OR for the former outcome measure was 0.33 (95% CI 0.09
to 0.95 and p = 0.056) and&#x000a0;for the latter was 0.32 (95% CI 0.12
to 0.77 and p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.016). The reported rates of SSI were calculated
after excluding patients who died within 30 days of operation. If
the most extreme position is taken and assuming that these all had
an SSI then the estimated rates would increase to 15.6% (66/422)
and 10.4% (41/395) in the control and intervention groups, respectively.
However, even in this extremely unlikely setting, due to similar death
rates, there would still be reasonable evidence of a difference
in rates between groups (unadjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.97;
p = 0.029. Including variables in addition to age and gender in
the logistic regression models such as hospital site, diabetes and
ASA grade did not&#x000a0;significantly improve the model fits (p-values
from chi-squared tests were &#x0003e; 0.05). Therefore, the effects of the&#x000a0;variables
reported in Table II on outcomes, other than age and gender, are
negligible (i.e. their ORs were approximately one).</p><p>There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for
length of stay in hospital. The medians for the control and intervention
groups were 23 days (interquartile range (IQR) 11 to 41) and 21
days (IQR 10 to 41) (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.265) or post-operative
mortality (chi-squared test; p = 0.858). Stay in a critical care
unit (CCS) differed between the two groups, with 19 (4.7%) of the control
group requiring this treatment, compared with two (0.5%) of the
intervention group (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test; p &#x0003c; 0.001) (Table III).
There was weak evidence for
an association between length of CCS and SSI, both superficial and deep,
with 3% (21/699) of those patients without a CCS having a SSI, compared
with 13% (2/15) of those with a CCS and an SSI (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test
p = 0.08). A total of three patients with SSIs did not have data
on whether they had a CCS and were not included in the analysis.
The difference in length of CCS was in part due to the different
rate and represents a marker of increased risk of SSI.</p><p>There was no evidence that the rate of development of any of
the complications differed between the groups (Table IV).</p><table-wrap id="t4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table IV</label><caption><p>Reported complications, summarised

control trials, which was a pivotal stimulus for our trial. <italic>In
vitro </italic>studies have shown that high dose impregnated cement
(1 g Gentamicin and 1 g of Clindamycin) inhibits bacterial growth
on agar plates for up to 672 hours, whereas with standard antibiotic
loaded cement (0.5 g Gentamicin) activity stops after 48 hours.<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This suggests that
a broader bacterial spectrum can be achieved for a longer period
of time.<sup><xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>As well as the primary endpoint of deep SSI, our randomised clinical
trial found a statistically significant reduction in combined SSI
between patients having low <italic>versus</italic> high dual dose
antibiotic cement when treated surgically for an intracapsular fracture
of the hip. This could have an effect on the rate of superficial
SSI because of a higher elution of antibiotics into the wound exudate
in the treatment group. The groups were equally matched and the
overall the rates of complications were similar, but there was evidence
of slightly increased CCSs in the low dose antibiotic group.</p><p>Less than 5% of patients in both groups did not receive their
allocated intervention. We had expected this rate to be lower with
this method of randomisation. Contamination generally occurred in
the crossover phase of the
trial, being at the start of a month when the alternate intervention
was being introduced.</p><p>Opponents of the use of local antibiotics have argued that using antibiotic impregnated
cement can lead to the development of bacterial resistance.<sup><xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> This theory is
based on having sub-inhibitory concentrations and the development
of resistance among infecting organisms.<sup><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> While there is <italic>in vitro</italic> data
to suggest that prolonged exposure of organisms to sub-inhibitory
levels of antibiotics encourages mutational adaptations that confer
resistance,<sup><xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> there remains
little clinical evidence to support this theory. On the other hand,
higher dose, dual action antibiotic cement <italic>in vivo</italic>,
results in a more potent and more prolonged inhibition of bacterial
growth.<sup><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, we did not find any significant change in the profile
of the infecting pathogens between groups.</p><p>The main strength of this trial is that it was entirely pragmatic.
Although we recruited patients from only two centres, the large
number of surgeons of various grades involved in the study realistically
reflects surgical practice.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Other
strengths included the use of a nationally recognised definition
of SSI, which was assessed by HPA trained nurses, and the high levels
of complete follow-up data at the primary endpoint (95%).</p><p>The key limitation was the use of quasi-randomisation, which
is widely recognised as being less rigorous than conventional randomisation.
Differences in the target population, local environment and procedures
at each of the sites of the study had the potential to confound
the effects of the intervention. Therefore group randomisation was
used and interventions were alternated on a monthly basis at each site
in an attempt to balance the characteristics of the patients and
unknown systematic effects of the treatments. There is also potential
bias near the time of change over, though the presence of a best
practice tariff ameliorates this fact as 90% of patients are operated
on within 36 hours and 24 consultant surgeons were involved in recruitment. Secondly,
these patients were all discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting.
Thirdly, the parenteral antibiotic regimen was modified during the
course of the trial. However, this change did not have any statistically
significant impact on the comparative analysis of the rates of deep
SSI between the groups. A similar analysis for combined deep and
superficial infections also showed that inferences were unchanged
after adjusting for the change in antibiotic regimen (likelihood
ratio test; p = 0.187).</p><p>With rigorous statistical interrogation, the two groups were
found to be comparable in terms of the demographics and important
expected comorbidities. The rates of SSI were calculated after excluding
those patients who died within 30 days of operation. It is possible
that some or all of these patients could have had a SSI, therefore
the reported rates might be underestimates of the true rates of
SSI in these patients. However, given that the rates of death were similar
in both groups, it is unlikely that this would explain the difference
in the rate of SSI between the groups. </p><p>Finally, there was some deviation from the original statistical
plan. A random effect was to be included in the logistic regression
model to account for heterogeneity due to the operating surgeon.
However, the relevant data were not consistently reported, so the
simpler fixed effects model only was fitted to the data. This would
not have modified the outcome in any significant way.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial has provided evidence that high dose
dual-antibiotic impregnated cement leads to a reduction in the rate
of SSI in the treatment of patients with an intracapsular fracture
of the neck of the femur, with no associated increase in complications.
Orthopaedic surgeons will be able to use this information when deciding
on which type of bone cement to use in the treatment of these patients. </p><p>Take home message: 
The use of high dose dual-antibiotic impregnated cement in these
patients significantly reduces the rate of SSI compared with standard
low dose single antibiotic loaded bone cement.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Jameson</surname>
