There is also an increased interest by payers in comparative-effectiveness drug trials in which 2 drugs are directly compared.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> When trials are performed with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), no-difference outcomes are common and are typically interpreted as a demonstration of comparable efficacy.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Trials that show a clear efficacy difference between therapies are more interpretable than trials that show no difference, but the ability of any AED to demonstrate superiority has not been commonly shown in add-on studies.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Pregabalin and gabapentin are 2 AEDs with similar &#x003b1;-2-&#x003b4;-ligand pharmacologies<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> that Emax modeling of published clinical trial data<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> showed had important different magnitudes of response for efficacy endpoints (figure e-1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003118">Neurology.org</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Modeling has been used to help with decision-making in early drug development.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, this approach is relevant for comparative-efficacy trials for established therapies. Assumptions based on modeling<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> (figure e-1) indicated that the expected difference between treatments would be 17% in favor of pregabalin. At the time this study was planned (2006&#x02013;2007), gabapentin and pregabalin were part of the armamentarium available for the treatment of resistant focal epilepsy, and it was anticipated that clinicians and payers, among others, would value information comparing both drugs since they had similar mechanisms. We therefore designed an add-on trial providing active treatments in both arms, which, as hypothesized, would demonstrate clear superiority of pregabalin compared to gabapentin in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures (POSs).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Study design.</title><p>This was a 2-arm, randomized, flexible-dose, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority study conducted in adult patients at 56 centers in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, and South and Central America between February 2008 and July 2013 (EVENT: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00537940). The study comprised 3 main phases: 6 weeks of baseline (screening), 9 weeks of double-blind dose escalation (titration), and 12 weeks of double-blind maintenance phase (21-week treatment phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). This design mirrored prior efficacy trials of both drugs, although to optimize safety and tolerability, there were 2 differences from prior trials. The first is that this study included 9 weeks of dose escalation compared to 0 to 4 weeks in earlier trials to potentially reduce discontinuations due to adverse events. Another difference is that uptitration was optional beyond a minimum dose of 100 mg 3 times daily (pregabalin) and 400 mg 3 times daily (gabapentin). After the 12-week double-blind maintenance phase, patients could enter a blinded continuation phase for a maximum of 2 years.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study design diagram</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="NEUROLOGY2015642413FF1"/></fig><p>This study began before the 2010 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) terminology for the organization of seizures.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Therefore, the 1981 terminology<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> was used.

The method of treatment administration was double-blind, double-dummy, with patients assigned either active pregabalin and dummy gabapentin or active gabapentin and dummy pregabalin. Investigators escalated doses of pregabalin (150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/d) or gabapentin (300, 600, 1,200, 1,500, and 1,800 mg/d) during the 9-week dose-escalation phase to the highest effective dose provided that tolerability was acceptable. The minimum maintenance phase dose was 300 mg/d (pregabalin) and 1,200 mg/d (gabapentin) divided 3 times daily. The optimized dose was continued during the maintenance phase. Dose reduction of the study drug was permitted once (for tolerability). Maintenance of prestudy regimens of other AEDs was required; no dose changes were permitted.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Efficacy endpoints.</title><p>This study was very similar in the definition of efficacy endpoints to a concurrent study that compared pregabalin and levetiracetam.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent change in 28-day seizure frequency during the 21-week treatment phase compared with baseline. We defined the key secondary efficacy endpoints as the proportion of participants with a 50% reduction (50% responder rate) or 75% reduction (75% responder rate) in 28-day seizure (all partial seizure) from baseline, with a reduction in the proportion of secondary generalized tonic-clonic (SGTC) from baseline (SGTC responder rate), and seizure-free in the last 28 days of treatment (seizure-free responder rate). SGTC seizures were equal to focal seizures developing into a bilateral, convulsive seizure in the 2010 ILAE classification.

Analyses of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints were based on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. We defined the mITT population as all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication and for whom there were at least 28 days of usable seizure data reported during baseline and after baseline, similar to the concurrent study.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The safety population included all randomized patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication. We used ranked analysis of covariance to assess treatment difference for the primary endpoint, which was percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure rate with the model including percent change from baseline as a response variable, treatment as the main effect, and baseline seizure count and cluster as covariates. In addition, we used Hodges-Lehmann estimation to estimate the median difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) for percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure rate. Logistic regression was used to assess 50% responder rate, with the model including 50% responder rate as the response variable, treatment as the main effect, and baseline seizure count and cluster as covariates. The Fisher exact test was used to assess 75% responder rate, SGCT responder rate, and last 28-day seizure-free responder rate.</p><p>An external data-monitoring committee carried out an unblinded interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, which sought to determine whether the study could be concluded for superiority with fewer patients after &#x02248;65% of patients had completed the maintenance phase.

Assay sensitivity is defined in the International Conference on Harmonization E-10 guideline as &#x0201c;a property of a clinical trial defined as the ability to distinguish an effective treatment from a less effective or ineffective treatment.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The E-10 guideline<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> suggests that the presence of assay sensitivity can be determined if prior similarly designed trials (such as used in the modeling) regularly distinguished effective from noneffective treatments. Whereas this criterion appears to have been satisfied, the guidance also states that &#x0201c;in addition, the actual study population entered, the concomitant therapies actually used, etc., should be assessed to ensure that conduct of the study was, in fact, similar to the previous trials.&#x0201d; This requirement likely was not met for the current study.</p><p>This outcome may reflect that no difference exists between the efficacies of these drugs in this population. If this is the case, then both are also more efficacious in this population than observed in previously studied populations. Another possibility is that this is a failed trial, unable to distinguish relative clinical efficacy of the 2 drugs. The present study found that the gabapentin 50% responder rate was nearly twice as high as it had been in all prior studies, despite the fact that only 20% of patients reached the maximum 1,800-mg dose, and since dose escalation, which was extended to 9 weeks, was included in the efficacy calculation, only 57% of the study duration was at the maintenance dose. The differences between the prior studies and the present study, including a longer titration and the individualized option of limiting dose, should have, if anything, reduced the apparent efficacy. The lack of difference in seizure control is also surprising in that the median dosages of gabapentin (1,500 mg/d) and pregabalin (450 mg/d) for the study are biased in regard to expected efficacy and in relation to the maximum dosages listed in the product labels for gabapentin (3,600 mg/d) and pregabalin (600 mg/d). Nonetheless, since there was no placebo group, it is impossible to know definitively whether these results are true. Gabapentin when tested against placebo had a relatively weak effect (highest median percentage effect of 19.5%) in the original add-on trials. If the current results are taken at face value, this drug would now be demonstrating better responder rates for treatment-resistant patients than any other AED.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The dropouts resulting from adverse events for both study drugs were similar within the current study (pregabalin 6.2%, gabapentin 7.1%) compared to the prior studies (pregabalin 16.2%, gabapentin 5.6%).</p><p>Because of the richness of the available prior data for both drugs, this study represents a unique opportunity to dissect the causes for the loss of assay sensitivity and to explain why past experience (as exemplified by modeled data) does not predict the future when shifting environmental factors and populations are at play. While the inclusion and exclusion criteria remained virtually unchanged over time, there were notable differences between the original gabapentin and pregabalin studies. The pivotal gabapentin and pregabalin studies were performed in the late 1980s and 1990s. All were completed in 15 to 30 months and were performed in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and South Africa. In contrast, the current study ran for &#x0003e;5 years (February 2008&#x02013;July 2013) at 56 sites, with few in Western Europe and none in the United States or Canada. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> lists patient characteristics that differed between the previous trials and the current trial. As an indication of the increase in available drugs, in the original gabapentin studies, only 3 to 5 concomitant AEDs were used commonly (taken by &#x02265;10% of patients); a decade later, this rose to 5 to 7; and in the current study, it remained in this range, at 8, although 4 of them were different drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). Another factor that may contribute to the mismatch of the original studies and the current study is the lower baseline 28-day seizure frequency in the current study (mean 13.1&#x02013;14.1, median 5.5&#x02013;5.8). The previous pregabalin and gabapentin studies had higher means (18.6&#x02013;27.4 and 20.2&#x02013;51.7, respectively) and medians (8.8&#x02013;12.3 and 9.5&#x02013;12.7, respectively). These differences could be due to referral source: large academic centers in the original trials vs clinical practice sites in the current trial. In the postmarketing environment, the balance or ratio of research and clinical practice investigational sites may change. Pivotal registration trials are more likely to be performed in epilepsy centers, while the postmarketing studies may have investigators with more general expertise. All of these factors, including differing time periods, countries (and demographic makeup of the patients enrolled), types of sites, seizure frequencies at baseline, and the types and number of concomitant AEDs, together may contribute to the divergence of the modeled prior data from the current study. Although the written protocols did not substantially differ, these factors changed the type of patients who enrolled in the trial.</p><p>Placebo-controlled arms were included in the earlier Pfizer pregabalin and gabapentin studies,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and each drug was compared to placebo.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Here, there was no placebo-controlled arm, and patients knew they were receiving active treatment; thus, all had reason to expect improvement. The fact that both treatment arms were active may have caused the patients, caregivers, and site staff to be biased to notice improvement.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> While seizures appear to be an objective event, they are still patient-reported, which may increase the likelihood of ascertainment bias. Methodologies to improve outcome assessment with technology such as seizure detection devices have been discussed<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and could be considered for future trials.</p><p>The patients&#x02019; response overall demonstrated more improvement than expected from modeling, which might suggest a combination of drug effect and placebo response. Placebo response has been climbing over time in epilepsy studies.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the absence of a placebo arm, it is very difficult to determine the influence of a placebo effect on the trial results. Of interest, the patients in the current study had a shorter history of epilepsy (&#x02248;15 years) than the original trials, which ranged from 18 to 26 years. In a lacosamide pooled analysis,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> shorter duration of epilepsy (with fewer background AEDs) increased the likelihood of placebo-associated improvement.</p><p>A negative clinical trial is one in which it is obvious that the drug under study did not work. The cause of a failed clinical trial is potentially more difficult to discern. Had the expectation been that these 2 drugs were the same rather than that they were different, this would not have been a failed trial. Here, both study drugs showed more improvement in seizure frequencies than expected. The results again raise the question of the impact of the changing environment of epilepsy studies, which are now often conducted in numerous sites and countries with differing background medical care. A future topic of discussion must be how to account for these changes in modern clinical trial design and how to conduct them without losing the benefit of prior knowledge.</p><p>These results suggest that designing trials that compare the efficacy of 2 active treatments is fraught with potential confounders that can mute the real differences that may exist in drug effect.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This should be taken into consideration when a no-difference outcome is observed, regardless of whether prior trials have suggested the existence of assay sensitivity, if study populations have changed over time.</p></sec>
