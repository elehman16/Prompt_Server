Possible explanations include higher incidence of flaring, higher mean disease activity or lower TNFi use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>18&#x02005;months data from the DRESS study were used. Change in Sharp-van der Heijde (&#x00394;SvdH) score (linear regression) and proportion of patients with &#x0003e;0.5 &#x00394;SvdH (logistic regression) were used as outcomes. The cumulative incidence and number of short-lived and major flares per patient, mean time-weighted disease activity (MTW-DAS28-CRP) and TNFi use were used as independent variables.

MTW-DAS28-CRP, but not incidence or number of short-lived or major flares, or TNFi use, was independently associated with the mean progression score, but only in the tapering group. Additional analyses on DAS28-CRP subcomponents showed that this was mainly caused by MTW swollen joint count.

It could be hypothesised that the tapering strategy leads to a higher incidence of flares, thus causing radiographic progression (in both groups or tapering group alone).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Second, a significantly higher mean time-weighted (MTW) disease activity was observed in the tapering group, again induced by the tapering and higher MTW disease activity could result in radiographic progression (in both groups or tapering group alone). Third, tapering causes lower TNFi exposition. Previous studies have suggested that TNFi use itself may prevent radiographic progression. Therefore, lower TNFi exposition could lead to progression, independent of increased disease activity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref></p><p>These hypotheses have different clinical implications. In the first two hypotheses, the effect is temporarily: progression is caused by a (sometimes unsuccessful) tapering attempt, not by lower TNFi use itself&#x02014;so in subsequent years, damage would not progress further. Tight control should be optimised, and if flares could be predicted, progression would be reduced. The third hypothesis would mean an ongoing process of radiographic progression in following years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2016000327F1">figure 1</xref>), and although the increase in progression that we found is minimal, it may become significant in subsequent years with consequent loss of function or pain symptoms. It would not be preventable by tight control alone and would require frequent radiographic monitoring and adaptation of TNFi use.</p><fig id="RMDOPEN2016000327F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Hypotheses for causes of progression and development over time.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="rmdopen2016000327f01"/></fig><p>Therefore, we investigated the effects of the occurrence of short-lived or major flare, MTW disease activity and TNFi exposition on radiographic progression in patients tapering TNFi compared with patients not tapering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and definitions</title><p>Clinical and radiographic data from the DRESS study were used: an 18-month, open randomised clinical trial, investigating non-inferiority of a disease activity-guided tapering strategy of adalimumab or etanercept compared with usual care (UC).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

Analyses yielded an association between MTW disease activity and radiographic progression, but only in the tapering group. No association was found between the occurrence or number of flares or lower TNFi exposition and radiographic progression.</p><p>Additional analyses on subcomponents of DAS28-CRP showed that radiographic progression was mainly caused by swollen joint count. Thus, it is the small overall increase in disease activity over time, and more specifically swollen joints, caused by the tapering strategy, and not the intermittent episodes of high disease activity (flares) that appear to cause progression. This suggests that radiographic progression occurs when two necessary causes (higher disease activity and tapering) are present. Therefore, tight control&#x02014;although also important in non-tapering patients&#x02014;is even more important when tapering TNFi, to prevent additional progression. However, further progression in subsequent years is not to be expected, as higher disease activity is a temporary effect of a trial-and-error tapering strategy, and disease activity was similar between dose reduction and the UC group at 18&#x02005;months.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, the follow-up time of 18&#x02005;months was limited. Furthermore, the level of radiographic progression that is of clinical relevance is somewhat debatable. In 2006, Welsing <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> established a level of five Sharp-Van der Heijde points per year as the minimal clinically important change. This level may be different for the current RA population treated with more strict tight control. Therefore, we also analysed progression with different cut-off levels (SDC and minimal progression &#x0003c;0.5 SvdH points), as well as with continuous SvdH score to be as sensitive as possible. Finally, the observed SDC is relatively high and some misclassification of patients with progression that is actually due to measurement error could be present. However, this would cause bias towards a null result, whereas we did find differences in radiographic progression and in associations between disease activity and progression.</p><p>Our findings are in line with three studies that have shown some effect of discontinuation but no effect of tapering of TNFi tapering on radiographic progression in RA.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> In the STRASS study, patients were randomised to disease activity-guided TNFi tapering or continuation of treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Multiple tapering attempts were allowed. A difference in disease activity and relapse rate was observed, but no difference in radiographic progression. Follow-up time and SDC were comparable to our study, but sample size was smaller, which may explain the null result. In PRESERVE, patients were treated with etanercept and methotrexate for 36&#x02005;weeks after which they were randomised to etanercept fixed dose halving, discontinuation or full-dose continuation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A significantly greater proportion of patients in the discontinuation group exceeded the SDC compared with patients continuing etanercept. This was explained by the fact that patients had moderate disease activity and were refractory to methotrexate monotherapy at study start. Furthermore, disease activity was not steered on, leading to a significant rise in DAS28 after etanercept discontinuation. Finally, Raffeiner <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> showed that randomisation of RA patients in remission under etanercept, to either receive fixed halve dose etanercept or continuation of full-dose etanercept, did not lead to differences in radiographic progression after 2&#x02005;years. However, this study did not include discontinuation of etanercept.</p><p>In conclusion, disease activity-guided TNFi tapering may result in a small increase in radiographic progression. This is possibly due to the disappearance of the direct inhibitory effect of TNFi on radiographic progression (&#x02018;disconnect&#x02019;), so that inflammation resumes driving this progression. These findings stress the increased importance of maintaining a state of low disease activity or remission&#x02014;especially low swollen joint count&#x02014;in patients in whom TNFi is tapered and to check for radiographic progression regularly. Long-term studies on TNFi tapering need to confirm that radiographic damage does not continue to progress over the years. Also, future studies should focus on predictors of successful tapering or discontinuation to further prevent the rise in disease activity that is the consequence of tapering.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all rheumatologists and specialist nurses from The Sint Maartenskliniek Nijmegen and Woerden for their participation in data collection.
