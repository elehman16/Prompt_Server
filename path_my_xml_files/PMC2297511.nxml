A total of 155 primary vaccinated and 20 previously vaccinated volunteers participated. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio to receive intradermal (i.d.) vaccination with live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine at a reduced dose (1/5<sup>th</sup>; 0&#x000b7;1 mL) or the conventional subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination (0&#x000b7;5 mL). Antibody neutralization titers were determined at 2, 4 and 8 weeks and 1 year after vaccination by counting the reduction in virus-induced plaques in the presence of serial serum dilutions. Adverse events were documented in a 3-week dairy. Viraemia was measured 5 days after vaccination. From 2 weeks up to one year after vaccination, the maximum serum-dilution at which 80&#x00025; of the virus plaques were neutralized, which indicates protection against yellow fever, did not differ between those given a reduced i.d. dose or standard s.c. dose of vaccine. In all cases the WHO standard of seroprotection (i.e. 80&#x00025; virus neutralization) was reached (in 77/77 and 78/78, respectively). Similar results were found in the previously vaccinated individuals. Viraemia was detected in half of the primary vaccinated participants, which was not predictive of serological response. In revaccinees no viraemia was detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intradermal administration of one fifth of the amount of yellow fever vaccine administered subcutaneously results in protective seroimmunity in all volunteers. Albeit this vaccination route should enable vaccination of five-times as many individuals at risk for disease, these results should now be confirmed in field studies in areas with potential yellow fever virus transmission to change vaccination policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Nederlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=231">ISRCTN46326316</ext-link>

It is estimated to affect 200.000 individuals annually of whom approximately 30.000 die worldwide <xref rid="pone.0001993-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The virus is transmitted by infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, and may cause a wide spectrum of disease, from mild symptoms to severe illness accompanied by fever, hepatic and myocardial injury, renal failure, hemorrhage, and even death. There is no curative treatment for yellow fever, making vector control and vaccination essential ingredients in the prevention of yellow fever morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Although this flavivirus has never emerged in Asia, the Asian continent is considered vulnerable to future introduction of the virus, because of the presence of a large susceptible human population, the presence of the urban vector and increasing international travel <xref rid="pone.0001993-Monath1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Also Western countries may be at risk: for instance, in the Netherlands, the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito was introduced via imported bamboo from China, and its capability of transmission of flaviviruses is currently under investigation.</p><p>Thus, there is a potential risk for large epidemics of urban yellow fever now that migration of people from rural areas may introduce the virus into areas of high human population density, such as large African and South-American cities. During yellow fever epidemics in non-immune populations, case-fatality rates may be as high as 50&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0001993-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In case of simultaneous outbreaks in megacities the current emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine of 6 million doses will not be sufficient to protect the large populations from the disease <xref rid="pone.0001993-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Yellow fever vaccination is the single most important and effective means to prevent the occurrence of yellow fever, and carries a low risk of serious adverse events. The live-attenuated 17D vaccine provides protective immunity within one to two weeks in 95&#x00025; of those vaccinated <xref rid="pone.0001993-Monath2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore strongly recommends to include yellow fever vaccination in at-risk countries, as part of the routine childhood immunization program. However, hampered by a limited vaccine supply, this recommendation has not yet been acted upon as epidemic emergencies have priority. Besides mass immunization campaigns in response to epidemic outbreaks and planned routine childhood immunization programmes, yellow fever vaccination is used for preventive immunization of travellers to endemic regions <xref rid="pone.0001993-Monath3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, to circumvent the consequence of current shortage of vaccine supplies, there is an urgent need to find alternatives for the current standard of yellow fever vaccination, i.e., the subcutaneous administration of 0&#x000b7;5 mL 17D vaccine.</p><p>In general, the route of administration of a particular vaccine, e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous or intradermal, appears to have been reached at arbitrary historical grounds. For the yellow fever vaccine, subcutaneous administration of 0&#x000b7;5 mL followed the initial human trials in which yellow fever 17D (YF&#x02212;17D) vaccines were first put to extensive use. However, for some vaccines already, for instance rabies, hepatitis B and influenza vaccines, the classical subcutaneous or intramuscular routes have been challenged by the apparent efficacy of intradermal administration using appreciably smaller amounts of vaccine <xref rid="pone.0001993-Belshe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001993-Warrell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The safety and efficacy of this route of administration has not been addressed for the yellow fever vaccine. Interestingly, already in 1943, at the dawn of yellow fever vaccine development, Fox and colleagues observed an immune response after intradermal administration of the YF&#x02212;17D vaccine <xref rid="pone.0001993-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the population investigated was small and the method used to assess antibody responses is irreconcilable with current definitions of seroprotection formulated by the WHO. Furthermore, scarification experiments with yellow fever vaccine conducted in the 1950s revealed a lower response rate when compared to subcutaneous inoculation <xref rid="pone.0001993-Cannon1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001993-Dick1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we investigate the efficacy of intradermal inoculation of yellow fever vaccine at one fifth the amount given subcutaneously, as a potential strategy to reduce costs and increase vaccine coverage in areas with limited amounts of vaccine available for mass vaccination as well as for travellers to these areas. Furthermore, to elucidate requirements for the induction of an effective immune response to yellow fever vaccination we assessed antibody responses in relation to post-vaccination viraemia in both primary and revaccinated individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001993.s001">checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001993.s002">protocol S1</xref> with amendments <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001993.s003">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001993.s004">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001993.s005">S4</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study was conducted to determine whether reduced dose i.d. yellow fever vaccination (1/5<sup>th</sup>; 0&#x000b7;1 mL) would be as efficacious and safe as the conventional s.c. vaccination (0&#x000b7;5 mL).

We excluded volunteers with a compromised immunity due to underlying illness or immunosuppressive medication, pregnant volunteers and those with chicken egg allergy. The study was carried out between August 2005 and February 2007. Subjects were randomly assigned by the investigator (AHR) to either receive intradermal (i.d.) (experimental vaccination group) or subcutaneous (s.c.) (conventional vaccination group) yellow fever vaccination. Randomization was performed with the use of sealed envelopes containing the vaccination code balanced through in permuted blocks of 10 each. Vaccinations were administered at the travel clinic of the LUMC by the investigators who were trained in both methods of vaccine administration.</p><p>In the experimental vaccination group, participants received 0&#x000b7;1 mL YF&#x02212;17D vaccine intradermally on the dorsal side of the right forearm. The syringe which was used for i.d. administration is identical to the syringe used for administration of tuberculin in the Mantoux test. The quality of the i.d. injection was defined by the diameter of the arisen cutaneous wheal (adapted from the tuberculin skin test) <xref rid="pone.0001993-Center1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, with 6 mm being the lowest acceptable diameter. The conventional vaccination group received 0&#x000b7;5 ml YF&#x02212;17D vaccine subcutaneously in the right upper deltoid region.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>17D Yellow Fever Vaccine</title><p>The live, attenuated, 17D vaccine used in this study was manufactured on embryonated chicken eggs according to WHO regulations and stored according to manufacturer's guidelines. All administered vaccines originated from the same vaccine lot (Stamaril, Lot no Y5597, Sanofi Pasteur, France). A single vaccination dose of 0&#x000b7;5 ml contained approximately 3&#x000b7;5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> plaque forming units (PFU), measured in two randomly selected vials. Multiple dosages (maximally 4) were obtained from one vial for i.d. vaccination.

For the antibody response in previously vaccinated individuals receiving a booster vaccination, basic descriptive statistics are used. It was anticipated that the small number in this subgroup would not allow a definite conclusion concerning non-inferiority and no power calculation was performed. Twenty previously vaccinated persons were included to monitor possible trends in interference of neutralizing antibodies in yellow fever vaccination. Paired t-test was performed to calculate their increase in neutralization after booster vaccination and linear regression was used to calculate influence of circulating antibodies on booster vaccination. Neutralizing capacity of sera after i.d. and s.c. vaccination were compared with Student's t-test. Where appropriate, Chi-square tests were used, and Wilcoxon's test for non-parametrical distributed numerical data.

Both i.d. and s.c. administration of the vaccine resulted in protective seroimmunity in all subjects. Finally, the kinetics of the immune response were similar in both groups with neutralizing antibody responses peaking at 4 weeks after vaccination.</p><p>Several aspects of this study require comment. First, assuming 99&#x00025; seroprotection after primary vaccination in both groups, the population size in this study does not allow to detect differences less than 4&#x00025; between the experimental (i.d.) and conventional (s.c.) vaccination groups. However, the numbers are sufficient to reliably measure a log 0&#x000b7;7 virus neutralizing capacity in at least 95&#x00025; of those vaccinated intradermally, which meets the minimal required percentage of seroprotection after vaccination, as defined by the WHO <xref rid="pone.0001993-World1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Second, the viral dose contained in the trial vaccine was 3&#x000b7;5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> PFU/0&#x000b7;5mL, which is equivalent to approximately 5&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> Mouse Lethal Dose (MLD)<sub>50</sub> (21). A fivefold reduction of vaccine dose for i.d. delivery then still contains the minimal potency requirement (1&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> MLD<sub>50</sub>) as defined by the WHO <xref rid="pone.0001993-World1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, meaning that the results of this study cannot exclude that s.c. vaccination with 0&#x000b7;1 mL dose might be protective. Several lines of evidence however suggest that this may not be the case. More than sixty years ago Fox and colleagues verified the protective efficacy of human serum from vaccinees in a mouse challenge model and observed that at a similar vaccine dose, sera from intradermally injected subjects were more efficacious than sera of those injected subcutaneously <xref rid="pone.0001993-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additionally, 0&#x000b7;1 mL s.c. delivery of a live attenuated chimeric flavivirus vaccine against Japanese encephalitis in non-human primates resulted in a 7&#x02212;fold lower neutralizing antibody response compared to 0&#x000b7;1 mL i.d. delivery by micro needle <xref rid="pone.0001993-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Finally, this study has been performed in healthy adult volunteers who represent travellers to and not individuals living in an area of potential yellow fever transmission. This study should be repeated in a population living in a yellow fever endemic area, to account for differences in skin tissue composition, possible interactions by cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses, and possible decreased immune response due to malnutrition or chronic parasitic infections.</p><p>In regard to the reproducibility of these results, the significant variation in viral load between YF-17D vaccine batches is of importance. The batches generally contain 5&#x02013;50 times the minimal required potency dose to account for possible loss during storage and transportation <xref rid="pone.0001993-Monath2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The YF-17D batch used in this study contained five times the minimal required potency dose, and is therefore at the low side of the batch-variability in viral vaccine load. Intradermal YF-17D vaccination with other batches will thus yield similar results, as no other batch is likely to contain less virus particles.</p><p>Correct i.d. vaccination is technically more demanding than subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination. By introducing a minimal diameter cutoff of the cutaneous wheal following i.d. vaccination, we allowed to control for proper i.d. delivery of the vaccine. To our opinion, this simple test is a valuable tool to ensure correct i.d. vaccination.</p><p>Local adverse events such as erythema and swelling were reported to occur longer in the i.d. vaccinated group. This is consistent with other intradermally administered vaccines <xref rid="pone.0001993-Belshe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001993-Kenney1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and might represent the inflammatory reaction due to activation of local immunomodulating cells. To our opinion this increased duration of local adverse events will not be a reason to renounce the new cost-effective method of yellow fever vaccination investigated, as they were not experienced as more severely than the adverse events in the s.c. group. Evidently, adverse events with a frequency beneath 1/77 after low dose i.d. vaccination could not be detected in this study.</p><p>The participants who had been previously vaccinated against yellow fever all showed seroprotection after booster vaccination, irrespective of their pre-booster VN capacity, implying that circulating neutralizing antibodies did not interfere with the induction of a booster response. Furthermore, this study shows that detectable YF&#x02212;17D replication as evidenced by viraemia in the week after vaccination, was not required for induction of a booster response, which is consistent with previous findings by Reinhardt et al. <xref rid="pone.0001993-Reinhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The enhanced efficiency of the i.d. route of vaccination may be explained by direct targeting of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the dermis and epidermis. Despite the possibility of YF&#x02212;17D replication in dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0001993-BarbaSpaeth1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, Palmer and colleagues found this replication to be restricted due to rapid processing of the virus <xref rid="pone.0001993-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Together with the fact that despite the lower vaccine dose the number of intradermally vaccinated participants in which viraemia was measured was not reduced, it is likely that an even more reduced vaccine dose (than fivefold reduction) administered i.d. could induce a protective immune response.</p><p>The findings of this study have the following practical implications: 1) in case of an outbreak of urban yellow fever or vaccine shortage for travellers to endemic areas, i.d. administration of yellow fever vaccine will allow immunization of at least four times as many individuals as s.c. vaccination with the same limited vaccine supply, 2) provided that these results can be confirmed in field studies in areas with potential yellow fever virus transmission, the i.d. vaccination strategy could be implemented in routine immunization programmes and support the &#x02018;yellow fever risk reduction initiative&#x02019; launched by the WHO and UNICEF to envisage the immunization of 48 million people in 12 high-risk countries between now and 2010 <xref rid="pone.0001993-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 3) finally, these results suggest that travellers with a possible history of egg allergy in whom an i.d. test dose of 0&#x000b7;1 ml YF&#x02212;17D vaccine yielded a strong local urticarial reaction do not need further vaccination, but this should always be checked by virus neutralization tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001993.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.07 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001993.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001993.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.10 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001993.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001993.s003"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001993.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001993.s004"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001993.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001993.s005"><label>Protocol S4</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001993.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank A. de Visser, H. el Bannoudi and C.
