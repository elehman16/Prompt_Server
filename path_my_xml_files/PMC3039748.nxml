At baseline, and after 1, 2 and 3 years of treatment, the lowest possible inhaled corticosteroid dose required to maintain asthma control was determined, followed by determinations of nonspecific and HDM-allergen-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, late asthmatic reaction (LAR), immediate and late-phase skin reactions, and immunological response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SQ-standardized HDM SCIT provided a statistically significantly higher HDM-allergen tolerance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 <italic>vs</italic> placebo) in terms of a 1.6-fold increase in PD<sub>20</sub> (HDM-allergen inhalation challenge), a 60-fold increase in skin test histamine equivalent HDM-allergen concentrations, reduced immediate- and reduced or abolished late-phase skin reactions, as well as fewer patients with LAR.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airway hyperresponsiveness. This causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing usually associated with airflow obstruction in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Asthma progression often involves airway remodelling (permanent structural changes in airways), which may cause irreversible airflow obstruction and is associated with poorer clinical outcome among patients with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Airborne allergens such as house dust mite (HDM) allergens are strongly associated with asthma. House dust mite sensitization commonly initiates the allergic disease manifested as allergic rhinitis that can progress to allergic asthma. Because of the allergic march, only few patients with allergic asthma are still monosensitized as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>Asthma control is usually achieved by treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Prolonged use of high doses of ICS may be associated with a risk of systemic side effects, and although treatment with ICS improves symptoms and inhibits exacerbations, this treatment is not curative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Therefore, a treatment is needed that can reduce the use of high doses of ICS, prevent asthma progression to a more severe state and potentially cure patients.</p><p>Treatment with specific immunotherapy (SIT) induces immune tolerance to the allergen to which the patient is allergic and is currently the only treatment with the potential to alter the natural course of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Specific immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with allergic asthma in terms of reducing asthma symptom score and medication requirements, and improve bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Specific immunotherapy has also been shown to prevent progression of allergic rhinitis into asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and to provide sustained effect after treatment cessation in allergic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). As concluded in the recent Cochrane collaboration report, trials are required to elicit the effect of SIT compared with other therapies, as well as the effect of SIT with concurrent steroid therapy in patients with allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported that 3 years of SQ-standardized HDM subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) was generally well tolerated and partly replaced the need for ICS treatment to control asthma in adults with HDM-allergic asthma; HDM SCIT had a steroid-sparing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). From the same trial, we now present the difference in treatment efficacy between patients treated with SQ-standardized HDM SCIT plus ICS and patients treated with placebo plus ICS in terms of nonspecific and HDM-allergen-specific BHR, late asthmatic reaction (LAR), lung function, HDM-allergen-specific immediate- and late-phase skin reactions and immunological response (HDM-allergen-specific IgE and IgE-blocking factor).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 54 out of 112 screened patients aged 18&#x02013;60 were included: 32 men and 22 women.

In short, it was a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive SCIT with Alutard&#x000ae; SQ <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic> (<italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic>; ALK, H&#x000f8;rsholm, Denmark) or placebo.</p><p>Treatment included an &#x02018;8-week&#x02019; up-dosing (up to 100 000 SQ-U) and a &#x02018;3-year&#x02019; maintenance with injection intervals of 6 &#x000b1; 2 weeks. The placebo group received histamine injections according to the same dose increase and maintenance schedule (0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 mg histamine/ml).</p><p>Patients were also treated with ICS to control their asthma, giving two treatment groups: HDM SCIT plus ICS and placebo SCIT plus ICS. The lowest possible dose of ICS that maintained asthma control in each patient was determined by a stepwise reduction protocol at baseline and after 1, 2 and 3 years of treatment (September&#x02013;December). Asthma control was defined as &#x02018;the ICS dose one step higher than when patients had uncontrolled symptomatic asthma&#x02019;. Rescue medication (Salbutamol) was allowed as needed. Tolerability was evaluated by adverse event reporting.</p><p>The efficacy measures described in the following paragraph were performed at baseline and after 1, 2 and 3 years of treatment, just after the ICS dose adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Bronchial challenge tests</title><p><italic>Determination of nonspecific BHR.</italic> The methacholine bronchial challenge test was carried out with the dosimeter method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) using a Spira Elektro II&#x02122; nebuliser (Respiratory Care Centre, Hameenlinna, Finland). Patients inhaled a fixed amount of solution (nebulization time 0.5 s, start of nebulization at 50 ml, working pressure 2 atm), inspiratory flow of 50 l/s; inspiratory volume of 500&#x02013;800 ml. FEV<sub>1</sub> was measured before provocation and 90 s after each inhalation. Methacholine was administered in doubling doses from 18 to 11 520 &#x003bc;g. Bronchial challenge was terminated when FEV<sub>1</sub> decreased at least 20% compared with the patient&#x02019;s FEV<sub>1</sub> measured after a saline inhalation. The decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> was plotted against the methacholine dose (log scale) and the cumulative dose causing a 20% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> (PD<sub>20</sub>) was determined. The severity of nonspecific BHR was defined as follows: no BHR, PD<sub>20</sub> &#x0003e; 2000 &#x003bc;g; mild BHR, 1000 &#x003bc;g &#x0003c; PD<sub>20</sub> &#x02264; 2000 &#x003bc;g; moderate BHR, 250 &#x003bc;g &#x02264; PD<sub>20</sub> &#x02264; 1000 &#x003bc;g; severe BHR, PD<sub>20</sub> &#x0003c; 250 &#x003bc;g.</p><p><italic>Determination of HDM-allergen-specific BHR.</italic> The HDM-allergen bronchial challenge test was also carried out with the dosimeter method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A dry extract of <italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic> (Aquagen&#x000ae; SQ, 1 000 000 SQ-U/vial) was diluted to concentrations of 1000; 10 000; and 100 000 SQ-U/ml (ALK). Three breathing steps were used for each allergen concentration (two, four and eight breaths) and the cumulated allergen dose for each breathing step was calculated. Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> was determined 15 min after two initial inhalations with diluent. The maximum allergen dose delivered was 2 breaths of 1000 SQ-U + 2 breaths of 10 000 SQ-U + (2 + 4 + 8 breaths) of 100 000 SQ-U = 1 422 000 SQ-U. FEV<sub>1</sub> was measured before and 15 min after each inhalation. Bronchial challenge was terminated when FEV<sub>1</sub> decreased at least 20% compared with the patient&#x02019;s baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>. The decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> was plotted against the HDM-allergen dose (log scale), and the provocative dose causing a 20% decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> (PD<sub>20</sub>) determined. PD<sub>20</sub> was considered to be 2 844 000 SQ-U if a patient failed to reach a 20% decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p><italic>FEV</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> was measured according to guideline on a daily calibrated dry wedge spirometer (Vitalograph&#x000ae;, Buckingham, UK) and the percentage of predicted value calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Late asthmatic reaction and peak expiratory flow</title><p>Patients were provided with an electronic spirometer (Asthma monitor-1; Erish Jaeger GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) to record their peak expiratory flow (PEF) at home every hour for 24 h after allergen challenge (except during sleep). Late asthmatic reaction was defined as a surplus administration of beta-2 agonist because of asthma symptoms or a fall in PEF of at least 15% from the maximum value after recovery from the early-phase reaction. Morning and evening PEF was recorded over the entire trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Skin prick test titration</title><p>Dilutions of 1, 10 and 100 Histamine Equivalent in Prick (HEP) of <italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic> allergen extract (ALK) were used for skin prick test titration (SPTT) on the volar side of the forearm. Positive and negative controls were diluents with or without histamine dihydrochloride (10 mg/ml).

Endpoints were tested on a 5% significance level, and all tests and confidence intervals (CI) were two-sided. The null hypothesis was no difference between the two groups. There was no adjustment for multiplicity. Doses of methacholine (&#x003bc;g) and HDM-allergen (SQ-U), as well as the concentration of specific IgE (kU/L) were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed for normality. These data and serum IgE-blocking factor were analysed in <sc>anova</sc> with change from baseline as response variable, treatment as fixed effect and baseline as covariate. The proportions of patients experiencing a LAR were tested using Fischer&#x02019;s exact test with exact 95% confidence intervals. In the SPTT, the HDM-allergen dose (in HEP) and skin reactions (weal area in cm<sup>2</sup>) were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed for normality. A statistical parallel line regression model was applied to obtain the histamine equivalent HDM-allergen concentration. The immediate- and late-phase skin reactions were analysed with nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. <sc>sas</sc>&#x000ae; statistical software, Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients and tolerability</title><p>We included 54 patients with HDM-allergic asthma; 26 patients received HDM SCIT plus ICS (SCIT group) and 28 patients received placebo SCIT plus ICS (placebo group).

Patients with HDM-allergic asthma were treated with HDM SCIT plus ICS or placebo plus ICS for 3 years. Each year, ICS was adjusted to the minimal dose that maintained the patient&#x02019;s asthma in control and the efficacy and tolerability of SCIT was evaluated accordingly. We previously reported that SCIT reduced the ICS dose that maintained asthma in control and was well tolerated in HDM-allergic patients with moderate asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>We found that nonspecific BHR was reduced similarly in both groups after 1 year. Methacholine acts as direct stimuli of BHR by binding to specific receptors on the bronchial smooth muscle to cause constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Regular treatment with ICS is known to progressively reduce the patient&#x02019;s sensitivity to this stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), and we found that SCIT fully replaced this effect over 3 years. However, nonspecific BHR was not fully reversed in any of the groups; persistent BHR has been found to correlate significantly with airway remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), which may be irreversible once established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Lung function was also unchanged in both groups after 3 years of treatment. Overall, supporting previous findings that HDM SCIT partly replaced ICS in providing asthma control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Both immediate- and late-phase reactions to HDM allergens were markedly more reduced in SCIT plus ICS treated patients than in patients treated only with ICS. House dust mite-allergens act indirectly by inducing the allergic reaction causing BHR and skin reactions; an immediate IgE-mediated mast-cell-driven response within 15&#x02013;30 min, and for some, a late-phase allergic inflammation 6&#x02013;12 h after allergen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Measuring allergen-specific BHR and skin reactions to HDM-allergen is, therefore, a direct measure of allergen tolerance in lungs and skin that can indicate if treatment improves the underlying allergic disease manifested as asthma. In this trial, patients treated with SCIT tolerated a higher inhaled HDM-allergen dose when challenged (PD<sub>20</sub> increased), fewer patients experienced a LAR to inhaled HDM-allergen challenge, the histamine equivalent concentration was higher at SPTT and the immediate-phase skin reaction was reduced. The late-phase skin reactions were strikingly diminished or abolished in the SCIT group and none of these patients experienced a severe late-phase skin reaction after only 2 years of treatment. Conclusively, HDM SCIT provided improved tolerability to HDM allergens in skin and lungs.</p><p>After SCIT, the suppression of early reactions in skin has been found associated with reduction in mast-cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), and suppression of late-phase skin reaction has been found associated with reduction in the number of infiltrating T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils and inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Thus, the increased allergen tolerability observed in this trial is probably because of a reduced allergic inflammation as a consequence to SCIT improving the underlying allergic disease.</p><p>Allergen-specific IgE is considered a central player in the allergic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and is increased in serum of patients with allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In this trial, SCIT also provided a change in the humoral immune response, which was absent in patients treated only with ICS; an initial increase in serum HDM-allergen-specific IgE antibodies followed by a decline and a marked increase in the effect of components blocking HDM-allergen-specific IgE function. The precise mechanism by which SIT acts remains unclear; however, consistent with the findings in this trial, an effect on IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; secreting regulatory T cells (Treg) associated with switching of allergen-specific B-cells towards IgG<sub>4</sub> production and suppression of allergen-specific IgE production is the most probable mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This was also observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), and probably reduce the immediate IgE-mediated mast-cell-driven allergic response and thereby also reduce the release of inflammatory mediators that induce the late-phase response, in this trial observed as reduced immediate- and late-phase reactions in lung and skin.</p><p>Treg may also directly inhibit the activation of allergen-specific Th2 cells, thereby reducing the production of Th2-cytokines and their multiple effects on cells involved in the allergic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Chen et al. demonstrated that 1 year of SQ-standardized HDM SCIT significantly decreased the serum level of the Th2-cytokine IL-13 (involved in the pathogenesis of airway remodelling) more than did ICS in children with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). At the same time, the serum level of IL-4 (a Th2-cytokine) decreased and the serum level of IFN-&#x003b3; (a Th1-cytokine) increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). This shift from an allergic &#x02018;Th2 cell predominance&#x02019; to a more normal &#x02018;type 1 Treg cell predominance&#x02019; immune response to allergen that also involves a shift in the balance of Th2 and Th1 cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) is also observed in allergic rhinitis after SIT, consistent with the idea of a one-airway-one-disease theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Therefore, the prevention of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and sustained effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) observed in patients with allergic rhinitis after SIT may also be expected treatment outcomes in patients with allergic asthma.</p><p>Because of the added benefit over ICS, we recommend that SIT is considered as first-hand medication when treating patients with HDM-allergic asthma. Because of current knowledge and current guidelines on asthma treatment (GINA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>), initial treatment is suggested to consist of SIT combined with controller medication in terms of inhaled ICS and reliever medication as needed. This trial indicates that over time, SIT will improve the underlying allergic disease in the majority of patients with asthma; the ICS dose can be down-titrated accordingly. For some patients with asthma, SCIT may ultimately become sufficient to control their asthma in combination with reliever medication.</p><p>In conclusion, SQ-standardized HDM SCIT induced a consistent immunomodulatory effect in adults with HDM-allergic asthma in terms of a change in the humoral immune response and as increased HDM-allergen tolerance in the lungs and skin of these patients. This strongly indicates that HDM SCIT treats the underlying allergic disease; sustained effect and prevention of disease progression may be expected treatment outcomes for the patient with HDM-allergic asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all patients who participated in this trial.
