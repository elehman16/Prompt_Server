However, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments on human breast cancer cells have reported contradictory results, indicating both a tumor suppressive and promoting functions of Wnt-5a. This could be due to various functions of Wnt-5a in different subgroups of patients. The unselected cohorts analyzed to date for Wnt-5a protein expression contained few premenopausal patients. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the prognostic significance of Wnt-5a protein expression in a cohort of premenopausal women with comprehensive data on biomarkers, molecular subtypes and long-term outcome. In a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no adjuvant treatment, 564 premenopausal primary breast cancer patients were included. The median follow-up time was 14 years. A tumor tissue array was constructed and 361 samples were evaluated for Wnt-5a reactivity by immunohistochemistry. The primary end-point was recurrence-free survival. Wnt-5a protein expression was reduced or lost in 146/361 of tumors and correlated to younger age, estrogen receptor (ER) negativity and triple-negative phenotype. Wnt-5a was a prognostic factor in the whole cohort (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). In patients with ER-positive tumors, Wnt-5a was an independent positive prognostic marker (HR 0.51 95% CI: 0.33&#x02013;0.78 <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002) and HER2 a negative prognostic marker (HR 2.84 95% CI: 1.51&#x02013;5.31, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001) in a Cox multivariate analysis adjusted for standard prognostic markers and tamoxifen treatment. In the ER-negative subset, Wnt-5a added no prognostic information. In a subgroup analysis, Wnt-5a was significantly associated with better prognosis in patients with Luminal A tumors (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). Conclusively, our results suggest that loss of Wnt-5a is a valuable prognostic marker in premenopausal breast cancer patients in particular in patients with ER-positive tumors and out-performed conventional prognostic factors in this subset of patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, S&#x000f6;derberg Foundations, Malm&#x000f6; University Hospital Cancer Foundation, Gunnar Nilsson's Cancer Foundation, the BioCare program at Lund University, Berta Kamprad Foundation, SUS Research Foundation, Percy Falk Foundation, Swedish Society of Medicine, Sk&#x000e5;ne County Council's Research and Development Foundation, and by Governmental Funding of Clinical Research within the national health services (ALF).

The heterogeneity of the disease affects not only the prognosis but also the choice of treatment <xref rid="pone.0070890-Early1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One very important factor in this context is the menopausal status of the patient. Breast cancer in premenopausal women is generally more aggressive and has a poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0070890-Early1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As a reflection of the difference between breast cancer in women with varying menopausal status, breast cancer in premenopausal females are more often estrogen receptor negative (ER&#x02212;) although &#x0003e;50% of premenopausal breast cancer are ER+ <xref rid="pone.0070890-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, premenopausal breast cancers usually have higher proliferation indices than tumors in postmenopausal women <xref rid="pone.0070890-Goldhirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Consequently, studies on the prognostic value of new biomarkers have to properly address this heterogeneous property of breast cancer.</p><p>Wnt proteins belong to a family of secreted proteins involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Wnt signaling can be broadly divided into two categories; the canonical, &#x000df;-catenin-dependent pathway and the non-canonical &#x000df;-catenin-independent pathway. Wnt signaling is initiated by binding of a Wnt ligand to its receptor(s). Canonical Wnt signaling results in stabilization of the key transcription factor &#x000df;-catenin, leading to its translocation into the nucleus where it drives the expression of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-MYC <xref rid="pone.0070890-Moon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Wnt-5a is a non-canonical Wnt ligand that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues <xref rid="pone.0070890-Ying1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In cancer, Wnt-5a is often dysregulated and the protein has been implicated both in tumor suppressive as well as in tumor promoting activities <xref rid="pone.0070890-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In good agreement with these findings, Wnt-5a has been recognized both as a marker of favorable and of poor outcome in primary cancers. We, and others, have previously shown that loss or low expression of Wnt-5a in the primary tumor has an unfavorable prognostic value in breast, prostate and colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jonsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Dejmek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Leris1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Dejmek2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Loss or reduced Wnt-5a expression has also been reported in liver metastases from patients with colorectal cancer <xref rid="pone.0070890-Ki1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In primary hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma and thyroid cancer, loss of or reduced Wnt-5a expression has also been associated with an adverse outcome <xref rid="pone.0070890-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, a tumor promoting function has been strongly documented for Wnt-5a in melanoma and in melanoma elevated Wnt-5a expression has also been associated with poor prognosis <xref rid="pone.0070890-Weeraratna1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jenei1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Similar results were also reported for the role and prognostic properties of Wnt-5a in gastric cancer <xref rid="pone.0070890-Kurayoshi1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Collectively, these findings underscore the complex functional and prognostic roles of Wnt-5a in cancer.</p><p>In experimental studies, we found that reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling decreased the migratory capacity and invasiveness of cultured breast cancer cells and that administration of a Wnt-5a-mimicking peptide significantly reduced breast cancer metastases in a mouse model <xref rid="pone.0070890-Safholm1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Safholm2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently these findings have been confirmed and in addition it was shown that when 4T1 breast cancer cells were transfected to express Wnt-5a their injection into the tail vein of Balb/c mice resulted in significantly less lung metastases as compared to control cells <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Despite all these findings it has also been reported from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments that Wnt-5a can promote migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines <xref rid="pone.0070890-Pukrop1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. It is possible that these contradictory results could be due to different properties of the cell lines investigated and that this might reflect different functional properties of Wnt-5a in the different subgroups of breast cancer. Such a possibility is strengthened by the fact that in the unselected cohorts analysed for Wnt5a protein expression there were few premenopausal breast cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jonsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Dejmek2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Here, we investigate for the first time the prognostic value of Wnt-5a expression in breast cancer tissue from a large cohort of premenopausal patients with comprehensive data on molecular subtypes and long-term outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Verbal informed consent was provided from all included patients.

Two 0.6 mm tissue cores were taken from each donor block and mounted in a recipient block. There were approximately 200 tissue cores in each recipient block. Cores were generally taken from the peripheral part of the tumor in cases where the tumor had relatively well defined borders. For technical reasons, in more diffusely growing tumors, areas with the highest tumor cell density were primarily targeted. Sections (4 mm thick) were dried, dewaxed, rehydrated, and microwave treated for 5 minutes in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) before being processed in an automatic immunohistochemistry staining-machine (Techmate 500; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) using antibodies against Wnt-5a (dilution 1&#x02236;200) or Ki-67 (1&#x02236;200, M7240; DAKO). The polyclonal antibody against Wnt-5a was developed and characterized in our laboratory <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jonsson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-SyedKhaja1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. For antibodies against ER, PR, VEGF-A, and HER2, heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed using microwave treatment for 2&#x000d7;5 minutes in citrate buffer before being processed either in the Ventana Benchmark system (Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, AZ) using pre-diluted antibodies to ER (anti-ER, clone 6F11), PR (anti-PR, clone 16) and HER2 (Pathway CB-USA, 760&#x02013;2694), or in the Techmate system (TechMate500, DAKO, Denmark) for VEGF-A using a polyclonal antibody (clone A-20, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Cytoplasmic staining of Wnt-5a was assessed by two investigators, one of whom is a board-certified pathologist (RE), according to intensity (negative &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, weak &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1, moderate &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2, strong &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). No Wnt-5a staining was present in the nucleus. Cores with discordant scores were reassessed jointly and a consensus was reached. For immunohistochemical evaluation of Ki-67, a scoring system based on the estimated fractions of positively staining nuclei was used as follows: 0, 0&#x02013;1%; 1, 1&#x02013;10%; 2, 11&#x02013;25%; 3, 26&#x02013;50%; and 4, 51&#x02013;100%. The intensity of the nuclear staining for Ki-67 varied slightly, but was distinct in most cases. For statistical evaluation, tumors were classified as I&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x02013;10% Ki67 positive nuclei; II&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11&#x02013;25% positive nuclei, and III &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x0003e;25% positive nuclei. ER-negativity and PR-negativity was defined as &#x0003c;10% positively staining nuclei, according to current clinical guidelines in Sweden. Staining of VEGF-A was only evaluated in invasive tumor cells and evaluated according to a semi-quantitative scale for staining intensity (0&#x02013;3). In the further analysis absent and weak staining intensity was considered as low protein expression and moderate and intense staining was considered as high protein expression. HER2 was assessed by IHC and fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0070890-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate survival according to Wnt-5a expression and log rank test to assess for equality of survival curves. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards model for RFS in uni- and multivariate analyses. The model was used to estimate the interaction between TAM treatment and Wnt-5a expression measuring a possible difference in treatment effect depending on Wnt-5a expression and an interaction variable was constructed (TAM treatment +/&#x02212; x Wnt-5a expression +/&#x02212;).

As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070890-t001">Table 1</xref>, loss of Wnt-5a was associated with younger age (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.016), ER negativity (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.016) and TNB- phenotype (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04). The correlation between Wnt-5a and ER is well in line with our previously published data <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jonsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and the finding isn't surprising, given that a majority of well established prognostic factors such as Ki67, NHG and HER2, show the same expression pattern in relation to that of ER. We also noted a positive association between Wnt-5a expression and VEGF-A expression, in accordance with previous findings in prostate cancer (25). No association was found between Wnt-5a expression and lymph node status, tumor size, histological tumor grade, or proliferation index (Ki67). Tumor characteristics did not differ between tumors with and without Wnt-5a status, confirming that the evaluated tumors were representative of the whole cohort (not shown).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0070890-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070890.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Associations between Wnt-5a and clinico-pathological variables.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0070890-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0070890.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wnt 5a low (0&#x02013;1) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;146)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wnt 5a high (2&#x02013;3) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;215)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

In ER+ patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;235) a significantly decreased risk of recurrence was seen in patients with moderate or strong expression of Wnt-5a (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.38&#x02013;0.85, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006). By multivariate analysis, Wnt-5a remained a statistically significant prognostic marker (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33&#x02013;0.78, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002) after adjusting for standard prognostic factors including TAM treatment. While neither lymph node status nor tumor grade was significantly associated with outcome in the multivariate analysis, expression of HER2 was independently associated with an increased risk of relapse (HR 2.84; 95% CI 1.51 to 5.31, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070890-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the ER- subgroup, no correlation between Wnt-5a expression and outcome was found (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.95). This was true also when restricting the analysis to patients allocated to no adjuvant treatment (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8). When analyzing patients according to breast cancer subtypes, we found that Wnt-5a was a robust prognostic marker for luminal A tumors (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;161) but not for luminal B, HER2+ or triple-negative tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070890-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In an exploratory analysis including patients with ER+ disease divided according to histological appearance in low (NHG I&#x02013;II), and high (NHG III) grade tumors, the prognostic effect of Wnt-5a expression was restricted to NHG I&#x02013;II tumors, (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070890-g003">Figure 3A&#x02013;B</xref>). Since the luminal A subgroup encompasses tumors with low proliferation indices, with all likelihood corresponding to NHG I and II tumors, this latter finding is not unexpected and supports the result of the subtype analysis. VEGF-A expression did not add any prognostic information in the whole cohort, nor in the ER+ subset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0070890-t002">Table 2</xref>). When categorizing tumors according VEGF-A expression and Wnt-5a expression into four groups (Wnt-5a low/VEGF-A high, Wnt-5a low/VEGF-A low, Wnt-5a high/VEGF-A high, Wnt-a5a high/VEGF-A low), we were not able to find any prognostic information by adding VEGF-A status to the information obtained by Wnt-5a (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17 log rank test).</p><fig id="pone-0070890-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0070890.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Recurrence-free survival according to Wnt-5a expression and tamoxifen treatment in ER+ patients.</title><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates of recurrence free survival according to Wnt-5a status in ER+ patients with high/low proliferation rates A.

Patients with ER+/Wnt-5a low tumors (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;93) had a borderline beneficial effect of TAM in terms of RFS (HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.3&#x02013;1.0) p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07), but there was no significant effect of TAM in ER+/Wnt5a high tumors (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;163) (HR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4&#x02013;1.3) p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0070890-g003">figure 3C&#x02013;D</xref>). These results suggest that the addition of TAM does not have any significant effect neither in Wnt-5a high nor Wnt-5a low tumors, but the results were further explored in a Cox multivariate analysis including a term of interaction for Wnt-5a (+/&#x02212;) and TAM (+/&#x02212;), Wnt-5a and TAM. The Cox multivariate analysis showed that the term of interaction was not significant (HR 1.3 95% CI 0.6 &#x02013; 2.9, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6).

We therefore performed Matrigel invasion assays with control transfected and ER-transfected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This approach enabled us to compare the possible difference in Wnt-5a-induced effect on cell invasion in ER expressing cells with those lacking ER expression in breast cancer cells with an identical phenotype.

Thus, the role of Wnt5a in premenopausal breast cancer has until now been unclear. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether Wnt5a expression has a unique prognostic value in premenopausal breast cancer patients that could explain the contradictory <italic>in vitro</italic> findings of the effect of Wnt5a on breast cancer cells. Our present results show that Wnt5a expression is a marker of favourable outcome also in premenopausal breast cancer patients and that it is a particularly valuable prognostic marker and thus a possible therapeutic target in pre-menopausal breast cancer patients with ER+ tumors. In contrast, Wnt-5a was not a prognostic factor in premenopausal ER- breast tumors. It is possible, that the Wnt-5a effect in this subgroup is outweighed by the high proliferation rate and other characteristics of bad prognosis characterizing those tumors.</p><p>Given the heterogeneity of breast cancer, the present identification of Wnt5a as a potential prognostic biomarker and an indicator of novel future therapies that might aid in further improving the survival of pre menopausal patients with ER+ breast cancers. In premenopausal patients &#x0003e;50% of the patients have ER+ tumors <xref rid="pone.0070890-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Generally, ER+ breast cancer has a better prognosis than ER- tumors and ER+ tumors with low proliferating tumors, the luminal A subgroup, are treated by surgery and endocrine therapy alone, whereas the luminal B subgroup will benefit from the addition of chemotherapy. However, up to 40% of ER+ patients will experience tumor recurrence in their lifetime, approximately half of which occur within 5 years after the primary diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0070890-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Besides lymph node metastasis, there is as of today no prognostic factor that can be used to identify patients at risk of developing a late recurrence in the ER+ subgroup. The identification of biomarkers for prediction of prognosis would aid in stratification of patients and allow for early selection of optimal therapies. Moreover, it would spare patients with less aggressive tumors a treatment from which they will not benefit. The importance of patient selection for individualized therapy is highlighted in the St Gallen guidelines for the treatment of early breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0070890-Goldhirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown <italic>in vitro</italic> that recombinant Wnt-5a and a Wnt-5a-derived peptide impaired migration and invasion of ER-negative breast cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0070890-Safholm1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, but had no effects on tumor cells proliferation or survival <xref rid="pone.0070890-Safholm2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present study we expand these findings by demonstrating that the ability of Wnt-5a to impair breast cancer cell migration is unrelated to the ER status of the tumor cells. Taken together with the present clinical data these findings suggest that the absence or low expression of Wnt-5a in ER+ tumors can cause a more aggressive phenotype by increasing tumor cell invasiveness. The increased tumor cell invasiveness, independent of cell proliferation, caused by loss of Wnt-5a might in such tumors promote breast cancer cell dissemination and the formation of micro-metastases. These micro-metastases can remain dormant for years, eventually forming clinically significant metastases. This is particularly interesting from a therapeutic point of view since a Wnt-5a-derived peptide has been shown to reduce distant metastasis by 70&#x02013;90% in a breast cancer mouse model <xref rid="pone.0070890-Safholm2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, suggesting that reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling in Wnt-5a negative tumors is a promising novel targeted approach to prevent breast cancer metastases.</p><p>Since the patients in the study were given adjuvant treatment with TAM or no adjuvant treatment it was possible to compare the effect of TAM in patients with ER+ breast tumors expressing either low levels (&#x02212;/+) or high (++/+++) levels of the Wnt-5a protein. The data clearly show that in patients with ER+, Wnt-5a expressing tumors, adjuvant treatment with TAM did not improve recurrence-free survival. If this can be explained by the fact that patients with Wnt-5a expressing breast tumors already have a very favorable prognosis remains to be investigated. However, in the ER+ but low Wnt-5a expressing group there was a trend towards increased survival (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07) with adjuvant TAM treatment.</p><p>In the ER+ subgroup there is a particular problem in predicting late recurrence in the low proliferating luminal A subtype. A recent publication suggested a panel of ER, PR, HER2, p53 and Ki67 for improving prognostication of breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0070890-Millar1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, for tumors with low proliferation rates, p53 and Ki67 are less likely to provide relevant prognostic information. Our results identify Wnt-5a as a potential independent marker of better prognosis, in premenopausal patients with ER+ breast cancer, including those in the luminal A subgroup. This finding should however be interpreted with caution due to the exploratory nature of the subgroup analysis including a limited number of patients. These results are similar to the previously published data on Wnt-5a as a tumor suppressor and favorable prognostic factor in postmenopausal patients <xref rid="pone.0070890-Jonsson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070890-Dejmek1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Consequently, the previous and the present findings are particularly interesting since they suggest that Wnt-5a, a single biomarker determined by immunohistochemistry, could be a useful marker in the clinical setting for both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer patients.</p><p>Taken together, the present study reveal that Wnt5a expression is a marker of favourable outcome also in premenopausal breast cancer patients and that loss of Wnt5a is a particularly valuable prognostic marker and a possible therapeutic target in premenopausal breast cancer patients with ER+ and low proliferative tumors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Elise Nilsson and Lena Axelsson for excellent technical assistance, Dr P&#x000e4;r-Ola Bendahl for statistical advice and for performing the subgroup analysis, as well as the South-East Swedish Breast Cancer Group for providing access to clinical data and tumor tissue.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0070890-Early1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
