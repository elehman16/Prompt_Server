Patients were randomly classified into three groups of 14 each. Control group (A) received carbohydrate-based diet (protein: 20%, fat: 30%, and carbohydrate: 50%), study groups received two types of high-fat diet; Group B (protein: 20%, fat: 45% including half of olive oil and half sunflower oil, and carbohydrate: 35%); and Group C (protein: 20%, fat: 45% including sunflower oil, and carbohydrate: 35%) in the first 48 h of admission.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Basal characteristics of participants were the same. After the feeding trial, there was no difference between the groups in mean plasma and capillary glucose levels and insulin requirements. Serum high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level was increased significantly in Group B on day 10 compared to admission level (40.75 &#x000b1; 5.58 vs. 43.56 &#x000b1; 2.25, <italic>P</italic> = 0.05).

Therefore, we conducted this study to compare the effect of two types of fat-based enteral formula (olive oil fat-based formula and sunflower oil fat-based formula) with carbohydrate-based enteral formula, primarily on glycemic control and lipid profile and secondarily on the mortality, organ dysfunctions, and the length of stay in ICU in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized double-blind controlled trial received the Institutional Review Board approval for human research from the university hospital and was registered at irct.ir (IRCT2015100414901N7).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Forty-eight adult patients in both sexes, who were hospitalized in 32-bed ICU of a tertiary care university hospital and initiating enteral nutrition within 48 h following the hospital admission from August 2013 to December 2015, were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients enrolled in other studies that were pregnant or with previous diabetes, hyperglycemia on admission, body mass index &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hyperlipidemia, liver failure, nephrotic syndrome, and any contraindication to enteral nutrition were excluded from the study. Patients who were discharged or died before the 5<sup>th</sup> day of enteral nutrition administration were also excluded from the study. Participants were randomized by admitting to ICU and separated into three groups to receive high-protein enteral nutrition with different macronutrient compositions for at least 5 days; carbohydrate-based diet (Group A) (protein: 20%, fat: 30%, and carbohydrate: 50%), olive oil fat-based diet (Group B) (protein: 20%, fat: 45%, and carbohydrate: 35%), in which the olive oil included 50% of fat composition and sunflower fat-based diet (Group C) (protein: 20%, fat: 45%, and carbohydrate: 35%). Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated random number table. The period of intervention was 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study procedures</title><p>During the admission, written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their next of kin (when the patients cannot sign by themselves) after explaining the procedure of the study. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), demographic information, and medical history were recorded at ICU admission. Planned enteral nutrition was administered after stabilizing the hemodynamic condition of each patient, which was dependent on the patient's clinical condition, and then the physician was allowed to feeding. Infusion of feeding was performed by gravity through intermittent technique, 6 times a day (6 am, 9 am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm). The volume of administration was determined based on the calorie needs and tolerance of patients by starting from 50 mL. Through the first 24 h, if the patient could tolerate the feeding without any symptoms such as vomiting and suspected aspiration or gastric residual volume &#x0003e;200 mL, the infusion volume was increased to the goal volume. Gastrointestinal complications including high gastric residual volumes, diarrhea, vomiting, regurgitation, abdominal distension, constipation, and pulmonary aspiration were recorded every day. Gastric residuals were evaluated before each feeding for the first 2 days and then every 12 h for the remaining days.</p><p>Daily energy consumption was calculated by 25&#x02013;30 kcal/kg for each patient based on weight and metabolic condition. Calorie needs were measured, and calorie intake was recorded daily for each individual during the study period. The volume ratio (VR) was calculated to measure the efficacy of daily nutritional administration: VR (%) = (volume administered/volume prescribed) &#x000d7; 100. Glucose was not used for infusion nor was propofol used for sedation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Laboratory data</title><p>The glycemic profile of each patient was evaluated on a daily basis measuring venous fasting plasma glucose levels (at 6 AM) and the daily average capillary glucose level. Plasma glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method. Patients received intravenous regular insulin, if the blood glucose level was higher than 200 mg/dL. Fasting lipid profiles (triglycerides, total, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were measured in days 0 and 10 of intervention at 6 am before feeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome variables were the glycemic control and lipid profile in patients. The secondary outcome variables were the occurrence of organ failure and length of stay mortality in ICU. To evaluate the number of days that patients were in ICU, we calculated the number of ICU-free days, as early mortality could result in skewed data. Occurrence of organ failure was monitored during hospitalization. Mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was used to determine the extent of a person's organ function. Each patient was evaluated daily for cardiovascular failure, central nervous system failure, coagulation failure, hepatic failure, and renal failure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between control and study groups were calculated from baseline to the end of intervention. Demographic data, baseline values, and outcome measures were compared with one-way ANOVA. Categorical data between the groups were compared using Chi square test. To compare the changes through the intervention, paired <italic>t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon test were used. Results were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation or median (Q<sub>1</sub> &#x02212; Q<sub>2</sub>).

Our findings are similar to Wewalka's pilot study which was conducted on sixty medical critically ill hyperglycemic patients with either fat-based or glucose-based enteral nutrition. They found no difference in glucose levels between two groups.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In another study which was conducted on 147 traumatic critically ill patients, low-carbohydrate and high-fat (MUFA) enteral formula was more effective for glycemic control in critically ill patients compared with a standard enteral formula. No differences were observed between the two groups with regard to mortality, ICU stay, and gastrointestinal complications.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Mesejo <italic>et al</italic>. enrolled fifty critically ill patients with diabetes mellitus or stress hyperglycemia to receive a high protein, high-fat formula (starch, fructose, MUFA, and soluble fiber), or a high protein formula for 14 days. Patients who received high-fat formula had a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels, capillary glucose levels, and insulin requirements in comparison to patients on a conventional high-protein diet. This better glycemic control does not modify ICU length of stay, infectious complications, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In Mesejo's study, fiber intake and type of carbohydrate were different between two groups and this difference might affect the results. In Huschak <italic>et al</italic>. study, 33 severe multiple trauma patients (injury severity score 31.6 &#x000b1; 11.5) received either a glucose-based diet or a fat-based diet (olive oil). They concluded that patients, who received fat-based diet, had a better glucose control and shorter hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In Huschak's study, diets were administrated by total parenteral nutrition for 6 days and then transmitted to enteral nutrition. In another study, the effects of long-term feeding with a low carbohydrate content and high fat (MUFAs, fish oil, chromium, and antioxidants) were compared with a standard formula, on glycemic control in 105 tube-fed type II diabetic patients. Better glucose control was seen in patients fed with high-fat diet.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This study was not conducted in critically ill patients with stress hyperglycemia. Furthermore, administration of fish oil, chromium, and antioxidants might affect the results.</p><p>The studies which have reported better glycemic control with high-fat diet in ICU were conducted on hyperglycemic patients or on patients with severe stress. In contrast to mentioned studies, our study was conducted on normoglycemic patients admitted to ICU to assay the preventive effect of high-fat diet on stress hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Lipid profile</title><p>As in mentioned studies, both high-fat diets did not have any adverse effects on lipid variables. In addition, gastrointestinal complications in both high-fat diets were similar to carbohydrate-based diet. Studies have shown that high-monounsaturated fat diets decrease serum triglyceride and very LDL-C (VLDC-C) and increase serum HDL-C in comparison to high carbohydrate diets.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In our study, the administration of a high monounsaturated-fat diet showed a significant increase in HDL-C compared to other groups, but the decrease in serum triglyceride and VLDL-C was not significant. This may be due to the time of serum lipid levels measuring which was done on day 10 of intervention whereas longer time was needed to see changes on serum lipid variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Clinical outcomes</title><p>In our study, high-fat low-carbohydrate diets did not reduce organ failure involvement and mortality rate but the length of stay in ICU was reduced in high-olive fat group. Shorter duration of hospitalization was seen in critically ill patients with stress hyperglycemia with a low carbohydrate content formula and high MUFAs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Olive oil contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory components which can reduce inflammation in critically ill patient and shorten the duration of hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Our study showed that high-fat diets did not have any preventive effect on glycemic control of critically ill patients. Furthermore, blood lipids were not changed with high-fat diets except for the rise in HDL-C in the high olive oil fat diet. We did not find any difference in organ failure involvement and mortality rate between the groups, but the duration of hospitalization in ICU was significantly lower in high olive oil fat diet. We might conclude better clinical outcomes in high olive oil fat diet if larger patient samples were studied. In addition, the change on other lipid parameters might be seen in high olive oil fat diet if enough time had elapsed for measuring these variables.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Funding of this study was provided by the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We convey our gratitude to the National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Tehran, Iran, and the ICU staff at Rasoul Akram Hospital.</p></ack><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McClave</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name><name><surname>Martindale</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Braunschweig</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy in the adult critically ill patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.)</article-title><source>JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr</source><year>2016</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>159</fpage><lpage>211</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26773077</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>YJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>WQ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Optimal target range for blood glucose in hyperglycaemic patients in a neurocritical care unit</article-title><source>Diab Vasc Dis Res</source><year>2014</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>352</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24925103</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chase</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Pretty</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeifer</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Preiser</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Le Compte</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Organ failure and tight glycemic control in the SPRINT study</article-title><source>Crit Care</source><year>2010</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>R154</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20704712</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parsons</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Watkinson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Blood glucose control in critical care patients &#x02013; A review of the literature</article-title><source>Nurs Crit Care</source><year>2007</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>202</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17883602</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wagstaff</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>NW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diabetes and hyperglycemia in the critical care setting: Has the evidence for glycemic control vanished?
