Global efficacy, as assessed by the investigator, was significantly higher at both time points examined. The patient/guardian questionnaire revealed that azithromycin, with its less frequent administration and shorter duration of treatment, was considered to be both more effective and easier to use than tobramycin.</p><p>In the present study, the duration of treatment was regarded as &#x0201c;very satisfactory&#x0201d; by more than three times as many azithromycin-treated patients or guardians as tobramycin-treated patients or guardians (69.1% vs 20.5% respectively), though the difference was less marked when those rating the duration as merely &#x0201c;satisfactory&#x0201d; were included (95% vs 76.7% respectively). Similarly, instillation of drops was significantly easier in the azithromycin than in the tobramycin group, and a higher proportion of parents and guardians in the azithromycin group never found difficulty in performing usual daily activities. Although questionnaires of this type cannot provide details on why performing daily activities should be more difficult on tobramycin than on azithromycin, it is not difficult to imagine that instillation of eyedrops morning and evening would be less disruptive to daily family life and children&#x02019;s activities than a requirement to administer drops every 2 hours.</p><p>The bacteriological and clinical findings from this study have previously been reported, and the present results extend those findings.<xref rid="b12-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Clinical cure rate was reduced more rapidly by azithromycin than by tobramycin (41% vs 28.7% respectively on day 3, <italic>P</italic>=0.013) and was noninferior at the end of the study (89.2% vs 78.2% respectively at day 7). Resolution of bacterial pathogens, including resistant species, was similar with the two treatments. As in the present study, the results were broadly equivalent in the sub-24 months of age subgroup.</p><p>Although bacterial conjunctivitis generally resolves without treatment, there are benefits to be gained, particularly in moderate to severe cases, by the more rapid improvements that can be achieved with topical antibiotic treatment. As well as the clinical benefits of avoidance of complications (particularly in younger children), earlier resolution of symptoms, and a reduction in the chance of contagion, nonclinical benefits such as an earlier return to school (and less loss of curriculum) and less disrupted work life for parents should be taken into account.<xref rid="b19-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A survey of 326 parents of children estimated that 54.2% of children missed 1.9 days of school and 28.6% of parents missed a mean of 1.5 days of work during a bout of infective conjunctivitis.<xref rid="b15-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Despite the significant literature on topical antibiotic use in infective conjunctivitis, until relatively recently, there have been few studies on the use of topical ocular antibiotics in children,<xref rid="b21-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> particularly newborns and infants who are at particular risk of bacterial conjunctivitis and who can suffer the most serious complications such as ophthalmia neonatorum. The current study recruited patients from hospitals rather than from general practice; since bacterial conjunctivitis in older children is generally managed in a community setting, this study included a significant population of newborns and infants. Because the study included a large population of these younger children (a population frequently underrepresented in similar clinical studies), the results in this group of patients are particularly noteworthy. Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and purulent discharge were lower in azithromycin- than in tobramycin-treated patients at both day 3 (by 14% for bulbar hyperemia and 20% purulent discharge respectively) and day 7 (by 20% for bulbar hyperemia and 18% for purulent discharge respectively); such differences are likely to be of clinical significance.</p><p>Convenience of use is a factor in promoting persistence and compliance, both of which are important when antibiotics are used to combat infection. Convenience is likely to be even more important in pediatric preparations, where the patient may not understand the significance of the medication. Like the tobramycin eyedrops used in the present study, most antibacterial ophthalmic solutions require instillation up to 8 times each day for 7&#x02013;10 days.<xref rid="b2-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Such a frequency and duration of application inevitably interfere with daily family life and raise significant barriers to good compliance, increasing the burden of illness for the patient and the family as a whole. The more benign dosage regimen of azithromycin 1.5% (a total of 6 instillations, compared with 36 for tobramycin) is more convenient for use in children. This is particularly the case for babies and infants in whom the instillation can be stressful for both child and parent. A twice-daily dosing regimen (on rising and at bedtime, for example) is likely to fit in with daily family life more easily than more frequent administrations.</p><p>Clinical evidence supports the contention that shorter and less frequent courses of antibiotic eyedrops are to be preferred from the compliance standpoint; compliance and satisfaction have been reported to be improved in twice daily versus four times eyedrop regimens in children,<xref rid="b17-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and in younger children (aged 2&#x02013;9 years), compliance was significantly better with a twice daily fusidic acid regimen than with a 4&#x02013;6 times daily tobramycin regimen. This is confirmed by studies in other ocular diseases where compliance falls as the number of instillations required increases, with midday instillations being the ones most likely to be omitted,<xref rid="b23-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and by studies in children receiving treatment for nonocular infective illnesses.<xref rid="b25-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A positive feature of the present study is the incorporation of a relatively large proportion, indeed a majority, of younger (less than 2 years of age) patients in whom the clinical results and questionnaire responses were not worse than in the patient population as a whole.</p><p>Inadequate compliance with a full course of antibiotic therapy is a well-known cause of antibiotic resistance, prolongs illness, and results in unnecessary costs; the longer and more onerous the course of treatment, the greater the probability of noncompliance and the associated risk of microbial resistance.<xref rid="b26-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In addition, it is generally well recognized that adherence is better in the early phase of treatment, perhaps because the patient is more aware of their condition; more complex treatment schedules also contribute to imperfect compliance.<xref rid="b28-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> As symptoms begin to resolve and patients return to their normal daily activities, their focus on regular use of the drops is likely to diminish, particularly if the duration of treatment is long.<xref rid="b23-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Thus, the less frequent and shorter treatment schedule for azithromycin permitted by its pharmacokinetic properties<xref rid="b11-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b29-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> may contribute to improved adherence and diminished microbial resistance.</p><p>The additional results presented here provide an interesting supplement to those in the initial report,<xref rid="b12-opth-9-725" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> particularly since data regarding the burden of management of purulent conjunctivitis remain very limited. However, a limitation of the study is evident in the relatively low rate of return of questionnaires, which may introduce an element of bias into these results.</p><p>In conclusion, the azithromycin formulation used in the present study produced a rapid resolution of clinical signs and symptoms in children with bacterial conjunctivitis. The twice-daily for 3 days regimen was convenient and easy to use and, in particular, fitted in with normal daily life. Such enhanced ease of use and convenience may serve to improve compliance and limit bacterial resistance by encouraging more complete treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>John Stolz provided editorial support in the preparation of the manuscript.
