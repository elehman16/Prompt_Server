As the proportion of older adults continues to grow, the coming decade will see a significant increase in the number of individuals living with impaired cognition. Trends in health care delivery suggest that, in the future, many older adults will obtain a majority of their health care from general practitioners and will not be referred to dementia specialists. However, identifying cognitive impairment (CI) in the primary care (PC) setting remains challenging <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Although it has been suggested that best practice care for older adults should include screening for cognitive disorders to facilitate early detection and treatment <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend universal screening in PC, citing performance characteristics of screening instruments and limited evidence of effectiveness <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nevertheless, beginning in January 2011, in compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began covering the costs of an annual wellness visit, which calls for detection of CI by providers conducting the annual wellness visit <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>A number of studies have investigated screening for dementia in PC <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> but fewer have examined the impact of screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on older adults <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. With the current emphasis on earlier diagnosis of CI, the goal of this study was to determine whether identifying MCI in older PC patients, without a dementia diagnosis, would result in a change in physician practice or slow cognitive decline. Community-based PC practices were randomized to either treatment as usual (TAU) or cognitive report (CR) arms. We hypothesized that PC physicians (PCPs) in the CR group, who received CRs based on neuropsychological testing, would perform dementia screening tests, refer patients to specialists for diagnostic assessment, and prescribe anticholinesterase inhibitors more frequently than PCPs in the TAU group. We also hypothesized that patients of physicians in the CR group would have a slower rate of progression of cognitive deficits over 2 years than cognitively impaired patients in the TAU group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="intref0015">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: PCP-AG023129). We based the hypothesis on the rationale that patients with reversible CI would have improved cognition due to its spontaneous resolution or treatment of the underlying cause. If other causes of impairment were ruled out and the impairment was thought to be due to impending Alzheimer's disease (AD), the decline could be slowed if the physician prescribed cognitive-enhancing medications <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p>This study was a 24-month, cluster-randomized trial with two parallel groups. The unit of randomization was PCP practice and not individual PCPs nor patients given that our primary outcome was physician-initiated interventions and that within practices, physicians frequently are called on to cover each other's patients and may exhibit similar practice patterns <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. If randomization occurred at the PCP level, a given PCP could be called on to treat a patient from the other arm, leading to possible contamination between groups. Additionally, patients who share PCPs may share information about cognitive testing and subjective complaints that could lead to dilution of treatment effects <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Practices were recruited from October 2005 to January 2006; patients were recruited from January 2006 to January 2008. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all physician and patient participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Setting, participants, and randomization</title><p>We stratified 12 PC practices from southwestern Pennsylvania by geographic location (urban, suburban, and rural). Two of the 12 were classified as urban, and to ensure balance, they were randomly assigned to intervention or control with equal probability in a block size of two. Eight of the 12 were classified as suburban, and these sites were stratified by the number of physicians participating in the study. The eight suburban sites were also randomly assigned to intervention or control with equal probability in a block size of four. Two sites were classified as rural were randomly assigned to intervention or control with equal probability in a block size of two. Of the 12 practices, six were randomly assigned to the CR group and received the results of the patients' baseline and 24-month assessments. The remaining six practices were assigned to the TAU group and did not receive baseline CRs. After randomization, but before patient recruitment, one suburban practice (with one physician) dropped out because of perceived study burden, leaving five TAU practices in the study.</p><p>Patients were first approached by physicians who were instructed to refer all patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years without a dementia diagnosis to the study coordinator. Patients with a diagnosis of dementia on their medical record, or with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> scores of 18 or below, which indicates the presence of unrecognized dementia, were excluded from this study. However, patients with complaints of memory loss who did not have a diagnosis of dementia were not excluded. A total of 731 patients were referred. Among those, 183 (25%) declined participation or were ineligible (e.g., &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years old, had a notation of&#x000a0;&#x0201c;dementia or Alzheimer's disease&#x0201d; somewhere within the medical record, died before enrollment; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Comparisons between patients who did and did not participate demonstrated no significant differences regarding PC office,&#x000a0;physician, geographic location, or group assignment. A total of 548 patients completed the baseline assessment; 15 (2.7%) were subsequently excluded because they did not meet study entry criteria (e.g., MMSE &#x0003c;18, dementia diagnosis, or the referring physician was not a participating PCP). The final sample included 533 patients (TAU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;204, 38.3%; CR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;329, 61.7%).</p><p>Of the initial 533 enrolled participants, 423 (79.4%) returned for the 2-year assessment (TAU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;169, 82.8%; CR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;254, 77.2%).

The study nurses extracted data using a structured chart abstraction tool over four periods: (1) 12-months before baseline; (2) baseline to 12-months after baseline; (3) 13&#x02013;24&#x000a0;months; and (4) 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;months. Data extracted from the medical record included clinical and utilization outcomes, including the medical problem list, family history of dementia, number of falls, PCP visits and phone calls, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, number of medications, number of new medical problems, and newly initiated advance directives. For all data collection time points after baseline, physician-initiated outcomes were recorded from the medical record. For the purposes of this analysis, the following outcomes were designated as physician-initiated interventions: discussions about memory or cognitive problems or dementia; administration of cognitive or functional assessments; referrals to dementia specialists; brain imaging; blood work to rule out reversible causes; referrals to social services; prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications; notations of memory or functional impairments from patient, family, or PCP; contact or discussion with family member; concern of deviation from medical instructions or noncompliance with medications; concern of unsafe driving; presence of advanced directive; and note of any formal or informal cognitive or functional assessments.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Adjudication procedure</title><p>Participants were first classified as having cognition within normal, MCI, or dementia ranges using the following criteria from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>: (1) dementia, scores &#x02265;2 standard deviations (SDs) below age norms on two cognitive domains, one of which must be memory; (2) MCI, at least two scores 1&#x02013;2 SDs below age norms; (3) and normal, individuals not meeting either (1) or (2).

Adjusted models included age and number of medical problems as covariates. To test whether improvement in cognitive status was associated with receiving a CR, we used a generalized estimating equation <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> model with a random intercept to adjust for the clustering of patients with physicians and for the clustering of physicians within practices.

Although there were statistically significant differences between study groups in the proportion of physician-initiated interventions, the actual number of medical interventions was surprisingly small. After receipt of the CR, physicians ordered blood tests as part of a dementia work-up for 17 of the 92 CR participants who were reported as having CI. We found such a low rate surprising given that AAN guidelines recommend screening for reversible causes of CI and CR physicians documented that they were aware of the CI in 30 (32.6%) cases by noting &#x0201c;memory problems&#x0201d; in the medical records (compared with 21% of TAU cases).</p><p>Several studies have suggested that impaired cognition in PC patients is under-recognized <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and poor recognition has been attributed to a number of factors, including the difficulty of identifying subtle cognitive symptoms or changes overtime, the length of time and perceived complexity of a dementia evaluation, and the lack of physician confidence in making cognitive diagnoses <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, experts conducted the cognitive assessments without any time burden for the PCP or staff; yet, few PCPs took action when a CR indicated possible MCI or dementia. We considered a number of reasons that may explain this. We looked first to see if physicians had conducted their own cognitive assessment from which they determined that the evidence of CI was not substantiated. However, our data showed that most physicians did not conduct, or at least did not document, cognitive assessments or cognitive screening in the record. Physicians may have decided to take a &#x0201c;watchful waiting&#x0201d; approach, perhaps, as a general treatment strategy, but perhaps also because physicians knew the patients would undergo retesting, and they may have considered the CR to be an expert consultation, making additional referral unnecessary. Additionally, the possibility exists that physicians interpreted the CR as indicating the presence of early AD and considered further investigation unnecessary, believing that potentially treatable causes of CI had been ruled out and that progressive decline is inevitable. Finally, physicians may have been reluctant to conduct further work-up regarding cognitive deficits if the patient did not make subjective complaints, suggesting that physicians may wish to see evidence of more significant decline. Support for this possibility comes from our finding that physicians were more likely to intervene when MMSE scores were lower. Many dementia experts believe that identification at the very earliest stage of impairment has the greatest impact, especially in identifying those whose cognitive deficits put them at risk for medication mismanagement that may lead to increased emergency department and PCP visits and greater utilization of services that may be unnecessary, unwanted, or even harmful.</p><p>In addition to the CR, a letter was sent to each patient recommending that they discuss the results with their physician. It is not possible from our data to determine how much of the physicians' treatment response was driven directly by the CR or by a discussion initiated by the patient. We note that physicians documented general discussions about cognition and memory with 43.5% of CR patients as compared with 21.1% of TAU patients.</p><p>A follow-up period of 2 years is relatively short given the long prodromal stage of AD and, thus, it is possible that we may have seen an effect in the rate of cognitive decline between the groups with longer follow-up. Although we controlled for receipt of a CR, we did not control the PCP's response to receiving the CR and the clinical determination of whether to initiate an intervention. We found that PCPs were more likely to order interventions for older, more cognitively impaired patients with the greatest number of medical problems; therefore, it is possible that these individuals may be less likely to benefit from an intervention than younger, healthier patients.</p><p>Our findings cannot be used to infer prevalence of MCI in PC settings as this was not an epidemiologic study. Moreover, although the protocol instructed physicians to refer all patients, they may have referred only patients for whom they had concerns, thus over-representing MCI in this sample.</p><p>This study has a number of strengths as compared with previous studies of cognitive assessments in PC patients. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only study to use a cluster-randomized controlled design in which study physicians in one group were randomized to receive the results of a neuropsychological assessment of their patients, and physicians in the practices randomized to TAU did not. Second, primary measures were collected over a 24-month period, which allowed us to compare multiple PCP-patient interactions. Third, the assessment included a comprehensive cognitive evaluation, rather than a brief screening measure, resulting in more confidence in the diagnosis of MCI and dementia.</p><p>At the same time, this study also had limitations. First, an overwhelming majority of patient participants identified themselves as white. Second, the method of recruitment through physician referral could have led to an increase in the number of patients for whom the physician already had concerns about cognitive abilities. The small number of physician practices is also of concern in that there may be confounding factors not controlled by randomization that could have influenced our findings. Finally, 25% of individuals referred by their physicians were not eligible or declined to participate. However, no definitive conclusions can be made regarding potential bias as data were not collected for subjects who did not participate.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we found that physicians who received CRs were more likely to order diagnostic tests and discuss memory problems with patients, and patients were more likely to be taking either a prescription or OTC cognitive-enhancing medication at follow-up. These findings are relevant to the current controversy regarding cognitive screening in PC in that we have demonstrated that having available cognitive information will change physician behavior. Although the physician response was modest, it is possible a more significant response will be seen once a more effective treatment becomes available and once the Medicare annual wellness visit is more widely adopted, and more potential cases of CI are detected<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: It has been suggested that optimal care for older adults should include screening for cognitive disorders to facilitate early detection and treatment.
