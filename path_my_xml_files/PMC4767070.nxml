This study was conducted after approval of Scientific and Ethical Committee of Anesthesiology Department in Kasr El Aini Hospital, Cairo University. A written informed consent was taken from each patient in this trial. 200 patients of (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status I-II patients of both sexes aged 20&#x02013;60 years scheduled for therapeutic or diagnostic colonoscopy under ketofol sedation were included in this study. Patients with allergy to study drugs, cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled hypertension, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease), and decompensated hepatic or renal failure, glaucoma, and prostatic patients were excluded.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned into one of four groups 50 patients in each group. The allocation sequence was done using a randomized computer-generated sequence done by an investigator not involved in the clinical management or data collection.</p><p>Preprocedural evaluation included history taking, physical examination, and laboratory investigations (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, and coagulation profile).</p><p>Before sedation, the study drugs were prepared as follow: Ketamine and propofol mixture (ketofol) is 5 mg/mL ketamine (ketamine 50mg/ml Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Egypt) and 5 mg/mL propofol (diprivan, 10% astrazeneca), 1:1 mixture. Hyoscine N-butylbromide 20 mg/ml (Buscupan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 20 mg/ml Boehringer Inglheim), 10 min before sedation hyoscine given very slowly either 5 mg (group A), 10 mg (group B), 20 mg (group C) and saline (group D). All the syringes were prepared and diluted in 20 ml syringe by an investigator who did not share in the assessment or the anesthesia, while another anesthetist or technician, who was blinded to syringes, documented all patients' parameters including salivation (double blinded to patient and follow-up investigator).</p><p>Baseline heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored and recorded, oxygen mask was applied then ketofol was titrated very slowly to reach Ramsey Sedation Score 4 or 5 and the patients were observed visually for increased salivation using Thomas-Stonell and Greenberg classification which consists of a 5-point scale for severity: 1 - dry, 2 - mild (wet lips), 3 - moderate (wet lips and chin), 4 - severe (clothing damp), and 5 - profuse (clothing, hands, and objects).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min after sedation were recorded.</p><p>Surgical condition will be recorded by asking the surgeon to identify either good relaxation or bad conditions (either happy or not happy).</p><p>The sample size was calculated by setting &#x003b1; error of 0.05 and power of 0.8, calculation produced a minimal sample size of 45 patients in each arm.</p><p>Data were coded and entered using the statistical package IBM Corp.

Data were summarized using mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Comparisons between quantitative variables were done using ANOVA with the post-hoc test. Comparisons between the values measured at baseline, after 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 60 min in each group were done using repeated measure ANOVA (general linear model). For comparing categorical data, Chi-square (c<sup>2</sup>) test was performed.
