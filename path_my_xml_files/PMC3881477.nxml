velocity and electromechanical reaction times (EMG-RT) of the teres major of young amateur
baseball players after neuromuscular joint facilitation (NJF) treatment. [Subjects] The
subjects were 18 healthy males who were divided into two groups: a NJF group and a control
group. The NJF group consisted of 10 subjects, and the control group consisted of 8
subjects. [Methods] Participants in the NJF group received NJF treatment. The baseball
pitching velocity, the EMG-RT, the premotor time (PMT), and the motor time (MT) during
shoulder internal rotation movement were measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise.
[Results] There were no significant differences among the results of the control group. In
the NJF group, there were significant differences in baseball pitching velocity, EMG-RT
and MT after NJF treatment. [Conclusion] NJF intervention shortens not only EMG-RT but
also MT, which implies that NJF is effective for motor processes. Since the baseball
pitching velocity increased, NJF may be recommended for the improvement of the performance
of baseball players.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Neuromuscular joint facilitation</kwd><kwd>Baseball pitching velocity</kwd><kwd>Motor time</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neuromuscular Joint Facilitation (NJF) is a new therapeutic exercise based on kinesiology.
It integrates the facilitation element of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and the
joint composition movement, aiming to improve the movement of the joint through passive
exercise, active exercise and resistance exercise<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is used to increase strength, flexibility and ROM, and shorten
the electromechanical reaction time (EMG-RT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The EMG-RT is an index of the shrinkage characteristic of the muscle. The EMG-RT is
composed of the premotor time (PMT) and the motor time (MT). The PMT is defined as the
interval between the stimulation signal and the onset of voluntary electromyographic (EMG)
activity of a response agonist. The MT is defined as the interval between the onsets of
voluntary EMG activity to the mechanical response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The PMT reflects the movement position, the movement pattern, the
movement programming, and the state of consciousness, the level of alertness, and the time
of the central process. The MT chiefly reflects factors at the periphery level, including
muscle contraction, series elasticity, and difficulties in loosening of connective tissue
and the joint capsule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to a biomechanical analysis, an increase in the time maximizing shoulder
horizontal adduction and a decrease in the time maximizing shoulder internal rotation are
significantly related to increased ball velocity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of baseball pitching velocity and
electromechanical reaction times of the teres major of the young amateur baseball players

before the start of the study using out a medical history questionnaire. The questionnaire
addressed whether subjects had a history of cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, somatosensory,
or neurological disorders. If so, they were excluded from the study. All subjects gave their
informed consent to participation in the study. All experimental procedures in this study
were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Jilin Dianli hospital.</p><p>To measure the baseball pitching velocity, a pitch distance of 18.44&#x02005;m between the
batteries was used as stipulated in the official baseball rules. The velocity of five balls,
pitched into the strike zone as quickly as possible were measured, and the average value was
used in the analysis. The pitching velocity was measured with used a sports radar gun,
SR3600 (Dainatecc).</p><p>We measured the EMG-RT of the teres major, the PMT of the teres major, and the MT of the
teres major in response to an auditory stimulus. The EMG-RT was measured with a digital
storage oscilloscope DCS-7040 (Kenwood). After cleaning the skin with alcohol and abrasion
paste, Ag/AgCl disposable electrodes (Vitrode F, Nihonn Kohden) were placed over the muscle
bellies of the teres major, with a 2-cm inter-electrode distance. The on-off signal was
generated by the contact of an electrode attached to the dorsum manus with an aluminum
board. At the onset of voluntary shoulder internal rotation, the electrode lost contact with
the aluminum board, generating the off signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

position of 90&#x000b0; of shoulder flexion and 90&#x000b0; of elbow flexion. The subjects were given an
oral warning of &#x0201c;Set&#x0201d;, 2 to 3 seconds before the stimulus auditory signal (2,500&#x02005;Hz, 50&#x02005;ms).
The subjects were required to respond to the auditory cues by performing shoulder internal
rotation as quickly as possible.</p><p>The EMG waveform and the on-off signal of the foot switch were synchronized on the display
of the oscilloscope. The latency time between the onset of voluntary EMG activity and the
stimulus auditory signal (PMT), and the latency time between the onset of voluntary EMG
activity and the off signal (MT) were measured by setting the image on the display to a
standstill each time and moving the cursor. Prior to the experiment, the subjects were
informed about what would be done in the experiment and made several practice trials to
accustom themselves to it. The reaction time was measured repeatedly five times at each
scheduled measurement.</p><p>The EMG-RT, the premotor time (PMT) and the motor time (MT) during shoulder internal
rotation movement, and the baseball pitching velocity were measured before the intervention,
and after 8 weeks of the intervention.</p><p>Four shoulder patterns of NJF were used. The patterns were shoulder
extension-adduction-internal rotation, shoulder flexion-abduction-external rotation,
shoulder extension-abduction-internal rotation, and shoulder flexion-adduction-external
rotation pattern. Each pattern was performed three times at random as a passive exercise and
as a resistance exercise, respectively. The subjects in the NJF group received the
intervention three times a week for 8 weeks. The intervention was performed by the same
physical therapist to avoid individual variations in therapy. For the control group, the
intervention was not performed.</p><p>To determine whether there were differences between the NJF group and the control group,
the independent t-test was performed on subject characteristics. Two-way ANOVA and multiple
comparisons (Bonferroni test) were used to test for statistically significant differences,
and the factors were intervention and group. If a significant interaction was found, the
paired t-test was performed to compare before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed
using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of statistical significance was chosen as
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the subject characteristics of the NJF group

EMG-RT. The subjects of the NJF group showed not only shortened EMG-RT, but also shortened
MT in the teres major. MT was shortened after the intervention, suggesting that the
contractile characteristic of the muscle was changed by the NJF intervention. MT is
influenced by the muscle tone before a movement appears<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the shortening of MT has been suggested to be the result of an
increase in muscular tension induced by changes in the mechanical properties of the muscle
tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>NJF uses a diagonal spiral pattern, which is similar to the pitching movement. Moreover, as
the EMG-RT shortened, the internal rotation speed of the shoulder joint improved in the
pitching motion, and the pitching velocity was increased. Therefore NJF may be recommended
for improvement of the performance of baseball players.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Huo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>: Neuromuscular Joint Facilitation.
