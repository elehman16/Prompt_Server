Biochemical remission of T2DM has been demonstrated with weight loss around 15kg following bariatric surgery and in several small studies of non-surgical energy-restriction treatments. The non-surgical Counterweight-Plus programme, running in Primary Care where obesity and T2DM are routinely managed, produces &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;kg weight loss in 33&#x000a0;% of all enrolled patients. The Diabetes UK-funded Counterpoint study suggested that this should be sufficient to reverse T2DM by removing ectopic fat in liver and pancreas, restoring first-phase insulin secretion.</p><p>The Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) was designed to determine whether a structured, intensive, weight management programme, delivered in a routine Primary Care setting, is a viable treatment for achieving durable normoglycaemia. Other aims are to understand the mechanistic basis of remission and to identify psychological predictors of response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Cluster-randomised design with GP practice as the unit of randomisation: 280 participants from around 30 practices in Scotland and England will be allocated <italic>either</italic> to continue usual guideline-based care or to add the Counterweight-Plus weight management programme, which includes primary care nurse or dietitian delivery of 12-20weeks low calorie diet replacement, food reintroduction, and long-term weight loss maintenance. Main inclusion criteria: men and women aged 20-65years, all ethnicities, T2DM 0-6years duration, BMI 27-45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Tyneside participants will undergo Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies of pancreatic and hepatic fat, and metabolic studies to determine mechanisms underlying T2DM remission. Co-primary endpoints: weight reduction&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;kg and HbA1c &#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol at one year. Further follow-up at 2&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will establish whether a structured weight management programme, delivered in Primary Care by practice nurses or dietitians, is a viable treatment to achieve T2DM remission.

Whilst it seldom develops with BMI &#x0003c;21&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, most people with T2DM have a BMI &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and around 50&#x000a0;% have a BMI &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. With BMI &#x0003e;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 20&#x000a0;% of all men and 11&#x000a0;% of women have known diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>There is consistent evidence that modest sustained weight loss, using a variety of diet and lifestyle approaches to achieve 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% weight loss, will prevent the onset of most new cases of T2DM in those with pre-diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]<sup>,</sup>, and that it improves <italic>all</italic> aspects of diabetes control (glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids and microvascular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with reductions in drug doses<sup>,</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Advice to lose and maintain 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% weight loss, by diet and exercise is included in most clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, most T2DM patients in the UK are now managed in primary care, many do not receive the necessary specialist lifestyle advice and support, from trained staff, to achieve 5&#x000a0;% weight loss. Financial incentives are provided only for diagnosis and for prescribing anti-diabetic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recognising changes in obesity prevalence, and also recent evidence for the benefits of more aggressive interventions including surgery, the 2010 SIGN Obesity guideline set a new weight loss/ maintenance target of &#x0003e;15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% for those with BMI &#x0003e;35&#x000a0;kg/m, or &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with serious medical complications such as T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This degree of weight loss most reliably led to diabetes remission in a randomised trial of bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and several studies have suggested that similar weight loss is necessary to normalize blood glucose and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is also indirect evidence that such weight loss might normalise life expectancy in those with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, routine NHS diabetes care seldom aims for weight loss of &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;kg (commonly equivalent on average to &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;%: most studies have average weight close to 100&#x000a0;kg in obese individuals with T2DM) and vanishingly few obese people with T2DM achieve this goal.</p><p>Bariatric surgery can reverse the metabolic abnormalities of T2DM, at least in patients up to 6&#x000a0;years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the proportion of individuals achieving normal blood glucose is determined primarily, by the extent of weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However the Counterpoint study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] demonstrated that a broadly similar benefit can be reproduced by negative energy balance alone. Eleven people with T2DM (nine male and two female, BMI 33.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;kg/m2) were studied before and after 1, 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks of a 2.5&#x000a0;MJ (600&#x000a0;kcal)/day liquid diet. Results showed a mean weight loss of 15.3&#x000a0;kg and a rapid return of fasting blood glucose to normal, which persisted for up to 3&#x000a0;months after return to normal diet. The underlying changes in liver and pancreas fat were consistent with the Twin Cycle Hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Publication of the Counterpoint study, demonstrating remission of T2DM and normalization of first-phase insulin response following weight loss of about 15&#x000a0;kg, prompted a massive response from people with T2DM who wanted to try to reverse their disease by weight loss. Evaluation of 77 reported experiences of self-directed weight loss indicated diabetes remission in 61&#x000a0;% overall: 80&#x000a0;% with &#x0003e;20&#x000a0;kg weight loss; 63&#x000a0;% with 10-20&#x000a0;kg weight loss; and 53&#x000a0;% with &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;kg weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These data, while self-reported and from self-selected motivated patients, indicate both a desire amongst those with T2DM to reverse their diagnosis, and that well-maintained weight loss leading to sustained remission of T2DM is achievable in a community setting.</p><p>The feasibility of a non-surgical approach for weight management has been demonstrated within routine NHS primary care. That feasibility study, mainly in non-diabetic patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;91, mean BMI &#x0003e;48&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2)</sup> found that an 810&#x000a0;kcal/d Total Diet Replacement (TDR), followed by structured food reintroduction and then a long-term weight-maintenance programme, was acceptable to both staff and patients. This programme resulted in a mean loss of about 17&#x000a0;kg in 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. At 12&#x000a0;months, at least 30 (33&#x000a0;%) of the 91 enrolled patients remained &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;kg lighter than at baseline. These observations indicate that it is possible to achieve, and maintain, substantial weight loss for many individuals by non-surgical methods. A recent systematic review of controlled studies evaluating very low energy diets (800&#x000a0;kcal/d), in individuals diagnosed with T2DM, found that these interventions led to greater weight losses at 3&#x02013;6 months than minimal intervention or standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However a longer and larger study is needed to determine whether i) this is a viable treatment for putting T2DM into remission, and ii) this approach is potentially transferable to a larger scale as part of routine GP care. The latter is particularly important because most overweight people with T2DM in the UK are managed in primary care rather than in specialist hospital clinics.</p><p>It is also important to extend our understanding of the mechanisms, which underlie the development of T2DM in susceptible individuals, and those responsible for achieving and maintaining remission. Over an eight-week study period, the Counterpoint study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed a return to near-normal first-phase insulin secretion, concurrent with a loss of abnormal ectopic fat accumulation in liver and pancreas. The subsequent Counterbalance study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that this dramatic reversal of T2DM occurs most reliably in patients with diabetes duration under 6&#x000a0;years since diagnosis. There is always some uncertainty about the duration of a diabetic state prior to diagnosis, but with known duration over 8&#x000a0;years since diagnosis, remission was much less likely.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title><bold>Study Objectives:</bold> (as set out in application &#x00026; Ethics submission)</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To determine whether a programme designed to achieve remission of T2DM to normal glucose tolerance by substantial weight loss can be effectively delivered, within the routine Primary Care setting where T2DM is normally managed</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate potential prospective metabolic and psychological markers for a good response to the proposed treatment programme</p></list-item><list-item><p>To define the mechanisms of long-term remission of diabetes, in particular examining the relationships of VLDL-triglyceride production rates to both pancreas fat content and beta cell function.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate the barriers to successful reversal of T2DM at both the individual and service level</p></list-item></list></p><p>Data will be collected for possible future health economics analyses</p><p><bold>Co-primary endpoints</bold>:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reduction in weight of 15&#x000a0;kg (assumed equal on average to 15&#x000a0;%) or more at one year;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Remission of diabetes (HbA1c &#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) at 1&#x000a0;year.</p></list-item></list></p><p><bold>Secondary endpoints</bold>:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Quality of life</p></list-item><list-item><p>Physical Activity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Serum Lipids<italic>,</italic> Liver function tests, Urea &#x00026; Electrolytes, plasma glucose</p></list-item><list-item><p>Programme acceptability</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study will use a cluster-randomised controlled design, with GP practice the unit of randomisation.

This is a particularly serious problem for younger people with more extreme levels of obesity with potentially many years of future hyperglycaemia and other weight-related features of Metabolic Syndrome. In the past, T2DM was commonly referred to as &#x02018;mild diabetes&#x02019;. It is now recognised as a devastating progressive disease, which causes accelerated aging macrovascular complications affecting heart, legs and brain, plus microvascular damage to eyes, kidneys and nervous system. These sequelae have lessened to some extent with modern evidence-based treatments under clinical guidelines. However, T2DM still reduces life-expectancy significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and is now a very major cause of prolonged disability, and a growing burden on healthcare services and on health budgets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] . Remission of T2DM can be achieved by substantial weight loss following either bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or hypocaloric diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While current clinical guidelines recommend bariatric surgery for obese T2DM patients, there is little realistic prospect of this being offered to most people because of surgical and follow-up resource limitations, and personal preference to avoid surgery. The DiRECT study has been designed to establish the feasibility and durability of a primary care-based dietary intervention, which, if effective could be offered routinely as soon as possible after diagnosis of T2DM.</p><p>To assess the efficacy and safety of the DiRECT intervention, and the additional burden to patients and to staff, outcomes will be compared with those from a non-intervention control sample of similar participants with T2DM, using random allocation. Recognising the undoubted value of current clinical evidence-based guidelines, it was considered essential that both groups should continue to be managed under current UK guidelines from NICE and SIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and that any new guidelines, emerging during the course of the trial, should be applied equally to all participants.</p><p>This trial is designed to be as &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; as possible, so that the results can be assessed in the context of conventional chronic disease management, and to allow maximal transferability into routine healthcare. In the UK, most patients with T2DM are now managed in NHS primary care at least in the earlier stages of the disease before serious vascular complications have developed. The setting for DiRECT is therefore routine NHS primary care, with the intervention being delivered by existing staff following training, and then interactive support and on-the-job mentoring being provided by the experienced research team dietitians, until practitioners are confident and competent. This is the same model as evaluated in the UK feasibility study of the Counterweight-Plus weight management programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which is now being offered in some health boards as part of routine NHS primary care.</p><p>A cluster randomised intervention was chosen to avoid contamination, which would be inevitable with randomisation at an individual level within GP practices, and to avoid the conflict which would arise for the dietitian or nurse if asked to offer a radically different intensive management only to randomly selected patients from their practice. The training and mentoring of practice staff delivering the programme was designed to ensure fidelity in programme delivery, necessary when interventions are delivered in more than one centre, but there always remains a possibility that differences will remain between centres. We therefore applied a conservative inter-class correlation of 0.05, which requires a 25&#x000a0;% increase in numbers recruited into the study. In our experience, the ICC (inter-class cluster effect) is likely to be smaller than this. In our Counterweight feasibility study, using the same intervention in 22 General Practices, there was no evidence of a cluster effect. If this applies to the present study, it is likely to be modestly over-powered.</p><p>A key principle behind the methodology of both DiRECT and the earlier Counterweight Plus feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] is the aim to assess the impacts from maximising weight losses and long-term maintenance <italic>for the maximum number of people</italic>. This is subtly different from an evaluation of a specific treatment, such as a drug which is given in fixed dose. Optimising weight control entails complicated behavioural modifications in the context of busy lives and often conflicting personal knowledge and attitudes, within a wide variety of changeable social and domestic situations. It would certainly have been possible to have tested a rigid diet and lifestyle prescription, but an &#x02018;off-the-shelf&#x02019; intervention could result in a very wide range of weight losses between individuals, with resulting wide range of secondary metabolic changes. The Counterweight feasibility study indicated that while about 25&#x000a0;% of patients followed the TDR fully for 12&#x000a0;weeks, the remainder had adhered only partially to the plan. The final outcomes of those patients varied, but many did achieve the intended 15&#x000a0;kg weight loss, and feedback indicated that they valued some flexibility which could accommodate individual circumstances and preferences in order to maximize weight losses. A fixed diet and lifestyle prescription cannot deliver a fixed weight-loss over a fixed time-period in a real-life setting. The decision was therefore taken that the DiRECT study would adopt a protocol which included flexibility (within pre-defined ranges) for the duration of the different phases of the intervention. Thus, it was planned that each participant should aim to lose <italic>at least</italic> 15&#x000a0;kg, (more if possible), but allow some to cease TDR early (if they were finding it difficult) and move on to FR, and others to extend TDR if there has been interruptions to protocol adherence, or they wished to continue longer. Defined windows of flexibility were incorporated into the protocol for each phase of weight-management, including pre-planned relapse-management plans for those whose weights begin to rise, or whose T2DM returned, during the maintenance phase. In a real-life, routine setting, these would be normal and expected components of care.</p><p>The aim of DiRECT is to achieve remission of diabetes, which was hypothesised would follow substantial weight loss, of the order of 15&#x000a0;kg. To achieve this, the duration of the weight loss intervention for DiRECT had to be at least 3&#x000a0;months, followed by a longer period to establish and optimise weight loss maintenance. Most clinical guidelines require evidence over 12-months or longer. The feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] had evaluated the Counterweight-Plus programme at 12&#x000a0;months, but not longer. For this reason, for the power estimations, the co-primary outcome measures were 12-month changes: weight loss &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;kg and HbA1c &#x0003c;48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) analysed as binary outcomes.</p><p>The choice of HbA1c cut-off for the co-primary outcome measure was between 48&#x000a0;mmol/mmol (the diagnostic threshold for T2DM) and 42mmo/mmol (diagnostic threshold for IGT/pre-diabetes). There is existing evidence that weight loss of 5-10&#x000a0;kg (mean 4&#x000a0;kg at 4&#x000a0;years) will prevent the development of T2DM for 58&#x000a0;% of patients with IGT/pre-diabetes, and that ~55&#x000a0;% will revert to a completely normal HbA1c of &#x0003c;42&#x000a0;mmol/mmol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The aim of DiRECT being to achieve remission of established T2DM, it was considered most appropriate to adopt the cut-off 48&#x000a0;mmol/mmol for the primary outcome measure, with 42&#x000a0;mmol/mmol as a secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DiRECT study, whose results will be available from 2018, aims to provide evidence to inform and guide future strategy to enhance the management of T2DM. It evaluates an existing, but not yet recommended, approach for routine weight management. The experimental protocol is patient-centered, and flexible within defined limits, in order to optimize weight loss and maintenance for the maximum number of patients. Its aims are to reverse the diagnosis of T2DM and normalise other associated metabolic features for substantial proportion of participants. With effective long-term weight loss maintenance, this should allow freedom for patients from the limitations which diabetes places on everyday life, occupation, insurance etc. In addition, it might potentially reduce morbidity from diabetic complications, but the present study is not powered for this purpose.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec29"><title>Appendix 1: Protocols for management of blood pressure &#x00026; inadequate glucose control</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Blood pressure</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Background</title><p>Antihypertensive and diuretic drugs will be stopped on the day the total diet replacement is commenced.
