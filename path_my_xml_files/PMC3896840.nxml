This is especially evident with regard to the level of use of evidence-based interventions with school children. Increased used of evidence-based interventions in urban schools would contribute to reducing mental health services disparities in low-income communities. School-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports (SWPBIS) is a service delivery framework that can be used to deliver universal preventive interventions and evidence-based behavioral health treatments, such as group cognitive behavioral therapy. In this article, we describe our ongoing research on creating internal capacity for program implementation. We also examine the cost-effectiveness and resulting school climate when two different levels of external support are provided to personnel as they implement a two-tier SWPBIS program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study follows six K &#x02013; 8 schools in the School District of Philadelphia randomly assigned to consultation support or consultation-plus-coaching support. Participants are: approximately 48 leadership team members, 180 school staff and 3,900 students in Tier 1, and 12 counselors, and 306 child participants in Tier 2. Children who meet inclusion criteria for Tier 2 will participate in group cognitive behavioral therapy for externalizing or anxiety disorders. The study has three phases, baseline/training, implementation, and sustainability. We will measure implementation outcomes, service outcomes, child outcomes, and cost.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings from this study will provide evidence as to the appropriateness of school-wide prevention and treatment service delivery models for addressing services disparities in schools. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses of the two levels of training and consultation should help urban school districts and policymakers with the planning and deployment of cost-effective strategies for the implementation of evidence-based interventions for some of the most common behavioral health problems in school children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01941069">NCT01941069</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Fidelity</kwd><kwd>Mental health services disparities</kwd><kwd>Behavioral health</kwd><kwd>Urban schools</kwd><kwd>School-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>Services disparities</title><p>Several epidemiologic studies have shown that only one in five children with emotional and behavioral disorders receive mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Low-income and ethnically diverse children lag well behind their middle class, Caucasian counterparts in rate of service utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Services are offered in convenient, close to home locations, are often provided at little or no cost to the families, and can be provided while the child is attending school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. School-based services reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and also afford the opportunity to serve children who are at risk for mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As such, schools can play a significant role in addressing mental health services disparities in low-income urban communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Externalizing and anxiety disorders</title><p>Aggressive, defiant, disruptive and antisocial behavior such as the behavior seen in children with, or at risk for, externalizing behavior disorders&#x02014;<italic>i.e.</italic>, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD)&#x02014;have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and are highly prevalent in school settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

The practices and systems of SWPBIS are organized along a three-tiered continuum of prevention with a behavioral theoretical orientation and the empirical foundation of applied behavior analysis (ABA). Primary prevention strategies focus on preventing new cases of problem behaviors by using school-wide (Tier 1, universal) strategies, such as school-wide discipline, classroom behavior management, and effective instructional practices. Emphasis is placed on teaching all students key behavioral expectations and routines and creating a proactive means of communication for students and school staff. Randomized clinical trials have shown that schools employing SWPBIS have demonstrated better school climate (<italic>e.g.</italic>, fewer student disciplinary problems), higher levels of perceived school safety as reported by students and staff, greater reductions in the number of office discipline referrals (ODR), and improved reading scores compared to schools that did not use SWPBIS and/or did not implement SWPBIS with fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Some SWPBIS programs also offer targeted group-based support for at risk children (Tier 2, secondary prevention) and individualized support for more severe cases (Tier 3, tertiary prevention). In the present study, children who exhibit need for more targeted support will be offered participation in group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) interventions for externalizing behavior problems or anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>GCBT for externalizing and anxiety problems</title><p>The Coping Power Program CPP; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], a GCBT intervention, has been found to be effective at reducing aggressive behavior, covert delinquent behavior and substance abuse among aggressive boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Studies using a briefer version of CPP (Anger Coping) also reported significant reductions in aggressive behavior at post-intervention among targeted aggressive boys, compared to untreated aggressive boys and normal controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Another GCBT intervention, Friends for Life FRIENDS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], has been proven to be effective for the prevention and treatment of GAD, SAD, and SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. For example, in a randomized trial with children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, 76% of children assigned to FRIENDS were diagnosis free at the end of the 10-week trial compared to 6% of children assigned to a wait-list condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Use of school personnel for implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs)</title><p>A number of recent studies have shown that school personnel can be successfully trained in the development and implementation of SWPBIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and GCBT for externalizing and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], respectively. Also, SWPBIS has been successfully implemented in a number of inner city schools around the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Unfortunately, school personnel and school counselors often lack adequate training in the implementation of SWPBIS and other EBIs. In addition, schools in urban settings often do not have adequate funding to contract mental health professionals to provide child services. The present study directly addresses these important barriers by enhancing school capacity to deploy EBIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Theoretical framework</title><p>We developed and pilot-tested the program in two K&#x02013;8 schools that have the same ethnic and socio-economic breakdown as the schools participating in this study. The project was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; RFA-CD-08-001; <italic>Elimination of health disparities through translation research; R18</italic>). The adaptation and testing of the interventions used in the study were organized around the first three steps of the Public Health Model (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Defining the problem; Identifying causes/risk factors; Developing and testing the intervention) See, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>] (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Specifically, we collected needs assessment data, assessed symptom profile and mental health service utilization of typical students in the participating schools, investigated risk and protective factors, conducted a review of EBIs for ethnically-diverse children, selected and adapted interventions based on the characteristics of the student population and specific constraints of under-resourced schools, and pilot-tested SWPBIS and EBIs for externalizing behavior problems and anxiety (Eiradi et. al., Development and implementation of a SWPBIS program with mental health supports in urban schools, submitted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. The present study will extend this work by addressing the fourth step (Implementing the intervention/measuring effectiveness) of the Public Health Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>].

Progress toward the completion of each step in the SWPBIS Team Training Manual will be assessed monthly via the Team Implementation Checklist (TIC) and PBIS Action Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>] completed by members of the LT and reviewed by the Tier 1 Coach. In addition, the Tier 1 Coaches will be available to the head of the LT for scheduled one-on-one performance feedback and as needed one-on-one consultation (via telephone or email) about implementation barriers (Individualized Problem Solving). The Tier 1C Coaches will supply the LT an online guide containing steps for the development and implementation of universal interventions. Also, the Tier 1C Coaches will have one-hour biweekly monthly phone conferences with the head of the LT in which progress in completing the steps needed for the development and implementation of interventions as measured via the TIC and PBIS Action Plan will be discussed.</p><p>After the initial training related to Tier 2 interventions, which will be the same for C and C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C counselors, the Tier 2C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C Coaches will conduct 14, two-hour weekly on-site consultation sessions with counselors to debrief previous CPP and FRIENDS sessions, observe child group sessions, prepare for upcoming sessions, and conduct problem solving concerning barriers and challenges in the implementation of the protocols. Counselors will receive video-recorded samples of effective implementation of the main components of the treatments (<italic>e.g.</italic>, exposure for anxiety). Tier 2C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C Coaches will also provide individual performance feedback to the counselors after the session is over and will be available to counselors as needed (via telephone or email) for one-on-one consultation about implementation barriers (Individualized Problem Solving). Tier 2C Coaches will conduct two-hour weekly consultation sessions using the same group content and format and they will provide counselors video-recorded samples of effective implementation of the main components of the treatments. However, they will not observe group sessions or offer individualized feedback or individualized support to counselors.</p></sec><sec><title>School recruitment</title><p>Upon receiving funding, a presentation of the project was conducted with a preselected group of school administrators from schools in the regional area of interest. Presentations were conducted in person and via GoToMeeting. Those who expressed interest in taking part in the project were asked to respond to a brief request for proposals (RFP). The six schools that applied met the minimal inclusion criteria, so the search was discontinued at this stage. The inclusion criteria included: grade level (any elementary or middle school combination); students&#x02019; socio-economic status (percentage of students eligible for free/subsided lunch set at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90%); racial/ethnic diversity (majority of students are of minority status); and school-wide initiatives (absence of current mental health prevention initiatives). A more in-depth description of the project was provided during staff meetings and a vote was taken. At least 80% of school staff in attendance was required to vote affirmatively in order for the school to join the project. This is a standard cut-off in SWPBIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Subsequently, the investigators trained members of the leadership teams.

The focus of primary prevention strategies will be to prevent new cases of mild externalizing or anxiety problem behaviors by using school-wide (universal) strategies. A key intervention will be the development of a leadership team. The primary responsibility of the leadership team will be to develop, implement and formatively evaluate Tier 1 interventions. In the process, a set of school-wide expectations will be developed, explicitly taught to all students and promoted through the implementation of a school-wide motivation system. Specific rules and positive and negative consequences for student behavior in hallways, cafeteria, and playgrounds will be developed, taught to students, and implemented and monitored by school personnel. We expect that Tier 1 interventions will lead to improved school climate and perceived school safety. Improved school climate and perceived school safety will likely contribute to a decrease in the number of children who develop externalizing behavior problems, and also, anxiety problems. We will have two tiers in the proposed study: Tier 1 for universal interventions and Tier 2 for children who meet diagnostic criteria or are at risk for an externalizing or an anxiety disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary prevention (at-risk/high risk students)</title><p>The Coping Power Program (CPP) is a cognitive-behavioral, multi-component group intervention for elementary and middle school students at risk for externalizing behavior disorders. In addition to anger management, the CPP includes units on goal setting, emotional awareness, relaxation training, social skills training, problem solving, and handling peer pressure. The original CPP offers eight sessions for the first year of intervention and 25 sessions for the second year of intervention. We adapted the protocol based on qualitative (focus groups) and quantitative (acceptability) data from parents, children and teachers. We reduced CPP from the original 34-session program to a 14-session format to make it possible for counselors in busy under-resourced urban schools to run groups with CPP. Care was taken to maintain the key components (active ingredients) of the treatment, even though less time was dedicated to covering each Section. A previous shorter version of CPP (Anger Coping Program) has been found to be very effective with a group of aggressive boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>].</p><p>Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is a group CBT intervention, based on a theoretical model, which addresses cognitive, physiological and behavioral processes that are seen to interact in the development and perpetuation of excessive anxiety. The original FRIENDS protocol consists of 10 (60-minute) weekly sessions and two booster sessions. In the present study, we have included the booster sessions in the regular protocol and added two more sessions in order to fit them into the typical class period (40&#x000a0;minutes), for a total of 14 sessions. The protocol has a parent component, which consists of two group sessions that focus on strategies to help parents cope with their own anxiety, reinforcement strategies and contingency management for children, and brief training in problem solving and communication skills.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analytic plan</title><p>The statistical analyses for each of the study aims are described below: in addressing aim one, mean fidelity and its 95% confidence intervals for Tier 1 will be calculated using 20 randomly selected participants from each of the six schools during years three, four, and five (120 total per year). The 95% confidence intervals will be presented by C &#x00026; C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C for all schools combined and for each school. Content and process fidelity data for Tier 2 will be obtained by scoring 14 video recorded sessions per each of the treatment groups. Perception of School Climate (aim two) during year one will be surveyed by a randomly selected sample of teachers, support staff and administrators from each participant school. The randomly selected sample will consist of similar proportion of teachers, support staff and administrators within each school. The questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>] will be completed at the end of years one, two, three, four, and five. This 31-item, 5-point Likert type scale checklist has four factors. Each factor&#x02019;s total score will be analyzed separately. School personnel no longer present in the school during subsequent years will be replaced.</p><p>The general analytical approach for testing our hypotheses will be the Laird and Ware mixed effects model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>] and the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>]. Mixed effects and GEE are statistical approaches based on regression techniques for analyzing correlated data collected repeatedly from the same subject. The study design will allow us to examine the between- subjects effect related to the two levels of support, and a within-subjects effect corresponding to time points (five time points), as well as a type of support (C, C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C) by time interaction effect. These analyses will be conducted using SAS Proc Mixed, which utilizes the mixed effects models, and SAS Proc Genmod, which utilizes GEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>]. Both the mixed effects model and GEE approaches allow estimation of fixed effect parameters such as time, and time by treatment interaction. If the interaction term is significant, it indicates that change in school climate and/or reduction in ODRs over time is significantly different between the two levels of support. If the interaction term is statistically not significant, the changes over time for the two primary outcomes will be presented by the time effect only, which represents both levels of support. The advantage of utilizing these methods is that all information available from each student is used, including variables with missing observations. In the proposed analyses, we will consider students measured within classes are correlated and will be nested within classes. Nested analysis will be chosen as part of Proc Mixed and Proc GEE, as such, the intraclass &#x02018;intracluster&#x02019; correlation (ICC) will be part of the overall variance covariance matrix.</p><p>Changes from pre- to post- implementation in diagnostic status, symptom severity and impairment level, coping skills and academic productivity during Implementation across all schools, regardless of level of support, will be analyzed using McNemar tests. For each of the listed primary outcomes, a series of 2X2 tables will be constructed to test changes from pre- to post- in the pertinent categories using McNemar tests. Alpha level will be adjusted to 0.025 based on Bonferroni criteria for multiple comparisons. We will also use McNemar tests to test the hypothesis that the pre- to post- level of improvement in diagnostic status, symptom severity, impairment level, coping, and academic productivity obtained during Implementation will be maintained during Sustainability among schools receiving C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C.</p><p>We would like to determine whether pre- to post- improvement in diagnostic status, symptom severity, impairment level, and academic productivity differ by support condition during the implementation phase. In addressing this research question, and for the sake of simplifying the statistical analysis, each student will be categorized as either improved or not improved based on change from pre- to post-. A category one will be assigned if a student&#x02019;s diagnostic status, for example, changes either from positive to intermediate, intermediate to negative, or positive to negative. Otherwise a score of zero will be assigned. Similar coding will be used for symptom severity, coping, impairment level, and academic productivity. We will use chi-squared tests to compare the proportion of (yes/no) for each of the primary outcomes between C and C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C type of supports. To examine changes in the rate of ODRs between baseline and follow up during each school year, the number of students with at least one ODR will be defined at baseline and at the follow up and a 95% confidence interval for such changes will be constructed for each of the five years.</p><p>In addressing aim three, school climate scores and the proportion of out-of school suspensions (number of suspension divided by number of students) served at the school during the previous academic year (<italic>i.e.</italic>, before implementation of Tier 1) will be compared to school climate scores (using the two independent sample t-test), and school suspensions for each subsequent project year (using Chi-squared test) respectively. For Tier 2, the proportion of children at baseline who are found to have unmet need for mental health services (<italic>e.g.</italic>, children found to have an externalizing or anxiety disorder at the intermediate or clinical level via the DISC-IV and who have not received mental health services as measured via the SACA) will be compared to the proportion of children with unmet need for mental health services in subsequent years (using Chi-squared test). In order to obtain a measure of unmet need at baseline, we will interview parents to assess the presence of disorders and service utilization at one year prior to the assessment and at the time of the assessment. For each subsequent cohort of children, we will interview parents about presence of disorder and service utilization only at the time of the assessment. Comparison of the proportion of unmet need between each subsequent year to the baseline proportion will be compared using Chi-square test.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim four: cost analysis</title><p>We will evaluate the effectiveness of SWPBIS with C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C as compared to SWPBIS with C in increasing procedural and process fidelity and in reducing ODRs and improving school climate, and children&#x02019;s grades, diagnostic status, symptom severity and impairment; and the effectiveness of SWPBIS with C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C as compared to SWPBIS with C. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>] will be constructed for each intervention (SWPBS with C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C for Tier 1, SWPBS with C for Tier 1, SWPBS with C&#x02009;+&#x02009;C for Tier 2, SWPBS with C for Tier 2). The denominator of the cost-effectiveness ratio is the difference between the effectiveness of the intervention and control groups (accounting for baseline levels) on designated measures of fidelity and student outcomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, student grades). The numerator of the cost ratios is the difference in mean costs for intervention and control groups (accounting for baseline levels). All costs associated with the program will be set at $0 at baseline. Costs for interventions will include: initial development of the leadership team; initial training of the coaches (Tier 1) and clinical supervisors (Tier 2); initial training of the leadership team and school counselors; subsequent supervision of coaches and clinical supervisors; conducting groups with at risk children; and activities to maintain the SWPBIS program, including day-to-day implementation, ongoing training, data collection, and money for student incentives. Within each component, two main types of costs will be calculated: cost of physical materials used for training and interventions and costs associated with time spent by trainers and school personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>].</p><p>As an example, the cost-effectiveness ratio for fidelity will reveal how much it costs (or how much it saves) to increase fidelity among the study population by one point. Confidence intervals will be constructed to determine the probability that the difference between two ratios indicates significant differences in cost-effectiveness for the target population. The ratios can then be ordered from lowest to highest to show which intervention is the most cost-effective for increasing the SET score. Administrators then have the information they need to determine if gains in fidelity are sufficient to justify marginal costs. In a similar manner cost-effectiveness ratios can be constructed for other targeted outcomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, measures of school climate, child symptomatology, impairment, coping skills, symptom severity, and functioning) for comparisons in which the results indicate significant improvement in the intervention group as compared to the control condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of focus group results</title><p>As indicated, focus groups will be conducted with LTs to identify their perceptions of SWPBIS implementation in their schools. Sessions will be transcribed and analyzed qualitatively, based on grounded theory. Two RAs will read the transcripts independently and record all major themes on index cards. The RAs will present the data to the research team. The research team will then try to resolve any discrepancies between the RAs&#x02019; findings. Next, the RAs will examine the transcripts once again and identify the frequency of comments pertaining to each theme. The frequencies for RA one and RA two will be compared to check for inter-rater agreement. Standard frequency tables will be used to compare the relative frequency of endorsements for each theme. The agreement between the two RAs will also be checked by calculating the Kappa co-efficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size justification and statistical power</title><p>Sample size estimation was based on addressing the primary outcome, the participants&#x02019; diagnostic status (aim two). The statistical analysis will be McNemar tests for two correlated proportions (pre/post) between two groups. With a sample size of 300 students, the statistical test achieves 92% power to detect an odds ratio of three using a two-sided McNemar test with a significance level (&#x003b1; ) of 0.01. The odds ratio is equivalent to a difference between two paired proportions of 0.25, which occurs, for example, when the proportion among students diagnosed with a Positive anxiety/externalizing disorder at pre and improved to Intermediate at post (cell 1,2 in the 2X2 McNemar table) is 0.425 and the proportion among students diagnosed without Positive anxiety/externalizing disorder who became either Intermediate or Positive at post (cell 2,1 in the 2X2 McNemar table) is 0.175. Therefore, the proportion of discordant pairs is 0.60. We adjusted &#x003b1; level to 0.01 to account for the multiple 2X2 McNemar testing. We need to recruit six schools, grades four to eight,to be able to enroll 300 evaluable students who meet inclusion criteria. We assumed that the observed changes in students&#x02019; diagnostic status within schools are independent based on an evaluation of the FRIENDS program, in which &#x02018;schools&#x02019; level accounted for less than 5% of the total variance across dependent measures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Innovation</title><p>The study is innovative in a number of ways. This is the first study utilizing SWPBIS as a foundation for addressing mental health disparities in urban schools and one of the first studies embedding EBIs for both externalizing and anxiety disorders within a SWPBIS framework. With regard to implementation science, this is the first study assessing the effectiveness of two randomized levels of support for school personnel implementing EBIs. The study uses rigorous methods for the measurement of intervention content and process fidelity within a two-tier mental health program. We will also conduct a cost analysis and measure the effects of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions on academic productivity, grades, attendance, disciplinary referrals, and suspensions, which are rarely assessed in this type of dissemination and implementation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges and limitations</title><p>Implementing SWPBIS with mental health supports in under-resourced urban schools presents a number of challenges. In our pilot study where we developed and piloted the interventions, we faced repeated leadership changes at the district level, staff turnover at the school level, and limited parent participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. However, we also found strong and consistent support among second-level administrators (<italic>e.g.</italic>, regional superintendents) at the District level and committed leadership teams that were able to recruit new members who functioned effectively. With the lessons learned from our pilot study, we are able to more effectively support the schools in successfully implementing SWPBIS while receiving either level of support. We have redoubled our efforts at helping schools to increase parental collaboration and support, which lead to more parent participation. We have also designed the implementation strategy to fully utilize existing policy and infrastructure (<italic>e.g.</italic>, implementation of District-wide practices to promote students&#x02019; success; utilizing school counselors and school facilities for Tier 2 interventions) to limit strain on resources so that the proposed program will be sustainable.</p><p>A limitation is that we are conducting the study in six schools within a single school district (though it is one of the largest and most diverse school districts in the country), which limits generalizability to schools in different parts of the country. Including a relatively small number of schools limits our ability to examine the clustering effect of school classes and schools. In this study, the unit of randomization is the school but the unit of analysis (aim two) is the student. A cluster randomized approach would have been an appropriate design if a much larger number of schools were included in the study. However, it is anticipated that the degree of similarity in treatment response among students within a class will be poorly correlated, and therefore the intraclass correlation coefficient within clusters will be small and its effect on the overall variance between schools would be minimal. However, an appropriate cluster analyses will be conducted using nested analysis. The NESTED Procedure of SAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>] is an example of such analysis. We expect that our findings will inform implementation research in schools and procedures to be incorporated into larger-scale trials in urban schools in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has the potential to show the amount of resources (training and consultation) needed for the implementation of EBIs with high levels of fidelity in under-resourced urban schools.
