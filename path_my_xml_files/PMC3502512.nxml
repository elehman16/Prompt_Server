By contrast, physiological tremor has a dominant frequency around 10 Hz. Although tremor has multiple sources, it is partly central in origin, reflecting a component of motoneuron discharge at this frequency. The motoneuron response to &#x0223c;20 Hz descending input could be altered by non-linear interactions with &#x0223c;10 Hz motoneuron firing. We investigated this further in eight healthy human subjects by testing the effects of the beta-adrenergic agents propranolol (non-selective &#x003b2;-antagonist) and salbutamol (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist), which are known to alter the size of physiological tremor. Corticomuscular coherence was assessed during an auxotonic precision grip task; tremor was quantified using accelerometry during index finger extension. Experiments with propranolol used a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. A single oral dose of propranolol (40 mg) significantly increased beta band (15.3&#x02013;32.2 Hz) corticomuscular coherence compared with placebo, but reduced tremor in the 6.2&#x02013;11.9 Hz range. Salbutamol (2.5 mg) was administered by inhalation. Whilst salbutamol significantly increased tremor amplitude as expected, it did not change corticomuscular coherence. The opposite direction of the effects of propranolol on corticomuscular coherence and tremor, and the fact that salbutamol enhances tremor but does not affect coherence, implies that the magnitude of corticomuscular coherence is little influenced by non-linear interactions with 10 Hz oscillations in motoneurons or the periphery. Instead, we suggest that propranolol and salbutamol may affect both tremor and corticomuscular coherence partly via a central site of action.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council.

During steady contractions, cortical recordings (electroencephalogram, EEG, or magnetoencephalography, MEG, in humans, local field potentials in animals) show coherence with contralateral rectified electromyogram (EMG) at frequencies of 15&#x02013;30 Hz <xref rid="pone.0049088-Conway1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049088-Kilner1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Both efferent and afferent (feedback) pathways contribute to this oscillatory coupling <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049088-Witham2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In the periphery, oscillations are greatest at &#x0223c;10 Hz. Physiological tremor has a strong component around this frequency, probably as a result of multiple interacting factors. These include mechanical resonance at skeletal articulations <xref rid="pone.0049088-Lakie1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the stretch reflex loop <xref rid="pone.0049088-Hagbarth1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, motor unit recruitment <xref rid="pone.0049088-Allum1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and motor unit synchronisation <xref rid="pone.0049088-Halliday2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A component of &#x0223c;10 Hz physiological tremor is centrally generated <xref rid="pone.0049088-Halliday2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049088-McAuley1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although both cortical and muscle recordings show oscillations around 10 Hz and 20 Hz, significant corticomuscular coherence is usually only seen for the higher frequency band, despite &#x0223c;10 Hz oscillations being effectively carried from the motor cortex down the corticospinal tract <xref rid="pone.0049088-Baker4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We have recently provided evidence that neural circuits in the spinal cord phase invert signals around 10 Hz <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Convergence of in-phase and out-of-phase signals on motoneurons results in phase cancellation, reducing the amplitude of signals at frequencies related to physiological tremor. This may have functional consequences in improving movement precision.</p><p>The non-linear nature of spinal circuits means that interactions can occur across different frequency bands. For example, our previous computational modelling suggested that recurrent inhibition by Renshaw cells will boost signals around 30 Hz, at the same time as reducing those around 10 Hz, leading to a reciprocal modulation of power at these frequencies <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Conversely, the highly periodic nature of motoneuron firing at low forces can produce oscillations in motor output, even when the synaptic input to motoneurons is not oscillatory <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. As the firing of the motoneuron pool becomes more or less periodic, this effect will mean that the amplitude of oscillations at 10 Hz and 20 Hz tends to co-modulate. We were interested to examine experimentally how motor systems oscillations at different frequencies might interact, since this could tease apart the different factors influencing oscillatory amplitude and coupling.</p><p>One approach to this issue is to manipulate the system pharmacologically. We have previously shown that the benzodiazepine diazepam modulates cortical oscillations in the beta band, without altering coupling to the periphery <xref rid="pone.0049088-Baker5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. By contrast, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine increases beta band corticomuscular coherence, without affecting the amplitude of cortical oscillations <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, neither of these agents affected oscillations around 10 Hz. Clinically, the most powerful effects on physiological tremor are produced by beta-adrenergic agents. The beta-adrenergic agonists enhance tremor (adrenaline <xref rid="pone.0049088-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; isoprenaline <xref rid="pone.0049088-Abila1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>; salbutamol <xref rid="pone.0049088-Koster1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>), whereas the antagonist propranolol reduces it <xref rid="pone.0049088-Abila1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These drugs are generally believed to act by changing the gain of muscle receptors and spinal reflex loops, mediated via peripherally located &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors <xref rid="pone.0049088-Marsden1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Abila1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Abila2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049088-Lakie2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. If the effects of beta-adrenergic agents are solely peripheral, they will change the gain of peripheral feedback, which would inject oscillations into motoneuron firing. This might co-modulate oscillations at 10 Hz and 20 Hz <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In this paper, we test this idea directly. Surprisingly, we show that propranolol increases &#x0223c;20 Hz corticomuscular coherence but reduces tremor at &#x0223c;10 Hz, and that salbutamol has no significant effect on &#x0223c;20 Hz corticomuscular coherence, but markedly increases &#x0223c;10 Hz tremor. These opposite effects on oscillations at 10 Hz and higher frequencies are similar to those seen in a computational model of recurrent feedback by Renshaw cells <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and are not expected if these agents only act peripherally. We speculate that beta-adrenergic agents also have a central action, allowing opposite effects on physiological tremor and beta-band corticomuscular coherence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Experiments were performed on 8 young healthy right-handed volunteer subjects (3 female; age range 21&#x02013;32 years) without a family history of essential tremor.

Subjects held the two levers of a purpose-built manipulandum between thumb and index finger. The aluminium levers (20&#x000d7;80&#x000d7;1.5 mm) were attached to the shafts of two computer-controlled torque motors, which incorporated optical encoders for position measurement. At rest the levers were separated by 70 mm; a 1 N force was required to move the levers off their end-stops.</p><p>The task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049088-g001">Figure 1</xref>) required subjects to maintain cursors representing each lever position within two moving target boxes on a computer screen. Movement of the levers was resisted by the torque motors, which simulated an auxotonic (spring-like) load. The target boxes produced a hold-ramp-hold pattern, with the first hold requiring a rapid lever displacement of 12 mm from rest followed by a hold period of 3 s at a force level of 1.3 N. The targets then produced a 2 s ramp movement to reach the second hold, with a displacement of 24 mm, 1.6 N force and duration of 3 s, before subjects released the levers.

For each subject, placebo and propranolol (40 mg of active compound mixed with vehicle compound), which were indistinguishable in appearance, were randomly assigned a label A or B by an independent randomizer. Each subject participated in experiments on two days, separated by a 2&#x02013;3 week washout period. At the start of the morning session of each day, the subject was prepared for recording. A control experiment was then carried out, which consisted of 80 trials of the precision grip task and a measurement of tremor. After this, the electrode locations were marked on the skin with ink and the subject ingested experimental compound A (first day) or B (second day). Four hours later, when peak serum concentrations of the active agent should have been achieved <xref rid="pone.0049088-Levitt1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, the subject returned to the laboratory. Fresh adhesive electrodes were applied at the marked muscle and scalp locations, and further recordings were made. The identities of compound A and B for each subject were only revealed by the randomizer once all experiments were complete and data were ready for analysis. By using a placebo, we were able to control for effects caused by the different time of day of the experimental and control recording sessions, which we have previously shown to be important <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The subjects who had participated in the propranolol experiments were also used in the salbutamol experiments, following a washout period of at least one week. After the control recordings, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was inhaled by the subject as an aerosolised solution produced by a nebuliser. Inhaled aerosolised salbutamol is absorbed rapidly via the lungs into the bloodstream. Maximum serum concentrations are achieved &#x0223c;10 minutes after inhalation <xref rid="pone.0049088-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Nebulised salbutamol, at a dose of 40 &#x000b5;g/kg, results in an average serum concentration of 2.5 ng/ml after inhalation <xref rid="pone.0049088-Lipworth1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The rapid absorption meant that control and test experiments were separated by only a short period, and we accordingly considered it unnecessary to carry out placebo experiments for salbutamol (see paragraph 12 of the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> section for further justification).</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored throughout the salbutamol experiments. Salbutamol at an average plasma concentration of 2.5 ng/ml produces a 10% increase in heart rate above baseline <xref rid="pone.0049088-Lipworth1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The second recording session (after salbutamol) was therefore only commenced after the heart rate had increased by 10% relative to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analysis</title><p>All data analysis was performed using custom written MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.) routines, and followed the procedures used in our prior publications <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

For acceleration, the normalisation used the total power in the first recording of that day, allowing overall changes in tremor power to be measured. For EEG and EMG, each spectrum was normalised to its own total power, revealing the magnitude of spectral peaks relative to the total. The spectra were then averaged across eight subjects for EEG or acceleration, and across eight subjects and five muscles for EMG. Coherence spectra were similarly averaged across subjects and muscles; significance limits for the averaged coherence were calculated according to the method described in Evans and Baker <xref rid="pone.0049088-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and Baker et al <xref rid="pone.0049088-Baker2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Power was summed across a frequency band of interest (6.2&#x02013;11.9 Hz for tremor; 15.3&#x02013;32.2 Hz for beta-band oscillations) within a single subject. Changes of power before and after substance administration in these frequency bands were then assessed using paired t-tests (P&#x0003c;0.05). For propranolol, we needed to test not only whether propranolol produced a change, but whether this change was significantly different from that produced by placebo. Accordingly, the change in power in the relevant band was found for each subject; these changes were compared between placebo and propranolol (paired t-test, P&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>For corticomuscular coherence, coherence was averaged across muscles and across bins within the 15.3&#x02013;32.2 Hz band for each subject.

Firstly, frequency bins in the beta-band region (15.3&#x02013;32.2 Hz) for each muscle were identified which had significant coherence both before and after substance administration. The coherence phase was measured for those bins, and the difference in phase determined between the &#x02018;before&#x02019; and &#x02018;after&#x02019; conditions. The circular average of this difference was computed <xref rid="pone.0049088-Fisher1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We then randomly shuffled the individual paired phase measurements, reallocating each member of a pair to the &#x02018;before&#x02019; or &#x02018;after&#x02019; categories; the circular average of the phase differences was recalculated.

We thus chose not to make the comparison with placebo in this case. Additionally, the effects of salbutamol on heart rate and tremor were clearly apparent to the subjects, so that a double-blinded study would have been impossible.

<xref rid="pone.0049088-Claustre1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to propranolol, the striking lack of any effect of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agoinst salbutamol upon coherence suggests that its predominant mode of action is via peripheral receptors. &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors are certainly found in abundance in extrafusal muscle where they mediate diverse functions including: metabolic regulation <xref rid="pone.0049088-Duranti1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>; myocyte hypertrophy <xref rid="pone.0049088-Hinkle1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>; and repair <xref rid="pone.0049088-Beitzel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. These actions occur over a protracted time course and are therefore unlikely to be responsible for salbutamol's rapid effects on tremor. Faster processes are also mediated via &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-receptors. They decrease muscle excitability by closing inward rectifying potassium channels, opening calcium-activated potassium channels <xref rid="pone.0049088-GeukesFoppen1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and blocking sodium currents <xref rid="pone.0049088-Desaphy1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In addition, because sympathetic activity produces rapid changes in blood flow to skeletal muscle, it has been argued that ischaemia (or its consequences e.g. hyperkalaemia) might affect tremor by changing the biophysical properties of muscle <xref rid="pone.0049088-Lakie2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Network re-organization</title><p>Although the literature is conflicting <xref rid="pone.0049088-Salenius1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049088-Halliday3" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, the phase of corticomuscular coherence often does not agree with simple efferent propagation of oscillations from motor cortex to the periphery <xref rid="pone.0049088-Riddle1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Witham2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049088-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.
