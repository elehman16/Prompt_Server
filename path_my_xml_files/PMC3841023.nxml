One suggested that nutrient sensor is the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), not previously studied in human skeletal muscle. It is hypothesized that oral ingestion of essential amino acids (EAA) and carbohydrates (Carb) increases Vps34 activity and mTOR signaling in human skeletal (hVps34) muscle after sprint exercise. Nine subjects were performed 3 &#x000d7; 30-sec all-out sprints with or without ingestion of EAA + Carb or placebo drinks in a randomized order with a month interval. Muscle biopsies were performed at rest and 140 min after last sprint and analyzed for p-mTOR, p-p70S6k, p-eEF2 and for hVps34 activity and hVps34 protein content. Venous blood samples were collected and analyzed for amino acids, glucose, lactate, and insulin. During the sprint exercise session, EAA, glucose, and insulin in blood increased significantly more in EAA + Carb than in placebo. P-mTOR and p-p70S6k were significantly increased above rest in EAA + Carb (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007) 140 min after last sprint, but not in placebo. Activity and protein expression of hVps34 were not significantly changed from rest in EAA + Carb 140 min after the last sprint. However, hVps34 activity and protein expression tended to increase in placebo (both <italic>P</italic> = 0.08). In conclusion, on the contrary to the hypothesis, no increase in activation of hVps34 was found following sprint exercise in EAA + Carb condition. In spite of this, the results support an activation of mTOR during this condition. However, this does not exclude the permissive role of hVps34 in mediating the amino acid-induced activation of mTOR and muscle protein synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Amino acids</kwd><kwd>hormones</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>Western blot</kwd><kwd>Wingate test</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In sprint exercise, with great power development, there is a need for both large muscle mass and fast contracting muscles. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of sprint exercise on factors that regulate muscle protein metabolism and the possible additional effects of nutritional supplements. The few studies, that have been performed on this topic, show that there is low or no activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream target p70S6k after sprint exercise, at least in males (Gibala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2009</xref>; Esbjornsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2012b</xref>). mTOR and p70S6k regulate protein translation initiation and elongation as well as ribosomal biogenesis and their activation mostly indicates an increased protein synthesis (Kimball and Jefferson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">2010</xref>) and muscle hypertrophy (Baar and Esser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1999</xref>; Bodine et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">2001</xref>; Terzis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">2008</xref>), although this is not always the case (Greenhaff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2008</xref>). Recently, Coffey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2010</xref>) studied the influence of protein/carbohydrate provision on mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis after repeated bouts of 6-sec sprints. They found that the nutrient supplement enhanced both the downstream mTOR signaling and myofibrillar protein synthesis. The mechanism, by which the nutrients are sensed in the muscle cell, is poorly understood, although various signaling molecules have been suggested and studied in vitro. One of these suggestions is the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) (Byfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>; Nobukuni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2005</xref>).</p><p>Human Vps34 (hVps34) overexpression, in vitro has been shown to activate p70S6k, whereas an hVps34 knockdown was shown to block amino acid-induced activation of p70S6k (Nobukuni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2005</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that addition of amino acids or glucose to starved nonmuscular cells leads to an increased activation of Vps34 and p70S6k (Byfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>; Nobukuni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2005</xref>). In addition, MacKenzie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>) demonstrated that leucine activated Vps34 in C2C12 myotubes and Gran and Cameron-Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2011</xref>) found that leucine increased the hVps34 protein concentration along with an increased p70S6k phosphorylation in human myotubes (Gran and Cameron-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2011</xref>). These studies indicate that Vps34 contributes to the regulation of mTOR/p70S6k pathway by nutrients. However, most of these earlier studies were performed in vitro. Therefore, it is important to further explore the role of Vps34 as a nutrient sensor in vivo. Vps34 has previously been studied in rat skeletal muscle (Mackenzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2007</xref>; MacKenzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>), but to the best of our knowledge, there are no earlier studies on Vps34 activity in human skeletal muscle tissue. It is hypothesized that oral ingestion of essential amino acids (EAA) combined with carbohydrates (Carb) increases the activity of hVps34 accompanied by increased phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6k in human skeletal muscle after repeated bouts of 30-sec cycle sprint exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine healthy physically active subjects (eight males and one female) were recruited from the university area and sports/health clubs for the study. The inclusion criteria include: in good health, participation in leisure-time sports, but not at an elite level and age 20&#x02013;35 years. The exclusion criteria were chronic disease, acute infection, severe asthma, or use of products containing nicotine. Health was checked by a general health questionnaire, followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram registration. A questionnaire was used to estimate the physical activity level during leisure time. The subjects answered nine different questions from which an activity index (minimum value 5 and maximum value 20) was calculated (Jansson and Hedberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">1991</xref>). Fat-free body mass (FFM) was estimated from skin fold measurements in triceps, biceps, subscapula, and suprailiacal regions (Durnin and Womersley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">1974</xref>). The maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) was determined using a standardized incremental cycle test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer (Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden). Oxygen uptake was measured continuously utilizing a gas analyzer Vmax Encore System (VIASYS Healthcare Inc., Yorba Linda, CA). The subjects' physical characteristics are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>. All subjects were fully informed about the procedures and potential risks of the experiment before giving their written and verbal consent prior to participation.

The order of the experiments was randomized. On each of the two occasions, the subjects reported to the laboratory in the morning after an overnight fast. The subjects were instructed to ingest either an essential amino acid and maltodextrin drink (EAA + Carb) containing eight EAA, 300 mg &#x000d7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight (Ajinomoto, Kanagawa, Japan) and maltodextrin, 1 g &#x000d7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight (Faring AB Sports nutrition, Fast Carbs Natural, J&#x000e4;rf&#x000e4;lla, Sweden). Both EAA + Carb and placebo drinks were &#x0201c;Wild Berrie&#x0201d; flavored and contained salts and artificial sweetener, all to conceal the taste of the amino acids (Funlight, Wild Berries, Procordia Food AB, Esl&#x000f6;v, Sweden, diluted 1:4 in water, see also Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Each subjects ingested a total volume of 12.5 mL kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight of the drink delivered at four occasions (5 min before sprint 1 and 15 min after each sprint). The subjects performed the sprint exercise on a mechanically braked cycle ergometer (Cardionics, Bred&#x000e4;ng, Sweden) according to the protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref> (Bar-Or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">1987</xref>). After a brief warm up (1 min, with a braking load of 1 kg) the subjects were instructed to pedal as fast as possible without any resistance. When maximal pedaling speed was reached, an individual braking load set at 0.075 kp kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight was applied to the flywheel, while the subjects continues to pedal &#x0201c;all out&#x0201d; for 30 sec. The subjects were performed in total three 30-sec sprint exercise bouts with 20-min rest between the sprints. A sensor-microprocessor assembly counted flywheel revolutions and the flywheel progression per pedal revolution was 6 m. Average power output was automatically printed every 5th second. Peak power (i.e., the highest 5-sec power) and mean power (the average power during the 30-sec sprint exercise) output was expressed in absolute values (W), relative to body mass (W &#x000d7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body mass) and relative to FFM (W &#x000d7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> FFM), see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>. Power decrease was calculated as the difference between peak power and the last 5-sec power output divided by peak power.

Comparing samples obtained at rest (placebo compared to EAA), a coefficient of variation (CV) for the hVps34 activity of around 30% was found. However, this does not represents the imprecision of the method because a biological variation, over the 1 month separating the experiments, adds to the true and lower value of imprecision. The CV for the comparison of postexercise values was around 60%, indicating a greater variation after exercise, that is, in a situation where changes in hVps34 activity were expected to occur.

In spite of this, there was a marked increase both in plasma EAA and p70S6k Thr389 phosphorylation in skeletal during the current experimental setup. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of hVps34 activity measurements in human skeletal muscle.</p><p>The hypothesis in this study was based on in vitro experiments, showing that Vps34 is activated by amino acids or glucose (Byfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">2005</xref>; Nobukuni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">2005</xref>; MacKenzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>). No previous studies have been conducted in vivo on the effects of exercise alone or in combination with nutrient ingestion on Vps34 activity in human skeletal muscle. However, there are some in vivo studies on Vps34 protein measurements in skeletal muscle related to nutrition in nonhuman species (Suryawan and Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">2010</xref>). In skeletal muscle of fed mice, there was lower detectable Vps34 protein expression along with reduced abundance of Vps34-beclin 1 complexes as compared to the fasted state (Yamada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2012</xref>). These data were supported by an earlier in vitro study by Tassa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2003</xref>), who demonstrated that amino acid-fed C2C12 myotubes demonstrated a reduced class III PI3K (likely Vps34) activity and reduced abundance of class III PI3K&#x02013;beclin 1 complex.</p><p>The lack of consistency between the various studies discussed above might be explained by two distinct roles of Vps34. One is to control growth by activating mTOR when amino acids are present. Whereas a second role is to induce autophagy during amino acid-deprived conditions. These opposing roles of Vps34 are thought to be possible by the formation spatially distinct Vps34 containing complexes mediating either mTOR activation and cell growth or autophagy (Burman and Ktistakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>; Ktistakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2012</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, the hVps34 activity and protein concentration tended to increase (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08) after sprint exercise in the nutrient poor (fasted) condition in this study, that is, the placebo condition. The novel interaction reported in this study, between increased hVps34 activity and plasma glucose levels in the EAA + Carb and placebo conditions, emphasizes the complexity of hVps34 activation and regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">6</xref>). In fact, it supports the model of the dual functions of this enzyme, as described by Burman and Ktistakis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>), where Vps34 activity is stimulated by both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor conditions. The lack of statistical significance for the increase in Vps34 activity in the placebo condition might be a question of experimental statistical power. However, it may also depend on a true interindividual variation in exercise-induced changes in hVps34 activity related to the degree of lack of nutrition in the placebo condition: subjects with the lowest plasma glucose level in the placebo condition consistently showed an increase in hVps34 activity, whereas those with higher plasma glucose did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">7</xref>).</p><p>An increase in hVps34 activity in a nutrient-poor condition is in line with the finding by Mackenzie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2007</xref>); MacKenzie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>), who found an increased Vps34 activity after exercise in the fasted rat. These are the only publications on Vps34 activity in skeletal muscle after exercise in any organism. As mentioned earlier, Vps34 is essential for autophagy, a process by which cells degrade cytosolic components (e.g., damaged organelles and unused long-lived proteins) by forming a double-walled vesicular structure, called an autophagosome, which fuses with lysosomes, thereby delivering cargo for destruction and recycling. This process is thought to help to maintain a balance between degradation, synthesis, and subsequent recycling of cellular products (Burman and Ktistakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>; Ktistakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2012</xref>). The formation of autophagosomes is initiated by hVps34 complexes that minimally contain hVps15 and beclin 1 (Mizushima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2007</xref>; Burman and Ktistakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">2010</xref>; Ktistakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">2012</xref>). Autophagy is not only induced changes activated by nutrient deficiency (Mizushima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2007</xref>), but also by exercise conditions such as hypoxia and oxidative stress (Azad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2009</xref>; Noman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">2012</xref>). Interestingly, exercise was found to induce autophagy in skeletal muscle of mouse (Grumati et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2011</xref>; Nair and Klionsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2011</xref>). Moreover, He et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">2012</xref>) demonstrated that the beneficial effects of exercise were dependent on an intact autophagy phenotype.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of p70S6k is increased after resistance exercise and that this increase is potentiated by nutrients such as EAA (Dreyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2008</xref>; Apro and Blomstrand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2010</xref>). The nutrient-induced changes in mTOR signaling after sprint exercise is less well studied. However, this study of 30-sec sprints and the earlier study by Coffey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2010</xref>) of 6-sec sprints show that nutrients have similar effects on mTOR activation after sprint and resistance exercise. In addition, the eEF2 phosphorylation, known to activate translational elongation, decreased to a similar extent after nutrient ingestion and placebo, despite the marked nutrient-induced increase in p70S6k phosphorylation. This indicates a potentiated activation of translation initiation, but not of translational elongation during the nutrient ingestion condition. A similar finding has been presented previously, after resistance exercise (Dreyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">2008</xref>). Irrespective of the lack of a measurable increase in hVps34 activity after sprint exercise combined with nutrient ingestion, a pronounced increase in the phosphorylation of p70S6k was found. Alternatively, p70S6k could be activated via the insulin&#x02013;Akt&#x02013;mTOR signaling pathway (Hillier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">2000</xref>; Greenhaff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2008</xref>). Ingestion of amino acids is known to increase plasma insulin levels (Floyd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">1966</xref>). In fact, in this study, a higher serum insulin concentration was found during EAA + Carb condition and the peak concentration occurred simultaneously with the peak for plasma EAA. This suggests that an EAA-induced increase in serum insulin may activate p70S6k through the Akt&#x02013;mTOR pathway. In fact, Coffey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">2010</xref>) showed that Akt phosphorylation was increased after EAA ingestion in parallel with increased p70S6k phosphorylation. Additional evidence comes from a study by Anthony et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2002</xref>), who demonstrated in rat skeletal muscle, that a leucine-induced increase in p70S6k phosphorylation was dependent on insulin (Anthony et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">2002</xref>).</p><p>Most earlier studies of sprint training have been performed without control of nutrient supply pre- and post the training sessions and there are no clear cut results regarding sprint training-related changes in, for instance, muscle mass (Esbj&#x000f6;rnsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">1993</xref>; Ross and Leveritt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">2001</xref>). Therefore, it would be of great interest to study the effect of nutrients on sprint training-induced changes in muscle mass. The finding in this study of a decrease in plasma EAA &#x02013; during repeated bouts of 30-sec sprint exercise (Esbjornsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2012a</xref>) in fasting condition, support the need for nutrient supply after sprint exercise to maintain or increase muscle mass.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that only one postexercise biopsy was taken approximately 2 h after the last bout of exercise. This was justified by a desire to avoid a residual effect of a preceding biopsy on protein activation. We cannot exclude the possibility of an earlier, transient increase in hVps34 activity following the last bout of exercise, related to the increasing plasma EAA level. However, the plasma EAA levels were still clearly elevated at the time of the postexercise biopsy obtained 140 min after the last sprint, suggesting activation conditions for hVps34. Further studies are necessary to explore the possibility of transient hVps34 activation. Another limitation of the study is that we did not had enough biopsy material to analyze other potential activators of mTOR following sprint exercise combined with nutrient ingestion such as membrane-associated amino acid transporters (Drummond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">2011</xref>; Suryawan and Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2011</xref>), Ser/Threonine protein kinase (MAP4K3 [Findlay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">2007</xref>]) or Rag GTPases (Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report demonstrating hVps34 activity in human skeletal muscle. Our data demonstrate that measurements of lipid kinase function and hVps34 specificity are possible in human subjects and allow for further studies on this important aspect of mTOR signaling. On the contrary to the hypothesis, no increase in activation of hVps34 was found following sprint exercise in a nutrient-enhanced condition. In spite of this, the results strongly support an activation of mTOR during this condition. However, this does not exclude the permissive role of hVps34 in mediating the amino acid-induced activation of mTOR and muscle protein synthesis. Even though not hypothesized we propose that an activation of hVps34 may occur following sprint exercise in the fasted condition (placebo) as earlier demonstrated after skeletal muscle contractions in rat (MacKenzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">2009</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the help and assistance of the following; Emily Fee in the Murray laboratory for hVps34 activity assay control experiments, Eva Nejman-Skoog for her skilled help with the amino acid analysis and Ted &#x000d6;sterlund for the skilled help with the Western blot analysis and all insightful comments.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anthony</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Crozier</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Anthony</surname><given-names>TG</given-names></name><name><surname>MacLean</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kimball</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Contribution of insulin to the translational control of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle by leucine</article-title><source>Am.
