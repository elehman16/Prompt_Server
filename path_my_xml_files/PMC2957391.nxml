Rotator cuff disease, rotator cuff tendinosis, and impingement syndrome are terms used synonymously with subacromial shoulder pain.

However, some patients develop chronic pain. To indentify the influencing factors or predictors might be important for outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Prognosis of shoulder pain may be influenced by different factors or a combination of factors such as socio-demographics, genetics, psychological- and personal-traits, occupational factors, work status, characteristics of the shoulder pain, use of medication, and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. According to a systematic review, few high quality prognostic studies exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

The patients were between 18 and 70 years old and had had subacromial shoulder pain for at least 3 months. The inclusion criteria were: dysfunction or pain on abduction; a normal passive glenohumeral range of motion; pain on two of three isometric tests (abduction at 0&#x000b0; or 30&#x000b0;, external or internal rotation); and a positive impingement sign. The exclusion criteria were: bilateral shoulder pain, previous surgery on the affected shoulder, instability, referred pain from neck, rheumatoid arthritis, clinical and radiological signs of glenohumeral- or acromioclavicular arthritis, serious somatic or psychiatric disorder or inability to understand Norwegian.</p><p>Patients gave their informed signed consent after written and verbal information before baseline registration. One hundred and four patients were included (50% women). Both treatments were conducted at the outpatient Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Ullevaal, Oslo University Hospital. The supervised exercise regimen (SE) was provided by two physiotherapists and the patients attended two 45-minute sessions weekly for a maximum of 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy (rESWT) (Swiss Dolor Clast, EMS) was provided by another physiotherapist, and administered once a week for 4 to 6 weeks, with 3 to 5 tender points treated each time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Medical Research, Health region I, Norway.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential predictors and outcome measures</title><p>At baseline, potential predictors previously identified in prospective and rehabilitation studies were assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Socio-demographic variables included age, gender, educational level (&#x02264;12 years at school) and work status (working &#x0003e;50%). Status of "not working" included those on sick leave, disability pension and vocational rehabilitation. Status of "retired" was not included. Characteristics of shoulder complaints included intensity and duration of pain (3-6 months, 6-12 months, &#x0003e;12 months), previous shoulder pain, previous treatment, and dominant arm involvement. Occupational factors examined were frequency of heavy lifting and working above shoulder level, which were classified into 3 categories (seldom/never, sometimes, extremely/often) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Use of pain medication, sleeping medication, and relaxation medication was registered according to frequency of use (not regularly versus daily or weekly). Emotional distress was scored from one to four by the 25-items Hopkins Symptoms Checklist with a higher score indicating more distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. General health status was evaluated by EQ-VAS (0-100) with higher scores indicating better perceived health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Self-efficacy for pain was evaluated as the sum of 4 items from 1(easy) to 7 (impossible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

In agreement with previous studies also self-reported health status, previous shoulder pain, and pain and disability (higher SPADI score) at baseline, predicted poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>All patients satisfied clinical criteria for subacromial pain and were included in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Strictly, our findings are valid for patients fulfilling the criteria outlined. We did not include a placebo group and can not estimate the prognosis as compared with patients given no treatment. However, a previous study reported that patients fulfilling similar clinical criteria randomized either to surgery or supervised exercises had better prognosis than patients given placebo laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Lower education and pain and disability (SPADI) at baseline was significant predictors for pain and disability (SPADI) after 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. According to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], patients with severe symptoms were more likely to receive more extensive treatment, but this did not improve outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Further investigation is needed to determine whether early intervention, especially for those with low education, positively affects outcome.</p><p>Work status at baseline was significantly associated with SPADI and working in the univariate analyses, but not in the multivariate analyses. The odds ratio for not working at 1 year was four-fold higher in patients with low versus patients with high education. This is well known according to back pain, but also seems to be applicable to patients with chronic subacromial pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Education is often considered to be the best indicator of socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. High educational attainment is also related to better personal economy, socio-psychological resources, and a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We found that also high score on EQ-VAS, evaluating current health status predicted working after 1 year. Lower health status may affect work status because both work-related and individual factors are associated with sick leave and might influence the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the reasons for not working may also depend on the physician, as well as individual attitudes towards being sick-listed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Some kind of work is difficult to perform with a painful shoulder, but previous studies suggest that long term sick-listing negatively influence return to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In agreement with a previous study from our hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] self-reported physical work related factors evaluated were not independently associated with outcome. Few studies have included psychosocial factors in their analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A combination of predictors seems more important than single predictors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This supports the consensus of musculoskeletal pain as being a multidimensional problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although many of these predictors are not in the control of health providers, such knowledge may improve the treatment decision process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Separate analysis of the interaction term (baseline SPADI * (treatment group)) indicate that baseline SPADI score is a more important predictor for pain and disability after 1 year for the supervised exercise (SE) group than for those treated with rESWT. Significant interactions are of clinical interest because different subgroups may respond differently according to the outcome. Further investigation with sufficient sample size is needed.</p><sec><title>Advantages and limitations</title><p>Advantages of the present study are the use of the recommended clinical diagnostic criteria for subacromial shoulder pain, application of recommended outcomes, the inclusion of several possible predictors in the analyses, and performance of analyses according to recommended criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The limitations are the small sample size and that missing values were not imputed. In particular, 8 patients who were not working at baseline and dropped out at 1 year may bias the results for work status and lower the possibility to find work status as a significant predictor. Patients in a clinical trial may have different prognosis compared to those excluded, but we were not able to evaluate those excluded.</p><p>Numerous predictors were investigated, but the final linear model explained no more than 30% of SPADI's variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similar results were found for the logistic model, which suggests that between 22% and 33% of the variability was explained by the two predictors. Heterogeneity of the patient group despite uniform clinical criteria, measurement error of the outcome variables, and prognostic factors not examined, may contribute to the moderate percentage of variance accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The AUC of the model of 0.78 may be interpreted as satisfactory discrimination between patients who were working and those who were not working after 1 year. It should be noted however, that a small sample size with a relatively high number of predictors investigated tends to over-fit the predictive model and spuriously overestimate associations between factors and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>An external validation of the results ought to be performed in different populations, preferably in a population from a cohort study and in patients in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Validation studies are of importance, especially if the request is to implement a hospital (secondary) care model to the primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Only a selective group of patients in general practice are referred to a specialist. These patients may be considered as subgroups of patients which may affect the generaliseability.</p><p>Adjusting for treatment is recommended as well as including treatment as a separate predictor in the models, especially when the treatment has effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The treatments may change the prognosis or modify the effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The two treatments applied may also be adapted according to changes in the patients' symptoms, complicating the interpretation of treatment as a predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the predictive value of treatments is often small in long term follow-up studies.</p><p>Another way to study possible predictors might be to include a population with different diagnoses of shoulder pain. Such studies require a larger sample size in order to have sufficient statistical power for subanalyses of different diagnostic groups. A more explanatory approach might be required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical value</title><p>When predictive models are obtained from randomized trials, data may have restricted generaliseability due to strict eligibility criteria for the trial, recruitment level, or if large numbers refused consent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In the present study, relatively few eligible patients refused to participate. In addition, the study population consisted of participants working in a wide variety of occupational settings, which makes the results more generalisable than a selective sample of workers.</p><p>The models presented, although not validated, may provide adequate information about prognostic outcome in patients with subacromial pain. They are more objective than subjective impression and can be complementary to clinical intuition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The models might help clinicians to make decisions, and in giving advice to the patients. In general, few models are validated in new patient groups and implemented into clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Our results indicate that generic factors not related to the shoulder problem were the most important prognostic factors, and that they may be of more importance for patients with poor outcome. This is consistent with other studies in patients with musculoskeletal pain disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that 12 or fewer years of education was the most consistent predictor of a poor outcome of pain and disability (SPADI score) and work status at 1 year follow-up.
