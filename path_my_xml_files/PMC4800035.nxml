STAMPEDE is a randomised controlled trial using a multiarm, multistage platform design. It recruits men with high-risk, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer who are starting first-line long-term hormone therapy. We report primary survival results for three research comparisons testing the addition of zoledronic acid, docetaxel, or their combination to standard of care versus standard of care alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Standard of care was hormone therapy for at least 2 years; radiotherapy was encouraged for men with N0M0 disease to November, 2011, then mandated; radiotherapy was optional for men with node-positive non-metastatic (N+M0) disease. Stratified randomisation (via minimisation) allocated men 2:1:1:1 to standard of care only (SOC-only; control), standard of care plus zoledronic acid (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA), standard of care plus docetaxel (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc), or standard of care with both zoledronic acid and docetaxel (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc). Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was given for six 3-weekly cycles, then 4-weekly until 2 years, and docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for six 3-weekly cycles with prednisolone 10 mg daily. There was no blinding to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. Pairwise comparisons of research versus control had 90% power at 2&#x000b7;5% one-sided &#x003b1; for hazard ratio (HR) 0&#x000b7;75, requiring roughly 400 control arm deaths. Statistical analyses were undertaken with standard log-rank-type methods for time-to-event data, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs derived from adjusted Cox models.

Median age was 65 years (IQR 60&#x02013;71). 1817 (61%) men had M+ disease, 448 (15%) had N+/X M0, and 697 (24%) had N0M0. 165 (6%) men were previously treated with local therapy, and median prostate-specific antigen was 65 ng/mL (IQR 23&#x02013;184). Median follow-up was 43 months (IQR 30&#x02013;60). There were 415 deaths in the control group (347 [84%] prostate cancer). Median overall survival was 71 months (IQR 32 to not reached) for SOC-only, not reached (32 to not reached) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA (HR 0&#x000b7;94, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;79&#x02013;1&#x000b7;11; p=0&#x000b7;450), 81 months (41 to not reached) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc (0&#x000b7;78, 0&#x000b7;66&#x02013;0&#x000b7;93; p=0&#x000b7;006), and 76 months (39 to not reached) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc (0&#x000b7;82, 0&#x000b7;69&#x02013;0&#x000b7;97; p=0&#x000b7;022). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect (for any of the treatments) across prespecified subsets. Grade 3&#x02013;5 adverse events were reported for 399 (32%) patients receiving SOC, 197 (32%) receiving SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA, 288 (52%) receiving SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc, and 269 (52%) receiving SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Zoledronic acid showed no evidence of survival improvement and should not be part of standard of care for this population. Docetaxel chemotherapy, given at the time of long-term hormone therapy initiation, showed evidence of improved survival accompanied by an increase in adverse events. Docetaxel treatment should become part of standard of care for adequately fit men commencing long-term hormone therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Cancer Research UK, Medical Research Council, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, Pfizer, Janssen, Astellas, NIHR Clinical Research Network, Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>Systemic treatment has changed little for newly diagnosed men with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer since the development of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues a generation ago. The only major change has been the use of radical radiotherapy for men whose disease had not spread. This century, new agents began to show valuable activity in relapsed, metastatic, castrate-refractory prostate cancer&#x02014;including zoledronic acid, which was approved in 2002 on the basis of reduced morbidity in men with bone metastases (a site of spread in up to 90% of castrate-refractory prostate cancer), and docetaxel, with improved survival demonstrated in 2004. Several other trials in addition to STAMPEDE have assessed both drugs in the newly diagnosed setting, most notably GETUG-15 and CHAARTED, which assessed docetaxel in the metastatic setting (about 60% of the population used in our trial). A systematic review and meta-analysis was done in parallel to preparation of this report and contains details of the review strategy.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>Our results for zoledronic acid show no convincing evidence of worthwhile benefit either on failure-free or overall survival. These results are congruent with emerging results from other trials in men starting long-term hormone therapy. The docetaxel results showed an improvement in overall survival (HR 0&#x000b7;78; 95% CI 0&#x000b7;66&#x02013;0&#x000b7;93; p=0&#x000b7;006). There was a notable improvement in survival for the metastatic subset, which is consistent with findings from GETUG-15 and CHAARTED which both also showed gains in failure-free survival with docetaxel. GETUG-15 showed a non-significant improvement in overall survival, and CHAARTED reported a statistically significant improvement in overall survival.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Together, these trials provide evidence that six cycles of docetaxel should be added to standard androgen deprivation therapy for men with metastatic disease commencing treatment. Men with non-metastatic disease had better prognoses, and failure-free survival was clearly improved by docetaxel; however, there were relatively few deaths in those with non-metastatic disease, so statements about overall survival in this population remain underpowered.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since October, 2005, the STAMPEDE randomised controlled trial has recruited men with metastatic (M1), high-risk localised (N0), or node-positive (N+) prostate cancer who were newly diagnosed or had high-risk recurrent disease following previous local therapy. All were commencing first-line long-term hormone therapy. Prognosis for these patient groups had altered little since the first description of the effects of hormone therapy in the 1940s. This began to change in the early 21st century with licensing of agents that improved survival (ie, docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T),<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and disease-modifying agents that reduced morbidity (zoledronic acid and denosumab).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, these agents have all shown their benefits in the setting of castrate-refractory prostate cancer (ie, after first-line hormone therapy has ceased working).</p><p>STAMPEDE uses a multiarm, multistage (MAMS) platform design to test whether the addition of treatments at the time of long-term hormone therapy initiation improves overall survival. Here, we evaluate and report findings for zoledronic acid and docetaxel; data for celecoxib, abiraterone, enzalutamide in combination with abiraterone, and (in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease only) prostate radiotherapy will be reported elsewhere. We have previously reported the celecoxib-containing groups which closed to recruitment early after a pre-planned second intermediate analysis failed to show sufficient effect on failure-free survival.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We have also previously reported control group outcome data for patients with metastatic<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and non-metastatic<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> disease. We report here the first survival data for the following original groups in this platform trial: zoledronic acid, docetaxel, and their combination. Other trials have also examined similar strategies, both in patients with non-metastatic disease and in those with metastatic disease, usually with single drugs.

There were no age restrictions; patients were required to be fit for chemotherapy with no clinically significant cardiovascular history.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Patients were randomised centrally using a computerised algorithm, developed and maintained by the trials unit. Minimisation with a random element of 80% was used, stratifying for hospital, age at randomisation, presence of metastases, planned radiotherapy use, nodal involvement, WHO performance status, planned hormone therapy, and regular use of aspirin or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Allocation was in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to standard of care only (SOC-only), standard of care plus zoledronic acid (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA), standard of care plus docetaxel (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc), or standard of care plus zoledronic acid and docetaxel (SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc).

Orchidectomy was an allowable alternative to drug therapy. No recommendations around the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor with docetaxel were given. Radiotherapy, at 6&#x02013;9 months after randomisation, was encouraged for patients with N0M0 disease, until November, 2011, then mandated; radiotherapy was optional for patients with N+M0 disease; staging was with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging criteria.

Serious adverse events, including serious adverse reactions, were reported accordingly.

All patients gave written, informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The definitive and intermediate primary outcome measures were overall survival and failure-free survival, respectively. Overall survival was defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause. Failure-free survival, which is commonly used to drive decisions in the clinic, was selected because it is on the causal pathway to death from prostate cancer and was not required to be a surrogate for overall survival. It was defined as time from randomisation to first evidence of at least one of: biochemical failure; progression either locally, in lymph nodes, or in distant metastases; or death from prostate cancer. Biochemical failure was defined as a rise of 50% above the within-24-week nadir and above 4 ng/mL and confirmed by retest or treatment.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We expected prostate-specific antigen failure to be the most common manifestation of failure-free survival events.

Standard survival analysis methods were used to analyse time-to-event data. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate most relative treatment effects. This model was adjusted for stratification factors (except hospital and planned hormone therapy), and stratified by time periods defined by addition of a new research group or end in recruitment to an ongoing research group. An HR below 1&#x000b7;00 favoured the research group. Flexible parametric models were constructed with 4 degrees of freedom for each of the baseline hazard function and time-dependent effect, and adjusted for stratification factors and time periods.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Medians and 5-year estimates come from the flexible parametric model fitted to the data; these are more reliable than reading the Kaplan-Meier curves. The proportional hazards assumption was tested; restricted mean survival time was emphasised in the presence of non-proportionality. Fine and Gray regression models were used for competing risk analysis of prostate-cancer-specific survival (non-metastatic prostate-cancer-specific survival analyses did not adjust for time period due to lack of convergence). Prespecified analyses looked at consistency of treatment effect within stratification factors, over time period, and also by categorised Gleason score (&#x02264;7, 8+, unknown), recurrent disease, and prostate-specific antigen values before hormone therapy. The statistical analysis plan was modified to include an analysis of the subset of patients with metastatic disease at randomisation after the presentation of CHAARTED<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and GETUG-15<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and before this primary analysis was performed. All tests were two-sided, with confidence intervals given at the 95% level.</p><p>Median follow-up was determined through the standard approach of reverse-censoring on death, in which survival is treated as the event and death as censoring. All patients are included in the efficacy analyses according to allocated treatment on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse event data are shown for the safety population, comprising patients who received any study drug and underwent adverse event assessment, and analysed according to treatment initiated irrespective of study group assignment; a sensitivity analysis of safety was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Safety data were assessed continuously; we also present a safety analysis at 1 year, chosen to assess whether chemotherapy side-effects had ameliorated by this timepoint. A formal comparison of those research groups showing a survival advantage, compared with SOC-only, was done, and a pre-planned factorial analysis (without an interaction term) is included for completeness.

In these cases, restricted mean survival time is preferred for summarising treatment effect.

In the patient group with bone metastases at presentation, SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA similarly had no evidence of an effect (HR 0&#x000b7;94, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;76&#x02013;1&#x000b7;16; p=0&#x000b7;564).</p><p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows time to first of any treatment after a failure-free survival event and time to first life-extending therapy (defined as available agents with proven survival gain in castrate-refractory prostate cancer: docetaxel, abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, and radium-223). There were no obvious differences either in time to any therapy or life-extending therapies between groups. There were however, differences in the pattern of therapy depending on whether patients were docetaxel-exposed upfront (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). Analysis of zoledronic acid use after relapse is provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix page 7</xref>. Overall exposure to treatment for progression is summarised in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>, showing slightly higher rates of exposure to subsequent therapy in the control group.

This was mostly due to events during the first 6 months on trial, when the proportions were 17% (n=203) for SOC-only, 15% (n=91) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA, 36% (n=198) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc, and 39% (n=202) for SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc, with docetaxel seeming to contribute the most toxicity. For 1998 patients with adverse event data around 1 year after randomisation (ie, worst adverse event grade reported at 48 or 60 weeks of follow-up), the proportions of grade 3 or higher toxic effects were balanced, with 10% (n=76) patients reporting a worst adverse event as grade 3 or higher with SOC-only, 10% (n=41) with SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA, 10% with (n=43) SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc, and 12% (n=49) with SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc. The pattern and levels of adverse events were similar in the safety and intention-to-treat populations. There were ten (2%) reported cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw on SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA and 20 (4%) on SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc. There were eight deaths probably or possibly related to the research treatment: one on SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc (neutropenic sepsis), and seven on SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc (four neutropenic sepsis, one pneumocystic pneumonia, one interstitial pneumonitis, and one pneumonia).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>The STAMPEDE randomised controlled trial is investigating the effectiveness of the front-line use of various treatments in men commencing long-term hormone therapy for newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or who have relapsed after local therapy with poor prognosis features. The MAMS design used in STAMPEDE has allowed us to address multiple treatment questions simultaneously within a single trial platform.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> We will report further randomised comparisons from STAMPEDE in the coming years (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix page 2</xref>), meaning that, through this single protocol, we will have answered at least eight different primary questions in 15 years. To have addressed as many questions in separate, sequential trials would have taken many decades and far more patients, notably allocated to control groups. We recommend that academic and industry researchers consider this design in the future, to make faster progress and good use of limited trial resources.</p><p>These are the first mature, comparative, randomised data to emerge from the trial. We found that the addition of docetaxel to standard of care was associated with improved survival, with an HR of 0&#x000b7;78 and a difference in median survival of 10 months, as well as improvements in prostate-cancer-specific survival, failure-free survival, and skeletal-related events. The combination of zoledronic acid and docetaxel was associated with similar improvements, although the benefit observed was smaller. We will report cost-effectiveness and patient-reported outcomes separately.</p><p>Docetaxel is a widely used drug with a familiar toxicity profile. Docetaxel was well tolerated in this population, with most patients completing all six cycles in a timely fashion and good dose intensity. Predictable chemotherapy toxic effects, including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, were observed but few patients stopped treatment because of side-effects. Toxic effects in both docetaxel-containing groups seemed higher than in previous studies of this drug in patients with castrate-refractory prostate cancer (eg, TAX327), but the studies have used different populations.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The protocol made no recommendations about growth factor support, and we have not collected information about its use.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Docetaxel significantly prolonged failure-free and overall survival across the trial population with no evidence that the effect varied across different groups in the population; in particular, there is no evidence of a difference of the effect of docetaxel by metastatic status, for either of these outcome measures. The beneficial effect on survival is clear in the larger metastatic subpopulation, which accounted for 61% of patients in the trial and 84% of deaths. There were fewer patients with non-metastatic disease and, with their generally more favourable prognosis, there were relatively few deaths in this group; all survival analyses for this subset are currently underpowered. In this non-metastatic subset of men, death from causes other than prostate cancer was more common than in men with metastatic disease, and therefore any effect of docetaxel on overall survival will be diluted. We will report longer-term follow-up in due course, but note that estimates of the treatment effect in failure-free survival and prostate-cancer-specific survival are extremely similar for patients with and without metastases at presentation.</p><p>For zoledronic acid, the results show no evidence of efficacy on failure-free survival, skeletal-related events, or overall survival, despite good compliance with therapy and good levels of exposure, with target duration of 2 years. Few patients stopped treatment for side-effects; the most frequent reason for stopping trial therapy within 2 years was disease progression. This differed between the SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA and SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;ZA&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc groups because failure-free survival was increased in the latter group by docetaxel, indirectly leading to increased exposure to zoledronic acid as well. Despite this increased exposure, zoledronic acid showed no evidence of an advantage when added to docetaxel (HR 1&#x000b7;06).</p><p>The effect of docetaxel on survival was positive, but clinically significant toxicity did occur; in clinical practice, consideration could be given to early use of growth factor support to enable treatment delivery. There was one treatment-related death in the SOC&#x02008;+&#x02008;Doc group and seven in the combination group. This difference, combined with a more modest survival benefit for the combination treatment, raises the possibility of some interaction (or antagonism) between docetaxel and zoledronic acid in the treatment of this group of men.</p><p>A number of trials have now examined docetaxel in the hormone-naive context in both the non-metastatic and metastatic settings, of which STAMPEDE is the largest.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These findings are discussed elsewhere but consistently show an improvement in failure-free survival.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The CHAARTED trial<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> recently reported improved survival in metastatic disease whereas GETUG-15,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> a similar trial, did not report a differential effect. Taken with our results, there is compelling evidence that front-line docetaxel substantially improves survival in patients with metastatic disease. In the non-metastatic setting, there are insufficient mature survival results in the literature, so further follow-up and engagement in planned meta-analyses are needed to further delineate the effect of docetaxel on survival in this setting. The impact on failure-free survival is both clear and large in favour of docetaxel in STAMPEDE.</p><p>The case mix of patients joining the trial included men with newly diagnosed disease and a small proportion of patients with recurrent disease. The recurrent disease subset is small and thus it is unrealistic to look for statistically reliable results in such men; however, we note that estimates of the effect of docetaxel are consistent with that seen in the population as a whole.</p><p>For zoledronic acid, there are now several trials showing no evidence of a survival gain with upfront use,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> as discussed in the accompanying meta-analysis. This contrasts with the results from MRC PR05<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> with sodium clodronate (another bisphosphonate), in which a survival benefit was reported in a metastatic population. The companion non-metastatic trial showed no evidence of an effect on survival with the same agent.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>Men in the STAMPEDE trial did better than we had expected in terms of survival. We believe this resulted from second-line and third-line treatments which were unavailable when the trial was designed. The timing of second-line therapy after relapse was similar across groups, but choice of which treatment to use was at the investigator's discretion, and, consequently, was varied. This choice would have been affected by local practice and availability of newer treatments over time, such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, and cabazitaxel, as well as allocated treatment in the trial.</p><p>There are several strengths to note in the STAMPEDE trial and specifically for the analyses reported here. First, the data were prospectively collected and randomised, from nearly 3000 men with patient characteristics that were well balanced by group, and we achieved good median follow-up (43 months). Second, the data were very recently frozen (May, 2015) at a pre-planned analysis point of roughly 400 control group deaths, meaning the primary outcome results are both well powered and have been reported promptly. Third, the patients contributing to these analyses came from more than 100 sites across the UK and Switzerland, suggesting the results to be generalisable. Fourth, the design allows easy understanding of effect across multiple randomisations. Finally, treatment compliance among patients starting treatment was good.</p><p>We are aware that there are also limitations within the data. First, the proportion of patients not starting treatment, especially docetaxel, will have a small diluting effect. Linkage to hospital records is required to report more detailed information on skeletal-related events. The impact of therapies that do not target androgen receptors on recurrence (as assessed by prostate-specific antigen) is likely to be complex. Finally, power for assessing the consistency of effects across subsets is inevitably low; we will report long-term follow-up in due course when the maturity will be much greater both across the trial and particularly in the non-metastatic subset.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown improved survival across a population of men commencing first-line long-term hormone therapy through the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy but not by adding zoledronic acid. Therefore, zoledronic acid should not become part of standard of care. Standard of care should be updated to include docetaxel chemotherapy in suitable patients with metastatic disease, and docetaxel may be considered for men with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer with or without radiotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
