In particular, the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI poses a vast challenge, as therapeutic options are limited because of contraindications and/or increased risk of hypoglycaemia in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hypoglycaemia is more common in patients with RI because of decreased renal gluconeogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and in particular, overexposure to insulin secretagogues or exogenous insulin is often associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as vildagliptin and sitagliptin are generally well tolerated, and are approved for use in patients with severe RI. Owing to their glucose-dependent mechanism of action, they are generally associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and are an attractive treatment option for these difficult-to-treat patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. All DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycaemic control by extending the meal-induced increases in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) for several hours by slowing the rate of inactivation of these peptides. There are differences in the mechanisms of action of DPP-4 inhibitors, in particular their catalytic binding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which may translate into clinical differences. For example, vildagliptin blocks DPP-4 through substrate-like binding to the active site of the enzyme for an extended time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. By contrast, sitagliptin exerts its effect through competitive enzyme inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Only vildagliptin has been shown to block the inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP between meals and overnight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, there are limited data comparing the various agents directly.</p><p>We report here the efficacy and safety/tolerability of vildagliptin compared with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI, with a focus on glycaemic control relative to hypoglycaemic risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, double-blind, 24&#x000a0;week, clinical trial of vildagliptin (50&#x000a0;mg once daily) and sitagliptin (25&#x000a0;mg once daily) in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI (ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT00616811). The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of both treatments in this patient population. The study was conducted between January 2008 and October 2010. Participants were recruited as outpatients in 87 centres across Brazil (6) and the USA (81).</p><p>Key inclusion criteria for this study included age 18&#x02013;85&#x000a0;years, BMI 18&#x02013;42&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.5&#x02013;10.0% (48&#x02013;86&#x000a0;mmol/mol), type 2 diabetes either untreated (no glucose-lowering medication in the past 8&#x000a0;weeks) or treated with a stable dose of sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, meglitinide or insulin, as monotherapy or in combination (for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks), and severe RI (estimated GFR [eGFR] by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [1.73&#x000a0;m]<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). Patients were excluded if they had a history of renal transplant, significant cardiovascular history within 6&#x000a0;months, liver disease, abnormal liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT] &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; upper limit of normal [ULN], aspartate transaminase &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN or total bilirubin &#x0003e;2&#x000d7; ULN and/or direct bilirubin &#x0003e;ULN) or any treatment that is contraindicated (i.e. metformin) in the severe RI population. The initial protocol excluded patients undergoing any dialysis, but it was subsequently amended to remove this restriction to facilitate recruitment.</p><p>Patients continued their initial background treatment throughout the study. After a 2&#x000a0;week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, eligible patients were randomised using interactive voice response technology (IVRS) to receive either vildagliptin (50&#x000a0;mg once daily) or sitagliptin (25&#x000a0;mg once daily) for 24&#x000a0;weeks in addition to continuing their background treatment, if applicable. IVRS assigned a randomisation number to the patient, which was used to link the patient to a treatment arm and to specify unique medication numbers for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient.</p><p>This clinical trial targeted enrolling a population of approximately 33% elderly women as a patient population considered more vulnerable. Therefore, patient randomisation was stratified by a combined age and sex factor (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;year old women versus others) and background glucose-lowering medication. Randomisation procedures were performed by the investigator or his/her delegate. The study drugs were supplied by Novartis as tablets, and patients were instructed to take one pill a day orally before breakfast. Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments and data analysts remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomisation until database lock. Both medications were used at the doses recommended in the label for patients with severe RI. Rescue medication (insulin addition or intensification) could be administered on or after week 4 if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;mmol/l, after week 8 if FPG &#x0003e;13.3&#x000a0;mmol/l and after week 16 if FPG &#x0003e;12.2&#x000a0;mmol/l.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Outcomes</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG were measured at all visits.

HbA<sub>1c</sub> and routine biochemistry laboratory assessments were performed by a central laboratory (Covance, Indianapolis, IN, USA).</p><p>For assessment of safety and tolerability all treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded and evaluated by the investigator for severity and possible relationship to study medication.

Assuming an approximate 35% dropout rate (i.e. patients who did not complete the 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment), 90 patients randomised to the vildagliptin group would provide approximately 58 patients who completed 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. A sample size of 58 patients who completed the 24&#x000a0;week study in the vildagliptin treatment group would have 83% power to observe at least one AE with an underlying rate of 3%. For efficacy variables (HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG), the adjusted mean changes from baseline to endpoint (with last observation carried forward) were compared between treatments using an ANCOVA model, with the baseline value as the covariate, and background therapy, pooled centre and treatment as the classification variables. In addition, the time course of HbA<sub>1c</sub> values and change from baseline by treatment were tabulated and plotted. Efficacy data were censored at the start of rescue medication.

This difference was primarily driven by AEs of hyperhidrosis, tremor and asthaenia, as well as asymptomatic low blood glucose levels.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Adjusted mean (SE) change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline with vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg once daily (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;78) or sitagliptin 25&#x000a0;mg once daily (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;62), <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.874.

The incidence of AEs (82% vs 86%), serious AEs (24% vs 23%) and discontinuations due to AEs (7% vs 9%) were comparable for vildagliptin and sitagliptin. Deaths were reported in two patients in each group (cardiac arrest and septic shock in the vildagliptin group, and acute pulmonary oedema and asphyxia in the sitagliptin group). Infections and infestations (vildagliptin 35% vs sitagliptin 39%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (25% vs 28%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (22% vs 23%), cardiac disorders (13% vs 15%), hepatobiliary disorders (0.0% vs 2%) and pancreatitis (0% in both groups) were reported with similar frequencies in both groups. The most commonly reported AE was peripheral oedema, which occurred at a similar frequency in the vildagliptin (23%) and sitagliptin (25%) groups. No deterioration of renal function was observed with either vildagliptin or sitagliptin. Two patients on sitagliptin had ALT elevations (one patient with ALT &#x0003e;3&#x000d7; ULN in the context of a gastritis, one asymptomatic with ALT &#x0003e;5&#x000d7; ULN); both events resolved on treatment. There were no such liver enzyme elevations on vildagliptin. While a limited number of patients with ESRD on haemodialysis were included in the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6 in each group), the safety data did not indicate that these patients receiving vildagliptin or sitagliptin were at an increased risk compared with the overall population with RI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study presented here is the first to directly compare efficacy and safety/tolerability of two DPP-4 inhibitors, namely vildagliptin and sitagliptin, in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe RI. The overall HbA<sub>1c</sub> lowering effect was similar for both drugs and both drugs were well tolerated.</p><p>Both drugs in this study were used at their expected maximal effective and recommended doses (in accordance with product labelling) for patients with severe RI. Vildagliptin is mostly hydrolysed to inactive metabolites, with approximately 20% being excreted unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In patients with severe RI, a 50&#x000a0;mg once daily dose of vildagliptin provides full efficacy, as slower elimination effectively doubles the period of time it prevents GLP-1 and GIP inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions seen with vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg once daily in patients with severe RI were similar to the reductions observed with vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg twice daily in patients with preserved renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and also consistent with HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions initially shown in a large, placebo-controlled trial in 515 patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate or severe RI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As sitagliptin is essentially excreted unchanged by the kidney (80% is excreted as the unchanged compound with only a small fraction being metabolised) and peak plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) increases approximately fourfold in patients with severe RI, the expected maximal effective dose and the dose recommended on the label in patients with severe RI for sitagliptin is 25&#x000a0;mg once daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The comparative efficacy of 50&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin and 25&#x000a0;mg sitagliptin cannot be determined from this study with certainty as it was not powered to assess relatively small differences in efficacy. In the current study, 80% of patients were on insulin treatment, which likely blunts any differences associated with extending the effects of GLP-1 with vildagliptin during the overnight period. Still, the numerical reduction in FPG with vildagliptin and the slight increase in FPG with sitagliptin are consistent with an effect of vildagliptin during the overnight period. A limitation of the study is that no postprandial blood glucose profiles were obtained. However, studies comparing vildagliptin and sitagliptin in patients with preserved renal function did not find relevant differences in postprandial glucose excursions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that this would be the case in our study in patients with RI. The percentage of patients achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &#x02264;6.5% (48&#x000a0;mmol/mol) was higher in the vildagliptin group than the sitagliptin group. This difference is unlikely to reflect a true difference in efficacy between the drugs, and may be a consequence of the slightly lower baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> level in the vildagliptin group. Interestingly, this higher responder rate with vildagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin. Overall, the nearly identical drops in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in our study indicate that the clinical efficacy of both DPP-4 inhibitors is similar in spite of the differences discussed above.</p><p>Both drugs were well tolerated. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar between the two treatment groups (16% vs 15%). These incidences are low given the vulnerable patient population and that the majority of patients were on insulin treatment. In a study with a similar design, the rates of hypoglycaemia in vildagliptin-treated and placebo-treated patients were of similar magnitude as in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The longer extension of the meal-induced increase in GLP-1 and GIP with vildagliptin was not associated with a safety concern in the present study. Of interest, in a prior study in which vildagliptin was dosed at either 50&#x000a0;mg once daily or 50&#x000a0;mg twice daily (i.e. double the recommended dose on the global label) in patients with ESRD, both dosing regimens were well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, this and other clinical trials demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile of the entire DPP-4 inhibitor class in populations with severe RI, irrespective of the degree of renal excretion or catalytic binding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg once daily and sitagliptin 25&#x000a0;mg once daily have similar efficacy and safety profiles in patients with severe RI, supporting the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with severe RI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec5"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="125_2015_3655_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>ESM List of participating investigators</label><caption><p>(PDF 12&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine transaminase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPP-4</term><def><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p>Estimated GFR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p>End-stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPG</term><def><p>Fasting plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GIP</term><def><p>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP-1</term><def><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVRS</term><def><p>Interactive voice response technology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDRD</term><def><p>Modification of diet in renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RI</term><def><p>Renal impairment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ULN</term><def><p>Upper limit of normal</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all the investigators, staff and patients at the participating sites and A.
