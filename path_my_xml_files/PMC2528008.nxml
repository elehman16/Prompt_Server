Thus a <italic>manual puzzle </italic>version of the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) was devised to appeal to the attentional and sensory preferences and language limitations of children with ID.

These findings suggest that the puzzle form does not require greater cognitive ability but demands sensory-motor attention and limits distraction in children with severe ID. Thus, we suggest the puzzle form of the RCPM is a more reliable measure of the non-verbal mentation of children with severe ID than the book form.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Intellectual disability (ID) affects 1.25% of the Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is defined according to the ICD-10 criteria as ongoing difficulties in age appropriate functioning and below age average cognitive performance as demonstrated by a score of two standard deviations below the mean on standardized intelligence tests. However, standardized intelligence tests such as the WISC-IV are often limited in their assessment of children with severe intellectual disability (ID) who are often unable to stay on task for the lengthy administration of the test, or handle its heavy reliance on language skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and lack of ability to motivate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, to produce a valid measure of cognitive ability for children with severe ID, testing procedures must accommodate their profound deficits in communication, attention and social skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Such procedures are necessary and important to facilitate the most appropriate educational placement to enhance their educational and learning potential. We suggest that the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices Test (RCPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) is a potentially more suitable alternative to tests like the WISC as it is an untimed non-verbal measure of reasoning ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This is supported by a recent study by Dawson, Souli&#x000e8;res, Gernsbacher and Mottron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which showed that the WISC-III underestimates intelligence in children with ASD. They found that scores of 38 children with ASD were on average 30 percentile points higher on the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) than their scores on the WISC-III, whereas no such difference was found for typically developing (TD) children. The RCPM consists of 36 coloured multiple choice matrices (although colour is irrelevant to the completion of the task), organized in three increasingly complex sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is being utilized increasingly with children with severe ID, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in research settings to control for non-verbal mentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and in educational settings to determine the level of functioning and treatment progress as part of a battery of tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite it being a better indicator of non verbal cognitive ability than the WISC III, many children with severe ID still show difficulties in completing the RCPM. Clark and Rutter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] found that motivation and associated disruptive behaviours such as task avoidance, self-stimulation and escape behaviours in children with lower functioning ASD, hindered test performance on the RCPM. Techniques adopted to maintain motivation (e.g. lowering task difficulty to increase success rate in low scoring children) led to better performance, which suggests that the task itself is not sufficiently engaging of attention for children with impaired intellectual functioning. The standard book form of the RCPM also requires the child to point to their chosen pattern, which is a problem as pointing is one of several delayed social communication skills observed in many children with ID, particularly ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To enhance compliance in cognitively less able clinical groups, Raven produced a board form of the RCPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] where each item, presented on a wooden board, can be completed with the correct placement of movable pieces. Raven et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] claim that the board form is a consistent, reliable and psychologically valid estimate of reasoning ability, with a test retest reliability of approximately <italic>r </italic>= 0.80. However, although past studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] have utilized the board form, the study details are not available and, evidence of its validity is limited. Furthermore its heavy inflexible wooden design is often unsuitable for use for children with severe ID. Carlson and Weidl used a test-retest design to show that the board form produced better performance than the book form in typically developing children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and children with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, because they allowed for trial and error in the completion of the board form, it is unclear whether the better performance on the board form was due to increased opportunity for self-correction or the nature of the board form itself. The board form is also limited as the moveable pieces are easily disarranged when in use and administration of 36 separate board pieces is quite time consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Such task characteristics do not encourage sustained attention and motivation in children with severe ID.</p><p>In line with the merits of the board form and considering its administrative inflexibility we have designed a puzzle version as an alternate form of the RCPM specifically designed to encourage greater sensory attention and motivation, increase task comprehension and consequently limit other disruptive behaviours in order to obtain a more valid measure of reasoning ability in children with ID. This new form resembles a jigsaw puzzle and therefore minimizes verbal task instructions for children with severe ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is also conceptually like the board form in that participants must physically remove pieces, however, our puzzle form utilizes a cardboard and Velcro&#x02122; system to allow the children to simply grasp and easily remove their chosen piece and place it in the gap of the larger pattern. Unlike the board form, the puzzle form is presented in a folder with each item displayed individually on one page and each piece secured with Velcro to minimize weight, distractions and ease and time of administration. Another advantage of the puzzle form is that grasping the pieces maintains attention better than the requirement of pointing, as in the book form. This is consistent with the idea that grasping requires more brain activation than visual recognition alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Grasping requires processing of spatial location, in addition to form, orientation and size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and serves to draw attention to the object, which maintains attention on the task. Motor engagement with the pieces and placement in the appropriate area provides immediate feedback and requires more attentional resources. Kaplan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] showed that people with ID receiving sensory input from different pieces of equipment, showed less aggression and self-stimulatory behaviour and more task completion. This effect was also generalized to subsequent tasks, which supports the effect of tactile stimulation in increasing task engagement in people with ID. Motor engagement is particularly important in children with severe ID and children with ASD who are less motivated by social reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] perhaps due to they failure to orient to and engage with the affective expressions of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Doussard-Roosevelt, Joe, Bazhenova and Porges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] found that children with ASD were more engaged when their mothers physically and non-verbally demonstrated an object to them than when she verbally described the object to them.</p><p>Thus the aims of these studies were in Study 1, to test the validity of performance of typically developing (TD) on the puzzle form of the RCPM by comparing it to the standard book form; and in Study 2, to examine overall performance and completion rate of the puzzle and book form in children with idiopathic ID, Down Syndrome (DS) or ASD to establish the potential applicability of this alternative puzzle form to children with severe ID. We hypothesized that, in Study 1, TD children would show comparable performance in the book and puzzle form of the RCPM, irrespective of which form was completed first on a counterbalanced cross over design over a three week period. We also hypothesized that, in Study 2, children with severe ID, whether ID, DS or ASD, who completed the puzzle form, would show a higher performance rate than children who completed the book form, irrespective of clinical group.</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1: Comparison of the standard and puzzle forms for the validation of the puzzle form of the RCPM</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Seventy-six typically developing (TD) children attending a mainstream primary school within the Catholic education system in the northeastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, participated in the current study.

Each item consists of a different coloured pattern with six possible pieces available to fill the "missing" location required to complete the pattern. The participant's task was to deduce the theme of relations expressed among the designs and choose the missing figure from among the alternative set of six. The original book form displayed each item on a page in a booklet. The alternative puzzle version was the same size and colour as the book form, but differed in that each of the alternative patterns could be removed and physically attached to the missing place on the matrix through the use of a Velcro system.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The standard administration procedure as prescribed by Raven et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], was used for the original book form, with trained clinicians administering both book and puzzle forms individually to each child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], within the school setting. As suggested by Raven et al. no time limit was assigned for either task. Participants were required to select a piece from six alternatives that completed the pattern for each item by either pointing to their chosen response in the book form or by removing their chosen response and placing it in the missing section of the matrix in the puzzle form. Participants were asked to do this using the verbal instruction "find missing". This very simple, clear and short verbal instruction was chosen to ensure that it could be successfully used with children with ID who have limited receptive language. Participants were required to select a piece their responses by pointing to Item one of the standard and puzzle versions served as a practice trial, where incorrect responses were corrected and no further assistance or verbal reward was given during performance and completion of the task. Performance on the RCPM was calculated according to the number of items correct, and unattempted items were classified as incorrect. Inclusion criteria required children to attempt at least one full set of 12 items. Children attempting less than this, were excluded from further analyses.</p><p>In Study 1, the TD children were randomly assigned to two groups where one group attempted the book form first while the other half attempted the puzzle form. The alternate form of the RCPM was again administered after three weeks. To minimize the impact of maturation in learning and memory or practice effects on performance a three-week interval between the puzzle and book form was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analyses</title><p>To validate the puzzle form, the performance of children who completed the standard book form first was compared to the performance of children who completed the puzzle form first using an independent samples t-test. A comparison of the two versions using a cross-over design was then used to examine the puzzle version performance over time, and to show that it matters little to overall performance of TD children, which form of the test was performed first. Previous test-retest studies using only the book form of the RCPM were conducted three weeks apart and reported correlations of Pearson's <italic>r </italic>= 0.80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

Past studies have reported that three factors delineate performance on the RCPM: continuous and discrete pattern completion, pattern completion through closure, and concrete abstract reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The high correlation between the book and puzzle forms found in the current study suggests that these constructs are maintained in the puzzle version.</p><p>Study 2 demonstrated that children with severe ID who were administered the puzzle form showed a performance advantage, as compared to those who were administered the book form. The findings suggest that the puzzle form provides a better indicator of learning potential than the book form in children with severe ID. We suggest that the performance advantage observed for the puzzle form is due to its unique features designed specifically to maintain attention and increase completion rate, though have not tested this suggestion directly. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that added motivational techniques increased performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the current study does provide evidence that attention can be engaged while maintaining the underlying constructs being measured. Thus, it is likely that the puzzle form does not demand additional cognitive processing on children with severe ID, but increases sustained attention on the task in comparison to the book form. If this were the case, it would suggest that the puzzle form effectively engages cognitive ability of children with severe ID through the integration of motor and sensory based learning but only when the child directs their own responses. This is also advantageous as it potentially useful as it puts the emphasis on the test to be able to engage children with severe ID rather than requiring the administrator efforts to promote engagement in the child during the testing. For example, a study found that certain adult style of interaction, such as following a child's line of action instead of trying to re-direct it enhances social engagement in children with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The greater completion rate for the puzzle form than the book form for the children with severe ID in study 2 suggest that the ability to sustain attention and maintain motivation is a factor contributing to performance on cognitive ability measures for children with severe ID. This is supported by previous research showing that salience of variables engaging attention are highly correlated with measures of intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The findings challenge the clinical assumption that task incompletion reflects the inability to maintain attention and indicates limits of cognitive ability. Increasing task completion rate in children with severe ID is also important as it allows better comparison of cognitive ability to children with TD.</p><p>Alternatively, the performance advantage of the puzzle form may be due to the greater completion rate for children who were administered the puzzle form, compared to the book form. It can be argued that the puzzle form produces a performance advantage because the physical placement of response pieces reduces the mental function of abstractly visualizing the chosen piece in the missing area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Unlike the results of the study by Carlson and Wiedl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], a trial and error approach was not permitted and hence this cannot be the source of increased performance when using the puzzle form. In addition, the performance advantage in the puzzle form was only demonstrated by children of the same mental age, some with ID and some developing normally, which could suggest that the puzzle form maintained attention and motivation in those with severely limited attentional resources.</p><p>Given that more ID children were able to complete the puzzle form than the book form, it is possible that the performance advantage of the puzzle form was associated with an increased opportunity to select responses, as oppose to heightened task engagement. As the RCPM is a multiple choice task, the more items an individual completes, even at random, the greater the possibility of obtaining a higher overall scores. However, this is unlikely as additional analyses showed that the performance advantage of the puzzle form was maintained even when only those children who completed either RCPM form were included. However, this performance advantage was not observed in the DS and ID groups (also in the DS group when all participants were included regardless of whether they completed the RCPM or not). These non-significant findings are likely to reflect a Type II error and may be due to the small number of participants in the DS and ID groups. Future studies should examine more closely the effect of responses due to chance when completing the RCPM, specifically error-type analysis reflecting problem solving strategies in children with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Profound deficits often make the assessment of children with severe ID very difficult, and the characteristics of standardized intelligence tests do not take into consideration such deficits. The current study indicates that children with ID perform better on the puzzle form of the RCPM and suggests that it is a better indicator of problem solving ability in children with severe ID than the book form. The puzzle form has proven to give a useful measure of RCPM in children with ID as it considers the degree of intellectual disability and severity of the language deficit, as well as engage attention and motivation while limiting distractions. Hence, this study supports the use of the puzzle form in clinical and educational research settings in place of the book form, as a better measure of reasoning ability in children with severe ID and in clinical settings for monitoring treatment progress, as a component of a battery of tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KB and NG created the puzzle form of the RCPM and carried out the testing of participants and collation of data and manuscript drafting.
