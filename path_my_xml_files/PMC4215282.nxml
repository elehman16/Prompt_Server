The primary endpoint was the cumulative number of new T1 gadolinium-enhanced (T1 Gd+) lesions per patient recorded every 4&#x02005;weeks from weeks 12 to 24 after study drug initiation. Secondary endpoints were the annualised confirmed relapse rate (ARR) and time to first confirmed relapse. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions at weeks 12&#x02013;24 was significantly lower in the ponesimod 10&#x02005;mg (3.5; rate ratio (RR) 0.57; p=0.0318), 20&#x02005;mg (1.1; RR 0.17; p&#x0003c;0.0001) and 40&#x02005;mg (1.4; RR 0.23; p&#x0003c;0.0001) groups compared with placebo (6.2). The mean ARR was lower with 40&#x02005;mg ponesimod versus placebo, with a maximum reduction of 52% (0.25 vs 0.53; p=0.0363). The time to first confirmed relapse was increased with ponesimod compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with &#x02265;1 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was similar across ponesimod groups and the placebo group. Frequently reported AEs with higher incidence in the three ponesimod groups compared with placebo were anxiety, dizziness, dyspnoea, increased alanine aminotransferase, influenza, insomnia and peripheral oedema.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Once-daily treatment with ponesimod 10, 20 or 40&#x02005;mg significantly reduced the number of new T1 Gd+ lesions and showed a beneficial effect on clinical endpoints.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Disease-modifying drugs for its treatment aim to reduce the relapse rate and slow the progression of disability. These include interferon &#x003b2;, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab and natalizumab. However, due to the complex interplay of efficacy and safety, the more efficacious therapies may be reserved for disease states sufficiently aggressive to justify the associated toxicity.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Furthermore, some available treatments, such as glatiramer acetate, require long-term self-injection by the patient, which may lead to a reduction in treatment adherence and, consequently, suboptimal efficacy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> New therapies should have improved safety and efficacy and reduce the burden on the patient. Hence, there has been a trend towards the development of oral therapies. Recently approved therapies include fingolimod, which modulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, including S1P<sub>1</sub>, S1P<sub>3</sub>, S1P<sub>4</sub> and S1P<sub>5</sub>; teriflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, and dimethyl fumarate, which were first approved in 2010, 2012 and 2013, respectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>Ponesimod [(Z,Z)-5-[3-chloro-4-((2R)-2,3-dihydroxy-propoxy)-benzylidene]-2-propylimino-3-o-tolyl-thiazolidin-4-one], an iminothiazolidinone derivative, is a reversible, orally active, selective S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor modulator.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Unlike fingolimod, which is a structural analogue of sphingosine, ponesimod is selective for S1P<sub>1</sub>; In vitro, ponesimod is at least 10-fold more potent on the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor than on any other S1P receptor subtype.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Lymphocyte exit from lymph nodes and their migration into the blood and target tissues is mediated by S1P binding to S1P<sub>1</sub> receptors. Binding of ponesimod to the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor results in rapid and efficient receptor internalisation, degradation and functional antagonism,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

Patients who completed treatment at week 24 were offered enrolment into an ongoing, long-term, dose-blinded extension study where all patients would receive ponesimod (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01093326). For those patients who prematurely discontinued study treatment or who completed 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment but chose not to enter the extension study, two safety follow-up visits were performed 7 and 30&#x02005;days after the last dose of study drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013307282F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>MRI scans were performed at baseline, every 4&#x02005;weeks from week 4 to 24 (end of treatment (EOT)) and at the second safety follow-up visit for patients not entering the extension study.

EDSS assessments were performed at screening, baseline, week 24, at follow-up visit 2 and at unscheduled visits in case of MS relapse by an independent neurologist not otherwise involved in patient care.

MRI scans from weeks 4 and 8 were excluded from analysis of the primary endpoint due to the delayed anti-inflammatory effects evident with the S1P modulator fingolimod.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, the primary endpoint was aligned with that of another agent (dimethyl fumarate) with delayed onset of anti-inflammatory effects in patients with RRMS.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Secondary efficacy endpoints were the annualised confirmed relapse rate (ARR) and time to first confirmed relapse within 24&#x02005;weeks of ponesimod initiation. Relapse was defined as the occurrence of an acute episode of one or more new symptoms or a worsening of existing symptoms of MS, not associated with fever or infection, and lasting for at least 24&#x02005;h after a stable period of at least 30&#x02005;days. A confirmed relapse was defined as a relapse with an increase of &#x02265;0.5 points from baseline in the EDSS score or an increase of one point in at least one functional system score (excluding bowel, bladder and mental functional systems) assessed within 7&#x02005;days of onset by the independent neurologist.</p><p>Exploratory efficacy MRI endpoints included cumulative number of new or enlarging non-enhancing T2 lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24; cumulative number of combined unique active lesions (CUALs; sum of all new T1 Gd+ lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions since previous MRI scan) at weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24; and percentage change from baseline to week 24 in brain volume as measured by MRI using the Structural Image Evaluation Using Normalisation of Atrophy (SIENA) program.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The global null hypothesis was that none of the three ponesimod groups differed from the placebo group in the mean cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions at weeks 12 to 24. The alternate hypothesis was that at least one of the ponesimod treatment groups differed from the placebo group. The test of the null hypothesis was based on a negative binomial regression model with treatment group as a four-level nominal covariate for the per-protocol analysis set. The null hypothesis was tested by a Wald &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with a two-sided significance level of 5%. No adjustment was applied for multiple comparisons.</p><p>The per-protocol analysis set was defined as all randomised patients who received &#x02265;80% of study drug from study drug initiation to the planned EOT and had &#x02265;2 valid post-baseline MRIs at weeks 12&#x02013;24.

To assess the precision of the model fitting, a bootstrap simulation was performed using 1000 iterations.</p><p>The cumulative number of new or enlarging non-enhancing T2 lesions at weeks 12&#x02013;24 and the cumulative number of CUALs at weeks 12 to 24 were analysed using the same statistical model and in the same patient analysis set as for the primary endpoint. The time to first confirmed relapse was analysed using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. The treatment effect versus placebo was described by HRs and the 95% CIs derived from a proportional hazards model. Total lymphocyte counts were summarised for the all-treated analysis set (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug); the absolute values and changes from baseline to scheduled visits and to EOT (last available value) were summarised by descriptive statistics. AEs and SAEs were reported and summarised throughout the treatment and safety follow-up periods for the all-treated analysis set.</p><p>The underlying assumption for the sample size calculation was a 50% decrease in the mean cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions from weeks 12 to 24 in at least one ponesimod treatment group compared with placebo and assuming a mean of eight lesions under placebo; the anticipated sample size of 90 evaluable patients per group had a 90% power to detect a significant difference between ponesimod groups and placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>Of the 621 patients screened, 464 were randomised between October 2009 and November 2010 to receive ponesimod 10, 20 or 40&#x02005;mg, or placebo.

There were no cases of total bilirubin elevation &#x02265;2&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN and no cases of Hy's law.</p><p>Four macular oedema cases were reported, all starting within 3&#x02005;months of treatment initiation. Two cases were reported as SAEs in the ponesimod 20&#x02005;mg group (only one confirmed by optical coherence tomography) and resolved after treatment discontinuation, while the third non-serious AE on 20&#x02005;mg resolved during study treatment. The fourth case (AE) of macular oedema was reported in the placebo group and resolved during study treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Once-daily treatment with ponesimod 10, 20 or 40&#x02005;mg for 24&#x02005;weeks significantly and dose-dependently reduced the cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions in patients with RRMS compared with placebo. These findings were corroborated by observed reductions in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions and the number of CUALs with ponesimod treatment compared with placebo. Treatment with ponesimod was also associated with a lower ARR and an increase in the time to first confirmed relapse. A clear dose&#x02013;response relationship was observed for the primary endpoint; a similar dose&#x02013;response relationship has also been reported for another S1P receptor modulator in development, siponimod.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although it is difficult to draw direct comparisons due to differences in study design, when compared with the phase II data from other available oral therapies for RRMS, ponesimod generally produced results that were of a similar magnitude. With regards to the primary endpoint of this study (the mean cumulative number of new T1 Gd+ lesions at weeks 12&#x02013;24), ponesimod was comparable with dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod and teriflunomide.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The magnitude of the treatment effect with ponesimod was also similar for other study endpoints, including ARR.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Ponesimod was generally well tolerated at doses of 10 and 20&#x02005;mg; the 40&#x02005;mg dose showed signs of reduced tolerability with no additional benefit with respect to MRI or pharmacodynamic efficacy compared with the 20&#x02005;mg dose. The reason for the lack of additional benefit with ponesimod 40&#x02005;mg compared with ponesimod 20&#x02005;mg is not entirely clear, although a lower mean T2 lesion volume at baseline as compared with other treatment groups may partly account for the fall-off in efficacy with regards to new or enlarging non-enhancing T2 lesions.</p><p>Ponesimod was associated with first-dose cardiac effects, similarly to other S1P receptor modulators such as fingolimod<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and siponimod<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>; with ponesimod, heart rate reduction reaches a maximum at 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;h after first dose and normalises approximately 6&#x02005;h postdose, earlier than observed with fingolimod therapy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The up-titration dosing scheme was used to reduce the first-dose cardiac effects.</p><p>Consistent with ponesimod mode of action, lymphocyte counts were rapidly reduced upon treatment initiation, with the maximum effect established within 7&#x02013;14&#x02005;days for each dose level. Importantly, no patients discontinued treatment due to lymphopenia, and the decrease in lymphocyte count was not associated with an increased risk of infections.</p><p>As shown in preclinical<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and phase I studies,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> ponesimod-associated lymphocyte sequestration was rapidly reversed upon treatment discontinuation, reaching levels close to baseline within 1&#x02005;week. By comparison, lymphocyte counts return to normal range within 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;months of stopping therapy with fingolimod.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The difference in lymphocyte recovery between the two compounds may be attributed to their pharmacokinetic profiles; while ponesimod has a terminal half-life of approximately 32&#x02005;h,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the terminal half-life of fingolimod is approximately 8&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although no documented cases have yet been reported to suggest that the long half-life of fingolimod has been problematic, rapid drug elimination and effect reversibility may be of clinical benefit in cases of serious infection, vaccination and pregnancy. Furthermore, fingolimod undergoes a phosphorylation&#x02013;dephosphorylation cycle in vivo, which is required for its activation/deactivation<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; this step is not required for ponesimod and may contribute to its low pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variability. Additionally, ponesimod is highly selective for the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> while fingolimod is active on the S1P<sub>1</sub> and S1P<sub>3&#x02013;5</sub> receptors.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The clinical significance of this selectivity is not yet clear. Concerns surrounding non-selectivity primarily revolve around safety, particularly with regards to cardiac effects. At least three S1P receptors (S1P<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>) are present in the heart and vasculature, and the predominantly expressed receptor subtype varies with cell type. Specific S1P receptor subtypes may also mediate specific cardiac effects, such as hypertension and bradycardia.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Notably, activation of the S1P<sub>3</sub> receptor results in bradycardia in both mice and humans.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Nevertheless, first-dose effects and decreased heart rate have been observed with ponesimod and fingolimod. Further investigation and long-term studies are needed to define the importance of receptor selectivity with regards to cardiac function. There are other effects arising from S1P receptor selectivity that deserve further investigation; evidence from in vitro studies suggests that fingolimod may have pro-fibrotic effects due to the stimulation of the S1P<sub>3</sub> receptor, an effect that is not replicated with ponesimod.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> On the other hand, modulation of S1P<sub>3</sub> and S1P<sub>5</sub>, in addition to S1P<sub>1</sub>, may enhance remyelination, which is critical in restoring electrical impulse conduction and preventing further degeneration or injury.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>The 24-week treatment duration of this study, although sufficient to establish the dose&#x02013;response effect on MRI parameters, limits the provision of long-term safety and clinical efficacy data. To consolidate the observations reported in this study, an extension study of up to 5&#x02005;years&#x02019; duration is ongoing. Further studies to confirm the efficacy and favourable benefit/risk profile of ponesimod for the treatment of patients with RRMS are under consideration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the independent Data Monitoring Committee (CH Polman, L Kappos, I Steiner, J Behr, C Pratt, D DeMets) and the Advisors (J Antel, E Waubant, H-P Hartung, F Lublin, P O'Connor).
