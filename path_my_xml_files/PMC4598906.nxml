The range of such a situation can vary from unstable angina to the most acute condition, i.e., acute myocardial infarction and irreversible necrosis of the myocardium.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] About 1 million people are involved every year in acute or recurrent coronary syndrome in the USA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Based on WHO estimation, about 23.6 million people will have died of cardiovascular diseases by the end of 2030.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] About 12 million people suffer from coronary artery diseases, of whom 600,000 die due to coronary arteri diseas. Despite the vast advancements concerning prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of cardiac patients, these diseases account for a high mortality.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] One of the interventions used in improvement of cardiovascular diseases is cardiac rehabilitation programs, about which there is a bulk of studies, especially on the effect of such programs across the world.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Cardiac rehabilitation is conducted through promotion and preservation of cardiovascular health through unique programs designed to improve patients&#x02019; physical, psychological, social, occupational, and emotional conditions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The goal of cardiac rehabilitation is speeding up the trend of secondary prevention and improvement of patients&#x02019; quality of life (QOL)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. QOL not only refers to individuals&#x02019; personal health status but also to their physical and mental conditions as well as psychological factors such as social and functional interactions and their level of independency.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Previous studies mostly measured the effect of rehabilitation programs on the physiological improvement and exercise tolerance, as well as modification of the risk factors.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] These studies revealed that cardiac rehabilitation activities have positive effects on mortality rate, physical health, socio-psychological function,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] levels of blood lipids, hypertension, dyspnea, weight loss, smoking, and level of stress.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In recent years, some studies have been conducted on the effect of rehabilitation programs on patients&#x02019; QOL. These studies are different concerning the type of intervention, length of intervention, study population, and subjects&#x02019; demographic characteristics and have shown controversial results.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Zwisler <italic>et al</italic>. showed an improvement in QOL after cardiac rehabilitation.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Shabani <italic>et al</italic>. also reported the positive effect of cardiac rehabilitation on patients&#x02019; QOL after coronary bypass or vascular reconstruction surgeries (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Failde and Soto, in a study conducted in Spain, showed a significant reduction in the QOL score 3 months after acute coronary syndrome incidence, in the domains of physical role, general health, and vitality.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Mohammadi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that cardiac rehabilitation did not lead to an improvement in QOL in the study group compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Bettecourt <italic>et al</italic>., in a study conducted in Portugal, showed that there was no significant change in QOL between rehabilitation and control groups.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Cieslik <italic>et al</italic>., in their study from Turkey, reported no significant difference in QOL between rehabilitation and control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] With regard to the existing shortage in knowledge and related research and the reported controversial results on the effect of cardiac rehabilitation on QOL, the researchers decided to design and conduct the present research. It is hoped that the obtained results can somehow modify the existing shortage of knowledge in this regard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This was a clinical trial conducted to investigate the effect of the independent variable of rehabilitation interventions on the dependent variable of QOL. The present research was a two-group (study and control) two-stage (before-after) prospective study, with subjects&#x02019; random allocation conducted between Oct 9 and Feb 17, 2013. The study population comprised 233 patients hospitalized in the CCUs of selected hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Shohada Lenjan Hospital), with diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Inclusion criteria were: having no history of: joint disease, cardiac surgery, uncontrolled hypertension, complete heart block, uncontrolled arrhythmias and thrombophlebitis. In case of loss of interest at any stage to remain in the study or a change occurring in any of the inclusion criteria, the subjects were excluded. Finally, the study was conducted on 50 patients who had been hospitalized with diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Convenient sampling was followed. Then, the subjects were randomly allocated to study and control groups by random numbers table. Data were collected through interviews, observation, and questioning and by use of patients&#x02019; medical files, demographic characteristics questionnaire, and QOL questionnaire (SF-36). The latter questionnaire contains two general sections of physical health and mental health. This questionnaire measures eight sub-scales including physical function index, physical role, emotional role, vitality, mental health, social function, pain, and general health status.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Cronbach alpha of this questionnaire was calculated between 0.71 and 0.93 in eight sub-scales in the study of Chan <italic>et al</italic>. conducted on acute coronary syndrome patients.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Cronbach alpha of the Persian version of this questionnaire was calculated between 0.70 and 0.85 in Asghari-Moghadam's study[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and its reliability was estimated between 0.77 and 0.9 in the study of Montazeri <italic>et al</italic>. After obtaining a written consent from all the subjects, demographic characteristics and QOL questionnaires were filled for the subjects in both groups by the researcher. Physical rehabilitation interventions in phases 1 and 2 were administered to the subjects in the study group. Conventional rehabilitation (phase 1) was administered for the subjects in the control group. To administer rehabilitation in phase 1, the rehabilitation program was conducted for five straight days under the researcher's and a cardiologist's supervision in the hospital. This program was designed based on the amount of permitted energy consumption measured by MET with regard to the number of hospitalization days. For instance, on the first day of hospitalization, the upmost permitted energy consumption was 1 MET, and then the patient remained in complete bed rest for 12 h. On the second and third days, the amount of permitted energy consumption was at the most 2 METs. Then, the patient was permitted to have activities up to an optimum of 3 METs until the fifth day, if there was no chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, and other signs.</p><p>After the end of the first phase (at the time of patients&#x02019; discharge), the rehabilitation program was administered in phase 2 for four straight weeks. As Shohada Lenjan Hospital lacks treadmill, barbell, stationary bicycle, and other professional rehabilitation devices, rehabilitation program in this phase was designed by simulation of rehabilitation activities according to the energy consumed based on MET, with the cooperation of a cardiologist, a CCU nurse, and one of the academic members in the nursing school teaching cardiology subject. For instance, the patient was educated about what activities he/she was permitted to do in the first week and how to increase his/her activities in the absence of no abnormal signs in the following week. The subjects were followed up through phone calls in the second and third weeks to monitor the trend of rehabilitation and to supervise the appropriateness of administration of the prescribed activities during the second phase. The subjects were asked to refer to the hospital in the first and the fourth weeks. At any time of their referral, the patient was visited by a cardiologist and an ECG was taken, and after taking the cardiologist's permission, the patient was asked to walk a certain distance in the hospital hall for a certain period of time. Immediately after, the patient underwent cardiac monitoring for 10 min concerning arrhythmia, chest pain, dyspnea, and other related signs. Patients&#x02019; BP and pulse were measured before and after intervention. In case of patients being in stable condition, the activities requiring more energy were prescribed for the patients. Through follow-up phone calls, the subjects were asked about their physician status and existing signs, and their questions in this regard were answered. Patients discussed their problems and were educated about appropriate activities based on their permitted and safe energy consumption. Therefore, in the present study, resuming the physical activities started from very light activities (1, 2, and 3 METs) and continued up to moderate level activities under the supervision of the related physician.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] If the patients did not feel any chest pain, fatigue, respiration distress, or abnormal changes in heart rhythm and rate while doing the activities, the severity of activities would be elevated to a higher level. Otherwise, it would be stopped with the permission of the physician. The subjects in the control group underwent conventional and routine rehabilitation of phase 1 in the hospital and received no further interventions in the following 4 weeks after their discharge. One month after intervention, the questionnaire of QOL was filled by the subjects in both groups.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>The study was approved by research committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. the study was explained verbally to patients and they also receive a written explanation. they were informed that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. it was emphasized that non of the informations would be identifiable and then informed consent was obtained.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The results showed that the subjects&#x02019; age ranged between 29 and 25 years.

In Isfahan, Iran, Mostafavi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that cardiac rehabilitation could improve patients&#x02019; QOL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Although Mostafavi's study was a retrospective, one-group study conducted on the medical files of 100 cardiac patients and was different from the present study, Attarbashi-Moghadam <italic>et al</italic>. and Abbasi <italic>et al</italic>. conducted their studies with a two-group design. These studies also reported an improvement of QOL after rehabilitation.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In the study of Attarbashi-Moghadam <italic>et al</italic>., an improvement was observed in all domains of SF-36 questionnaire (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005), although it was conducted on 44 patients and their QOL was measured after a coronary bypass surgery. Meanwhile, the present study was conducted on 50 patients who had not undergone coronary bypass surgery as these cases were excluded from the study. Abbasi <italic>et al</italic>., who investigated the effect of taking a walk on Chronic heart failure patients, reported an improvement in patients&#x02019; QOL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The questionnaire adopted in Abbasi's study was Minnesota, but their results are in line with those of the present study.</p><p>The study of Dugmore <italic>et al</italic>. showed that rehabilitation activities could have positive effects on QOL, well-being, and mental and psychological factors (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05),[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] although the QOL was also significantly increased in the control group. The difference between their results and those of the present study may be due to the difference in the study populations. In Dugmore's study, these were 122 male and 2 female subjects (subjects were mostly male). In addition, the length of monitoring was different. During 12 months, there might have been more adaptation with the disease condition in the control group, which might have resulted in improvement of QOL. Grace <italic>et al</italic>. found out that rehabilitation could lead to an increase in and improvement of QOL and anxiety (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). They also reported that rehabilitation could also improve signs of depression (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although anxiety and depression were not investigated in the present study, a significant improvement was observed in the dimensions of exhilaration, vitality, and mental health. Briffia compared QOL scores in the study and control groups after intervention and reported a significant difference just in physical function,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] which is consistent with the present study. Samartzis <italic>et al</italic>., in a meta-analysis study on 1074 patients in the study group and 1106 patients in the control group, reported that cardiac rehabilitation improved patients&#x02019; QOL through mental and psychological effects (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which is in line with the present study.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Pasqali <italic>et al</italic>. and Koertage <italic>et al</italic>. also reported positive effects of rehabilitation intervention on patients&#x02019; QOL in the study group compared to control.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the literature review and meta-analysis studies, it was found that cardiac rehabilitation resulted in a reduction in mortality rate and a significant increase in O2 consumption and QOL.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Chan <italic>et al</italic>., in a clinical trial conducted in Hong Kong, showed an improvement in subjects&#x02019; QOL, regardless of them being in either control or study group, although the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The reason for the difference in their results and those of the present study, especially in the control group, might have been the difference in the number of subjects and the length of monitoring (6 months) as well as a high number of subjects dropping out of the study.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In Portugal, Bettencourt <italic>et al</italic>. showed that cardiac rehabilitation had no significant effect on the domains of QOL (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), except on the dimensions of exhilaration and general health, possibly due to an equal distribution of the subjects into study and control groups (31 in study vs 95 in control group after subjects&#x02019; dropout).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The results of most of the above-mentioned studies are in line with those of the present study. It seems that administration of cardiac rehabilitation activities could lead to improvement of QOL in patients with acute coronary syndrome. As educating the nurses about cardiac rehabilitation and its administration in clinical setting does not impose high costs, their education in CCUs can result in improvement of patients&#x02019; QOL and their physical and mental health indexes. Patients&#x02019; education about the principles of rehabilitation and the gradual trend of resuming activities can improve their QOL and prevent complications which result from their inadequate knowledge and disobedience of doing appropriate activities in their recovery period after discharge. As such a study was conducted for the first time in Isfahan province in which cardiac patients have inadequate access to cardiac rehabilitation and as the study yielded positive results, cardiac rehabilitation is recommended to be administered in all provinces in Iran to move toward promotion of public health. In this way, frequent hospitalizations of patients and their imposed costs can be diminished.</p><p>The present study showed that cardiac rehabilitation could improve QOL of the patients with acute coronary syndrome, although rehabilitation activities need patients&#x02019; education and supervision on their rehabilitation activities. One of the limitations to the present study was patients&#x02019; personal differences that may have affected their QOL and were out of researchers&#x02019; control. Finally, the researchers suggest conducting such a study with a higher number of subjects and for a longer period of time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>This article was derived from a master thesis of Safoura Dorri with project number 392403, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.
