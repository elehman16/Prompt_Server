The primary outcome was mean change from baseline to week 20 in Pelli&#x02013;Robson CS. Secondary outcomes were mean change from baseline in best-corrected VA (BCVA), CRT, and National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty eyes (baseline VA &#x0003e;6/30) were evaluated. A median of 21.1&#x000b1;11.9 (range 5&#x02013;55) ranibizumab injections were administered prior to initiation of aflibercept. Mean CS improved from 1.40&#x000b1;0.14 log units at baseline to 1.46&#x000b1;0.15 log units at week 20 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). VA improved with mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA of 0.33&#x000b1;0.19 at baseline compared with logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA of 0.28&#x000b1;0.16 at week 20 (<italic>P</italic>=0.0016). Mean CRT decreased from 324&#x000b1;85 to 289&#x000b1;61 &#x000b5;m (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Twenty-two (55%) patients experienced an overall improvement in National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire score. Interestingly, an association was found between changes in CS and change in CRT (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.385, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and between changes in BCVA and change in CRT (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.092, <italic>P</italic>=0.032).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in patients with recalcitrant diabetic macular edema resulted in an improvement in all measured metrics, including CS, VA, and CRT. A majority of patients also indicated an improvement in vision-related quality of life. The finding of a stronger relationship between changes in CRT and CS compared with changes in CRT and BCVA suggests that the inclusion of CS as an endpoint may yield a more complete understanding of visual outcomes than that obtained by using VA alone.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>aflibercept</kwd><kwd>ranibizumab</kwd><kwd>diabetic macular edema</kwd><kwd>contrast sensitivity</kwd><kwd>visual acuity</kwd><kwd>anti-VEGF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global prevalence of diabetes (among adults aged 20&#x02013;79 years) is predicted to rise to 642,000,000 by 2,040, according to the latest data from the International Diabetes Federation.<xref rid="b1-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> One of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes is retinopathy, affecting 10% of diabetic patients.<xref rid="b2-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of visual impairment in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and has a significant impact on quality of life.<xref rid="b3-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The pathogenesis of DME is highly complex and not yet fully understood.

One possible explanation is that patients included in the study were those refractory to previous anti-VEGF therapy; this unique subset of &#x0201c;difficult-to-treat&#x0201d; patients may require longer treatment time to achieve optimal outcomes. The results could also be explained by the chronic nature and insidious development of diabetic complications. DR is caused by ongoing damage to the small blood vessels of the retina.<xref rid="b38-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Inner retinal alterations occurring in patients with DME may lead to visual deficiency persisting after treatment despite a favorable anatomic response.<xref rid="b39-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>When assessing the relationship between anatomic and visual function response to treatment, we observed a statistically significant relationship between a decrease in CRT and an improvement in CS; in comparison, a relatively weaker relationship between changes in CRT and BCVA was seen. This suggests that the inclusion of CS as a measurable endpoint of visual function may yield a more complete understanding of treatment outcomes than that obtained by using VA measurements alone. A similar study evaluating outcomes in patients with recalcitrant neovascular age-related macular degeneration switched to aflibercept from ranibizumab also used CS as the main visual outcome measure.<xref rid="b40-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The study demonstrated an association between improvement in CS and change in CRT, but no relationship between improvement in VA and change in CRT.<xref rid="b40-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>An increasing number of studies have indicated that VA often fails to predict the day-to-day visual problems faced by the patients.<xref rid="b41-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Although VA testing is helpful in identifying difficulties in seeing detail, much of our routine visual activity involves the detection and discrimination of larger objects in luminance.<xref rid="b41-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Many daily visual tasks such as reading, driving, and face recognition are highly dependent on CS, and CS has been shown to be a strong predictor of real-world performance, providing useful independent information in relation to one&#x02019;s visual function, which may not be revealed by VA.<xref rid="b21-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> For example, a patient with poor CS may be able to easily identify dark letters on a white VA chart. Failure to identify a patient with impaired CS may cause unrecognized and untreated visual problems effecting the patient&#x02019;s day-to-day life. Therefore, it is important to include CS as an additional measure to understand the full impact of vision impairment on everyday life. This may be of particular interest to patients with DME because of the close association between DR and CS: vision deterioration in DR is associated with damage to retinal ganglion cells, and responses delivered by ganglion cells to luminance and chromatic contrast are considered to be related to CS.<xref rid="b42-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="b43-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>We used the Pelli&#x02013;Robson chart to measure CS in the study; a tool that has been used by researchers for many years and is currently the most widely used method for clinical spatial CS testing.<xref rid="b30-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It has good test&#x02013;retest reliability and relative immunity from varying test conditions.<xref rid="b21-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The test is quick and can usually be completed in 3&#x02013;5 minutes; it is easily administered in a clinical setting, with a 6-letter change in CS equating to a 15-letter (or 3-line) change in VA.<xref rid="b21-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b44-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> It has been shown that Pelli&#x02013;Robson CS is moderately associated with VA, with several studies indicating that these correlation coefficients are ~0.5&#x02013;0.6.<xref rid="b21-opth-12-191" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Our study is important because it used CS change as the primary efficacy endpoint and the results support the use of CS as an independent parameter for determining treatment outcomes in future clinical studies in DME. The data presented here add to the existing knowledge that the evaluation of change in CS provides valuable additional information and should be considered in conjunction with VA measurement when assessing the effect of new treatment modalities. Furthermore, the study design did not include a washout period, which is not typically employed in clinical practice when considering a switch in pharmaceutical agents; therefore, our study closely mimics clinical practice patterns, offering insight into the impact of treatment change in a real-world setting.</p><p>We acknowledge some limitations of the study, which are as follows: lack of a control group, a relatively small sample size, and a short follow-up. Additionally, to investigate possible tachyphylaxis with anti-VEGF therapy, it would be of interest to have a 2-period crossover study design involving a re-switch from aflibercept back to ranibizumab.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Management of DME cases exhibiting suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy remains a clinical challenge. Our study provides further evidence of the benefit of switching to aflibercept in patients with recalcitrant DME who had been previously treated with ranibizumab. Converting to aflibercept from ranibizumab in these patients led to positive anatomic and visual function outcomes, resulting in statistically significant improvements in all measured metrics, including CS, VA, and CRT. The majority of patients also indicated an improvement in vision-related quality of life. Future studies involving larger patient populations and longer durations are needed to determine whether these results will be sustained or improve further.</p><p>The finding of a stronger relationship between changes in CRT and CS compared with changes in CRT and BCVA suggests that CS may be a clinically meaningful measure of treatment response and could have implications for present and future studies evaluating treatment patterns and novel drug therapies in DME and other retinal diseases. Assessing both VA and CS in clinical studies may provide a more complete picture of the effect of treatment on vision than either measure alone. Wider use of CS as an additional outcome endpoint would offer clinicians important information about the impact of treatment on patients&#x02019; overall visual functioning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank all the patients who participated in the study, the study team, and Zhizhi Fiske of Inspired Science, London, UK, who provided medical writing and editorial support.
