Elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with tissue damage and organ dysfunction. We hypothesized that local bladder trauma induced by a Foley catheter (FC) will result in mtDNA release, migration of neutrophils into the bladder lumen, and activation of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway leading to bladder tissue damage. We randomized 10 swine into two groups receiving uncoated, or chloroquine/N-Acetylcysteine (CQ/NAC)-coated FCs. Urine samples were analyzed for mtDNA activation of TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B as demonstrated by indicators of neutrophil adhesion, migration, and activation. We found that uncoated FCs resulted in a unique active neutrophil phenotype that correlated with bladder epithelial injury, neutrophilia, necrosis, mtDNA release, TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B activation, transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced respiratory burst. In our study we observed that the high levels of mtDNA and elevated TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B activity were ameliorated in the CQ/NAC-coated FC group. These findings suggest that post-migrated bladder luminal neutrophils are involved in local tissue damage and amelioration of the mtDNA/TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B inflammatory axis may represent a therapeutic target to prevent inflammation, and bladder tissue injury.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bladder catheterization is common during hospitalization and may acutely induce tissue damage evident by bladder irritation (cystitis), spasms, pain and urinary infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, all possible causes of delayed hospital discharge and increased medical costs. Although many studies have shown the impact of bladder uropathogens on local and systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the primary factors involved in early neutrophil activation in the absence of bacterial contamination are not completely elucidated and require a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms present during a sterile injury. We have previously shown that human and swine mucosal invasion by a foreign body induced mucosal inflammation and activation of the innate immune system resulting in neutrophil infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It is known that bladder instrumentation with a Foley catheter (FC) results in inflammation and neutrophil cell recruitment, thus promoting bacterial contamination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Neutrophil cells are essential for a proper innate immune response as they have the capacity to express multitude of surface and intracellular receptors to contain and destroy injurious sterile products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For instance, as neutrophils migrated through tissues they will express surface receptors indicative of epithelial/neutrophil interaction as seen by expression of ICAM-1 (CD54)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Neutrophils also have the capacity to release various pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to promote cellular responses, for instance tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukins (IL)-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, may impact several cellular activities ranging from delayed apoptosis to tissue and cell necrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Less is known about local neutrophil activity mediated by non-bacterial triggers of neutrophil activation in bladder injury.</p><p id="Par3">Neutrophils are first responders of the innate immune system against infectious and non&#x02013;infectious agents following detection by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which include the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. TLRs identify not only bacterial antigens but also host sterile intracellular molecules (damage associated molecular patterns, DAMPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> released during cellular injury, generating signals that induce inflammatory activity. The urinary system express several TLRs, such as TLR4, TLR5 and TLR11 on cells lining the urinary tract, were they contribute to the local immune defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. TLRs and in particular TLR9 can be activated by evolutionarily conserved pathogen&#x02013;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as unmethylated CpG DNA present in bacteria, or by oxidized mtDNA of non-bacterial origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. More recent work has demonstrated that oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released during eukaryotic cell injury induce neutrophil expression of TLR9, thus mediating neutrophil activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In particular, the effects of mtDNA/TLR9 signaling has been documented under sterile conditions, indicating that mtDNA is a TLR9 agonist that can activate downstream pro-inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. TLR9 is known to signal via MyD88-dependent pathway, which ultimately activates NF-&#x003ba;B gene transcription of as many as 400 genes with heterogeneous actions ranging from apoptosis, to inflammation and cell activity regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The importance of mtDNA on organ dysfunction has been illustrated in multiple reports linking sterile inflammation to cardiac dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, tracheal injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and other pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, recently we showed that mtDNA induced TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B mediated neutrophil activation that resulted in tracheal mucosal inflammation and pain (sore throat) in human subjects exposed to an endotracheal tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Neutrophil migration during bladder infection has been shown to correlate with bacterial load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, however, the role of necrotic cell products such as mtDNA on TLR9 and neutrophil activation during presence of a Foley catheter (FC) has not been elucidated.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we hypothesized that a sterile bladder injury induced by FC placement can initiate a local inflammatory response that promotes neutrophil migration predominantly dependent on TLR9 activation. Here we show in a swine model that FC placement results in loss of bladder mucosa integrity with subsequent neutrophil cell migration and activation mediated by necrosis, resulting in local mtDNA release, and TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B activation.

Mucosal tissues are exposed to a variety of bacterial and host-derived signals that require a well-organized neutrophilic response to preserve tissue homeostasis. However, uncontrolled neutrophilia in the bladder lumen implies disruption of the epithelial layer, and suggests trafficking of neutrophils towards a chemotactic gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The combination of tissue damage and neutrophil migration across epithelial layers is generally attributed to degranulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> of neutrophils and release of proteinases such as neutrophil elastase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, matrix metalloproteinases, and cathepsin G. These proteinases promote tissue invasion or protein degradation as determined by post-translational modification of proteins. As a result of migration across epithelial tissues, neutrophils may have enhanced activation and degranulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, thus increasing release of myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase leading to further cellular injury and necrosis. Necrotic cell death will release intracellular damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), in particular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MtDNA is a TLR9 ligand that is recognized and internalized by neutrophils using mechanisms that are not completely understood. Activation of TLR9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> promotes further inflammation by downstream engagement of NF-&#x003ba;B resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

However, it is possible that neutrophils are not the only source of DAMPs as epithelial cells may also play a role in bladder inflammation. This study demonstrates that placement of a Foley catheter results in bladder tissue injury within three hours of exposure, resulting in neutrophil migration and activation. Notably, neutrophil migration indicates disruption of the epithelial layer of the bladder and is generally associated with cellular degranulation and proteinase (e.g., neutrophil elastase) activity. As the neutrophils migrate through the epithelium, local surface proteins become activated as noticed here in which CD54 (ICAM-1), a protein expressed in the epithelium, likely imparted activity to neutrophil ICAM-1 and CD18. Evidence of neutrophil activation has also been reported in ischemic injury as determined by CD11b and CD54 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. For example, CD54 further amplifies inflammation by combining with other neutrophils and macrophages expressing CD11b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">As a result of sustained trauma to the bladder, further accumulation of neutrophils at different stages of activation takes place. For example, we documented the presence in the bladder lumen of an activated neutrophil phenotype characterized by high surface protein membrane expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD54, and CD62L, which is consistent with activation and migration of local neutrophils. We can speculate that the phenotype we regarded as not activated may have indeed been the first active neutrophil group and now are depleted of any obvious immune activity.</p><p id="Par24">Progressive activation and degranulation of neutrophils leads to amplification of local inflammation by releasing sustained levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neutrophil elastase, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. For instance, extracellular release of ROS and elastase indicates a process of degranulation since neutrophils contain azurophilic granules rich in these pro-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, elastase may also participate in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation where it serves several purposes including chromatin decondensation and acts in synergy with myeloperoxidase during immune responses. ROS are present during normal cellular activity, however persistent elevation as the one observed in our current study may have a negative impact on tissue homeostasis due to their ability to damage macromolecules (i.e., DNA, RNA, lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) in neighboring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, thus inducing bladder tissue injury.

We documented progressive elevation of mtDNA in urine specimens containing high numbers of neutrophils, and elevated ROS activity and elastase concentrations, indicating that these cells are likely releasing mtDNA during the process of necrosis. Interestingly, others have documented the presence of high systemic mtDNA in sterile injury that resulted in organ dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, whereas in our study we show similar mtDNA levels but localized in the bladder. More recent work has demonstrated that oxidized mtDNA released during eukaryotic cell injury induces neutrophil expression of TLR9, thus mediating neutrophil activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We also confirmed that the mtDNA concentration in the urine of uncoated Foley catheters was sufficient enough to upregulate TLR9 activity and induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation, as assessed in the HEK-Blue&#x02122; hTLR9 cell reporter line. It is also conceivable that mtDNA release is not exclusively originating from neutrophils, but also the epithelium.</p><p id="Par26">Neutrophils utilize Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to recognize pathogen (PAMPs) and damage (DAMPs) associated molecular patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Similarly, TLR4 activation has been demonstrated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) leading to NF-&#x003ba;B activation and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-8<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Impaired activity of TLR4 will result in urinary infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Our urine analysis of bacterial <italic>16S rRNA</italic> DNA showed nearly undetectable levels of bacterial contamination in both coated and uncoated urine specimens (data not shown), consistent with our observation that the leading inflammatory source of bladder injury in this case is mtDNA.

In this current study, during exposure to meaningful concentrations of mtDNA the percentage of necrotic cells in urine samples was high while the percentage of apoptotic cells was low suggesting that during the early stages of bladder injury apoptotic delays are not likely a predominant factor but rather necrosis appears to lead the initial injury.

This study showed that <italic>IL8</italic> gene transcription negatively correlated with <italic>IL10</italic> transcription in the coated FC group, a result that may have an effect on chemokine activity as IL-8 binds to CXCR1 and CXCR2, thus impacting degranulation and amplification of the inflammatory response. IL-8 levels were significantly lessened by exposure to coated Foley catheters. Furthermore, IL-1&#x003b2;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> has been implicated in inflammasome formation via caspase-1 activation as a result of the cytosolic release of mtDNA, suggesting that this mechanism may have a role in the pathophysiology of bladder inflammation. Several of the cytokines analyzed in the current study (i.e., IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;) have been implicated in pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, particularly during simultaneous elevation of neutrophil elastase. Interestingly, transcription of the anti-inflammatory gene <italic>IL10</italic> may not only participate in reducing inflammation but also in regeneration of epithelial tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> as seen during mast cell activation, and thus its role in the CQ/NAC-coated group may also play a role in protecting the epithelium from damage.</p><p id="Par29">Finally, confirmation of the beneficial impact of CQ/NAC was observed by histological evaluation indicating less tissue damage, better epithelial integrity and lower injury scores. Interestingly, the tissue cellularity appears to indicate that neutrophil migration into the lumen has occurred and cell counts in the tissues are at a transitional stage in preparation for a new influx of cells. Similarly, tissues from the CQ/NAC-coated FC group show marked reduction in TLR9 expression in the epithelium by immunohistochemical staining compared to the tissues from the uncoated FC group, indicating a protection from TLR9-mediated inflammation and damage. Thus, our study confirms the benefits of administration of chloroquine and N-acetylcysteine likely due to interference with endosomal activation of TLR9 and inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B, respectively.</p><p id="Par30">Some limitations of our study will be addressed in future studies and will include extending the study period to more than six hours to evaluate the full impact of epithelial damage in promotion of bacterial infiltration and seeding over a clinically relevant period of time. Further analysis of TLR9 interactions with other TLRs is also necessary, as TLR4/TLR9/CD14 interactions have not been analyzed in the context of bladder inflammation mediated by sterile factors.</p><p id="Par31">In summary, the findings of this study provide supporting evidence to explain the initial pathological events leading to bladder tissues damage during exposure to a Foley catheter and illustrate the importance of the proper activation of the innate immune system to control and prevent epithelial damage. Most studies focus on the impact of bacterial inflammation in tissue damage, neglecting early sterile inflammatory events as the ones presented in this study. A better understanding of the factors involved in sterile injury and the impact of early intervention to prevent cellular activation and tissue damage may have beneficial effects on clinical symptoms and outcomes regarding pain and recurrent infections.</p><p id="Par32">We demonstrated that cellular necrosis induced by a Foley catheter has a prominent role in releasing mtDNA, which in turn leads to activation of the TLR9/NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and induces pro-inflammatory marker, elastase, and ROS production and release, thus resulting in tissue damage. Our findings indicate that upstream interventions to prevent TLR9 activation at the endosome in combination with amelioration of NF-&#x003ba;B activity using CQ/NAC-coated FCs results in a short-term decrease in bladder tissue damage, thus preventing uncontrolled activation of neutrophils. A better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in bladder injury is necessary to devise new therapies, and our initial results indicate that amelioration of injury and bladder tissue preservation are a feasible goal to improve health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
