Duloxetine is clinically effective in major depressive disorder and several chronic pain states, including CLBP. The objective of this post hoc meta-analysis was to assess direct and indirect analgesic efficacy of duloxetine for patients with CLBP in previous clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Post hoc path analyses were conducted of 3 randomized, double-blind, clinical studies of patients receiving duloxetine or placebo for CLBP. The primary outcome measure for pain was the Brief Pain Inventory, average pain score. A secondary outcome measure, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, was used for depressive symptoms. The changes in score from baseline to endpoint were determined for each index. Path analyses were employed to calculate the proportion of analgesia that may be attributed to a direct effect of duloxetine on pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 851 patients (400 duloxetine and 451 placebo) were included in this analysis. Duloxetine significantly improved pain scores compared with placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). It also significantly improved depressive scores compared with placebo (<italic>p</italic>=0.015). Path analyses showed that 91.1% of the analgesic effect of duloxetine could be attributed to a direct analgesic effect, and 8.9% to its antidepressant effect. Similar results were obtained when data were evaluated at weeks 4 and 7, and when patients were randomized to subgroups based on baseline pain scores, baseline depressive symptoms scores, and gender.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Duloxetine significantly improved pain in patients with CLBP. Path analyses results suggest that duloxetine produced analgesia mainly through mechanisms directly impacting pain modulation rather than lifting depressive symptoms. This effect was consistent across all subgroups tested.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>duloxetine</kwd><kwd>direct analgesic effect</kwd><kwd>chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>post hoc path analysis</kwd><kwd>double-blind</kwd><kwd>placebo-controlled studies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a significant global public health concern, and the major cause of disability.<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> CLBP is a leading cause of physical disability in individuals aged &#x0003c;45 years.<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Japan, the point prevalence of CLBP ranges between 20% and 25%,<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the lifetime prevalence was found to be 83%, which is comparable to that of countries such as Canada, Germany, and Australia.<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>CLBP is highly disabling and is the leading cause of work days lost.<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition to its physical impact, various studies have found that individuals with CLBP also have significantly greater levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sleep impairment compared with matched controls without CLBP.<xref rid="b7-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For most (&#x0003e;90%) patients with anxiety disorders or substance abuse, the syndromes preceded the onset of CLBP, whereas for 46% of those with comorbid depressive symptoms, the depressive symptoms appeared after the onset of CLBP.<xref rid="b10-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There appears to be a reciprocal association between the development of depressive symptoms and back pain, as depression tends to exacerbate pain in CLBP patients, and increased pain is associated with greater risk of depression.<xref rid="b8-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The etiology of CLBP remains largely unknown, thereby presenting a challenge in optimizing treatment.<xref rid="b11-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although ~15% of cases may be attributed to a specific cause, such as osteoporotic fracture, neoplasm, or infection, 85% of CLBP cases are idiopathic, with no clear cause.<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Factors that are associated with back pain include obesity, arthritis, increase in age, poor posture, poor physical condition, and psychologic factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, and smoking, but these factors are not highly correlative and do not predict patients at risk of developing CLBP.<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Growing evidence indicates that CLBP, like many other chronic pain conditions, is largely driven by central sensitization, neuronal hyperactivity, and dysfunction of endogenous pain modulatory systems.<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In one recent study, it was shown that patients with CLBP had significantly decreased conditioned pain modulation compared to normal, healthy volunteers.<xref rid="b15-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Taken together, these studies indicate that dysfunctional pain modulation and enhanced excitability are at least partially responsible for the development and the persistence of chronic pain regardless of the underlying etiology.</p><p>Duloxetine, a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is believed to exert a direct analgesic effect through modulation of endogenous descending inhibitory pain modulatory systems.<xref rid="b19-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In addition to being effective in major depressive disorder (MDD), duloxetine has also been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of CLBP as well as other chronic pain conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis of the knee.

However, it is unknown whether duloxetine has an independent analgesic effect. That is the reason why path analysis was conducted in CLBP patients without MDD.

Improvement in pain is indicated by a reduction in the BPI score from the baseline BPI average score. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the BDI-II, which is a 21-item questionnaire completed by the patient in order to assess characteristics of depressive symptoms. The BDI-II consists of 21 questions that are each scored from 0 to 3.

These conditions are associated with dysfunction of endogenous pain modulation and associated with diminished conditioned pain modulation, and it is highly likely that duloxetine, by enhancing noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, engages descending pain modulatory systems, and may normalize this dysfunctional process.<xref rid="b28-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Path analyses showed that the majority of the pain reduction in pain scores can be attributed to a direct effect of duloxetine on pain, and only a small proportion due to a reduction of depressive symptoms. The direct effect on pain accounted for 91.1% of the total analgesic effect of duloxetine. A recent path analysis performed only with data from HMGY in Japan showed a similar result.<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In that study, a direct effect of 97.3% was shown for duloxetine in treating CLBP.<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Patients with CLBP treated with 60 mg/day of duloxetine had a significant, progressive improvement in pain scores relative to placebo-treated patients. It should also be noted that over time, the direct effect of duloxetine on pain symptoms diminished slightly and the indirect effect through antidepressant activity increased accordingly. This result is consistent with the observations made recently in patients with MDD and pain symptoms.<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In that study, the time-dependent change from a predominance of direct effect to indirect effect of duloxetine on pain symptoms was much more pronounced, since these patients also had MDD and improvement of associated depressive symptoms.<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Depression is a common comorbidity in chronic pain states, including CLBP.<xref rid="b10-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Severity of pain and its impact on functional impairment are associated with a greater risk of depression, and depression is associated with greater pain complaints, impairment, and poorer treatment outcomes.<xref rid="b9-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that alleviation of depressive symptoms could reduce pain symptoms as well. Path analyses recently showed that duloxetine has both a direct and an indirect analgesic effect in patients with MDD and symptoms of physical pain, showing that it is able to produce analgesia independent of an antidepressant effect.<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-1357" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> It is very likely that the analgesic effect of duloxetine occurs independently of its antidepressant effect in the present study. This likelihood is especially emphasized since patients with MDD were specifically excluded from the investigation.</p><p>In the present analysis, the BDI-II &#x02265;6 subgroup still had relatively low mean scores, of ~12, reflecting the fact that none of the included patients were diagnosed with depressive disorders. Consequently, it is not surprising that there was no significant difference in the direct effect of duloxetine between the 2 groups. Thus, the results of the path analyses, together with the disconnect between changes in depressive symptoms and pain symptoms, and the absence of patients with MDD all support that duloxetine has a direct effect on pain relief, independent of its antidepressant activity.</p><p>Parsing subgroups based on baseline BPI scores, BDI-II scores, and gender did not appear to lead to any substantial changes in the percentage of analgesia attributed to the direct effect of duloxetine. Patients with a higher baseline BPI score (ie, &#x02265;6) showed a markedly greater reduction in BPI than did those with lower baseline pain scores. This observation is consistent with a greater range over which duloxetine could exert an analgesic effect. The same group, however, showed less reduction in depressive symptoms, underscoring a possible lack of association between pain relief and antidepressive activity. Baseline depressive scores did not appear to affect the analgesic effect of duloxetine, as both groups showed an approximately similar degree of analgesia. Patients with high baseline BDI-II scores showed marked reduction in these scores with duloxetine, underscoring its antidepressant activity. This group showed the lowest attribution (%) of direct effects to duloxetine, and a somewhat higher indirect effect relative to all of the other subgroups, which is also consistent with the antidepressant effect of duloxetine. Males and females showed similar levels of pain relief and of the direct effect (%) on analgesia, although female patients appeared to show a somewhat greater level of antidepressant activity as well.</p><p>The results of this investigation strongly suggest that a substantial part of pain relief due to duloxetine is largely due to a direct effect. This is consistent with duloxetine&#x02019;s ability to enhance endogenous pain modulatory systems, which is an effect independent of its antidepressant activity.</p><p>A limitation of the present investigation is that the path analysis was based on a hypothesis that a factor that induces pain relief is the antidepressive effect of duloxetine. Even though the depressive symptom is one of the emotional components, the present study focused on the correlations between pain and depressive symptoms. Another limitation is that the present investigation is limited to patients with low depressive symptoms. Patients with MDD were excluded.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Noelle Gasco, full-time employee of inVentiv Health Clinical, LLC, for editorial support.
