This is possible only with the use of growth factors, extracellular matrix, and the use of bone morphogenetic proteins instead of routinely used synthetic bone grafts,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] because synthetic bone grafts induce regeneration by osteoconduction, whereas, these biological modulators induce regeneration by osteoinduction.</p><p>The need for these biological modulators resulted in the development of Platelet-Rich Plasma [PRP] by Whitmen <italic>et al</italic>., in 1997.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Platelet-Rich Plasma is the component of blood with concentrated platelets in a limited volume of plasma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] This autologous plasma is a rich source of growth factors and its application is thought to be an effective way of inducing tissue repair and regeneration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Marx <italic>et al</italic>., in 1998, reported the first clinical dental results with PRP and they suggested that adding PRP to bone grafts accelerated the rate and degree of bone formation. Platelet membranes had been shown to stimulate the mitogenic activity of human trabecular bone cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The proliferation rate of human osteoblast-like cells was increased, up to a certain level, by adding thrombocytes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have indicated the stimulator influence of PRP in collagen biosynthesis and proliferation of osteoblastic cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] These <italic>in vitro</italic> results have supported the current assumption that the clinical use of PRP might enhance bone regeneration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The aim of this <italic>in vivo</italic> study was to evaluate the bone regeneration in endodontically induced periapical lesions using Hydroxyapatite, Platelet-rich plasma, and a combination of both, for a period of one year.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Clearance from ethical committee was obtained for performing this <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Twenty systemically healthy patients of both genders, between the ages 20 and 40 years, were included. The procedure was explained to the patients in their own language and informed consent was obtained from them. To qualify, the patient had to have a tooth where non-surgical root canal therapy had failed, periapical radiolucency was present, and periapical root-end surgery was required. The bony defect had to be confined to the apical area with the bone covering the entire root surface coronally and had an intact lingual cortical plate. The patients were randomly divided into four groups of five patients each: Group I &#x02014; Replacement with Hydroxyapatite (Periobone G, Top notch health care product, India. Batch No: PB01040006), Group II &#x02014; Replacement with PRP, Group III &#x02014; Replacement with PRP and Hydroxyapatite, and Group IV &#x02014; Control group with no substitutes.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Procedure for procuring PRP by manual isolation technique[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</title><p>Ten milliliters of venous blood was drawn from the patient and transferred into two test tubes containing Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant. The blood was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. The blood and plasma formed two layers; the supernatent being plasma. The plasma was then aspirated with a micropipette and transferred to a sterile test tube without an anticoagulant. The samples of plasma were subjected to a second centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes, which allowed the precipitation of the platelets (0.8 to 1.2 ml) to fall onto the bottom, while the surface Platelet Poor Plasma was discarded using a micropipette. The PRP was transferred to a dappen dish and stored at room temperature until further use. Just before placing the PRP into the bony cavity, a small amount of bovine thrombin (DADE BEHRING Test Thrombin Reagent, Germany) and a few drops of 10% Calcium Chloride [obtained by mixing 1 g of calcium chloride in 10 ml of distilled water] were added to the PRP to form a gel in a few seconds [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. This preparation of the PRP gel was conducted by another operator during the surgical procedure.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Platelet-Rich plasma gel</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-14-140-g001"/></fig><p>The first step of the treatment plan was to complete the root canal therapy in cases where dry canals existed and in others obturation was done on the day of surgery. The surgical protocol included a routine medical history followed by blood investigations. The surgical procedure included reflection of a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap by sulcular incision and two relieving vertical incisions. Debridement of tissues at the defect site was followed by irrigation with sterile saline solution. Root planing was performed on the root surface under the apical portion of the root. No root resection was done. For Group I patients, the Hydroxyapatite crystals were mixed with the patients&#x02019; own blood and thoroughly compacted into the bony defect until it reached the level of the periphery of the bone margins. Care was taken not to spill the graft. For Group II patients, the PRP gel was carefully placed into the cavity till the entire cavity was filled [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. For Group III patients, the bottom of the defect was filled with PRP. Then Hydroxyapatite crystals were mixed with the remaining PRP and were packed into the defect as a second layer. For Group IV patients, the defect was not replaced with any substitutes.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Bony cavity filled with Platelet-Rich plasma gel</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-14-140-g002"/></fig><p>Wound closure was obtained with a 3-0 black silk suture. Analgesics (Combiflam [Aristo] {ibuprofen 400 mg + paracetamol 325 mg} twice a day), Antibiotics (Amoxycillin 500 mg [Alembic pharma] twice a day) and 0.2% Chlorhexidine mouthwash (hexidine, ICPA Health products), was prescribed for five days post surgically. The sutures were removed after seven days. The patients were reviewed at regular intervals of one week, and one, three, six, nine, and twelve months. During the review, radiographs were taken using the paralleling cone technique (RWT Rontgenfilmhalter mit Langtubus, KKD, D-7090 Ellwangen). These follow-up visits included routine intraoral examinations and professional plaque control. All these cases were evaluated clinically and radiographically.

The success of an endodontic procedure depends upon complete healing of the lost periapical tissues. Most periradicular lesions heal uneventfully after conventional endodontic treatment. However, some may require surgical intervention to remove the pathological tissue and simultaneously eliminate the source of irritation that could not be removed by the orthograde root canal treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Bone regeneration after surgical intervention takes place in a very slow manner. Hence, to enhance these processes a number of bone substitutes are being tried out. The objective of using a bone graft is to achieve successful and complete healing of the bone. Bone grafting is the most common form of regeneration therapy. A variety of materials are available for bone regeneration, which are highly osteoconductive or osteoinductive like, freeze dried bone graft, bioactive glass, emdogain, PTR polymer, MTA, tricalcium phosphate, and octacalcium phosphate .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Blood and blood products have been used for over a century for various purposes, including the use of serum and individual components. Since the early twentieth century, various functions of platelets have been known, such as, hemostasis and platelet-plug formation. Research regarding the active use of growth factors present within the platelets started in the middle of twentieth century. These studies began to explore the fact that platelets could be used to modulate regeneration, and to repair and heal the tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>In 1997, Whitman <italic>et al</italic>., introduced PRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In 1998, Marx <italic>et al</italic>., showed PRP as an autologous source of Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-b (TGF) that was obtained by sequestering and concentrating platelets by gradient density centrifugation. This method showed a 338% increase in platelet concentration. PRP increased the density of bone when placed along with the bone grafts.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Platelet gel was prepared by blood collection preoperatively, and was prepared by another operator during surgery.</p><p>Platelet rich plasma contain various growth factors namely PDGF, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;, insulin-like growth factor, and epidermal growth factor. These factors play a prime role in bone regeneration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The various advantages of PRP are:</p><p>

</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is used, as it helps in osteoconduction. Osteoconduction is a process wherein the bone is formed by the in-growth of capillaries and osteoprogenitor cells from the recipient bed into, around, and through a graft. These Hydroxyapatite crystals when used act as a scaffold upon which new bone is deposited, which is then followed by a slow resorption of the graft. PRP is used, as it helps in better healing and faster regeneration, because of the biological modulators and also helps in osteoinduction. PRP acts as an osteoinductive material because osteoinduction is a process whereby new bone is produced in an area where there was no bone earlier, where one tissue or its derivative causes another undifferentiated tissue to differentiate into a new bone. Calcium Chloride is added to nullify the effect of the anticoagulant EDTA, and Bovine thrombin is added to gellate the plasma. As only small grains of thrombin are added, it does not produce any antigenic response, as proved by Neil Winter Bottom <italic>et al</italic>., in the year 2002. A number of methods have been used for the procurement of PRP, such as:</p><p>

</p><p>The method used in this study to procure PRP and PRP Gel was based on the test-tube or Manual isolation techniques (vacutainer system) by Sonnenleit and Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Evaluations of all these cases were carried out both clinically and radiographically. Radiographic evaluation in Group I (Periobone G) showed increased radio-opacity immediately, due to the compaction of the bone graft into the defect. In the first month there was reduction in volume of the material due to initiation of resorption of the bone graft. In the third month there was diffuse radio-opacity due to increased calcification of the graft. In the sixth and ninth months, bone regeneration was seen, but not complete, due to partial resorption of the graft. In the first year there was complete bone regeneration due to osteoconduction as explained earlier. In Group II (PRP) the immediate, first week and first month postoperative radiographs showed a radiolucency similar to that of the preoperative radiograph, as PRP was a radiolucent material. In the third and sixth months bone regeneration was evident, but not complete, due to the presence of biological modulators as discussed earlier. In the ninth month bone regeneration was complete. In Group III (PRP and Periobone G) there was an increase in radio-opacity immediately, due to the compaction of the bone graft into the defect. In the first month there was reduction in volume of the material due to initiation of resorption of the bone graft. In the third month there was evidence of bone regeneration, but not complete, due to partial resorption of the graft. In the sixth month bone regeneration was complete because of the combined effect of Periobone G and PRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In Group IV (Control) there was incomplete bone regeneration, even at the one-year follow-up, due to nonavailability of bone substitutes to induce osteoconduction.</p><p>In this study the grafts did not produce any adverse reactions. Wound healing and primary closure of the surgical site were good. Radiographic evaluation revealed favorable results.</p><p>Today's understanding of the bone science recognizes the pivotal role of the growth factor in the clinical bone grafting success. This study elucidates the mechanism of action and the points of influence that the fundamental growth factors of PDGF and TGF-&#x003b2; exert on bone regeneration. The amplification of PDGF and TGF-&#x003b2; through the technique of platelet sequestration and concentration into PRP is seen as an available and practical tool for enhancing the rate of bone formation and the final quality of the bone formed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Under the conditions of this <italic>in vivo</italic> study, it can be concluded that:</p><p>
