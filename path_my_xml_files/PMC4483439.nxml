physiological reflex mechanisms through submaximal contraction of agonists which activate
Golgi organ, promoting the relaxation reflex. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation alone and with prior application of
cryotherapy and thermotherapy on hamstring stretching. [Subjects and Methods] The sample
comprised of 32 young subjects with hamstring retraction of the right limb. The subjects
were randomly allocated to four groups: the control, flexibility PNF, flexibility PNF
associated with cryotherapy, flexibility PNF in association with ultrasound therapy.
[Results] After 12 stretching sessions, experimental groups showed significant
improvements compared to the control group. Moreover, we did not find any significant
differences among the experimental groups indicating PNF stretching alone elicits similar
results to PNF stretching with prior administration of cryotherapy or thermotherapy.
[Conclusion] PNF without other therapy may be a more practical and less expensive choice
for clinical care.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Thermotherapy</kwd><kwd>Cryotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Flexibility is free movement, without impediment and within the physiological limit of each
joint. Reduced flexibility results in muscular retraction<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> which limits range of
motion (ROM), and is frequently caused by a periarticular soft tissue adaptation. Other
factors that may cause muscular retraction include prolonged immobility and limited mobility
caused by various diseases that affect the skeletal, nervous, muscular and articular
systems. Regardless of cause, muscular retraction will cause functional limitations in
performance of various daily activites<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises for increasing flexibility are used in physical therapy for the treatment of
muscular retraction and to prevent greater functional losses<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises provide various benefits through pain relief and
reduce the risk of injuries. Among them, the most used are ballistic/dynamic and static
stretching and through proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several reflex physiological mechanisms, such as reflex relaxation,
which is promoted by activating the Golgi organ during contractions of the agonist, are
involved in PNF stretching. The contract-relax technique is a PNF modality which requires
the submaximal isometric contraction of the muscle after it has been for being stretched for
a certain length of time. Afterwards, the segment is passively moved to the limit point of
the subject&#x02019;s stretching sensation the point at which some discomfort<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> is reported. When
applied correctly, this technique provokes reflex relaxation, facilitating passive
stretching and improving ROM<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Flexibility training is often used in clinical and sporting practice and the demand for
physical resources for potentializing their effects has become increasingly frequent.
Various studies have examined the efficacy of thermotherapy modalities for the enhancement
of flexibility exercises<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cryotherapy decreases nervous conduction velocity and
consequently, pain and muscle spindle discharge. It is a modality widely used in clinical
practice. Applying ice prior to stretching optimizes improvements in flexibility, since the
muscle reflex response and pain are considered the main barriers to stretching
maneuvers<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to subject&#x02019;s increasing tolerance to stretching maneuvers, the
prior use of cryotherapy requires attention in the act of stretching so as not to exceed a
patient&#x02019;s physiological limits<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thermotherapy is another modality that has been extensively investigated as a factor
enhancing the results of the stretching, since it effectively changes conjunctive tissues
viscoelastic properties<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various studies have attempted to establish the effects of thermotherapy combined with
stretching, but most of them have sought to elucidate the effects of thermotherapeutic
modalities associated with static stretching<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and few have evaluated their association
with PNF stretching. Accordingly, the aim study was to evaluate the effects on hamstring
flexibility of PNF stretching using the variant contract-relax with prior application of
cryotherapy or thermotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at the School Clinic of the Federal University of Piau&#x000ed; and
included healthy subjects who were recruited through notices placed on bulletin boards. The
sample comprised 32 volunteers (men and women), aged 20 to 25&#x02005;years old (mean 22.4), all
healthy (according previous anamnesis), right-handed, and sedentary, who had body mass
indexes within the normal rang, and showed knee extension less than or equal to 155&#x000b0;.
Subjects with muscle injury of the lower limbs, fractures, inflammatory or infectious
diseases, or hypersensitivity to ice or heat application were excluded. All the volunteers
were informed about the procedures and signed an informed consent form. This study was a
randomized and prospective clinical trial, which was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the State University of Piaui &#x02212; UESPI with n&#x000b0; 188.420.</p><p>The subjects were instructed to not practice physical exercises during the intervention
period, so as not to influence the results. Twelve experimental sessions, three each week,
were performed and the results of the popliteal angle range of extension, measured by
goniometry and Wells&#x02019; bench test evaluated before and after the first and last sessions were
compared. During right knee popliteal angle measurement, the subjects lay supine on a gurney
and the examined leg was positioned to produce hip flexion of 90&#x000b0;, with the contralateral
leg resting on a wedge of foam that kept hip flexion and the knee at 90&#x000b0; to stabilize the
lumbo pelvic region. Then, the examiner requested the subject to perform an active knee
extension. In order to measure the popliteal angle, a goniometer was positioned on the
lateral condyle, with the fixed arm oriented to the greater trochanter and the movable arm
parallel to the leg.</p><p>The measures were performed three consecutive times and the arithmetic mean was calculated.
After active knee extension angle evaluation, the subjects were instructed to sit facing the
Wells&#x02019; bench, placing their feet flat on the box bench base with their knees extended. They
then raised their upper limbs with overlapping hands, moving both forward through trunk
flexion, to reach the greatest possible distance on the ruler without bending their knees
and without performing additional movements. So as to minimize execution errors the
evaluator remained beside the subjects, to ensure their knees were extended. The movement
was performed three times, and the best result, the furthest distance that a subject could
reach on the scale with tips of the fingers was recorded<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The subjects were randomly allocated four groups of 8 subjects each: the control, PNF
flexibility (PNF), PNF flexibility with cryotherapy (PNFCRYO), and PNF flexibility with
ultrasound thermotherapy (PNFUS) groups. The control group received an initial and final
evaluation but did not receive any type of intervention. The PNF group was subjected to
hamstring stretching PNF through the contact-relax technique. They performed a submaximal
isometric muscle contraction for about five seconds, followed by relaxation. Then, this
segment was passively moved to the pain-limiting point of each subject&#x02019;s stretching range
and maintained in this position for 30 seconds. In each experimental session, a series of
four repetitions of this type of stretching was performed with 10-second intervals between
them. This protocol was performed three times a week, for four weeks<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The PNFCRYO group was subjected to the same protocol as the PNF flexibility group, but with
the prior application of cryotherapy. Ice packages with a temperature 0&#x000b0; to 5&#x000b0; degrees were
wrapped in a damp cloth and placed for during 20 minutes on the belly of the hamstring. The
PNFUS group performed PNF stretching immediately after receiving ultrasound heat treatment
for the muscle belly, at a frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz in continuous mode with an intensity of
1&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> for five minutes. Water-based gel was used as the coupling for the
ultrasound head with the treatment area, as well as for the propagation of sound waves. The
ultrasound had an effective radiation area of 5&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> and was moved in a circular
pattern at about 4&#x02005;cm/s to prevent the formation of standing waves which are responsible for
excessive local heating.</p><p>The data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS 19.0. In all analyses, values of
p &#x02264; 0.05 were considered significant. The homogeneity of the sample was tested using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results of the Wells&#x02019; bench test and goniometry were evaluated

technique for the hamstrings and to compare it with prior application of cryotherapy or
thermotherapy. Studies of exercises and methods that improve flexibility are common in the
literature. Flexibility training methods (static stretching, dynamic and PNF) are used to
improve range of motion, and heat or cold are sometimes used to enhance effect. After 12
treatment sessions the hamstrings stretching protocol, elicited flexibility gains in all
groups and the results show that the prior use of cryotherapy or thermotherapy did not
enhance the effect of the flexibility training.</p><p>To investigate the effects of stretching modalities on ROM, muscle activation and balance,
a study employed static stretching, PNF stretching and no stretching for 48 adult males with
hamstring muscle tightness who were randomly divided into three groups. The stretching
modalities were performed once for the hamstring, and active knee extension angle, muscle
activation during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC), and static balance were
measured before and after the application of each stretching modality. Both modalities were
successful at increasing the knee extension angle compared to the control group, but there
were no significant differences in MVC or static balance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, ROM improved after hamstring stretching PNF
using the contact-relax technique. Moreover, exercise programs using PNF techniques are
known to be effective at improving the function of myofascial pain syndrome patients<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our sample, the subjects were healthy,
and although they showed limited extension of the knee, they did not have pain. It is useful
to note that PNF stretching could be effective at decreasing pain.</p><p>Comparing the static stretching alone and with cryotherapy, Busarello et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, verified that cryotherapy minimizes
discomfort during flexibility training enabling increase of the movement range. The 20
subjects analyzed were 18&#x02013;25 years old and received ice packages on the hamstring for 15
minutes, followed by static stretching in two series of 30 seconds. Significant differences
were found in hamstring extensibility in both groups; however, the use of cryotherapy did
not effectively increase extensibility. In the present study, cryotherapy elicited results
similar to the group that did not use cryotherapy prior to flexibility training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study corroborate the findings of Mallmann et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, who demonstrated a significant gain in
hamstring flexibility in a PNF group. They evaluated and compared the immediate and acute
effects of three stretching protocols (static, passive stretching, and PNF) for the
hamstring and paraspinal muscles, with stretching 32s. Wells&#x02019; bench results indicated that
there were significant differences in all experimental groups between the first and second
evaluations. However, they found no significant difference when they compared the protocols,
both in the Wells&#x02019; bench test and the goniometry results. Similarly, the present study
compared the pre- and post-intervention results of the PNF, PNFUS and PNFCRYO groups and
found there were no significant differences among them.</p><p>Knight et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> compared stretching
using superficial heat, profound/deep heat, or active heating to increase the plantar
flexors&#x02019; extensibility in an intervention of six weeks. A hot water bag was used for
superficial heating, continuous ultrasound with a frequency 1&#x02005;MHz for 7 minutes, for
profound/deep heat, and exercise to stay on the toes for active heating. Continuous
ultrasound was the most effective modality for improving dorsiflexion ROM. This result
contrasts with our present results, which show that there was no greater effect of
flexibility training when it was combined with ultrasound thermotherapy. However, this study
used only five minutes ultrasound therapy before PNF stretching, unlike the study of Knight
et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> which used 7 minutes.</p><p>In the study of Funk et al.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, the
subjects were divided into two groups. One performed only static stretching, and the other
used only a hot water bag for 20 minutes. The group that used the hot water bag showed a
flexibility gain that was greater than that of the static stretching group. This result
differs from results of the present study, in which the group that performed PNF stretching
technique with ultrasound therapy demonstrated results similar to the PNF group. Burke et
al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> evaluated and compared increase
in ROM of hip flexion after static stretching with prior heating or cooling. They reported
that there was no statistical difference in movement range gain between the groups. These
results are in agreement with our present results that show there was no significant
improvement with the use of thermotherapy.</p><p>In one of his studies Draper et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>
evaluated flexibility gain hamstring in three different groups: control, short wave
diathermy plus stretching, and short wave diathermy placebo plus stretching. They selected
30 students with inability to maintain movement amplitude of 160&#x000b0; knee extension at 90&#x000b0; of
hip flexion and the goniometric measures made before and after each experimental session
during five days. The diathermy plus stretching group received 10 minutes diathermy (distal
hamstrings), followed by 5 minutes of simultaneous diathermy and stretching, and finally
5&#x02005;min of only stretching. The placebo diathermy and stretching group followed the same
protocol, but with the diathermy unit off. Draper et al. concluded that short wave diathermy
with stretching improved hamstring flexibility, differing from the results of the present
study, in which the results of the PNFUS group did not significantly differ from those of
the group that performed only PNF. A possible explanation for this difference is that short
wave diathermy affects a larger operational area than the ultrasound used in the present
study.</p><p>Russo et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed and compared
active flexibility training <italic>versus</italic> active stretching with therapeutic
ultrasound in 51 male volunteers, young adults and not physically active. Using goniometry
they evaluated the flexibility before and after treatment and reported that in the
intragroup comparison, all groups showed improved hamstring flexibility, but in the
comparison of groups, only the active stretching group showed a significant ROM gain in knee
extension. These results agree with those of both the intra- and inter-group comparisons of
the present study. They show increased movement range; however, the studies differ, because
our study there was no preponderance of one group over another, but an opportunity to choose
the effective therapy considering time spent and benefits achieved.</p><p>The effects of therapeutic ultrasound on ROM and stretch pain and the relationships between
the effects were analyzed in a study conducted with 15 healthy males. The subjects received
three interventions: ultrasound (US group), sham ultrasound without power (placebo group),
and rest (control group). Ultrasound was applied for 10 minutes at 3&#x02005;MHz with an intensity
of 1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> and a 100% duty cycle on the upper fibers of the right trapezius
muscle. The evaluation indices were active and passive ROM, stretch pain (visual analog
scale; VAS), and skin surface temperature (SST). The results showed there were significant
increases in ROM and SST after ultrasound, without any change in stretch pain<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, we opted to use ultrasound
at 1&#x02005;MHz due to its depth of action and the localization of the target muscle.</p><p>Analyzing the data presented, we conclude that all experimental groups showed greater
increases in flexibility and better ROM than the control group. Moreover, the use of the PNF
technique alone elicited results similar to the other techniques of profound/deep heat
provided by continuous ultrasound, and cryotherapy. Among the interventions investigated in
this study, PNF stretching seems to be more appropriate for clinical practice since it
depends only on the technical skill of the therapist, and does not require equipment for
electro-thermotherapy, as well as being faster and less burdensome to execute.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>GN</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewek</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Aging skeletal muscle: physiologic changes and the effects
