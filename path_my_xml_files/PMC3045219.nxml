                    Biobrane for the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burns using the
                    patient as his or her own control. Primary outcome measures included length of
                    hospital inpatient stay and patient-reported perception of pain. Secondary
                    outcome measures included time to healing, clinical outcome of burn sites
                    (scarring) and a comparison of cost of care for patients treated with AWBAT-S
                    versus Biobrane.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Superficial partial-thickness burns involve damage to the epidermis and superficial
                dermis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> The destroyed tissue typically
            blisters and sloughs off leaving an open and exuding dermis with nerve endings exposed.
            They thus represent one of the most painful of the several categories of thermal
            injuries. Historically, conservative treatment consisted of removing nonviable tissue on
            the ward (the aggressiveness dictated by pain), daily bathing or showering with friction
            washing of burn wounds and applying new dressings with topical medications 1 to 2 times
            a day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>
            These procedures cause severe pain and anxiety in patients, even with the use of opiate
            analgesics. The management of these injuries at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH)
            involves aggressive cleaning under general anaesthetic immediately, or within 24 hours,
            after the burn injury and arrival at hospital, followed by the application of a
            biosynthetic epithelial replacement (Biobrane, Dow Hickam/Bertek Pharmaceuticals Inc,
            Sugarland, Texas; distributed by Smith &#x00026; Nephew Medical Ltd, Hull, UK).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref> This has been performed with great success in more
            than 1000 cases over 9 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></p><p>The application and subsequent firm adherence of Biobrane, a partly occlusive dressing,
            allows reepithelialization to occur underneath and eliminates the need for daily bathing
            and frequent dressing changes. Although several skin substitutes are available
            commercially, Biobrane (a biosynthetic wound dressing constructed of a silicone film
            with a nylon fabric partially embedded into the film) presents to the wound bed a
            complex 3-dimensional structure of trifilament thread to which collagen has been
            chemically bound. Serum exudate clots in the nylon matrix (most likely because of
            conversion of exudate fibrinogen to fibrin after exposure to the porcine type 1 collagen
            peptides), thereby firmly adhering the dressing to the wound until epithelialization
            occurs. It has been effective in the treatment of partial-thickness burns since
                1982.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><sup>-</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></p><p>A more recent product, AWBAT-S (Advanced Wound Bioengineered Alternative Tissue &#x02013;
            Superficial, Aubrey Inc Carlsbad, California), which is comparable in cost to Biobrane,
            has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration and is commercially available.
            Although similar in many ways to Biobrane, there are some dissimilarities. Both
            materials have a thin medical-grade silicone membrane (0.001-in thick), which controls
            water vapor transfer and maintains a moist healing environment. Both have a fine woven
            nylon fabric (15/3 denier&#x02014;Biobrane and 15/2 denier&#x02014;AWBAT), which gives the
            skin substitute its strength, elasticity and ability to be surgically secured. Both have
            pores in the silicone membrane to enable excess fluid/exudate to escape the wound
            surface through the skin substitute into a sterile outer dressing. This minimization of
            fluid accumulation adjacent to the wound surface reduces proliferation of endogenous
            wound bacteria. Fluid accumulation (seroma) also compromises adherence of the skin
            substitute to the wound surface, which is the most important property of an effective
            skin substitute. Biobrane has pores in the silicone membrane at &#x000bd;-in centers.
            AWBAT-S has pores in the silicone membrane at &#x000bc;-in centers. The area of the
            AWBAT-S pores (8.8 mm<sup>2</sup>) is larger than the pores in Biobrane (6.2
                mm<sup>2</sup>) making AWBAT-S approximately 500% more porous than Biobrane. The
            greater porosity of AWBAT-S is expected to result in improved transfer of fluid/exudate
            from wound surface to outer dressings, which may result in lower rates of infection,
            better acute adherence and shorter healing time. Both materials contain collagen
            peptides for the purpose of reacting with the fibrin in the wound to achieve good acute
            adherence. In Biobrane, cyanuric chloride (a carcinogen) and dodecylamine (an allergen)
            covalently bond the collagen peptide to the silicone-nylon composite. AWBAT-S uses no
            toxic or allergic cross-linking agents in its collagen binding. As there is residual
            dodecylamine in Biobrane, an allergic reaction mandates removal and prohibits further
            application. Allergic reactions are rare with AWBAT-S and allergens have not been
            demonstrated. Biobrane has low levels of immobile collagen peptide (porcine type I at
            approximately 2.5 &#x000b5;g/cm<sup>2</sup>). AWBAT-S has more collagen peptides of the
            same type (at approximately 10 &#x000b5;g/cm<sup>2</sup>) and highly mobile, which enables
            the peptides to quickly react with fibrinogen in the wound exudate and achieve the acute
            adherence desired. Both materials are provided sterile in a sealed package; Biobrane is
            sterilized with an autoclave (live steam) and AWBAT-S by electron beam.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S1"><title>METHODS AND MATERIALS</title><p>The study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and
                allocated the registration number ACTRON 12609000765224.</p><sec id="S1-1"><title>Study population</title><p>We intended to enroll all patients admitted with burns expected to heal
                    spontaneously (who would usually undergo aggressive burn debridement under
                    general anaesthesia and Biobrane application). Inpatient treatment over the next
                    12 months was used for clinical follow-up visits, scar assessment, clinical
                    outcome assessment, and data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S1-2"><title>Study duration</title><p>It was anticipated that all subjects would be enrolled and complete their
                    follow-up visits at 12 months post application.</p></sec><sec id="S1-3"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>For inclusion, patients had to have superficial partial thickness to mid dermal
                    burns with 2 noncontiguous burn sites of the same approximate size/depth for
                    comparison or 1 burn site large enough to accommodate both a 6-in AWBAT dressing
                    and a 6-in Biobrane dressing. To enable this, the burn wounds had to range
                    between 2% to 40% total body surface area (TBSA). The research ethics committee
                    insisted that the patient age ranged from 18 to 70 years. Exclusion criteria
                    included delayed presentation (&#x0003e;48 hours, Biobrane is never applied after
                    this time in my practice because the burn has &#x0201c;dried out&#x0201d; and cannot
                    be made to appropriately exude after this time), ventilator dependence,
                    non-English speakers (consent impossible), signs of burn wound infection
                    (another indication for nontreatment with Biobrane), pregnancy/lactation, burns
                    of unpredictable early depth and course (electrical, chemical or frostbite
                    injury) and comorbidity which may compromise healing or any known allergy to
                    porcine products.</p></sec><sec id="S1-4"><title>Randomization and group allocation</title><p>After admission to the Burn Centre, a member of the research team contacted the
                    patient to invite them to participate in the study. Signed consent (both
                    research and standard RAH surgical) was obtained following full explanation of
                    the study. The patient was screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. The random
                    allocation of dressing locations was by randomization table and sealed
                    envelopes, which were opened in the operating room and the wounds dressed in
                    accordance with the instructions provided.</p></sec><sec id="S1-5"><title>Procedures and Assessments</title><p>Once the patient was enrolled and consent obtained, a visual assessment and
                    measurement of the burn wound(s) was made by the surgeon and recorded. The
                    surgeon matched sites by approximate size and depth and identified them
                    anatomically (noncontiguous, right or left; contiguous, superior or inferior,
                    medial or lateral). Under general anaesthesia, the burn wounds were meticulously
                    cleaned according to Burn Centre Surgical Protocol which included shaving any
                    hair from the surface of the burn and for 10 cm around the burn to aid Hypafix
                    (BSN Medical GmBH, Hamburg, Germany) adhesion and minimize discomfort.</p><p>Using the patient-specific randomization envelope, one burn wound anatomical site
                    was dressed with AWBAT-S and the other anatomical site was dressed with
                    Biobrane. Alternatively, both materials were used adjacently on large burns and
                    their respective positions were randomized. Both AWBAT-S and Biobrane were
                    applied according to the manufacturer's instructions (AWBAT-S could only be
                    applied under moderate stretch to prevent destruction of the 3-dimensional
                    matrix of the skin substitute and compromising both acute and secondary
                    adherence). The dressings were secured with sterile Hypafix tape and covered on
                    the limbs with burns gauze soaked in weak (1 in 10) povidone iodine solution
                    followed by a crepe bandage (limbs). On the trunk, dressings consisted of
                    Acticoat (Smith &#x00026; Nephew Ltd, Hull, UK) and Exudry (Smith &#x00026; Nephew Ltd,
                    Hull, UK) (posterior) or Acticoat and Cutilin (DeFries Industries, Melbourne,
                    Australia) (anterior).</p><p>The wounds were inspected on day 1 by removing the outer dressings down to the
                    Biobrane/AWBAT-S layer and assessed for their intactness and complete wound
                    coverage, seroma or hematoma formation, signs of infection, pain experienced,
                    exudation, quality of dressing including conformability, pliability, elasticity
                    and any adverse event. Redressing was performed according to Burns Centre
                    dressing protocols and the dressings used were recorded on the case report
                    form.</p><p>Adult patients were instructed to assess and report pain as 0 to 1, no pain; 2 to
                    3, mild pain; 4 to 5, uncomfortable to moderate pain; 6 to 7, distressing to
                    severe pain; 8 to 9, intense to very severe pain; or 10, unbearable pain. The
                    time of administration, dose, and route of any analgesia administered within 4
                    hours of examination was noted on the case report form.</p><p>This process was repeated on day 2 and subsequently as required until healing.
                    After healing and Biobrane/AWBAT-S separation, a scarring assessment was also
                    made at each time point using the Vancouver Scale. Digital photographs were
                    taken at every visit after photographic consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="S1-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined by 2-tailed student
                    <italic>t</italic>-test for parametric data (time to healing). A 2-tailed
                        <italic>t</italic>-test was also used to analyze the difference (matched
                    pairs) for each day between medians for pain scores. A probability level of 0.05
                    was used as the criterion for significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The anticipated recruitment for this study was based on the large number of Biobrane
                applications for superficial partial thickness burns over the previous 7 years.
                However, disappointingly, a very large number of these injuries presenting within 13
                months of the study commencement met exclusion criteria (specifically the inability
                to understand the study and to provide &#x0201c;informed&#x0201d; consent). After
                commencement of the study, Aubrey Inc released what they claim to be a more
                effective epidermal skin substitute (AWBAT-plus). These 2 factors together prompted
                discontinuation of the study after 14 months. The data produced, however, is
                important in evaluating the AWBAT platform. The results have been summarized in
                Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p><sec id="S2-1"><title>Length of stay</title><p>Generally, the usual length of stay in the Burns Centre at the Royal Adelaide
                    Hospital is 1 day per percent TBSA. This was confirmed during this study (0.88
                    days per percent TBSA). This is despite the fact that the specialized nature of
                    Biobrane means that some patients (rural dwellers&#x02014;several hours to several
                    days from Adelaide, those whose compliance cannot be relied upon for any reason)
                    are encouraged to stay longer. In this study, only in 2 patients (with the
                    largest TBSA burns) did the length of stay in hospital exceed the time to
                    healing. Both of these patients were referred from areas 4 to 5 hours drive from
                    Adelaide (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In one patient,
                    although the burn was smaller (6% TBSA), its site (which included the groin)
                    caused too much discomfort to allow earlier discharge. In all other cases, the
                    presence of Biobrane or AWBAT-S did not prove a barrier to discharge. Figure
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>
                        (<italic>a</italic>-<italic>o</italic>) demonstrates a typical progression
                    from admission to healing in AWBAT-S compared to Biobrane.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Time to healing</title><p>With small study numbers (n = 12), the mean time to healing between the groups
                    was not significantly different (Biobrane, 10.17 &#x000b1; 2.33 days compared
                    with AWBAT-S, 9.58 &#x000b1; 2.39 days, <italic>P</italic> = .09&#x02014;Table
                        <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This might achieve significance
                    with larger study groups. There were some features of healing under AWBAT-S,
                    which made the material different to Biobrane, such as wrinkling, which gave the
                    appearance of linear nonadherence and caused concern in a few early patients
                    (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This occurred despite the AWBAT-S
                    being applied flat and under tension. It usually settled by day 5. Once these
                    differences were appreciated, AWBAT-S was as easy to manage as Biobrane.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Pain experienced</title><p>Three patients had pain scores that were extraordinarily high in our experience
                    for Biobrane (No. 1, 2 and 12&#x02014;Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The individual perception of pain experienced by each patient
                    can skew data and this study method of using both materials on each patient
                    (both treatment and control arms being subject to individual pain perception)
                    help to negate such outlying effects. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> demonstrates that the pain scores for both materials in all
                    patients were very similar throughout the study. Pain scores up to day 3 have
                    been included, after this point the pain scores dropped to zero in most
                    patients. There were no significant differences between median pain scores with
                    Biobrane or AWBAT-S at any time point (day 1, <italic>P</italic> = .49, day 2,
                        <italic>P</italic> = .34, day 3, <italic>P</italic> = .38&#x02014;Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Cost of treatment</title><p>Subtracting the cost of the material itself (the Australian market cost of
                    AWBAT-S is not yet known), both materials were identical in terms of outer
                    dressing cost, nursing attention, and analgesia. Over the 12 patients, 7 days
                    less treatment was required for wounds dressed with AWBAT-S (although this did
                    not equate to a significant difference).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>I personally believe that the development of Biobrane, with its subsequent widespread
                availability, has been an important step in reducing pain and facilitating therapy
                in burn injuries expected to heal spontaneously. Those clinicians managing burns who
                do not use this material in this indication, favoring more traditional conservative
                approaches, have failed to grasp the magnitude of these patient outcomes (in
                particular pain) and nursing resource issues (such as a reduction in dressing time).
                The material is not, however, without its downsides and the meticulousness with
                which the wound bed must be prepared no doubt disinclines some surgeons to use it.
                No less meticulous preparation is needed before AWBAT-S application. I would
                suggest, however, that such wound preparation allows an unparalleled opportunity to
                decontaminate the wound and fully assess burn depth, degree of exudation and in some
                cases (where epidermis is critically injured but not detached) even burn size. I
                have also experienced personally the deleterious effect of &#x0201c;delaying
                intervention to allow the burn to declare.&#x0201d; In refusing to acknowledge the
                validity of this claim, and interfering early in the evolving pathophysiological
                process, I have markedly reduced my grafting rate with concomitant shortening of
                length of hospital stay and time to return to work, reduction in time to full
                function and improvements in scarring, and patient satisfaction with cosmetic and
                functional outcome. My experiences with Biobrane have been published demonstrating
                my reliance on it in a range of burn situations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> When Aubrey Woodroof revealed his development of a new, biosynthetic
                epidermal skin substitute, AWBAT-S, claiming that he had ironed out some of the
                problems associated with Biobrane, I was skeptical and excited at the same time. He
                claimed that the increased porosity would decrease the incidence of seroma (which I
                have never experienced with Biobrane but which clearly perplexes others) and that
                the extension of the matrix across the pores (so that only the silicone layer was
                deficient at these areas) would reduce the &#x0201c;pore marks&#x0201d; reported by some
                authors with Biobrane use. He claimed less &#x0201c;allergic reaction&#x0201d; (which
                again I have not experienced with Biobrane). In actual fact, when one considers my
                avid loyalty to Biobrane, he was extremely brave to allow me to compare AWBAT-S
                against it.</p><p>Obviously, the outcome of this study in simple terms could only be one of 2; AWBAT-S
                performs better than Biobrane or AWBAT-S does not perform better than Biobrane. In
                the case of the former, whether a surgeon changes to a newer material depends also
                on reliable availability, ease of access and supply (which can depend heavily on the
                national local regulatory body) and cost.</p><p>Biobrane's main advantage over other conservative treatments is its adherence and
                elasticity (which prevents shear against the wound bed during dressing changes even
                with joint movement, such as metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal
                joints and distal interphalangeal joints flexion in making a fist)&#x02014;these are
                the properties, which reduce pain and speed return to function. There are a number
                of &#x0201c;surgical&#x0201d; features where, personally, AWBAT-S is not as good as
                Biobrane. One such is in its ease of fixation with fixative tapes. The smoothness of
                the silicone layer lacks the &#x0201c;texture&#x0201d; of Biobrane and Hypafix simply
                does not stick so well to it. Since my application technique for Biobrane relies
                heavily on me being able to use tape to stretch and hold the material, this is a
                major problem for AWBAT-S.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> In addition,
                AWBAT-S is nowhere near as elastic as Biobrane and thus, each piece covers less
                wound area (which would make each treatment more costly, even if both materials cost
                the same). The new material does not adhere like Biobrane, remaining
                &#x0201c;wrinkled&#x0201d; clinically, which can give the impression that it has not
                stuck. However, this is a false impression, which is dispelled during the first
                use.</p><p>In terms of nursing staff preferences, AWBAT-S is considerably easier and less
                uncomfortable to remove than Biobrane. Biobrane has 2 problems in this
                regard&#x02014;the first is that the material frequent sticks at the pores due to
                coagulated exudate, the second is that Biobrane usually has a
                &#x0201c;Velcro-like&#x0201d; attachment to the healed burn away from the pores. The
                continuation of the nylon matrix across the pores in AWBAT-S removes the first
                problem. The looser binding of the protein to the matrix in AWBAT-S may be
                responsible for the wrinkling appearance and seems to make removal far easier.</p><p>In terms of patients, all preferred AWBAT-S during dressing changes and at removal to
                Biobrane.</p><p>A final issue relates to pore marks. This is a subject of collaborative investigation
                close to publication and I do not want to reveal too much about mechanism here;
                however, pore marks were seen in 5 of the 12 patients at the AWBAT-S treatment area
                compared with 4 of the 12 Biobrane site pore marks. Patient number 2 developed
                AWBAT-S pore marks that became prominent between 6 and 12 months and left raised
                pore scars at 12 months. Patient number 3, had a particularly unusual AWBAT-S
                pore-mark reaction, with raised prominences that persisted, leaving regular and
                frequent raised white scars (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref><italic>a</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref><italic>b</italic>). In all but one patient (number 10), the Biobrane
                pore marks faded completely (2 by 3 months, 1 by 6 months); patient number 10 had
                pore scars from Biobrane at 12 months (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).
                Patient number 12 completely healed a thigh burn in AWBAT-S without any visible
                marks, and then developed blisters at the site of the pores after irritation while
                wearing nylon track pants (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These
                subsequently healed without scarring. It is obvious that the pore-mark phenomenon in
                Biobrane is not a feature of the discontinuity of the nylon matrix at the pore site,
                but the discontinuity of the silicone layer. Since AWBAT-S has larger and more
                frequent pores, the phenomenon appears to persist for longer, and more frequently
                result in pore scars, than when using Biobrane. Finally, the pink colouration of the
                healed wound faded more quickly in AWBAT-S&#x02013;treated areas than Biobrane-treated
                areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>AWBAT-S is better than Biobrane in terms of ease of removal and discomfort
                experienced by patients at this time. For these reasons, the nursing staff preferred
                it.</p><p>AWBAT-S is at least as good as Biobrane in terms of length of hospital stay, time to
                full healing, and pain/discomfort experienced by patients during healing at rest and
                therapy. Also, in the general cosmetic appearance of the healed wound under the
                material proper (not the pores).</p><p>AWBAT-S is not as good as Biobrane at the pore sites where a much greater number of
                AWBAT-S sites displayed pore marks compared with Biobrane. It is not as good as
                Biobrane in terms of its elasticity or its &#x0201c;&#x02018;fix-ability&#x0201d; with
                adhesive tapes.</p><p>Since my practice is about patients, despite my personal happiness with Biobrane, I
                would consider a change to AWBAT-S if the pores were made comparable in size and
                frequency to Biobrane (ameliorating the pore-mark issue) and if the issues of
                reliable availability, regulatory clearance and cost allowed. The material is not so
                different from Biobrane that I would accept a higher market cost.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barret</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Dziewulski</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramzy</surname><given-names>PI</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Herndon</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biobrane versus 1% silver sulfadiazine in second-degree pediatric
