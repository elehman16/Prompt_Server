</related-article><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Thomas Campbell and colleagues report findings of a randomized trial conducted in

to maximize the efficiency of antiretroviral delivery in resource-limited
settings. We investigated the efficacy and safety of antiretroviral regimens
with once-daily compared to twice-daily dosing in diverse areas of the
world.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>1,571 HIV-1-infected persons (47% women) from nine countries in four
continents were assigned with equal probability to open-label antiretroviral
therapy with efavirenz plus lamivudine-zidovudine (EFV+3TC-ZDV), atazanavir
plus didanosine-EC plus emtricitabine (ATV+DDI+FTC), or efavirenz plus
emtricitabine-tenofovir-disoproxil fumarate (DF) (EFV+FTC-TDF). ATV+DDI+FTC
and EFV+FTC-TDF were hypothesized to be non-inferior to EFV+3TC-ZDV if the
upper one-sided 95% confidence bound for the hazard ratio (HR) was &#x02264;1.35
when 30% of participants had treatment failure.</p><p>An independent monitoring board recommended stopping study follow-up prior to
accumulation of 472 treatment failures. Comparing EFV+FTC-TDF to
EFV+3TC-ZDV, during a median 184 wk of follow-up there were 95 treatment
failures (18%) among 526 participants versus 98 failures among 519
participants (19%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72&#x02013;1.27; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.74).
Safety endpoints occurred in 243 (46%) participants assigned to EFV+FTC-TDF
versus 313 (60%) assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV (HR 0.64, CI 0.54&#x02013;0.76;
<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and there was a significant interaction
between sex and regimen safety (HR 0.50, CI 0.39&#x02013;0.64 for women; HR 0.79, CI
0.62&#x02013;1.00 for men; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01). Comparing ATV+DDI+FTC to
EFV+3TC-ZDV, during a median follow-up of 81 wk there were 108 failures
(21%) among 526 participants assigned to ATV+DDI+FTC and 76 (15%) among 519

advantageous for use of this regimen for initial treatment of HIV-1
infection in resource-limited countries. ATV+DDI+FTC had inferior efficacy

past decade, there are still considerable challenges to meeting the global
goal of universal access to highly active antiretroviral treatment&#x02014;a
combination of effective drugs that attack the HIV virus in various ways&#x02014;to
everyone living with HIV/AIDS who could benefit from treatment. In
recognition of the related financial, technical, and system obstacles to
providing universal access to HIV treatment, in 2010 the UN agency
responsible for HIV/AIDS&#x02014;UNAIDS&#x02014;launched an ambitious plan called Treatment
2.0, which aims to simplify the way HIV treatment is currently provided. One
of the main focuses of Treatment 2.0 is to simplify drug regimes for the
treatment of HIV and to make treatment regimes less toxic. In line with
Treatment 2.0, the World Health Organization currently recommends that
antiretroviral regimens for the initial treatment of HIV should include two
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine or tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate [DF] with lamivudine or emtricitabine) and a
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz or
nevirapine.)</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Most of the evidence about the safety and effectiveness of clinical trials
come from clinical trials in high-income countries and thus is not generally
representative of the majority of people with HIV. So in this study, the
researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial in diverse populations
in many different settings to investigate whether antiretroviral regimens
administered once daily were as effective as twice-daily regimens and also
whether a regimen containing the drug atazanavir administered once daily was
as safe and effective as a regimen containing efavirenz&#x02014;data from previous
studies have suggested that atazanavir has characteristics, such as its side
effect profile, which may make it more suitable for low income settings.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers recruited eligible patients from centers in Brazil, Haiti,
India, Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, the United States, and
Zimbabwe&#x02014;almost half (47%) were women. Then the researchers randomly
assigned participants to one of three regimens: efavirenz 600 mg daily plus
co-formulated lamivudine-zidovudine 150 mg/300 mg twice daily (EFV+3TC-ZDV);
or atazanavir 400 mg once daily, plus didanosine-EC 400 mg once daily, plus
emtricitabine 200 mg once daily (ATV+DDI+FTC); or efavirenz 600 mg once
daily plus coformulated emtricitabine-tenofovir-DF 200 mg/300 mg once daily
(EFV+FTC-TDF). During the study period ATV+DDI+FTC was found to be inferior
to EFV+3TC-ZDV, so the Multinational Data Safety Monitoring Board ordered
this arm of the trial to stop. Then a year later, due to the low number of
treatment failures (deaths, severe HIV disease, or serious opportunistic
infections) in the remaining two arms, the board advised the trial to stop
early. So the researchers analyzed the data obtained up to this point and
pooled the results from all of the centers.</p><p>The researchers found that during an average of 184 weeks of follow-up, there
were 95 treatment failures (18%) among 526 participants taking EFV+FTC-TDF
compared to 98 failures among 519 participants taking EFV+3TC-ZDV. During an
average 81 weeks follow-up, there were 108 failures (21%) among 526
participants assigned to ATV+DDI+FTC and 76 (15%) among 519 participants
assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV. As for safety, 243 (46%) participants assigned to
EFV+FTC-TDF reached a safety endpoint (grade 3 disease, abnormal lab
measurement, or the need to change drug) compared to 313 (60%) in the
EFV+3TC-ZDV group. Importantly, the researchers found that there was greater
risk of safety events for women assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV and also that the
atazanavir-based regimen had a higher relative efficacy in women compared to
men.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that in diverse populations, EFV+FTC-TDF is as
effective as EFV+3TC-ZDV but importantly, the once-daily dosing of
EFV+FTC-TDF makes this regimen useful for the initial treatment of HIV,
especially in low-income countries. Therefore, as per the guidance in
Treatment 2.0, EFV+FTC-TDF in a single combination tablet that can be taken
once a day is an attractive option. These findings also indicate that as
ATV+DDI+FTC was found to be inferior to the other regimens, this combination
should not be used in the initial treatment of HIV. These findings also add
to the evidence that antiretroviral efficacy and safety can differ between
women and men and support further development of sex-specific
recommendations for antiretroviral regimen options.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at

However, most existing knowledge of antiretroviral safety and efficacy comes from
clinical trials in high-income countries with study populations not representative
of the global diversity of people infected with HIV-1. Prospective comparisons of
antiretroviral efficacy and safety in diverse multinational settings with
representative proportions of women are needed to better inform the choice of
antiretroviral drugs for initial HIV-1 treatment.</p><p>World Health Organization (WHO, 2010 revision) guidelines recommend initiation of
antiretroviral therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)
(zidovudine [ZDV] or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DF] with lamivudine [3TC] or
emtricitabine [FTC) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
(efavirenz [EFV] or nevirapine) <xref rid="pmed.1001290-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Randomized clinical trials conducted in developed countries provide
evidence that these regimens are safe and effective <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Staszewski1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although a regimen of FTC, tenofovir-DF
(TDF), and EFV meets criteria outlined in Treatment 2.0 including low toxicity and
simplified once-daily dosing, the comparative safety and efficacy of this regimen in
low-resource settings is unknown.</p><p>Compared to EFV, the HIV-1 protease inhibitor atazanavir (ATV) lacks known
teratogenicity and is active against NNRTI-resistant virus. These features are
potentially advantageous for use of ATV in resource-limited settings where use of
single dose nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 could
increase the risk of NNRTI-resistant virus in women and their sexual partners.
Previous studies of antiretroviral na&#x000ef;ve persons provide evidence that ATV without
ritonavir boosting is safe and efficacious: Unboosted ATV had similar efficacy
compared to EFV when given with co-formulated 3TC-ZDV <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Squires1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, similar efficacy compared to
ritonavir-boosted ATV when given with extended release stavudine and 3TC <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Malan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and comparable activity to
nelfinavir when given with didanosine and stavudine <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Sanne1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Previous studies also provide evidence
that, when given with EFV, the NRTI combination of didanosine and FTC (or 3TC) is
safe and efficacious and has comparable activity to 3TC-ZDV and stavudine plus 3TC
<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Berenguer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Saag1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, taken together
available data predict that a regimen of ATV, didanosine, and FTC would have
antiviral efficacy comparable to 3TC-ZDV and EFV; however, direct comparisons of
these two regimens have not been performed previously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource Limited Settings

Management Center (Frontier Science &#x00026; Technology Research Foundation)
randomly assigned participants 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 to an open-label regimen of EFV 600 mg
daily plus co-formulated 3TC-ZDV 150 mg/300 mg twice daily (EFV+3TC-ZDV); or ATV
400 mg once daily with food, plus didanosine-EC (DDI) 400 mg once daily taken on
an empty stomach 1 h before or 2 h after the ATV dose, plus FTC 200 mg once
daily (ATV+DDI+FTC); or EFV 600 mg once daily plus co-formulated FTC-TDF 200
mg/300 mg once daily (EFV+FTC-TDF). Permuted block randomization was stratified
by country (nine levels) and screening plasma HIV-1 RNA (&#x0003c;100,000 versus
&#x02265;100,000 copies/ml). Treatment assignment was revealed after successful
enrolment at the local site on the web-based system.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedures</title><p>A targeted physical exam, medication review, adherence interview and pill counts,
serum chemistries, liver function tests, pregnancy test, CD4+ lymphocyte count,
and plasma HIV-1 RNA were scheduled at least every 8 wk. All study drug
modifications including initial doses, participant-initiated and/or
protocol-mandated interruptions, substitutions, and permanent discontinuation
and reasons for modification were assessed at each visit. Adverse events (signs,
symptoms, and laboratory results) used US Division of AIDS (DAIDS) scale for
severity grading <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Division1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.
Diagnosis criteria were standardized across sites using ACTG Appendix 60 (see
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1001290.s019">Text
S3</xref>). Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured in real time by the Roche Amplicor
Monitor assay (v1.5) at laboratories participating in the DAIDS Virology Quality
Assurance program.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint (treatment failure) was time from randomization to
first occurrence of any of the following: (1) death; (2) HIV-1 disease
progression defined as new or recurrent WHO stage 4 diagnosis (excluding
HIV-1-associated nephropathy or cardiomyopathy) <xref rid="pmed.1001290-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, Chagas' diseases, or chronic
microsporidiosis or cyclosporidiosis occurring at least 12 wk following
randomization and not part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
(IRIS); or (3) virologic failure defined as two successive measurements of
plasma HIV-1 RNA&#x02265;1,000 copies/ml, with the first measurement at the week 16
visit or later (&#x02265;14 wk after randomization), regardless of study treatment
history or status (intention-to-treat). Participants who did not meet primary
endpoint criteria at any time were censored at the last study visit at which
plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured. Disease progression and IRIS events were reviewed
and adjudicated by a panel of five physician team members who were blinded to
participant identity, clinic site, demographic characteristics, and study
treatment. Study treatment information was also ignored for the mortality and
HIV-1 disease progression components, so the analysis for the primary efficacy
endpoint was fully intent-to-treat. A post hoc sensitivity analysis that
explored whether crossover could explain observed results was also
performed.</p><p>The primary safety endpoint was the earliest of the following times: date of
onset of grade &#x02265;3 (at least one grade higher than entry) sign/symptom, date of
specimen collection of a grade &#x02265;3 (at least one grade higher than entry)
laboratory abnormality, or date of last dose of randomized study treatment
before any modification to that treatment (change in drug dosage, addition of
another antiretroviral drug, or discontinuation of any component of the
randomized antiretroviral regimen). Elevated serum bilirubin concentration was
excluded from the laboratory abnormality component of this endpoint only,
because it is usually asymptomatic and not associated with known adverse
outcomes. Any signs, symptoms, or changes in antiretroviral therapy that
resulted from elevated bilirubin were captured in the other components of the
composite safety endpoint. Participants who did not meet the safety endpoint
definition were censored at the earlier of the last study visit or final
medication dose. Because study treatment modification was part of the composite
primary safety endpoint, this analysis was necessary as-treated.</p><p>First antiretroviral regimen discontinuation was time to premature
discontinuation of study participation, failure to take antiretrovirals for &#x02265;8
consecutive wk, or switch to another antiretroviral regimen. Prespecified
antiretroviral substitutions not included in the definition of regimen
discontinuation were as follows: Substitutions of stavudine for ZDV were not
counted as endpoints in this analysis because WHO guidelines (2003 revision)
when PEARLS was implemented listed 3TC-ZDV as the initial recommendation for the
nucleoside analog component of an antiretroviral regimen with substitution of
other nucleosides, including stavudine, if needed. In 2006 the protocol was
modified to include TDF for ZDV as a prespecified non-endpoint in response to
the 2006 revision of the WHO guidelines that listed ZDV and TDF as the preferred
initial nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors to be combined with
3TC or FTC. Substitutions of DDI for TDF and TDF for DDI were not counted as
endpoints because both drugs are once daily nucleoside analogs. Likewise,
substitutions of nevirapine for EFV were prespecified as non-endpoints because
both drugs are in the NNRTI class and can be dosed once daily.</p><p>Plasma HIV-1 RNA below lower quantitation limit (&#x0003c;400 copies/ml) was a
secondary endpoint that used the closest value to the scheduled visit. Another
secondary endpoint, time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) included an
analysis as specified in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines where
all antiretroviral substitutions were counted as endpoints <xref rid="pmed.1001290-US1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and an analysis where the prespecified
antiretroviral substitutions did not count as endpoints. Immunologic failure was
defined as CD4+ lymphocytes &#x0003c;100 cells/&#x000b5;l at 48 wk or later. Those not
meeting the immunologic failure secondary endpoint were censored at the study
visit week of last CD4+ lymphocyte count.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Assumptions included a non-inferiority threshold hazard (relative risk ratio) of
1.35, overall 30% treatment failure rate within the two arms compared under the
alternative of equivalence (hazard ratio [HR]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0), and one-sided significance
&#x02264;0.05. The estimated statistical power for the primary efficacy comparison by a
one-sided log-rank test comparison of ATV and EFV+FTC-TDF arms to EFV+3TC-ZDV
was 80% for a sample size of 456 per arm with inflation by 10% to account for
losses to follow-up. The study did not have a fixed follow-up duration, but was
planned to continue until 30% of participants experienced a primary efficacy
endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Study Oversight and Monitoring</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional review boards and ethics committees
at each participating institution. Written, informed consent was obtained from
study participants, and human experimentation guidelines of the US Department of
Health and Human Services were followed.</p><p>The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
Multinational Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed safety and efficacy
at least yearly. The prespecified stopping guidelines were only for early
evidence of inferiority of an experimental arm, based upon Haybittle-Peto
bounds. On 6 May 2008, ATV+DDI+FTC was found to be inferior to EFV+3TC-ZDV for
the primary efficacy endpoint at median follow-up of 72 wk. The HR for time to
regimen failure was 1.67 (99.98% CI 1.0&#x02013;2.75; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001),
reflecting 104 failures in the ATV+DDI+FTC arm compared to 67 failures in the
EFV+3TC-ZDV arm. These CIs reflect those data available at interim review by the
DSMB, which prespecified 99.98% intervals to correspond to
<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001 Haybittle-Peto bounds for superiority (and likewise,
inferiority). Study participants, investigators, institutional review boards,
and ethics committees were informed of the DSMB findings on 23 May 2008, and
participants still taking ATV+DDI+FTC were switched to alternative
antiretroviral regimens. The DSMB did not report any findings related to the
comparison of the EFV+FTC-TDF and EFV+3TC-ZDV arms so these arms were not
modified and the investigators remained blinded to outcomes in those arms until
completion of all study follow-up.</p><p>On 3 November 2009, the DSMB concluded that the remarkably low rate of new
endpoints in the EFV+FTC-TDF and EFV+3TC-ZDV arms made it unlikely that the
study would reach the planned 30% rate of primary endpoint within 2 y (or even
considerably longer) and continuation of study follow-up for two more years
would likely improve precision of the comparison by only a small amount. The
DSMB recommended that &#x0201c;it was simply not practical to continue until 274 events
(30%) and that no statistical penalty needed to be paid for stopping before
then.&#x0201d; The ACTG followed the DSMB recommendations and closeout visits were
conducted between 1 April and 31 May 2010.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Analyses for the comparison of ATV+DDI+FTC to EFV+3TC-ZDV used data collected
from 1 May 2005 through 22 May 2008. Analyses for comparison of EFV+FTC-TDF to
EFV+3TC-ZDV used data collected through 31 May 2010. The study was designed to
test the primary efficacy hypothesis of non-inferiority using an upper bound of
a one-sided, 0.05 level interval. Early study closure prompted a revised
analysis plan for pairwise comparison. Since comparison of the ATV+DDI+FTC and
EFV+3TC-ZDV arms used additional data collected between 4 March to 22 May 2008,
two-sided 95% CIs and associated <italic>p</italic>-values are presented here.
As the closure of the EFV+FTC-TDF and EFV+3TC-ZDV arms was not due to the
prespecified stopping guidelines, we followed the DSMB recommendations on
significance level and focused inferential procedure for the primary efficacy
outcome on estimating treatment difference effect size and its related range of
plausible values, rather than hypothesis testing. Specifically, two-sided 95%
CIs for treatment difference (parameterized as the relative difference by HR)
were provided. Parallel methods were used for secondary efficacy outcomes (for
consistency) and safety outcomes (by original plan). <italic>p</italic>-Values
based upon stratified log-rank test with a null hypothesis of no difference
between randomized arms were provided only for secondary efficacy and safety
outcomes. Time-to-event outcome distributions were summarized by the method of
Kaplan and Meier, and compared between randomized groups by log-rank test
stratified by randomized allocation. HRs were estimated from Cox proportional
hazards regression; HR variation over time was based on a test for interaction
between treatment group and time. Cumulative probabilities of time-to-event
endpoints used Greenwood estimates of variation for CI formulation. For each of
the primary efficacy and safety time-to-event outcomes, the proportional hazards
assumption was tested through introducing an interaction term between treatment
group and time, and was not rejected in any case (all
<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.18). Interactions between study treatment and
pretreatment covariates were tested individually by Cox regression. Estimated
binomial proportions were compared between arms using Fisher exact test and 95%
exact CIs. Comparisons of CD4+ cells over time used a one-sided, 0.025-level

low-, intermediate-, and high-income countries on four continents with near equal
proportions of men and women. The distribution of enrollment by country, uniform
entry criteria, and quality assurance measures across study sites allowed direct and
highly powered comparisons of antiretroviral regimen efficacy in HIV-1-infected
persons with diverse racial, cultural, and demographic characteristics. In this
context, ATV+DDI+FTC had inferior efficacy compared to EFV+3TC-ZDV and is not
recommend as an initial antiretroviral regimen. The regimen of EFV+FTC-TDF had
similar high and durable efficacy with a significant safety advantage compared to
EFV+3TC-ZDV.</p><p>PEARLS was the first clinical trial to prospectively evaluate ATV+DDI+FTC. This
regimen had significantly inferior virological efficacy as demonstrated by highly
significant greater rates of protocol defined virologic failure (plasma HIV-1
RNA&#x02265;1,000 copies/ml at week 16 or later) and significantly less viral suppression
(plasma HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;400 copies/ml) at 24 wk, which was a prespecified secondary
endpoint. PEARLS was not designed to directly compare individual antiretroviral
agents within regimens, so the reason for inferiority of this antiretroviral
combination is uncertain. Participants were instructed to take DDI on an empty
stomach at a separate time from when ATV was taken with food. The possibility that
this inconvenient dosing schedule could have affected adherence to the ATV+DDI+FTC
regimen is being investigated. There was no significant interaction between
treatment effect and baseline viral load stratum for the comparison of ATV+DDI+FTC
to EFV+3TC/ZDV. However, there was a significant difference in treatment effect
between women and men for the efficacy of ATV+DDI+FTC and the inferior efficacy of
this regimen compared to EFV+3TC-ZDV was most pronounced among men. Several previous
studies demonstrated higher serum protease inhibitor concentrations among women
<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Fletcher1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, so we are currently
investigating whether inadequate ATV exposure in men in the ATV+DDI+FTC arm explains
the interaction between sex and treatment efficacy in PEARLS. Given that women had
significantly better relative efficacy with this regimen than men, whether or not
this regimen should be used for initial treatment of HIV-1-infected women remains an
unanswered question.</p><p>Overall, the ATV+DDI+FTC arm had superior safety compared to EFV+3TC/ZDV. Although
absolute number of events was small, participants assigned to ATV+DDI+FTC had
greater frequency of serious renal disease. Previous large studies in which ATV,
didanosine, and FTC were components of other multidrug antiretroviral regimens did
not report this toxicity <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Squires1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Saag1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.
Participants assigned to ATV+DDI+FTC had greater CD4+ lymphocyte increases than
participants in the EFV+3TC/ZDV arm. Since there was a trend toward more new AIDS
endpoints in the ATV arm compared to the EFV arm (18 versus 10;
<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.14) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1001290-t001">Table
1</xref>), there was no evidence that the statistically significant difference
in CD4+ cell count increase was associated with a clinical benefit.</p><p>PEARLS is the second randomized clinical trial to compare EFV+FTC-TDF and EFV+3TC-ZDV
in an initial antiretroviral regimen. The study populations of the previous study
(GS-01-934) <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and PEARLS
are different. Compared to GS-01-934, PEARLS had a larger sample size for the
comparison of EFV+FTC-TDF to EFV+3TC-ZDV (1,045 versus 515) and a larger proportion
of women (46% versus 14%), African race (50% versus 23%), Asian race (23% versus
&#x02264;4%), Hispanic ethnicity (20% versus 16%), and greater geographic diversity (North
America, Caribbean, South America, Africa and Asia versus North America and Europe).
These differences in study populations, and their potential effects on study
outcomes, should be considered when comparing the results of GS-01-934 and
PEARLS.</p><p>A second key finding of PEARLS is that EFV+FTC-TDF and EFV+3TC-ZDV had very similar
treatment failure rates and both regimens suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA below 400
copies/ml for greater than 80% of participants for up to 144 wk. Given the precision
of the confidence bounds on the efficacy comparisons, we conclude that these
regimens had similar efficacy for initial treatment of HIV-1. GS-01-934 reached
different conclusions about the relative efficacy of these two antiretroviral
regimens <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is
possible that differences in the study populations between PEARLS and GS-01-934
contributed to the different efficacy conclusions, but the finding that sex, race,
ethnicity, or geography did not affect relative regimen efficacy in PEARLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001290-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel) does not
support this explanation. The conclusion of the GS-01-934 study that EFV+FTC-TDF had
superior efficacy to EFV+3TC-ZDV was based on an FDA TLOVR primary endpoint that
assigned equal consequence to changes in the randomized drug assignments regardless
of the reason for change. When the FDA TLOVR algorithm was evaluated as secondary
endpoint in PEARLS we also found significant superiority of EFV+FTC-TDF, but a TLOVR
algorithm that did not count protocol-prespecified drug substitutions as endpoints
did not detect a difference between arms. The discordant findings of the two TLOVR
analyses in PEARLS suggest that the different conclusions of GS-934 and PEARLS about
relative regimen efficacy could be due to whether or not drug substitutions for
toxicity management were included in the primary efficacy endpoint. Inclusion of
drug discontinuation for toxicity management in an efficacy endpoint has the
potential to lead to inaccurate conclusions about regimen efficacy. This point is
illustrated in the efficacy comparison of ATV+DDI+FTC to EFV+3TC-ZDV in PEARLS. In
the FDA TLOVR the inferior efficacy of ATV+DDI+FTC was masked by the higher rate of
drug substitutions in the EFV+3TC-ZDV arm, whereas in PEARLS the primary endpoint
comparison and the TLOVR that did not count protocol-specified drug substitutions
ATV+DDI+FTC had clearly inferior efficacy.</p><p>Another important finding of PEARLS is that EFV+FTC-TDF had superior safety with
significantly less laboratory adverse events compared to EFV+3TC-ZDV. This finding
also differs from GS-01-934, which had overall higher rates of primary safety events
than PEARLS <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but did
not detect a significant difference in clinical or laboratory adverse events between
arms. Since the better safety of EFV+FTC-TDF in PEARLS was most pronounced in women,
we speculate that the larger number of women in PEARLS allowed us to detect this
safety difference.</p><p>The between-arm differences in the PEARLS primary safety analyses were driven largely
by higher rates of neutropenia and anemia resulting in protocol-recommended drug
substitutions in the EFV+3TC-ZDV arm. Neutropenia and anemia are well-described
toxicities of ZDV <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Richman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and
neutropenia has been associated with increased risk of serious bacterial infections
in HIV-infected people <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Kuritzkes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.
Thus the risk, potential consequences and the laboratory monitoring required to
detect and manage neutropenia and anemia are important considerations when deciding
whether to initiate antiretroviral treatment with EFV+3TC-ZDV. Although no apparent
differences in the occurrence of clinical events as a complication of neutropenia or
anemia were observed in PEARLS, potential consequences could have been attenuated by
frequent laboratory monitoring and standard procedures for clinical management of
adverse events specified in the protocol. The finding that the EFV+FTC-TDF arm had
significantly fewer serious metabolic diagnoses (which included lipoatrophy and
lipodystrophy) is an important safety advantage of this regimen that was also
observed in GS-01-934 <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Pozniak1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.
Although renal impairment has been associated with TDF, renal adverse events were
uncommon in the EFV+FTC-TDF arm of PEARLS.</p><p>All HIV-1 protease inhibitors, even with ritonavir boosting, have a significant
pharmacokinetic interaction with rifampin that decreases protease inhibitor
concentrations and potentially reduces anti-HIV-1 efficacy <xref rid="pmed.1001290-World2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Thus use of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in
persons with active tuberculosis is not recommended if other options are available.
Although active tuberculosis was relatively uncommon in PEARLS participants overall,
treatment of tuberculosis was the third most common cause of the antiretroviral
regimen discontinuation endpoint in the ATV plus DDI and FTC arm largely because of
the requirement to substitute for ATV if there was concomitant use of rifampin.
There was no prescribed substitution for EFV if rifampin was used and
discontinuation due to tuberculosis treatment did not occur in either EFV containing
arm.</p><p>Half of HIV-1 infections worldwide occur in women <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Joint1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, but historically women are
underrepresented in clinical trials of antiretroviral therapy <xref rid="pmed.1001290-dArminio1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Almost half of PEARLS participants
were women so we were able to evaluate potential interactions between sex and
treatment effect and safety. Our findings of greater risk of safety events for women
assigned to EFV+3TC-ZDV and higher relative efficacy of an ATV-based regimen in
women compared to men add to a growing body of evidence that antiretroviral efficacy
and safety can differ in women and men <xref rid="pmed.1001290-Moore2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001290-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and support further development of
sex-specific recommendations for both antiretroviral regimen choice and toxicity
monitoring. When treating HIV-1-infected women with EFV it is important to recognize
the teratogenic risk during the first trimester of pregnancy. In PEARLS, women of
reproductive potential were treated with EFV only if they agreed to use effective
birth control methods and close monitoring was performed to detect pregnancies early
to ensure that EFV was used safely. Despite these requirements, there were 62
pregnancies during study follow-up, including 42 in the two EFV-containing arms. It
is also notable that the incidence of pregnancy of women of child-bearing potential
was higher in the ATV+DDI+FTC arm, which had less stringent contraception
requirements, compared to the EFV-containing arms. The outcomes of the live births
to women in the PEARLS study are reported elsewhere <xref rid="pmed.1001290-NielsenSaines1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>There are limitations to consider in the application of the study findings to
resource-limited settings. PEARLS was conducted at clinical research sites
affiliated with academic medical centers in large cities and these environments are
undoubtedly different from community clinics or rural health care facilities. The
entry criteria resulted in recruitment of a relatively health study population with
a low prevalence of co-morbidities. Although most participants had a pretreatment
CD4+ lymphocyte count that put them at risk for AIDS-related complications,
relatively few reported prior or current AIDS-related infection or malignancy at
baseline. Data concerning potential participants who were screened and found not to
meet entry criteria were not collected so it is unclear how representative our study
population was of other HIV-1-infected persons in care at the study sites. Intense
clinical and laboratory monitoring required by the study design could also have
affected safety and efficacy outcomes through improved adherence and retention in
care. To date, we have only investigated the influence of factors such as
race/ethnicity, sex, and geography on treatment effect (e.g., the performance of one
regimen relative to another regimen). Although we did not detect interactions
between race/ethnicity and geography and treatment effect, this finding does not
mean that these factors do not affect antiretroviral efficacy or safety and further
analyses to explore these possibilities are ongoing.</p><p>To our knowledge, PEARLS is the first study to recruit a study population with this
racial, geographic, and sex diversity for a prospective randomized clinic trial of
antiretroviral therapy. This unique feature of PEARLS likely contributed to the
identification of previously unrecognized sex-related differences in antiretroviral
efficacy and safety, and provides an evidence base to better guide the choice of an
initial antiretroviral regimen in multinational settings. The efficacy and safety of
EFV+FTC-TDF in this diverse study population, especially in HIV-1-infected women,
combined with the availability of these three drugs in a single co-formulated tablet
with once-daily dosing make this an attractive regimen for initiation of
antiretroviral therapy in resource-constrained settings by the criteria outlined in
UNAIDS Treatment 2.0 <xref rid="pmed.1001290-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001290.s001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><p>
