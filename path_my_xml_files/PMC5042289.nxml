Six wards for adult patients participated including medicine for older people (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4), urology (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) and orthopaedics (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eligible patients on participating wards were randomly selected for observation. Staff-patient interactions were observed using the Quality of Interactions Schedule. 120&#x000a0;h of care were observed with each 2&#x000a0;h observation session determined from a balanced random schedule (Monday-Friday, 08:00-22:00&#x000a0;h).

Forty percent of patients had at least one negative interaction (95% confidence interval 32% to 49%). Interactions initiated by the patient (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR] 5.30), one way communication (adjusted OR 10.70), involving two or more staff (adjusted OR 5.86 for 2 staff, 6.46 for 3+ staff), having a higher total number of interactions (adjusted OR 1.09 per unit increase), and specific types of interaction content were associated with increased odds of negative interaction (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In the full multivariable model there was no significant association with staff characteristics, skill mix or staffing levels. Patient agitation at the outset of interaction was associated with increased odds of negative interaction in a reduced model. There was no significant association with gender, age or cognitive impairment. There was substantially more variation at ward level (variance component 1.76) and observation session level (3.49) than at patient level (0.09).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings present a unique insight into the quality and quantity of staff-patient interactions in acute care.

In the UK, retrospective analyses of care failures suggest that interactions between patients and staff, particularly nurses, were of low quality and frequency, undermining quality of care and patient experiences (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Francis, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Maben et al., 2012a</xref>). Findings from enquiries into these care failures have been accompanied by a crisis of public confidence in the ability of nurses in general to be compassionate (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Maben and Griffiths, 2008</xref>; Prime Minister&#x02019;s Commission on the Future of Nursing and Midwifery in England, 2010; <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Report of the Willis Commission, 2012</xref>). A variety of reforms have resulted across the health service, such as changes to nursing education and recruitment (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Report of the Willis Commission, 2012</xref>). While the UK care failures have had particular prominence, evidence suggests that concerns about the frequency and quality of interactions between nursing staff and patients are shared internationally (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Corbin, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Kagan, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Reader and Gillespie, 2013</xref>). However, surprisingly little is known about the quantity and quality of interactions between staff and patients outside of settings in which care failures have been identified and studied. This paper presents findings based on observations of staff-patient interactions in six hospital wards in two National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.</p><p>When people come into hospital, the quality of their interactions with staff is key to shaping experiences during their stay. For example, older people want nurses and others to use interactions to maintain identity (&#x0201c;see who I am&#x0201d;), to create community (&#x0201c;connect with me&#x0201d;) and to share decision making (&#x0201c;involve me&#x0201d;)&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Bridges et al., 2010</xref>). There may also be wider benefits to high quality interactions beyond patient experience. For instance, nurses aim to use their relationships with patients to provide tailored care, comfort and support, including supporting informed decision-making, and assessing responses to treatments, suggesting a clinically therapeutic potential to interactions (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bridges et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the links that have recently been indicated between positive experience, patient safety and clinical effectiveness, suggest that quality of interactions may impact on a wider range of important outcomes such as adherence to recommended medication and treatments or technical quality of care delivery (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Few studies offer a clear indication of how common the problems regarding staff-patient interactions are. Many that report on staff-patient interactions give retrospective global evaluations using questionnaires. For instance, The 2014 NHS inpatient survey involving 59,000 inpatients showed that 24% of inpatients could not find a member of the hospital staff to talk to about their worries and fears, and 13% did not get enough emotional support from hospital staff (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2015</xref>). Measures such as the NHS survey offer a partial view because not everyone can participate, memories may be inaccurate and respondents cannot give a clear view of the frequency of negative experience.</p><p>Given the limitations of questionnaire methods, which tend to exclude some of the groups that may be most vulnerable to the impact of negative interactions such as those with cognitive impairment, observational methods may be a more appropriate method to measure the quantity and quality of interactions in general hospital care (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Goldberg and Harwood, 2013</xref>). A review of the care of older people in 11 acute hospitals in Northern Ireland reported that 67% of 1836 interactions observed were rated as positive and 7% were rated negative (<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority, 2015</xref>). While assessments of interaction quality were made using the validated Quality of Interactions Schedule (<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority, 2015</xref>) the sampling method and context are unclear. A number of studies focusing on the nurse as the unit of analysis indicated that the amount of direct contact time was low, but no data were gathered on interaction quality (<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Westbrook et al., 2011</xref>). No studies have been identified that comprehensively explore both the quality and quantity of interactions with the patient as the unit of analysis in general hospital settings, an important gap given the degree of attention this issue is attracting in the UK and beyond.</p><p>The study aims to address the important gap identified.

The data presented here were collected during the baseline phase of the study using a descriptive design.</p><sec id="sec0015"><label>3.1</label><title>Setting and sample</title><p>Data were collected in two acute NHS hospitals in England between March and April 2015. Managers of seven medical and surgical wards with high proportions of older in-patients were invited to include their ward in the study. Six wards participated: medicine for older people (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4), urology (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) and orthopaedics (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1). Each ward had between 28 and 32 beds. We excluded patients identified by the nurse in charge as palliative, critically ill or reverse barrier nursed. All other patients were eligible for inclusion in the study.</p><p>Observations were undertaken in randomly generated time slots for ten two-hour sessions on each ward over a three week period (Monday-Friday, 08:00&#x02013;22:00), there were 60 observation sessions in total. Observation sessions were balanced between wards and time of day. For each observation session, a random number generator was used to identify an index patient who was then approached and invited to take part in the study. If the patient agreed to take part, other patients in their vicinity were also approached and invited. If the index patient declined to take part, a new index patient was selected. This process continued until an index patient agreed to participate.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>3.2</label><title>Data collection</title><p>The quality of interactions was measured using the Quality of Interactions Schedule (QuIS) (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 1993</xref>), an observation-based tool that has been used in a number of studies in NHS acute care settings. Interactions between staff and patients are coded as positive social, positive care, neutral, negative protective and negative restrictive (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The QuIS has been shown to be sensitive to change in service quality (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Algar et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Brooker, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Dean and Briggs, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Health Advisory Service, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Wewers et al., 1994</xref>). In long term residential settings QuIS has been shown to be reliable with kappa coefficients of above 0.75 (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Dean et al., 1993</xref>). Concurrent validity has been demonstrated by the association of increased quantity and quality of interactions experienced by residents with improvements in ratings of residents&#x02019; cognitive impairment, observed depression, and functional capacities (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Dean and Briggs, 1993</xref>). QuIS was originally designed for long term settings, and so prior to the current study a protocol was developed for use by the research team to guide its application in acute settings, including a definition of what constituted the beginning and end of an interaction and how to decide between the different ratings (see <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">McLean et al., 2014</xref>). Inter&#x02010;rater reliability testing was conducted on acute care patients recruited opportunistically. Kappa for QuIS rating was found to be 0.61, indicating good agreement.</p><p>Data gathered included the quality, length and frequency of all interactions between participating patients and staff during each observation session. Contextual data were also gathered on the session (number of patients on the ward, staffing levels and skill mix), on the patients (age, gender, evidence of cognitive impairment, agitation at outset of interaction) and on individual interactions (including number of staff, staff type, and content of interaction into seven types as detailed in <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The platform used for data collection was the Quality of Interactions Tool (QI Tool), a tablet-based interface that enables users to enter data in real-time for subsequent wireless upload to an encrypted central database. Data were gathered through direct observation of interactions between patients and staff. Single researchers located themselves in a discrete location near enough to the patient(s) to be able to see and hear interactions. If curtains were drawn researchers stayed within hearing distance but did not enter in order to uphold the privacy and dignity of the patient. Five researchers were involved in collecting data. Each attended a seven-hour classroom training session and four hours of ward-based direct observation training.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>3.3</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>Exploratory data analyses were performed to check the data and identify inconsistencies. Descriptive statistics for patient and interaction characteristics were calculated. Frequencies and percentages were computed to describe the type of interaction and QuIS ratings. Amongst patients with a full two hours of observation, the percentage with at least one negative (either protective or restrictive) was calculated and presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p>A four level mixed-effects logistic regression model was fitted to investigate the effect of the predictive variables on the probability of an interaction being rated as negative (protective and restrictive combined). The individual interactions recorded between patients and staff were considered as the lowest level of the model. Patient, observation session and ward were included in the model as random effects making up the higher three levels of the model. Predictive variables were included as fixed effects and presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI. Models were fitted including each predictive variable as a fixed effect on its own (Model A), all predictive variables (Model B) and a selection of predictive variables (Model&#x000a0;C). Terms were deemed statistically significant at the 5% level by virtue of the 95%CI around an OR including the value 1.00 or not. Models were estimated using the command xtmelogit in Stata 11.0 (StataCorp.2009.Stata Statistical Software: Release 11. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Agreement was assessed by calculating the Intra-class correlation (ICC) for the number of interactions observed. ICCs for agreement in the number of ratings recorded for each category, between the two observers, was also calculated. ICCs were calculated using the one way random model for a single measure in command reliability in SPSS.</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><label>3.4</label><title>Ethics</title><p>Procedures were in place to ensure that the principles of the Mental Capacity Act (2005)(<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Department for Constitutional Affairs, 2007</xref>) were adhered to. Personal consultees were consulted if an individual patient was assessed as lacking mental capacity to decide about whether or not to take part in the study. Any staff, including non-nursing staff, who interacted with recruited patients during the observation sessions were included, unless they declined to participate. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Social Care Research Ethics Committee for England: study reference number 14/SC/1313.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0035"><label>4</label><title>Results</title><p>The care of 133 patients was observed over 120&#x000a0;h of planned observation. The intra-class correlation coefficient for the number of interactions recorded by paired observers was 0.94 (95% CI 0.67&#x02013;0.99, P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). During this time there were 1554 interactions recorded.</p><p>Patients and interactions: The mean patient age was 83 years (range 18&#x02013;101 years). Seventy nine per cent were female (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;105). Thirty-one percent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41) of patients had evidence of cognitive impairment. The proportion of positive interactions was the same for patients with/without cognitive impairment. The patient was not agitated at the outset of most interactions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1491, 96%).</p><p>Length of interaction: There was a mean of six interactions per patient per hour (range 1&#x02013;20) (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The mean length of interaction was 101&#x000a0;s with a median of 36&#x000a0;s (range 0&#x02013;2337&#x000a0;s, or 0&#x02013;39&#x000a0;min).</p><p>Interaction rating: Sixty percent of interactions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;927) were rated as positive care. In addition, 13% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;204) of interactions attracted the rating of positive social. Ten per cent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;156) of interactions were classified as negative, of which over half 6% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;97) were given the lowest rating of negative restrictive. Forty percent (47; 95% CI 32% to 49%) of patients with two hours of observation (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;117) had at least one negative interaction.</p><p>Initiation of interactions: Eighty-one percent of interactions were initiated by staff rather than patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1262) and most were two-way interactions, that is the patient and staff member(s) were involved (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1322, 85%). Interactions typically occurred with no visitors present (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1454, 94%).</p><p>Type of interaction: Twenty-eight percent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;439) of interactions were classed as functional (including delivery of food and drink, bed-making, documentation and patient transfer), 25% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;383) were focused on communication, and 22% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;345) were focused on delivery of personal care (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Staff and interactions: On average 4.5 registered nurses (RN) and 3.8 health care assistants (HCA) were present on the ward at the start of an observation session, with a mean of 3.5 patients per RN&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;HCA (range 1&#x02013;5.7) (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Registered nurses were involved in the largest proportion of interactions (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;596, 38%) followed by HCAs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;572, 37%) (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Quality of interactions between patients and registered nurses and HCAs appeared to be similar; Seventy six percent of interactions involving registered nurses were rated as positive compared to 80% for HCAs (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Ninety-one percent of interactions involved just one member of staff (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1420).</p><p>Wards and session level: Wide variation between wards is evident, with negative restrictive ratings ranging from 3 to 18% of interactions on individual wards. Positive ratings (positive social and positive care combined) on individual wards ranged from 65 to 82%.</p><p>In the initial multilevel model (Model A) logistic model of predictors of a negative (combined protective and restrictive) interaction (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) increasing age, agitation at outset of interaction, interactions initiated by the patient, one way communication, having two staff involved and a higher total number of interactions as well as some specific types of interaction content were associated with statistically significantly increased odds of negative interaction. For example, as patient age increases by 1&#x000a0;year, the odds of having a negative interaction will increase by 5%. The presence of a visitor reduced the odds of a negative interaction. There was a trend to marginally reduced odds for interactions involving a HCA in comparison to those involving registered nurses, amongst interactions with only one member of staff present. Although a higher number of patients per nurse was associated with increased odds of negative interaction this was not statistically significant. Similarly while a skill mix with a higher proportion of registered nurses was associated with reduced odds of negative interaction this was not statistically significant.</p><p>In Model B (<xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) only interactions initiated by the patient (adjusted OR<xref rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn">1</xref> 5.30), one way communication (adjusted OR 10.70 [5.64, 20.28]) having two or more staff involved (2 staff: adjusted OR 5.86 [2.33, 14.74]; 3+ staff adjusted OR 6.46 [1.45, 28.80]) and a higher total number of interactions (adjusted OR 1.09 per unit increase [1.03, 1.15]) plus specific types of interaction content were associated with increased odds of negative interaction. Interaction activity classified as communication (adjusted OR 2.56[1.18, 5.54]), personal care (adjusted OR 4.10 [1.84, 9.14]) or &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; (adjusted OR 8.36 [2.42, 28.91]) were more likely to be rated negatively. Associations with staffing levels or skill mix remained non-significant although the magnitude of the non-significant relationship for staffing was increased.</p><p>As a secondary analysis we estimated regression models including only patient, nurse and session level characteristics as predictors of quality of interaction (shown in <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> as Model C). In this model, patient agitation at the outset of interaction (adjusted OR 5.97 [2.23, 16.01]) was associated with increased odds of negative interaction and having visitors present was associated with reduced odds of negative interaction (adjusted OR 0.24 [0.07, 0.84]).</p><p>The estimate of variation from the multi-level model was lowest at the patient level (variance component 0.09) with substantially more variation at the ward level (variance component 1.76), and highest variation at the observation session level (variance component 3.49). In the reduced multi-level model, the variance components at the ward and observation session levels were lower.</p></sec><sec id="sec0040"><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings provide a detailed description of the length, frequency and quality of staff-patient interactions in six UK hospital wards. Staff-patient interactions were frequent but tended to be relatively short. Interactions were mostly positive, but a small yet significant proportion were negative. Forty percent of patients had at least one negative interaction. A number of factors were independently associated with more negative interactions, including being patient-initiated, type of care and number of staff involved. Patient agitation at the outset of interaction was associated with increased odds of negative interaction and having visitors present was associated with reduced odds of negative interaction but only in Model C where no account was taken of the interaction content. Variability was highest at ward and session level, compared to patient level.</p><p>Findings on the length and quality of interactions are broadly similar to those reported in other studies, although frequency of interaction at a patient level has not been previously reported (<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Westbrook et al., 2011</xref>). Findings indicate that length of interaction is not associated with quality of interaction, suggesting that both positive and negative interactions can be accomplished in spite of short contact time. However more frequent interactions were associated with a more negative experience. More research is needed to better understand these patterns.</p><p>In contrast to other research, this study did not find that age or cognitive impairment increased the likelihood of a negative interaction (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bridges et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Bridges et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Eriksson and Saveman, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Fulmer et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies have not controlled for multiple patient and staff factors and these findings clarify that age and cognitive impairment do not appear to be independently associated with interaction quality. In Model C, patient agitation at the outset of interaction was associated with higher odds of a negative interaction which adds to our understanding of which patients may be more vulnerable to negative interactions.</p><p>The finding that interactions focused on communication and personal care were associated with a higher likelihood of a negative interaction is noteworthy given that communication and personal care are aspects of nursing care in which positive interactions are regarded as essential for establishing therapeutic relationships (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Deparment of Health, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Francis, 2013</xref>). Qualitative inquiry into interactions during these aspects of care would enable greater understanding of the association found here.</p><p>In Model C, the presence of visitors reduced the odds of a negative interaction, whereas having more than one member of staff present increased it. It might be anticipated that staff perform better when under the observation of others (<xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Strauss, 2002</xref>), but these findings do not consistently support this claim. It may be that staff become so used to having an audience of other staff that any effect of observation is muted, but they become more conscious of their behavior when visitors are present. Conversation that occurs between staff when more than one is involved in an interaction may result in their being less focused on the patient. Results from the National Inpatient Survey in England suggest that staff talking in front of patients as if they were not there is a relatively common complaint, for example 19% of patients reported this. For doctors the percentage talking as if the patient wasn&#x02019;t there rose to 24% (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2015</xref>). Alternatively it may be that with more members of staff involved, the opportunity for at least one of them to act negatively is increased. Visitors appear to have a protective effect, perhaps because staff become more conscious of their behavior when visitors are present. An alternative explanation is that visitors play an active part in improving the quality of an interaction. However, as this finding is only significant when the interaction content is not included in the model it may simply be that visitors are less likely to be present during encounters more likely to be associated with negative interactions, such as personal care.</p><p>The high variability associated with sessions and wards compared to patients suggests that common factors operating at these levels are leading to similar quality of interactions. This suggests that there may be factors associated with wards, for example ward cultures, that may influence the quality of interactions. The variability associated with an individual session suggest that factors present in the immediate situation, for example particular stressors or groups of staff, may have the biggest influence. The effects of staffing levels, skill mix or particular staff groups could operate at either of these levels, although we found no evidence of significant associations between these variables and the quality of interactions. However, given the large body of evidence linking staffing levels and skill mix to quality of care (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2014</xref>) the non-significant trends observed here warrant further exploration. Nonetheless these findings give no support to identify a specific staff group, and in particular health care assistants, as the source of negative interactions and these findings contradict previous largely anecdotal evidence (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Cavendish, 2013</xref>). The importance of ward and organisational level cultural factors such as the nurse practice environment has also been established previously (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Aiken et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Maben et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al., 2011</xref>) and warrants further investigation in future studies with a larger sample of wards.</p><sec id="sec0045"><label>5.1</label><title>Limitations</title><p>This study was undertaken on only six wards in two hospitals. The patient mix and ward characteristics suggest that the wards included in this study are typical of NHS general acute care wards (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2013b</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2000</xref>). In addition to the inclusion of a representative proportion of patients with cognitive impairment, the strengths of the study lie in the collection and analysis of data across a wide range of factors and on a large number of interactions, adding valuable understanding about the contextual influences on the quality of interactions between staff and patients in acute hospital settings. However, caution must be exercised in generalising to other settings. The observational tool used is reliable and is supported by evidence of validity. Using observational methods means that patients who might otherwise be excluded are represented in these findings. However, further validation of the tool to explore its relationship with patient experience is warranted. We focused on the quality and quantity of interactions which occurred. Our study gives no indication of the appropriateness of the content or the extent to which necessary care was delivered. Other studies have shown that nurses frequently omit necessary elements of interpersonal care in the face of low staffing levels (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Ball et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0050"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this study present a unique insight into the quality and quantity of interactions between staff and patients in acute hospital settings, and into the factors associated with the quality of an interaction. While a high proportion of interactions were positive, the findings also indicate that there is scope for further improving the quality of interactions: even over the short observation sessions a large number of patients experienced one or more interactions characterised as negative by an independent observer. It is unclear how these negative interactions affect overall patient experience of care or whether the overall number, or the presence of any negative interaction is most important. Further work is warranted to explore factors associated with a negative interaction, including workload and ward culture. Ward and session level factors are more important influences on the quality of interactions than patient factors, although our findings do not support attributing negative staff patient interactions to any particular staff group.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aiken</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sermeus</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van den Heede</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sloanes</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Busses</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>McKee</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kutney-Lee</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Patient safety, satisfaction, and quality of hospital care: cross sectional surveys of nurses and patients in 12 countries in Europe and the United States</article-title><source>BMJ</source><volume>344</volume><year>2012</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Algar</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>R.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Windle</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Measuring the quality of life and well-being of people with dementia: a review of observational measures</article-title><source>Dementia</source><volume>15</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>832</fpage><lpage>857</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24961999</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ball</surname><given-names>J.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Murrells</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rafferty</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrow</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Care left undone during nursing shifts: associations with workload and perceived quality of care</article-title><source>BMJ Qual.
