We conducted a first-in-human study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of a novel human recombinant alkaline phosphatase (recAP), and we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to support dose selection for future patient studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I trial, healthy volunteers received a single dose of recAP (200, 500, 1000 or 2000&#x000a0;U/kg; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33; 3:1 ratio) or multiple doses of recAP (500 or 1000&#x000a0;U/kg; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18; 2:1 ratio) via a 1-h intravenous infusion on three consecutive days. Serum recAP concentrations, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity levels and anti-drug antibodies were measured, and safety parameters were monitored. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed, and simulations were performed to guide dose selection for a phase&#x000a0;IIa/b trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Peak concentrations of recAP and peak AP activity were reached at the end of the 1-h infusion and showed a rapid decline, with about 10&#x000a0;% of the maximum concentration remaining at 4&#x000a0;h and less than 5&#x000a0;% remaining 24&#x000a0;h post-start. RecAP treatment was generally well tolerated, and anti-drug antibodies could not be detected in the serum up to 2&#x000a0;weeks post-injection after a single dose, or up to 3&#x000a0;weeks post-injection after multiple doses. A four-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics of recAP administration, with moderate inter-individual variability on the central volume of distribution and elimination rate constant. Simulations showed that 1-h intravenous infusions of 250, 500 and 1000&#x000a0;U/kg recAP once every 24&#x000a0;h for three consecutive days constituted the dosing regimen that best met the criteria for dose selection in patient studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>RecAP did not raise any safety concerns when administered to healthy volunteers.

While AKI may develop after trauma, cardiovascular surgery or administration of nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis represents the most common cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sepsis-associated AKI increases mortality to 70&#x000a0;%, and survivors have an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As yet, no pharmacological interventions have been approved, and treatment is limited to renal replacement therapy (RRT).</p><p>Currently, alkaline phosphatase (AP) is one of the limited number of candidate drugs in clinical development to prevent or treat sepsis-associated AKI. This endogenous, membrane-bound enzyme is present in many cells and organs, including the placenta, liver, bone, kidney, germ cells and granulocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. AP exerts detoxifying effects through dephosphorylation of pro-inflammatory molecules, including endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) involved in sepsis pathogenesis, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from cells during stressful events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The potency of AP in attenuating the innate immune response has been illustrated in several animal models of sepsis, in which exogenous AP reduced inflammatory injury and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Considering the immune-modulating effects of AP, the potential of bovine intestinal AP (biAP) was investigated in critically ill patients with sepsis, with or without AKI, in which biAP treatment significantly improved renal function and prevented further kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. An effect on mortality was not demonstrated in these relatively small studies (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36 each).</p><p>Administration of bovine-derived material in humans is less than ideal. Repeated administration of animal-sourced AP could provoke immune reactions, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-free sources of bovine-derived enzyme are difficult to obtain. Therefore, a human recombinant AP (recAP) has been developed as a pharmaceutically acceptable alternative by replacing the crown domain of a human intestinal AP with the crown domain of human placental AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As the renal protective effects of recAP have been confirmed in vitro in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, and in vivo during LPS-induced AKI in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], therapeutic application of recAP could have potent anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects in patients suffering from sepsis-associated AKI. Prior to investigating the potential of recAP in this patient population, it is vital to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this enzyme. A translational population pharmacokinetic model has previously been developed, based on preclinical data on recAP and preclinical and clinical data on biAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], followed by simulations of several dosing regimens, aiding in dose selection for the first-in-human clinical trial, as reported in this article. Here, we evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of recAP in healthy volunteers in a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Using data from this study, the population pharmacokinetic model was further developed, and simulations were performed to support the design and dose selection for patient studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phase I Clinical Trial</title><p>This two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 51 healthy volunteers (part&#x000a0;A: <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;33; part&#x000a0;B: <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18) at a medical screening facility in Zuidlaren, the Netherlands.

The lower limit of quantitation was 3.91&#x000a0;ng/mL and the upper limit of quantitation was 500&#x000a0;ng/mL, with overall mean accuracy and precision values of &#x000b1;20.0&#x000a0;% at each concentration of the quality-control samples (10, 66 and 400&#x000a0;ng/mL). Duplicates were not allowed to exceed the coefficient of variation (CV) of 10.0&#x000a0;%. Anti-drug antibodies were determined by an ECL ligand-binding assay, for which a confirmatory cut point of 18.9&#x000a0;% was established during method validation. Any study sample signal reduction equal to or higher than the specificity cut point was confirmed as positive, and any signal reduction lower than the specificity cut point was scored as negative.

The intensity of the adverse events was rated as mild, moderate, severe, life threatening or fatal, and the relationship between the adverse events and the study medication was indicated as non-existent, unlikely, possible, likely or definite. Additional safety and tolerability assessments consisted of the results of vital sign assessments, 12-lead ECGs, continuous cardiac monitoring (telemetry), laboratory tests, physical examinations and detection of anti-drug antibodies. All subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication were included in the analysis. Blood sampling for anti-drug antibodies was performed at screening and at days 9 and&#x000a0;15 (part&#x000a0;A) or at days 10 and&#x000a0;19 (part&#x000a0;B).</p><p>The data, represented as mean values and standard deviations or as numbers and percentages, were summarized in tabular or graphical form, and descriptive statistics are given.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Population Pharmacokinetic Model Development</title><p>Population-approach nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed with the NONMEM software package (version 7.2.0; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA).

For the four-compartment model, a proportional error structure was preferred over an additive error structure or a combined proportional and additive error structure.

Finally, a covariate analysis was performed, based on the available covariates. On the basis of the correlation plots, the best candidates for covariates on either V<sub>1</sub> or K<sub>10</sub> were selected and tested in the models, but none improved the model fit and they were therefore not taken forward in the model development.

The dosing rationale for the patient studies was primarily based on <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> values and exposure shown to be associated with objective clinical benefit in sepsis-associated AKI patients treated with biAP in previous clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which indicated that clinical benefit occurred above serum recAP concentrations of 290&#x000a0;U/L (170&#x000a0;ng/mL). Therefore, the lowest predicted (trough) concentrations should stay above this level for at least 48&#x000a0;h and preferably for 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days. On the basis of predictive simulations, three recAP dose levels&#x02014;all 1-h intravenous infusions administered once every 24&#x000a0;h for three consecutive days&#x02014;were selected, such that a low-dose group (250&#x000a0;U/kg) achieves borderline exposure and <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> values, while the medium-dose and high-dose groups (500 and 1000&#x000a0;U/kg, respectively) should achieve substantially higher exposure and <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> values. The simulation of the high dose is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The three dosing regimens were also selected because the simulated serum recAP concentration&#x02013;time profiles per dose group were sufficiently differentiated, which allows attribution of a potential observed treatment effect to a specific dose cohort.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Prediction of human recombinant alkaline phosphatase (recAP) concentrations over time after intravenous infusion of the high dose (1000&#x000a0;U/kg, administered once every 24&#x000a0;h for three consecutive days) selected for patient studies.

Two previous clinical trials suggested that biAP had renal protective effects in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated AKI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the basis of these results, recAP was developed to replace the bovine-derived enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human trial demonstrated that single ascending recAP doses of up to 2000&#x000a0;U/kg and multiple recAP doses of up to 1000&#x000a0;U/kg per day for 3&#x000a0;days were well tolerated by healthy volunteers and that recAP displays a good safety profile. Following recAP infusion, no anti-drug antibodies were detectable, no serious adverse events occurred and recAP could be administered sequentially without an increase in either the frequency or the severity of any treatment-emergent adverse events, in comparison with single recAP infusions.</p><p>The results from the biAP trial showed that a loading dose was required to significantly raise serum AP activity levels, followed by a continuous infusion over 24&#x000a0;h, to maintain relatively stable serum AP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In order to improve the treatment regimen, recAP was developed by replacing the crown domain of a human intestinal AP with the crown domain of human placental AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which has a half-life of approximately 6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is expected to improve enzyme stability while preserving or enhancing catalytic function. Indeed, our results demonstrated that a 1-h recAP infusion resulted in an apparent terminal half-life of 48&#x000a0;h, and that 24&#x000a0;h after a single administration of 2000&#x000a0;U/kg recAP, or after 3&#x000a0;days of recAP dosing of 1000&#x000a0;U/kg, serum AP activity levels were still up to 20-fold higher than at baseline. The improved bioavailability of recAP could be an important feature of a potential new treatment option for sepsis-associated AKI, a disease with a complex pathogenesis in which multiple pathological processes&#x02014;including inflammation, hemodynamic instability, microvascular dysfunction and unbalanced renal bioenergetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]&#x02014;should be targeted for a longer period of time.</p><p>On the basis of the pharmacokinetic observations, a four-compartment population pharmacokinetic model was developed with IIV on V<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>10</sub>. The apparent terminal half-life (48&#x000a0;h) and volume of distribution (3.5&#x000a0;L) are comparable to those in the previously developed translational two-compartment pharmacokinetic model (41&#x000a0;h and 4.2 L, respectively) used to support the design of this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The discrepancy in the model structure could be explained by the experimental design of this trial, as the sampling was more intensive, with a longer follow-up period. Nevertheless, our model accurately described the data and was used to support the selection of optimal dosing regimens to investigate the potential of recAP in patients. The simulations aimed to reach trough recAP concentrations above 290&#x000a0;U/L (170&#x000a0;ng/mL), maintained for at least 48&#x000a0;h and preferably for 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days. This resulted in selection of three recAP doses, ranging from 250 to 1000&#x000a0;U/kg, administered once every 24&#x000a0;h for three consecutive days. The dosing rationale was primarily based on the results of previous clinical studies conducted with biAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As could be expected from the enhanced stability by design of the chimeric enzyme, the data from this trial showed that AP activity increased with increasing concentrations of recAP in a linear relationship. Once the optimal dose of recAP is determined, therapeutic drug monitoring allows exposure to be monitored, as AP activity can be quantified by routine laboratory chemistry.</p><p>Patients suffering from sepsis-associated AKI not only have impaired renal function, but also have critical illness-related symptoms such as hypotension, edema and increased vascular permeability, all of which might influence recAP pharmacokinetics. In addition, impaired liver function could affect recAP clearance, as circulating AP is normally cleared through uptake by the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated in&#x000a0;vivo that recAP radioactivity and AP enzyme activity levels were increased during endotoxemia-induced AKI in rats, in comparison with placebo, whereas the organ distribution of recAP was not critically affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Currently, the safety and efficacy of recAP are being investigated in patients with sepsis-associated AKI (ClinicalTrials.gov study ID: NCT02182440). In that trial, recAP pharmacokinetics will also be assessed in patients receiving one of three doses of recAP (250, 500 or 1000&#x000a0;U/kg). Even if pharmacokinetic derangements affect the recAP dosing requirement, the highest dose selected for that patient study significantly exceeds the target <italic>C</italic><sub>min</sub> of 290&#x000a0;U/L. Whether recAP administration will result in sufficient exposure in the target organs of the heterogeneous patient population, and will thereby exert renal protective effects, will be revealed by that large, multicenter trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of recAP, a potential new biological treatment option for critically ill patients with sepsis-associated AKI. In healthy volunteers, peak concentrations of recAP and AP activity levels were reached at the end of the 1-h infusion and decreased rapidly in a multiphasic manner. Single ascending recAP doses of up to 2000&#x000a0;U/kg and multiple doses of up to 1000&#x000a0;U/kg three times daily did not cause serious adverse events. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed and was used to simulate different dosing regimens. From these simulations, a more informed dose was selected for the patient studies. These results pave the way to investigation of the potential of recAP as a new treatment option for sepsis-associated AKI in patient studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
