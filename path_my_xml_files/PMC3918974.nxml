Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that attrition rates were low in the metabolic study when all food was provided. Food availability and preparation may therefore be important factors. For those who did complete the study, however, there were benefits in weight loss and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, an additional 2% advantage in body weight reduction compared with the high-carbohydrate diet and a 13% drop in LDL-C for participants consuming a more plant-based low-carbohydrate diet.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study's strength is that the prescribed hypocaloric diet was self-selected, meaning the results are more in line with what can be expected under free-living conditions. The breadth of application of the plant-based low-carbohydrate diet, however, remains to be determined, but it may provide an option for some individuals for whom LDL-C reduction is an equal concern to weight loss. If low-carbohydrate dietary options become more generally available the number of individuals who will benefit is likely to increase.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A further strength of the study is that the reduction in Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score seen on the Eco-Atkins diet has been validated in a long-term cardiovascular disease outcome trial using key components of the Eco-Atkins diet (nuts and vegetable/olive oil).</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many popular weight loss diets emphasise carbohydrate restriction (Atkins, Eddies, South Beach, Zone).

Percentage body fat was measured at baseline and end of the ad libitum treatment by bioelectrical impedance (Quantum II; RJL Systems, Clinton Township, Michigan). Seven-day diet and exercise histories were recorded in the week prior to each monthly visit. These histories were reviewed and discussed with the dietitian and appropriate dietary counselling was provided to enhance adherence.

Carbohydrate sources on the low-carbohydrate diet featured viscous fibre-containing foods (such as oats and barley) and low-starch vegetables (emphasising okra and eggplant) for the relatively limited amount of carbohydrate allowed. The vegetable proteins were prescribed as gluten (54.8% of total protein), soy (23%), fruits and vegetables (8.7%), nuts (7.5%), and cereals (6%). Gluten was contained in the nut bread and wheat gluten (also called &#x02018;seitan&#x02019;) products. Soy protein was present in the form of burgers, deli slices, breakfast links, veggie bacon, tofu and soy milks. Nuts included almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia, pecans and pistachios. The fat sources were nuts (43.6% of total fat), vegetable oils (24.4%), soy products (18.5%), avocado (7.1%), cereals (2.7%), fruits and vegetables (2.3%), and seitan products (1.4%). Participants were able to purchase at the research centre the &#x02018;no&#x02019; starch high protein nut bread and three of the seitan (wheat gluten) products used in the study which were not available in Canada. The control, high-carbohydrate lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (58% carbohydrate, 16% protein and 25% fat) emphasised whole wheat cereals and cereal fibre, as well as low-fat or skim milk dairy products and liquid egg substitute to reduce saturated fat and cholesterol intakes. These diets have been published previously.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Participants were given a copy of the menu plans that outlined the food items and amounts prescribed during the metabolic phase. These menu plans served as a reference during the ad libitum phase. Furthermore, participants were given an exchange list of the items prescribed on the menu plan. The goal was to enhance adherence.</p><p>Self-taring electronic scales (My Weigh Scales, Vancouver, BC or Tanita Corporation, Arlington Heights, Illinois) were provided to all participants and they were instructed to weigh all food items while recording the 7-day food diary in the week prior to monthly clinic visits. Adherence to the three principal cholesterol-lowering components (vegetable proteins (soy and gluten), nuts and viscous fibres) of the low-carbohydrate diet was assessed from the completed monthly 7-day food records. The amount of each component provided during the metabolic phase remained the same as that prescribed during the ad libitum phase.</p><p>Neither the dietitians nor participants could be blinded, but equal emphasis was placed on the potential importance for health of both diets.

LDL-C (in mmol/L) was calculated by the method of Friedewald <italic>et al</italic> using all data including the two participants who had baseline and during study triglyceride values above 4.5&#x02005;mmol/L (3 values on low-carbohydrate diet and 2 on high-carbohydrate diet, maximum triglyceride &#x0003c;6.5&#x02005;mmol/L; exclusion of these two individuals did not alter the findings). The methods for analysing apolipoproteins A1 (ApoA1) and B (ApoB), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c and homoeostasis model assessment&#x02014;insulin resistance model (HOMA-IR) have been described previously.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Exercise data were calculated as metabolic equivalents (METs).<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The absolute 10-year CHD risk score was calculated using the Framingham risk equation.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Diets were assessed for macronutrients, fatty acids, cholesterol and fibre using a computer programme based on the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) database<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and developed in our laboratory to allow the addition of the macronutrient content of study foods obtained from food labels or directly from food manufacturers.

Each component was assessed as contributing 1/3 or 33.3% to the LDL-C reduction. When the amount consumed was equivalent to the amount prescribed a 33.3% compliance would be recorded for that component. The sum of the three components if consumed as prescribed would equal 100% adherence.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Results are expressed as means&#x000b1;SEM or 95% CIs.

<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The high dropout rate in the present 6-month study did not prevent identification of significant LDL-C and body weight differences in the intent-to-treat analysis (using all available data). However, the completer data demonstrated an even larger treatment difference in LDL-C favouring the low-carbohydrate treatment. Those on the low-carbohydrate diet showed overall adherence to the major dietary components (vegetable proteins (soy and gluten), nuts and viscous fibres) at 33.6% of that provided during the metabolic phase.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> This adherence is similar to the 43.3% seen with the dietary portfolio in the comparison of the metabolic 1&#x02005;month<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and the ad libitum 6-month studies.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In this study, the LDL-C reduction on the low-carbohydrate metabolic month was also greater than that on the ad libitum 6&#x02005;months, although the treatment differences were similar.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>The effect of low-carbohydrate diets on CHD events has not been assessed in randomised controlled trials. Nevertheless, low-carbohydrate diets high in vegetable proteins and oils have been associated with a 30% reduced CHD risk and an 18% reduced incidence of diabetes in cohort studies.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The median interquartile difference in these studies between the 1st and 10th decile for vegetable protein and MUFA intakes, as a marker of increased vegetable oil consumption, was 1.4% and 9.3% expressed as a percentage of total calorie intake.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These figures compare with an 8.2% and a 4.6% relative increase in vegetable protein and oil consumption from baseline on the Eco-Atkins diet compared with the control diet. The increases in MUFA were therefore seen in both studies. Recently a Spanish Mediterranean diet emphasising increased nut or olive oil consumption, and so increasing MUFA intake by 2&#x02013;3%, has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular events also by approximately 30%.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These data provide consistent support for the view that the Eco-Atkins approach would reduce CHD risk in the long term.</p><p>The present diet, while lowering LDL-C by 9%, did not result in any significant depression of HDL-C.

<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Similarly, reductions in ApoB and the ApoB:ApoA1 ratio were also observed in the present study. These findings further support the potential CHD benefit that this weight loss diet may have.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49&#x02013;51</xref> It has also been claimed that apolipoproteins may be stronger predictors of CHD events than conventional lipid variables.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52&#x02013;54</xref></p><p>In contrast to the metabolic study, the reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not significant between the low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate diets.

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Furthermore, nuts and high fibre food consumption have been associated with lower body weight.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></p><p>The study weaknesses include the relatively small sample size and the high dropout rate. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that attrition rates were low in the metabolic study when all food was provided.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Food availability and preparation may therefore be important factors. Future studies will need to focus on strategies to increase and maintain adherence, especially to the cholesterol-lowering components, which all bear US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) health claims for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Furthermore, collaboration with food industry may be helpful in addressing concerns of availability, variety and ease of preparation. In retrospect, a simplified one page eating plan for breakfast, lunch and dinner with a number of options and amounts for each meal, as we have used in our dietary portfolio studies, might also be helpful.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> For those who did complete the study, however, there were benefits in weight loss and LDL-C reduction, an additional 2% advantage in body weight reduction compared with the high-carbohydrate diet and a 13% drop in LDL-C for participants consuming a more plant-based low-carbohydrate diet. Unfortunately it was not possible to predict who would complete the diet based on prestudy data or changes observed during the metabolic phase.</p><p>The study's strength is that the prescribed hypocaloric diet was self-selected, meaning the results are more in line with what can be expected under free-living conditions. The breadth of application of the plant-based low-carbohydrate diet, however, remains to be determined, but it may provide an option for some individuals for whom LDL-C reduction is an equal concern to weight loss. If low-carbohydrate dietary options become more generally available the number of individuals who will benefit is likely to increase.</p><p>We conclude that a weight loss diet which reduced carbohydrate in exchange for increased intakes of vegetable sources of protein, such as gluten, soy and nuts, together with vegetable oils offers an opportunity to improve both LDL-C and body weight, both being risk factors for CHD. Further trials are warranted to evaluate low-carbohydrate diets, including more plant-based low-carbohydrate diets, on CHD risk factors and ultimately on CHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e345" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003505.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e346" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003505.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the study participants for their attention to detail and enthusiasm.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DJAJ, JMWW, CWCK, DAF, GP, RM, ESK and WS contributed in conception and design; DJAJ, JMWW, CWCK, AE, VWYN and TCKL contributed in acquisition of the data; DJAJ, JMWW, CWCK and EV contributed in analysis and interpretation of the data; DJAJ and JMWW contributed in drafting of the manuscript; DJAJ, JMWW, CWCK, AE, VWYN, TCKL, DAF, EV, GP, RM, ESK and WS contributed in critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content; EV was involved in statistical analysis; DJAJ, CWCK and JMWW contributed in obtaining funding; JMWW, CWCK, AE, VWYN, TCKL, DAF was involved in administrative, technical or material support; DJAJ, CWCK, JMWW and WS was involved in supervision.
