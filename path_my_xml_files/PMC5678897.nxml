The current goals of COPD management are to increase the time free of disease symptoms, reduce time spent in hospital, and improve exercise tolerance, health status and quality of life (QoL) [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Exacerbations are an important area of COPD care due to their impact on health status and disease progression [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current pharmacological treatment reduces the frequency of exacerbations, but does not abolish them [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent data indicate that the burden of COPD is also related to the duration of exacerbation, with the length of acute exacerbations being strongly linked to morbidity, poorer health status and hospital admissions. Moreover, longer exacerbations are associated with an increased risk of a new event and accelerate the rate of decline in lung function [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative stress, inflammation and mucus hypersecretion are among the factors driving the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations. The exacerbation rate can be reduced by drugs with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and mucolytic properties [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, no data are available on their efficacy in reducing the duration of exacerbations.</p><p>Erdosteine is a more recently developed mucoactive drug which addresses some of the problems associated with older drugs in this class [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Erdosteine has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but also modulates bacterial adhesiveness, properties potentially of value in the treatment or prevention of exacerbations [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Preliminary clinical data (EQUALIFE study) suggested that erdosteine, as an add-on therapy, could reduce the exacerbation rate and time spent in hospital, and improve health-related QoL in COPD patients [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the duration of the treatment (8&#x02005;months over the winter period) and the size of that study were insufficient to assess the suitability of erdosteine as maintenance therapy in outpatients with COPD at risk of exacerbations treated with conventional COPD therapy.</p><p>In this study we assessed whether long-term treatment with erdosteine at its standard dose could reduce not only the exacerbation rate, but also impact the duration of exacerbations and time to next exacerbation event.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The RESTORE (Reducing Exacerbations and Symptoms by Treatment with ORal Erdosteine in COPD) study was a phase III multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdosteine added to usual maintenance therapy <italic>versus</italic> placebo over 12&#x02005;months, a period long enough to avoid bias due to seasonal variability in exacerbation frequency. Patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD were enrolled at 47 hospital-based pulmonary clinics in 10 European countries (see details in the supplementary material).</p><p>The study was conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation's E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, Directive 2001/20/EU and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by local independent ethics committees.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were current or ex-smokers (&#x02265;10 pack-years) aged 40&#x02013;80&#x02005;years treated as outpatients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II/III with a stable therapeutic regimen for &#x02265;8&#x02005;weeks. Patients had to have experienced two or more acute COPD exacerbations requiring medical intervention in the previous 12&#x02005;months, but no exacerbations in the previous 2&#x02005;months, with forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) 30&#x02013;70% predicted and post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) &#x0003c;70% (the full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the supplementary material). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to enrolment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Patients were randomised following their assigned number after their 2-week run-in period to receive either oral erdosteine at the approved dosage of 300&#x02005;mg twice daily or placebo in addition to their usual maintenance therapy for COPD based on local physician practice and the available guidelines on COPD.</p><p>If respiratory symptoms worsened, patients were allowed to use short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists as &#x0201c;reliever medications&#x0201d;, adding them to their usual prescribed maintenance therapy and to their trial treatment. This use was recorded in the patient diaries on a daily basis and further confirmed by the investigator in the case report forms. After randomisation, clinical visits occurred at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x02005;months. No follow-up study was planned.</p><p>We stratified patients 1:1 according to concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use in order to avoid any imbalance in the study treatment groups. The subgroups consisted of patients using bronchodilators alone and those using long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs) plus ICSs. An independent statistician generated a randomisation list of patient random numbers using a pseudo-random number generator. Series of four patients for each of the two strata were assigned to study sites in order to achieve, within each centre, a balanced number of patients treated with erdosteine or placebo in each of the two strata.</p><p>Erdosteine and placebo capsules were manufactured and provided by the sponsor (Edmond Pharma, Milan, Italy). The placebo was identical in composition, shape, colour and size, but did not contain any active ingredients. Erdosteine or placebo capsules were packed identically.</p><p>The investigator or anyone at the study site was prevented from knowing the allocation sequence with code labelling. The sponsor and clinical research associate were notified if there was a clinical reason for an individual's treatment to be unmasked by the investigator.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome was the number of acute exacerbations occurring over the 12-month study period. Key secondary outcomes were the duration of exacerbations and time to first exacerbation.</p><p>At the time when the study was designed our original statistician advised that a simple comparison of the number of events in each group was sufficient. After the trial started it became clear that the most appropriate methodology was to use a modelled approach to be consistent with current statistical practice [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Exacerbations were defined as a symptomatic worsening beyond normal day-to-day variations and requiring a change in regular medication and/or healthcare resources utilisation: mild (increased use of bronchodilators), moderate (treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids and additional medical assistance) and severe (visit to an emergency department/hospitalisation) [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Exacerbations were collected using the patient's home daily diaries (see supplementary material). In these diaries, patients scored each of the following COPD symptoms on a five-point scale: difficulty in breathing, cough and trouble with sputum. Additionally, patients recorded any change in use of regular medication. Patients answered specific questions on the state of their disease (judgement about worsening of symptoms, extra medical visits and prescription/use of additional drugs for COPD treatment) on a weekly basis.</p><p>The investigators identified exacerbations by daily symptom score variation, change in regular medication and use of additional medication or an emergency hospitalisation for COPD. The onset of a COPD exacerbation was defined as an event with at least 2&#x02005;days of symptomatic worsening and/or an increased level of healthcare utilisation.</p><p>The end of each event was established by a return to the pre-event symptomatology in the case of mild events and, by similar criteria, the cessation of additional treatment to the background therapy in the case of moderate events or severe events, whichever was longer. Investigators registered a new exacerbation provided there was an interval of at least 10&#x02005;days without symptom variation and/or additional drug intake, and/or a re-hospitalisation since a previous episode.</p><p>Additional outcomes included subject and physician assessment of disease severity using a four-point numeric graded scale, where subjects and physicians rated from 0 to 4 how troublesome their lung problems were and how physicians rate patient's COPD symptoms (this scoring scale has not been formally validated), and the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), hospitalisation rate, morning pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC and use of reliever medication, plus the 6-min walk test (6MWT; described in the supplementary material). Safety parameters monitored adverse events, study withdrawal rate, changes in vital signs, ECG parameters (including corrected QT) and routine laboratory testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We based the sample size for RESTORE on studies of mucoactive drugs available at the time of protocol design [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The sample size was calculated using the Andersen&#x02013;Gill multiplicative intensity model for comparison of two treatment groups. The following assumptions were made: two-tailed test, exacerbations percentage reduction 20, average number of exacerbations 1.3&#x02005;patient<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, type I error 0.05, type II error 0.20. As a result, a study population of 470 patients was needed.</p><p>Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on all randomised patients who received at least one administration of the study treatment, with at least one available post-baseline efficacy evaluation.</p><p>A predefined analysis of exacerbation frequency was performed using a Poisson mixture regression model with adjustment for over-dispersion with the covariates of treatment, age, sex, body mass index and FEV<sub>1</sub> at baseline to estimate the rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A rate ratio &#x0003c;1 indicates a protective effect of treatment. All data were analysed per intention to treat. The natural logarithm of the duration, expressed as months in the study, was used as an offset variable to correct for differences in the time individuals spent under observation. A mixed regression model was used to correct for over-dispersion. Rate ratios from this model are expressed as percentages of reduction. Repeating the analysis according to the use of ICSs at baseline demonstrated no significant differences in exacerbation rate or duration between patients using ICSs or those not using them in both the placebo and erdosteine groups. Time to first exacerbation was evaluated by the log-rank test and described by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method.</p><p>As per protocol, the secondary outcomes were compared by nonparametric statistics. After normality testing (Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test) and eventual log-transformation for normalisation purposes, pulmonary function parameters, QoL scores and distance (metres) walked in the 6MWT were analysed using an ANCOVA model with treatment and centre (country) as variants, and baseline as a covariate. For use of &#x0201c;reliever&#x0201d; medications, the median data during the 12-month study period were analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The proportion of patients presenting adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal, adverse drug reactions and serious adverse events were evaluated for each treatment group. We coded adverse events according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meddra.org">www.meddra.org</ext-link>). The proportion of patients presenting adverse events, those adverse events leading to withdrawal, adverse drug reactions and serious adverse events were tabulated for each treatment group (see supplementary material).</p><p>The distribution over time of the clinical laboratory parameters was analysed by describing and comparing frequencies of abnormal values at baseline and after 12&#x02005;months of treatment by means of the McNemar test.</p><p>Comparisons within treatment were performed by calculating the 95% confidence intervals of the changes from baseline, when applicable. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A two-sided p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant for all tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>All authors (academic investigators (R.W.D.N., J.A.W., M.I., G.F., C.P., A.F.C. and P.M.A.C.) and employee of the sponsor (E.P.)) had full access to and interpreted the data, and were responsible for the decision to publish the article.

In RESTORE, erdosteine, a mucoactive drug added to usual COPD maintenance therapy, reduced the absolute number of exacerbations together with the event rate and their duration over 1&#x02005;year. Both the patients and their physicians noted clinical improvements with active treatment, and less rescue medication was taken in this group. However, there was no significant effect on lung function, time to first exacerbations or 6MWT distance, nor was there a significant difference between groups in overall health status as measured by the SGRQ. These data have implications for the way we approach the treatment of COPD exacerbations and the role of erdosteine in their treatment.</p><p>The RESTORE trial provides further evidence that treatment with oral mucoactive drugs with antioxidant properties can reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations. The primary analysis is statistically significant even if the effect size was smaller than expected, the event rate lower and we had fewer people recruited than those requested by the power calculation. This probably reflects the fact that our original estimates were very prudent and we assumed a higher dropout rate from the trial than we finally observed. There are other recent studies where the exacerbation rate was substantially lower than anticipated [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>As with studies conducted in Asia with other mucolytic drugs, the total event rate was reduced but the time to the first event was not [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similar findings were reported in the initial trials of ICSs in COPD [<xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but not when larger studies were reported [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and so this negative finding may be a function of our study size.</p><p>The reduction in the number of exacerbations we registered was driven largely by a reduction in the number of symptomatic events managed by an increase in bronchodilator use. In clinical practice, these mild symptomatic episodes are frequently seen especially in less advanced COPD stages, and they are usually unreported and consequently untreated with antibiotics and/or corticosteroids [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recent data suggest that these mild events are associated with more healthcare use and worse outcomes, although the economic impact of mild exacerbations alone is likely to be less than moderate or severe events [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The ability of erdosteine to prevent these milder events may improve adverse outcomes associated with exacerbations and merits study over a longer timescale.</p><p>RESTORE was conducted in European patients with a higher background use of ICSs than in earlier trials with mucoactive drugs. Unlike the BRONCUS study where <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine did not reduce exacerbations in ICS-treated patients, we saw no influence of ICS use on the efficacy of erdosteine [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This may reflect the additional effect of erdosteine on bacterial adhesion, but may also be due to the inclusion in our exacerbation definition of some events identified by symptomatic change rather than the use of systemic corticosteroids [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These events are associated with impaired well-being even in relatively mild COPD [<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Differences in the speed of onset and duration of exacerbations have been reported from detailed analysis of home diary card data, with a significant number of events beginning slowly and taking longer to resolve [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The RESTORE study showed that erdosteine reduced the duration of all types of exacerbation, thus providing a longer time free from symptoms between events and reducing the total burden of these events on the patient. Like other drugs in this class, erdosteine had no effect on lung function or walking distance. This reflects the known biological properties of this drug, and suggests that the effects on exacerbation rate and duration were not due to altered lung mechanics.</p><p>There was no difference in respiratory health status as measured by the SGRQ between treatments, although like many other clinical trials there was a substantial improvement in SGRQ score in both treatment groups which may have dwarfed a modest change due to reduced exacerbation prevention. In contrast, the use of reliever treatment fell significantly with erdosteine treatment. Changes in reliever medication use have been seen previously with studies of LABA plus ICS combinations and are usually attributed to the use of a maintenance bronchodilator drug [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This cannot be the explanation here given the lack of impact of erdosteine on lung function, which in any case is not a bronchodilator. Reliever use is a risk factor for subsequent exacerbation, and its reduction with erdosteine is in keeping with the overall physician and patient statements that the treatment was significantly more effective than placebo [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The freedom from adverse events in the erdosteine group did mean that treatment was well tolerated and likely contributed to the low withdrawal rate from the study.</p><p>There are both strengths and limitations to our data. This study was designed and implemented before data from more recent studies were available, and so this study was powered using data from the earlier BRONCUS trial [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The EXACT-PRO methodology to detect milder exacerbations had not been reported when RESTORE began so we have relied on daily diary cards scored by the investigator blind to treatment allocation to define exacerbations [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our method for the detection of the duration of the events was pragmatic, and used information from both diary cards and healthcare utilisation to determine when events began and ended. As expected, milder events were shorter than more severe events and a treatment effect was observed in both. The blinded nature of this evaluation and the study size give us confidence that these observations are likely to be valid.</p><p>We elected not to include patients with very severe COPD in the study and further work is needed to determine whether erdosteine might also be beneficial in this population. Inevitably, the background maintenance therapy used reflects the choices available when the study was conducted and does not take account of more recent treatment approaches, such as dual long-acting bronchodilator treatment [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nonetheless, our patients used more background treatment and specifically ICSs than was the case in earlier studies with mucoactive drugs. There was no bias due to differential withdrawal from the placebo arm or loss of study participants due to unacceptable side-effects [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations was lower than anticipated, there were still significantly more events than reported in recent larger studies where treatment differences were identified [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide evidence that mucoactive drugs, like erdosteine, prevent exacerbations and shorten their duration irrespective of whether ICSs are given. However, the availability of a well-tolerated simply administered orally active treatment like erdosteine should be of value to patients who experience these troublesome episodes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supplementary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00711-2017.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Supplementary material <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ERJ-00711-2017_Supplement.pdf" content-type="local-data">ERJ-00711-2017_Supplement</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="disclosures"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00711-2017.Supp2</object-id><p>P.M.A. Calverley <inline-supplementary-material id="SS2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ERJ-00711-2017_Calverley.pdf" content-type="local-data">ERJ-00711-2017_Calverley</inline-supplementary-material></p><p>A.F.
