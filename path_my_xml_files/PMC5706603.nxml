professional, the institution and the health system. Detailed records help following the
progress of the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition, contributing to the continuity of care and
the planned treatment<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>, providing information to evaluate the care delivered and providing data to
develop health indicators.</p><p>Discussions about the relevance of nursing records and the nursing process came into
greater prominence in the 1950&#x02019;s. However, the importance of nursing records was
expressed by Florence Nightingale in the nineteenth century, when she described, on her
notes, a formal collection process to assess people&#x02019;s health history<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A considerable growth in the computerization of clinical documents took place in the
1990&#x02019;s. However, this is a process gradually developed over time and it is in different
stages of implementation, considering that it requires heavy investment in
infrastructure, incurs high costs of implementation and technical maintenance and also
demands continuous training of its users<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the computerization of nursing records, it is fundamental to define which
standardized language systems (taxonomies) will be used, since they are the guarantee
that the nursing process is visible in electronic health records<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. In addition to favoring the use of structured and standardized methodologies of
data, the use of systematized language allows the interoperability between computerized
systems, among other factors.</p><p>Taxonomies started being used as a way to standardize nursing language in the 1960s.
Since then, several terminologies have been used, mostly in order to improve the quality
of the care provided, which is directly related to the way the diagnosis, intervention
and outcome are registered. The nursing records are continuously improved with the use
of technologies and different communication techniques<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Some researchers identify different educational actions focused on improving the quality
of nursing records<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>

<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, a continuous development of research and interventions addressing
nursing records is important in order to promote its continuous improvement and further
improve the scientific bases associated to practice. Thus, the present study was
designed to assess the impact before and after an educational intervention on the
quality of nursing records.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Quasi-experimental study with before-and-after design, conducted in a philanthropic
hospital complex in the South Region of Brazil, with beds available for the Brazilian
Unified Health System (SUS). The study was carried out from the first semester of 2013
to the last semester of 2015.</p><p>

</p><p>The nursing records registered by a group of eight nurses from a cardiac intensive care
unit were included in this study. The group was composed of all the nurses who worked in
the unit. The nurses were invited to participate in the study and the consent and
participation of 100% of the group was obtained. No socio-demographic characteristics
were investigated as it was not relevant to the present approach to compare nurses or
even to divide them into groups.</p><p>The nursing records included were not computerized, they did not use standardized
language and they were chosen for convenience, that is, all the nursing records
registered by the nurses, in agreement with the collection instrument and available
during the collection period were included. The nursing records contained information
about hospitalized patients who stayed for at least 48 hours in the unit and had their
medical record, history, evolutions and nursing prescriptions recorded during a minimum
period of four days. The evaluation started in the first record (admission or first
evolution). This period is determined according to the recommendations of the Quality of
Diagnosis, Interventions and Outcomes (Q-DIO)<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. There was no collection of patient information, such as age or diagnosis, and
there were no interviews, since those were not the focus of the study or part of the
instrument items. No exclusion criteria were adopted in this study.</p><p>The nursing records selected for convenience were assessed by applying the Q-DIO
instrument in two moments: baseline (data collection 1), applied before the intervention
and at the second data collection, five months after the intervention.</p><p>The purpose of the Q-DIO Brazilian version is to evaluate the quality of the
documentation of nursing diagnoses, interventions and results. It can be used for
electronic or paper records and for nursing records with or without standardized
language. This instrument was developed and validated in 2007 and published in 2009 by
researchers from Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United States of America<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. The Q-DIO version for use in Brazil has been published recently<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. The instrument is a Likert scale composed of 29 items divided in four concepts:
nursing diagnoses as process (11 items), nursing diagnoses as product (eight items),
nursing interventions (three items) and nursing outcomes (seven items). The scores range
from 0 to 2 for all items, 0 being undocumented, 1 partially documented and 2 fully
documented<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

months, with a total of 30 hours in 20 meetings.</p><p>The sessions (interventions) were conducted by a group of five nurses who had a PhD in
nursing, were adjunct professors in the nursing department and researchers in the
subject under study. These nurses had no working relationship with the hospital, only
with the university.</p><p>The first two sessions started with a theoretical approach, focusing on clinical
evaluation and elaboration of diagnoses, interventions and description of results, using
the taxonomies NANDA-I, Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) and Nursing Interventions
Classification (NIC). At that moment, the group of nurses received theoretical-practical
classes, with lectures on the content and discussions about the taxonomies with
explanations and use of books, addressing the structure of each of the taxonomies and
discussing fictional clinical cases.</p><p>The following sessions were conducted based on discussions of actual clinical cases of
hospitalized patients in the unit under study, which were presented by nursing
assistants and debated with the researchers. The methodology used in the case
presentation meetings included strategies for developing critical thinking skills for
nursing diagnoses (or problems) and questioning ability to determine signs and symptoms
in the cases. The sessions also presented suggestions for effective interventions for
the possible etiologies, aiming at achieving better results and, consequently, a better
quality of the records and the care offered.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data were organized and analyzed using the program Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS). Continuous variables were described based on mean and standard
deviation. The categorical variables were described with absolute and relative
frequencies.</p><p>The pre and post-intervention periods were compared by the Student&#x02019;s t-test. The choice
for this test considered the evaluation of the data from the normality test. The results
were considered statistically significant if p &#x0003c;0.05, with a 95% confidence
interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The research was conducted in accordance with the Directives and Norms Regulating
Research Involving Human Beings (CNS Resolution No. 466/12). The project was approved by
the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal Medical Sciences Foundation of Porto Alegre
(CEP-UFCSPA) under protocol (CAAE) number: 20292113.9.0000.5345. Two terms were used:
Data Usage Agreement Form (DUAF), which establishes a commitment to use and preserve the
material and the Consent Form (CF), which establishes the participation of the study
subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Records of 30 patients were evaluated before and after the intervention. The results

questions presented in the items of the Q-DIO. This is indicated by the assessment of
the 29 items, most of which showed a significant increase in the mean values after the
intervention.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that education-focused interventions addressing the nursing

</xref>. A quasi-experimental study conducted in a developing country evaluated 40
nurses using a five-day workshop (with concepts for documentation and use of
standardized language). In this study, our researchers identified that the combination
of education on the use of nursing diagnoses, standardized nursing languages &#x0200b;&#x0200b;and
standardized nursing care plans can improve the documentation of care<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Another study, carried out in Switzerland, assessed the effect of Guided
Clinical Reasoning as a method to improve the quality of records with the implementation
of electronic documentation<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> presents the items
included in the concept Nursing Diagnosis as Process. These items assess the information
provided by the patient or relative during the initial interview or anamnesis performed
by the nurse, usually guided by a script or clinical history.</p><p>The nurses participating in the educational activity, now aware of the improvement of
the nursing quality records necessity, received material in a virtual learning
environment, including classes and other learning materials to guide the different
stages of the nursing process. However, the evaluation of the records registered by
these nurses showed that, among the 11 items of the first phase of the Q-DIO, items 7, 8
and 9 presented low averages, indicating poor quality of the registry, either because it
is incomplete or because it is partially complete. Item 7 assesses information provided
by the patients about their sexual life, and the absence of this piece of information,
in both analyzed moments, serving as an alert of the importance of completing the
nursing record, since this document contributes to the analysis of the nursing diagnosis
hypotheses.</p><p>The information regarding hobbies and leisure activities is assessed in item 8, which
presents a small variation before and after the intervention. Considering that the
patients, whose nursing records were analyzed were hospitalized in a cardiac intensive
care unit, information on sexual life, hobbies and leisure are potentially relevant, as
patients will need post-discharge instructions for their rehabilitation. From this
perspective, the collection of nursing record data will contribute to the processes of
decision making and nursing care plans<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Item 9 presents a question considered as fundamental in care: contact information of
relatives or significant others. However, the nurses in the present study have not been
recording this piece of information. In general, nurses have used the nursing record
partially, prioritizing the collection of data regarding some human needs to the
detriment of others, with emphasis on biological aspects, and even failing to complete
patient and professional identification data. This contributes to the fragmentation of
the care provided and hinders the delivery of a more individualized care<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The analysis of the concept Diagnosis as Product found no significant increase in the
items 12, 16, 18 and 19. Items 12 and 16 can be discussed under the same perspective,
since both address issues fundamental for nursing care and documentation: the
description of the problem and the signs/symptoms. However, these items would only
receive maximum scores if their records were in accordance with NANDA-I<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A systematic review with the main objective of evaluating the studies and evidences
produced according to the five taxonomies validated by the American Nursing Association
(ANA) demonstrated that the NANDA-I taxonomy predominates in studies developed
worldwide, as well as in studies with higher evidence level<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Another study compared the quality of nursing records that used NANDA-I and
International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) using the Q-DIO instrument. The
study identified that the hospital that used NANDA-I in the records presented a better
quality nursing documentation than the other hospital, which used ICNP<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Items 18 and 19 are fundamental, since they address the issue of nursing goals. In the
present study, these items did not show significant improvement and also presented
values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;very close to zero, meaning there were no records of nursing goals. Thus, in
addition to the fact that nurses did not register those topics, they also failed to
describe specific nursing goals for the problems or even achievable objectives through
the registered intervention. The nurse will always have a goal already set by the work
process when facing a nursing problem. However, the nurses rarely document the goal of
the interventions (daily activities). A recent study was developed to assess the records
of patients admitted in the medical clinic of a Brazilian teaching hospital. It revealed
that, despite the fact the records were in compliance with the norms of the Regional
Nursing Council, there were significant flaws related to medical history, physical
examination, absence of date or time, blank spaces, spelling errors and non-standard
abbreviations<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing that investments in permanent and continuing
education are necessary not only to adjust the work process through the systematization
of nursing care, but also to find the factors or conditions that represent difficulties
or solutions for the production of adequate nursing records. </p><p>A Norwegian study pointed out some weaknesses of electronic health records, even among
those implemented more than 15 years ago, highlighting: lack of accuracy and quality,
complicated documentation process, competing interests and lack of functionalities<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. On the other hand, another study that documented the nursing process in six
German hospitals found as the main barriers: lack of motivation, insufficient technology
for data collection at the bedside, low financial benefit at a high cost, failures or
insufficient technology and lack of knowledge of (on) the programs<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, item 20, which addresses naming and evaluation of the
interventions and its accordance with the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC),
presented no significant improvement. This result demonstrates a particularity of the
health institution itself, since it does not use the NIC taxonomy in its interventions.
According to the guidelines of the Q-DIO instrument used in this study, item 20 should
only receive the maximum score when the interventions present in the records are named
according to the NIC<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. It should also be noted that there is no computerized nursing process in the
investigated institution.</p><p>The integration of the nursing process into the electronic health record has the
potential to demonstrate the contribution of nursing to the health of individuals,
raising the visibility of the profession and allowing the measurement of both the
efficacy and the cost of nursing care<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the concept Nursing Outcomes, only item 23 did not present significant
improvement. However, it should be noted that the item already had a high value, and
came close to being classified as fully documented. This item represents an ideal
condition of care, and the evaluation/change of diagnoses daily or shift to shift is a
fundamental part of the continuity of care.</p><p>A study that assessed nursing records and their implications on quality of care pointed
out that the correct filling up of medical records from admission to discharge allows
the nurse auditor, for example, to analyze the processes based on the hospital
accreditation standards and document the indicators in which failures are found. Thus,
it was possible to verify how the nursing records reflected the quality of the nursing
care delivered to the patient and the continuity of the care provided by the nursing
team<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A study carried out in two hospitals with 843 nursing records evidenced that the records
are deficient, do not portray the patient&#x02019;s reality or the nursing care provided and do
not contribute to the development of the nursing process. These data demonstrate that,
in professional practice, nursing care is not always properly documented<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. Also, when assessing continuity of care, the study found differences between
the two hospitals surveyed<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>: in one, there was no logical sequence of information between one registry or
another system which would allow the evaluation of the patient&#x02019;s evolution by any health
professional; in the other, 100% of the analyzed records presented continuity in the
patient information, allowing the evaluation of the evolution of the clinical
conditions<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Thus, different studies have demonstrated weaknesses in the nursing documentation
process<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

records. Therefore, educational actions focused on real clinical cases may have positive
implications for nursing practice.</p><p>It should be noted that, despite the effectiveness of the intervention, a lack of
quality was identified in the evaluated records, revealed by the low mean values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;of
the items and by the weakness of some questions presented in the items, which did not
present a significant increase. From this perspective, new studies focusing on the use
of standardized language can be developed in the researched group. The use of electronic
health record was suggested to the hospital and is in the process of implementation.
Therefore, next studies should incorporate the three items - educational interventions,
use of taxonomies and use of electronic records - in order to effectively improve the
quality of nursing records, thus contributing to an effective, visible, quantifiable and
qualified nursing care. </p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>Refer&#x000ea;ncias</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Griffith</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What to include in a nursing record</article-title><source>Br J Nurs</source><year>2016</year><volume>15</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>520</fpage><lpage>522</lpage><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172499">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27172499</ext-link><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.12968/bjon.2016.25.9.520</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marques</surname><given-names>DKA</given-names></name><name><surname>Souza</surname><given-names>GLL</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>N&#x000f3;brea</surname><given-names>MML</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Conjunto Internacional de Dados M&#x000ed;nimos de Enfermagem: estudo
