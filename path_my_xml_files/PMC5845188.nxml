Undernutrition contributes to around 3.1 million (45%) child deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In South Asia, more than a third of children are stunted and a third of women are underweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Maternal and child undernutrition have adverse consequences for pregnancy outcomes, children&#x02019;s morbidity and mortality, their physical and cognitive development, and the incidence of chronic diseases in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The impacts of undernutrition also extend beyond health, with negative consequences for educational attainment, economic productivity as adults, and human wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">India has made progress in reducing undernutrition, but the prevalence of child undernutrition remains strikingly high: 38% of children under 5 years of age are stunted (height-for-age z-score &#x0003c;&#x02009;-2 standard deviations, SD), 21% are wasted (weight-for-height <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003c;&#x02009;-2 SD), and 58% are anaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, almost a quarter of Indian women aged 15&#x02013;49 are underweight and more than half are anaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Making agriculture work for nutrition</title><p id="Par18">Estimates suggest that implementing ten nutrition-specific interventions, addressing the immediate determinants of undernutrition, at 90% coverage could reduce deaths by 15% and stunting prevalence by 20% among children under 5 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Accelerating reductions in undernutrition will entail coupling nutrition-specific interventions with nutrition-sensitive programs that address the underlying causes of undernutrition in other sectors, such as agriculture, education, and social welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">&#x02018;Making agriculture work for nutrition<italic>&#x02019;</italic> is now a policy priority. The question is: How can it be done?</p><p id="Par20">Agriculture can affect maternal and child nutrition through several interrelated pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, agriculture is a source of income and food, and it has effects on food prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Women&#x02019;s participation and decision-making in agriculture also affect their, and their children&#x02019;s, nutritional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Between 2001 and 2013, more than a dozen literature reviews have sought to understand whether agricultural programs improve nutrition outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These reviews highlighted several critical methodological and evidence gaps, calling for more rigorous, theory-driven evaluations of nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) intervention impacts on nutrition outcomes. The findings of the most recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] testify to a swift response to this call in recent years. Their review finds that NSA interventions show positive impacts on maternal dietary diversity, micronutrient intakes, child wasting and maternal underweight, and reduction in anaemia among mothers and children, but not child stunting. However, there remains a paucity of studies assessing the impact on maternal nutrition outcomes (only two studies in the review assessed maternal anthropometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) and the cost-effectiveness of NSA interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study justification</title><p id="Par21">The review of Ruel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] shows encouraging progress, with the addition of recent studies on nutritional impacts of diverse agriculture interventions such as biofortification, homestead food production, livestock, nutrition-sensitive value chains, and irrigation. This review and several recent global reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] highlight the critical need to continue to develop, improve, and assess innovative NSA approaches in this Decade of Action on Nutrition.</p><p id="Par22">Agricultural extension services aim to foster smallholder farmers&#x02019; access to technical knowledge and information, improve their skills through training and demonstration, and facilitate access to credit and markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Nowadays, these services are also expected to play a broader role in improving rural livelihoods and food security and promoting farming techniques that are not harmful to the environment; these services could also provide a platform to improve nutritional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Most agricultural extension services involve a worker going from door to door in villages and interacting with a select number of people, usually men with larger farms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Studies have shown that many farmers have limited access to extension services and, even when they do, farmers may not adopt extension workers&#x02019; advice if these agents do not possess location-specific, relevant knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Extension workers visit infrequently or erratically, and their information does not reach farmers with the lowest yields, many of whom are women and poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Consequently, agricultural extension programs have been inefficient with mixed impacts on agricultural productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Recognising this, agricultural extension systems in India and worldwide are adopting pluralistic, decentralised, participatory, gender-sensitive, demand-driven approaches to improve coverage and relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A promising innovation is the use of digital platforms that can strengthen the delivery and uptake of extension services in agriculture, even in the poorest settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. One such approach features low-cost participatory videos with women&#x02019;s groups and farmers&#x02019; groups. In a pilot trial involving 16 villages, this approach increased the adoption of promoted agricultural practices sevenfold compared with the traditional extension approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. On a cost-per-adoption basis, the method was ten times more effective per dollar spent than a classical extension system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A trial in the Indian state of Bihar found that this intervention resulted in a 21% increase in agricultural productivity compared with the control areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. By integrating nutrition-sensitive video content to improve yields of nutrient-rich foods, increase incomes, reduce women&#x02019;s workloads, and promote more participation of women in agricultural decision-making, this video approach could leverage these agricultural improvements to improve dietary quality and nutritional status. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether this approach, if made nutrition-sensitive, can improve nutrition outcomes for mothers and children.</p><p id="Par24">As with agriculture, experimentation with digital platforms for health- and nutrition-related behaviour change has gained momentum worldwide. Published literature on the impact of digital interventions to improve nutrition is only just emerging, and the overall quality of evidence remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Participatory interventions integrating mobile phone messages have been shown to improve infant and young child feeding practices in two trials in Nigeria and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Building on this success and on the success of low-cost videos for agriculture, videos with nutrition-specific messages could provide viewers with knowledge and opportunities to adopt new nutrition practices. However, we did not identify any studies that evaluated the impact of any other digital technologies, such as videos shown in women&#x02019;s groups, on undernutrition outcomes.</p><p id="Par25">Another important development relevant to efforts to improve agricultural productivity, health, and nutrition is the spread of participatory women&#x02019;s groups. Participatory interventions with women&#x02019;s groups using a Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) approach have shown large positive impacts on essential newborn care practices and have reduced neonatal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These interventions have also shown large effects on women&#x02019;s nutritional knowledge and dietary diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], but limited impacts on maternal and child nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In PLA groups, women acquire new nutrition knowledge, receive social support from peers and the community, and exercise both problem-solving and decision-making power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Coupled with a nutrition-sensitive, video-based agricultural extension approach, all of these PLA processes could enable women and their families to further capitalise on the nutrition benefits of an NSA intervention.</p><p id="Par26">The challenge of making agriculture work for nutrition is twofold: it involves (1) strengthening agriculture programs in a way that is feasible and can therefore be effectively implemented at scale, and (2) making these programs &#x02018;nutrition-sensitive&#x02019;. The UPAVAN trial (Upscaling Participatory Action and Videos for Agriculture and Nutrition) aims to address this dual challenge by testing the nutritional and agricultural effects of (1) a participatory, NSA extension platform with women&#x02019;s groups viewing videos and follow-up visits and (2) two variants of this intervention, integrating videos on nutrition-specific behaviour change and integrating the PLA methodology. Rigorous assessment of these interventions will determine the effects and cost-effectiveness of NSA extension through participatory, low-cost, video-based approaches on maternal and child nutrition and whether integration of nutrition-specific goals and enhanced participatory approaches can increase these effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par27">This study aims to estimate the nutritional and agricultural impacts and cost-effectiveness of (1) an agricultural extension platform of women&#x02019;s groups viewing and discussing videos on NSA practices, with visits at women&#x02019;s homes or farms to follow up on adoption of new practices shown in the videos (AGRI), (2) women&#x02019;s groups viewing and discussing videos on NSA and nutrition-specific practices, also with follow-up visits (AGRI-NUT), and (3) women&#x02019;s groups viewing and discussing videos on NSA combined with a PLA approach of meetings and nutrition-specific videos, with follow-up visits (AGRI-NUT+PLA).

In each cluster, well-trained data collectors invited a random sample of eligible households to participate in the survey and obtained individual written informed consent from participants.</p><p id="Par82">The household survey comprised questionnaires for women and men (available in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Mothers or female primary caregivers were interviewed about nutrition, health, and empowerment in agriculture. Height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and haemoglobin measurements were taken for each mother-child dyad. A male household member (if possible the caregiver&#x02019;s husband, otherwise a male decision-maker, or a female decision-maker in a female-only household) was interviewed about agriculture and household socio-economic status. In addition, due to the length of the questionnaire and to reduce the burden on respondents, half of the male participants, randomly selected, were asked questions on their empowerment in agriculture while the other half were asked about household consumption and expenditure. The questionnaires were pilot tested before use.</p><p id="Par83">Data collectors, &#x02018;lab technicians&#x02019; (certified to take blood spots), and supervisors were organised into teams and collected data over the 3 months prior to implementation start; this will be repeated for 3 months for the endline survey. Supervisors and lab technicians took anthropometric measurements, and data collectors conducted the rest of the interview. Before data collection, measurements of maternal and child height, MUAC, and haemoglobin concentrations by supervisors and lab technicians were standardised against a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; measurer, and we calculated inter- and intra-technical error of measurement and re-trained weaker teams. Data collectors were given 3 weeks of training, and we standardised the child dietary diversity score by comparing data collectors against a &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; interviewer.</p><p id="Par84">Child length was measured using Seca 417 Infantometers, adult height using Seca 213 Stadiometers, maternal and child weight using PLAX-Cruzer scales, MUAC using MUAC tapes for children and Seca head circumference tapes for adults, and haemoglobin concentrations using HemoCue Hb 301 machines. Severely undernourished children (MUAC &#x0003c;&#x02009;115 mm and/or bilateral pitting oedema) or mothers (MUAC &#x0003c;&#x02009;210 mm or haemoglobin &#x0003c;&#x02009;7 g/dl) were advised to consult the government frontline nutrition worker or Anganwadi worker for referral. Scales were calibrated weekly, and the stadiometers, infantometers, and HemoCues were&#x000a0;calibrated at the start, middle, and end of the survey period. These procedures will be repeated at the endline survey.</p><p id="Par85">The Quality Assurance team completed observation checklists on 10% of households to ensure that teams adhered to protocols, and they took duplicate readings on a subset of questions by revisiting 20% of households to check consistency.</p><p id="Par86">For baseline, anthropometric data were entered using tablets (iBall Slide Snap 4G2) and transferred to a password-protected computer at the field office each day, and the rest of the survey was conducted on paper forms that were stored in a locked office. We reviewed the quality of anthropometric data by checking plausibility of values, digit preference, and missing values. Paper forms were submitted to the Quality Assurance team at the field office for a review of the logic, completeness, and plausibility of values, and errors were resolved by discussion with the data collector or revisit to the household. Data from paper questionnaires were double entered by trained data operators and discrepancies resolved by referring to the original source document.</p><p id="Par87">The same procedures will be applied for the endline survey, although we plan to use tablets for all data capture.</p><p id="Par88">The study team will make the full datasets available in anonymised form within 3 years of project completion. Before depositing into the data repository (LSHTM Data Compass, an institutional research data repository), data will be anonymised to protect participant confidentiality and converted into a file format suitable for long-term access, based on the recommendations of the UK Data Service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analysis plan</title><p id="Par89">The analysis and presentation of results will be in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement for cluster randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Descriptive statistics of demographic and outcome measures at baseline will be tabulated to ascertain any imbalance between arms.</p><p id="Par90">The main analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes will be based on cross-sectional analyses that will compare the outcome at endline between the control arm and each of the intervention arms. All analysis will be carried out on groups as randomised (&#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019;). All analyses will account for the nature of the distribution of the relevant outcome, and results will be presented as appropriate effects sizes (difference in means between arms; odds ratios) with a measure of precision (95% confidence intervals). Generalised estimating equations will be used to account for clustering. Analyses will adjust for baseline by inclusion of the cluster mean of the outcome as a covariate in statistical models.</p><p id="Par91">Unadjusted and adjusted results will be presented for all analyses. Covariates in adjusted analyses will be specified <italic>a priori</italic> and will include the strata (distance to the nearest town and proportion of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes).</p><p id="Par92">This is a multi-arm trial and, to restrict the number of comparisons, no statistical comparisons will be made directly between intervention arms. We will restrict formal testing, and reporting of <italic>p</italic> values, to the primary and secondary outcomes and will only compare each of the intervention arms with the control arm. Thus, no formal adjustment for multiple comparisons will need to be made. All other outcomes will be reported and interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par93">Planned subgroup analyses will include the impact of mothers&#x02019; exposure to the interventions, caste, and wealth. All subgroup analyses will be performed by including a variable (or variables, as appropriate) for the subgroup and its interaction with the treatment in the model. Results will be interpreted with due caution. Full details of all analyses, including any additional covariates to be included in the adjusted models, will be set out <italic>a priori</italic> in a Statistical Analysis Plan that will be uploaded as an appendix prior to the start of the endline survey.</p><p id="Par94">As we will conduct repeat cross-sectional surveys to assess the trial outcomes, loss to follow-up of specific individuals is not an issue. Questionnaire completion rates are expected to be high, so only a small proportion of missing data is expected, and it is unlikely that it will have to be accounted for in any analysis. Sensitivity analyses (such as best- and worst-case scenarios and inverse probability weighting) will be conducted for the primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="Par95">We do not expect any adverse effects of the intervention, but the trial will be monitored for severe adverse events. Information on these events is collected and compiled on a quarterly basis. The principal investigator will review the quarterly severe adverse events report to assess the level of relatedness to intervention. These data, with allocation concealed, will be shared annually with the independent statistician on the Trial Steering Committee for review. If any problems arise, the Trial Steering Committee can request the data to be unblinded. The independent statistician will share his/her assessment in writing with the Trial Steering Committee and research team.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Process evaluation</title><p id="Par96">Our process evaluation has three objectives: (1) to assess the fidelity and quality of the interventions&#x02019; implementation, (2) to clarify mechanisms behind the intervention&#x02019;s effect, and (3) to identify contextual factors associated with variation in effects on the primary outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Assessing fidelity and quality of the intervention&#x02019;s implementation</title><p id="Par97">We will report data on three domains related to fidelity and quality of implementation in the main trial results paper.

We will test intervention workers&#x02019; knowledge during the implementation period and calculate average test scores per arm. Second, we will assess the <italic>quality</italic> of video disseminations and PLA meetings (AGRI-NUT+PLA), including quality of facilitation, through structured observation forms (all intervention arms).

If the final trial analyses detect no effect on the primary and secondary outcomes, this systematic assessment will also allow us to investigate what shortcomings may have compromised the interventions&#x02019; effects.</p><p id="Par104">We will use quantitative and qualitative data sources for the assessment. The intervention monitoring systems and endline survey provide data on exposure to the interventions. The trial&#x02019;s endline survey also provides data on other intermediate outcomes in the theory of change. To further understand women&#x02019;s experiences of, and responses to, the intervention, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 5), mothers of children younger than 2 years (<italic>n</italic> = 5), their husbands (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and mothers-in-law (<italic>n</italic> = 10) per arm, or around a total of 30 interviews in each of the three intervention arms. Participants will be sampled purposively to represent the mix of caste and tribal groups present in the intervention areas. We will supplement the interviews with participant observations in a subsample of three participant observations per arm.</p><p id="Par105">We will conduct around four focus group discussions per arm with women&#x02019;s groups to understand reasons for attendance patterns, the groups&#x02019; ability to plan and implement strategies together, and dissemination of information beyond the group. We will sample women&#x02019;s groups purposively, based on the trial strata and their longevity. We will also conduct two focus group discussions per arm with the frontline UPAVAN implementation staff to understand factors that supported or hindered the interventions&#x02019; implementation. We may also conduct one focus group discussion per arm with key government frontline health and nutrition workers.</p><p id="Par106">We will collect data in two waves of around 3 months each, and may sample additional women or use new data collection techniques if analyses generate questions that require further exploration. A data collection group independent of the implementation team will collect the qualitative data. We will use a thematic approach to data analysis in order to capture themes related to the theory of change and other emergent themes.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Mediation analyses</title><p id="Par107">We will explore the role of four hypothesised mediators of the effects of the interventions on maternal and child nutrition: agricultural production, household income, women&#x02019;s workload, and women&#x02019;s decision-making. Data on these potential mediators will be captured by the endline survey. We will explore, if appropriate, the role of these mediators through causal mediation analyses using the potential outcomes framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Identifying contextual factors associated with variations in outcomes</title><p id="Par108">In addition to the pre-specified subgroup analyses, as a part of the process evaluation we will explore the role of other factors such as women&#x02019;s group longevity associated with primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par109">The economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective, taking into account all costs incurred by the implementing agencies (program costs), community and health care providers, and users or households, and all associated and measurable outcomes or benefits associated with the intervention.</p><p id="Par110">The program costs will be estimated using a combination of activity-based costing and an ingredients approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Program costs will be collected prospectively from the project accounts of all implementing partners. These costs will be entered into an MS Excel data capture tool designed for this purpose. Costs incurred by government frontline workers and community level institutions such as <italic>gram panchayat</italic> (local, elected body of representatives) and health facilities will be collected retrospectively using key informant interviews and publicly available salary information. Costs incurred by households affected by the UPAVAN interventions will be collected using household surveys.</p><p id="Par111">All costs will be estimated from an economic perspective, assessing the full impact on all parties of direct and indirect costs, including time costs and donated goods. All costs will be adjusted for inflation using the Indian Consumer Price Index and converted to International Dollars to adjust for purchasing power parity.</p><p id="Par112">The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-consequence analysis, comparing incremental costs of the interventions and incremental changes in the trial outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Incremental costs and significant outcomes will be listed separately, allowing policymakers to compare the incremental costs with the incremental consequences of the different UPAVAN interventions. Cost-consequence analysis has been recommended for complex interventions, such as UPAVAN, that have multiple health and non-health effects which are difficult to measure in a common unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].

The intervention components are not additive, and therefore the study will not be able disentangle the effects of individual components within arms. The reason is that we kept the number of meetings (video disseminations or PLA) at two per month to minimise the burden on participants and to standardise the number of meetings per month across all intervention arms. Had we made the intervention strictly additive, the number of meetings would have also been additive, making it difficult to distinguish between the effect of the number of meetings and the meeting content.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Study implications</title><p id="Par114">By examining the role of innovative agricultural interventions for improving maternal and child nutrition, the trial will inform ways in which nutrition- and agriculture-related services can be strengthened in rural communities. Specifically, our study will provide robust evidence on (1) the extent to which improving agricultural extension through participatory, low-cost, video-based approaches can improve agricultural productivity and diversity; household income and investments in nutrition-related expenditures; women&#x02019;s decision-making; and reducing women&#x02019;s workload and thus maternal and child nutrition outcomes; (2) whether integration of explicit nutrition-specific messages enhances the impact of agriculture interventions on maternal and child nutrition; and (3) the optimal level of participatory action required to improve nutrition outcomes. The trial will provide insights on whether women&#x02019;s groups can provide an effective platform for integrated agriculture and nutrition interventions. Our process and economic evaluations will provide critical information for translational feasibility and scale-up. The lessons from this trial can be readily adopted at scale in UPAVAN partners&#x02019; existing and future collaborations with non-governmental organisations and governments across South Asia and Africa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial timeline and status</title><p id="Par115">Ethics approvals and informed consent were obtained in October 2016 and clusters were randomised.
