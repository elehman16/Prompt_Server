The mechanism of the angle closure is complex and includes pupillary block and non-pupillary block. Currently, opinion is that laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) alone is not sufficient to prevent disease progression. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIP) is an alternative and effective way of widening the angle recess in eyes that are affected by primary angle closure (PAC). However, it is not known if greater benefit would be achieved using LPI plus LPIP for PAC with multiple mechanisms (MAC). Thus, the aim of this study is to demonstrate if LPI plus LPIP would be more effective than single LPI in controlling the progression of PAC with multiple mechanisms, based on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) classification. A secondary aim is to determine whether or not this would result in the use of less medication and/or prolong the time to antiglaucoma surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multiple-mechanism angle-closure study will comprise a 3-year, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, superiority trial, the aim of which will be to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LPI plus LPIP versus LPI for PAC. It is anticipated that 240 adults, diagnosed with PAC (the mechanism of angle closure will be assessed by UBM and it will be determined whether or not it involves multiple mechanisms) will be recruited from ten ophthalmic centers in China. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either single LPI or LPI plus LPIP. Participant assessment will be designed to test the rate of disease progression and who will be followed up for 3 years. The primary outcome will be the disease progression rate and a comparison will be made between the LPI and LPI plus LPIP groups using Pearson&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to account for the central effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If the LPI plus LPIP is found to significantly decrease the rate of PAC progression, this intervention could potentially be a standard therapy to be used to treat PAC when multiple mechanisms are involved in angle closure. Subsequently, this would have the potential to delay the rate of PAC progression to PACG and delay the time to the administration of antiglaucoma medication or trabeculectomy surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02613013?term=xiulan+zhang&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02613013</ext-link>.

Although angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) only accounts for 26% of all glaucoma, it is expected that angle-closure glaucoma will affect 87% of Asian glaucoma patients, with bilateral blindness recorded in 5.9 million people with ACG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It was found in a population-based study that China has the largest burden of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the suggested initial treatment for primary angle closure (PAC) and early PACG as it eliminates pupillary block, allowing the convex iris to flatten, while widening the anterior chamber angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the pathophysiological features that underlie PAC are complex and include pupillary block and non-pupillary block mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>It was found in our previous ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM)-based study that multiple mechanisms of angle closure were found in approximately 55% of PACG patients. The causes of the angle closure include pupillary block leading to peripheral iris bombe, anterior rotation of the ciliary body, and a thickened and anteriorly located peripheral iris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, LPI alone may not be effective in angle closure caused by multiple mechanisms.</p><p>It was discovered in the Liwan Eye Study and Zhongshan Angle-Closure Prevention Trial that approximately 20% of Chinese eyes with suspected PAC had residual angle closure after single iridotomy and the greater angle width following iridotomy further decreased as time went on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Choi et al<italic>.</italic> followed up eyes with peripheral anterior synechia (PAS) after LPI for a mean of 34.4 months and found that disease progressed in 32% of the eyes due to the existence of a non-pupillary block component in angle closure, i.e., plateau iris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It was shown in a 2-year follow-up study on primary angle closure suspects (PACS) after LPI that roughly 28% of the patients progressed to PAC. A decreasing anterior chamber area was predictive of progression from PACS to PAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Contraction burns to the peripheral iris result from peripheral iridolasty, leading to contraction of the peripheral iris stroma and the creation of a space between the anterior iris surface and the trabecular meshwork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It has also been suggested that this effectively opens up the appositionally closed portions of the drainage angle, even resulting in a synechiolysis effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ritch et al<italic>.</italic> found that laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIP) was highly efficient in eliminating residual appositional closure following LPI caused by plateau iris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that LPI plus LPIP would be more efficacious in opening up the angle closure caused by multiple mechanisms and would provide greater intraocular pressure (IOP) control. It was found in our previous randomized controlled trial that LPI plus LPIP resulted in superior reduction in the PAS surface area than LPI alone in synechial PAC and PACG after 1-year follow-up, although a similar magnitude of IOP reduction was reported for the two interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, a guideline has not been published, nor have any studies been conducted, on the treatment of PAC based on the clinical research associate classification of various mechanisms of angle closure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of LPI plus LPIP versus LPI in reducing the rate of 3-year disease progression in patients with multiple mechanisms of angle closure based on UBM classification.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculations are based on published PAC disease progression with LPI and LPIP treatment. Disease progression is defined as glaucomatous optic nerve injury, increased IOP for which antiglaucoma drugs are required, and PAS progression according to the published clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is assumed that the 3-year PAC progression rate after receiving LPI will be approximately 55%, and the rate for LPI plus LPIP will be 35%, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided test at 5% significance. Thus, allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 240 participants for this study is required (calculated using nQuery Advisor&#x000ae;&#x02009;+&#x02009;nTerim&#x000ae; 3.0 software; Statsols, Boston, MA, USA).

(This system is run by personnel in the Department of Biostatistics, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China), using the IOP as the stratification parameter. Patients will be stratified into a high IOP subgroup (21 mmHg to&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;30 mmHg) and a low IOP subgroup (&#x02264;21 mmHg) since it is likely that IOP will vary in the enrolled PAC participants. This procedure will ensure that there is a nearly equal number of patients in each treatment group early on in the trial and that the investigator will not be able to predict the next treatment assignment. In addition, the number of patients in the high and low IOP arms will almost be equal. The intervention date is the study entry date. Dates for all postoperative follow-up visits will be computed from this date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Blinding</title><p>This study is an open-label trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>The classification of ultrasound biomicroscopy-based angle closure</title><p>Patients who have been diagnosed with PAC will be invited to undergo a UBM examination (SW3200L&#x000ae;; Suowei Electronic Company, Tianjin, China).

Laser treatment, based on the type of angle closure, is reasonable and necessary. A multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial on the optimal laser treatment for PAC is mandatory but is currently lacking. This trial is the first multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effect and safety of LPI plus LPIL, compared with LPI alone, for the treatment of PAC with multiple mechanisms based on UBM classification. The findings are expected to provide evidence that laser treatment for PAC should be based on the mechanism of angle closure.</p><p>Strengths of this trial include the fact that UBM-based angle-closure classification will be used, central randomization will be applied, the IOP will be classified as high and low, and the follow-up will be over a long term (3 years).</p><p>It was found by Jiang et al<italic>.</italic> that a thick peripheral iris was more relevant to a narrow angle configuration, based on UBM images in Chinese patients, although the anterior rotation of the ciliary body and the iris insertion was similar to that in narrow- and wide-angle eyes. However, on the other hand, it was demonstrated that multiple mechanisms were involved in angle closure in Chinese PAC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the use of laser treatment (LPI plus LPIP), based on the UBM classification in the current study, was prudent. Though our previous randomized controlled trial stated that the use of LPI plus PLPI achieved an equivalent reduction in IOP in PAC and PACG, in that study both PAC and PACG patients with PAS were included and the type of angle closure was not classified, which may have influenced the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The classification of angle closure, based on the UBM images, is an issue that requires attention. Since there is no unified guideline on the UBM classification of angle closure, we referred to the previous hospital-based population study and the Liwan Eye Study carried out at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since UBM classification is semiquantitative, we used UBM analysts to avoid possible bias.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment for the MAC study began in November 2015.
