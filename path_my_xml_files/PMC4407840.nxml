The anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin are largely described but its low bioavailability precludes its clinical use. NDS27, a lysin salt of curcumin incorporated in beta-cyclodextrine, has high bioavailability and can be administered by inhalation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inhaled NDS27 on inflammatory cytokines and proteins in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid using a model of neutrophilic airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Airway neutrophilia was induced in eight horses by inhalation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Horses were treated with either inhalation of NDS27 or with placebo in a randomized cross-over design. Broncho-alveolar lavages were performed 6&#x000a0;hours after stimulation with LPS.

From a clinical point of view, the disease is characterized by periods of acute exacerbation that are interspersed by periods of remission when horses are kept away from the causative environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Initiated following exposure to organic dusts, molds, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in hay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], acute exacerbations are characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation, coughing, periods of labored breathing at rest and exercise intolerance due to bronchospasm and mucus accumulation in the airways. The exact immunological processes responsible for the airway hyper-reactivity and the persistent airway inflammation are still under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and several studies have focused on cytokine expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It seems that the equilibrium between pro-and anti-inflammatory factors is disturbed and shifted towards a pro-inflammatory profile. Club cell secretory protein (CCSP) is a recognised inhibitor of inflammation in the lung. Both, the gene expression and protein secretion are depleted in the airways of symptomatic RAO horses compared with control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This finding may reflect the entry of CCSP into luminal neutrophils, potentially inhibiting oxidative burst and enhancing phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Activated neutrophils release oxidative enzymes such as NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NO synthase that are responsible for the <italic>in vivo</italic> generation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen reactive species (RNOS) and several other proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, cathepsin and elastase (ELT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Activation of inflammatory cells by exposure to exogenous stimulants plays a major role to tip the balance towards an excess of RNOS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Recently, the levels of RNOS in RAO-affected and clinically healthy horses have been investigated and the therapeutic use of agents that may reduce the oxidative stress has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One of these potential agents is curcumin, a natural phenolic compound, which has largely documented anti-inflammatory properties (for review see Prasad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). It has been shown that curcumin has the ability to reduce the production of RNOS by stimulated neutrophils through acting as an RNOS scavenger but also as a direct inhibitor of MPO and NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A highly water-soluble form of curcumin called NDS27 was developed by our team (WO 2009144220 A1). NDS27 is a combination of a salt of curcuminoid derivative and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. As curcumin, NDS27 has the ability to inhibit the oxidant response of neutrophils and the activity of MPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>NDS27 has been investigated in RAO-affected horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Inhalation with NDS27 resulted in decreased neutrophil percentages and reduced myeloperoxidase concentration in broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) relative to sham-treated horses.</p><p>LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of RAO in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and lung inflammation in other species. Experimental inhalation of LPS is commonly used as a model of neutrophilic lung inflammation mimicking natural disease. Inhaled endotoxins are an important cause of human pulmonary disease, with the severity of pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms experienced by subjects exposed to organic dusts being related to the endotoxin concentration in the inhaled dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consistent with endotoxin inhalation studies in humans and other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], inhalation of 20, 200 and 2000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g soluble <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> Ra60 LPS induced a dose-dependent airway neutrophilia, with BALF neutrophil numbers increasing approximately 50-fold in heaves horses at 6&#x000a0;h after the high dose challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The horses&#x02019; susceptibility to develop airway inflammation, as well as the ease by which the airway inflammation can be induced in healthy horses, make the horse an ideal model for testing drugs by inhalation. Although not very popular compared to murine models of respiratory disease, horses have some considerable advantages over smaller laboratory animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Horses naturally develop heaves which is characterized by stable dust-induced inflammation, bronchospasm, and remodelling. Horses can be evaluated during well-controlled natural antigen exposure allowing the study of disease mechanisms in the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. Further, the disease can be followed over longer periods to evaluate the cumulative effect of repeated episodes of clinical exacerbation and of long-term treatment. Horses can easily be exposed to inhalation challenges and repeated broncho-alveolar lavages can be performed in the same animal. LPS challenge and especially naturally occurring heaves share similarities with the human asthma and the equine model is currently being used to evaluate airway remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to test the effect of NDS27 on the BALF concentration of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, the neutrophil enzymes MPO and elastase, and the anti-inflammatory protein CCSP in an equine model of LPS-induced lung neutrophilia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional committee of animal use (Commission d&#x02019;Ethique Animale de l&#x02019;Universit&#x000e9; de Li&#x000e8;ge, Protocol 11-1137). Eight clinically healthy adult Standardbred horses with no history of RAO were included in this study. All horses were maintained on pasture for at least two months without supplementation of hay and underwent a thorough physical examination, complete blood count and airway endoscopy before the beginning of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The control BALs were performed on eight horses without any treatment while they were kept on pasture (CTRL). Three weeks later, the horses were randomly assigned to both stimulation and placebo (STIM) or both stimulation and treatment (NDS27) groups. After a washout period of three weeks horses received the other treatment.</p><p>Horses of both groups were challenged with 2&#x000a0;mg of LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium) diluted in 4&#x000a0;ml of NaCl (0.9%) given via inhalation (SaHoMa, Nebu-tec, Germany) at T0. They received placebo or treatment at one hour before and two and four hours after challenge. Each dose of NDS27 contained 4&#x000a0;mg of curcumin, 49.8&#x000a0;mg of hydroxy-propylbeta-cyclodextrin and 1.1&#x000a0;mg of lysine base. Each dose of the placebo treatment contained 49.8&#x000a0;mg of hydroxy-propylbeta-cyclodextrin and 1.1&#x000a0;mg of lysine base. Each dose was diluted in 4&#x000a0;ml of NaCl 0.9% before administration by inhalation (Flexineb, Nortex, UK).

A broncho-alveolar catheter (BAL catheter 240&#x000a0;cm, Surgivet, Smith Medical, Zaventem, Belgium) was introduced naso-tracheally and forwarded until it became locked in a bronchus. Warmed sterile saline solution (240&#x000a0;ml) was injected and gently aspirated. The amount of recovered fluid was recorded. From the recovered fluid, 9&#x000a0;ml were transferred to an EDTA-tube and centrifuged. The supernatant was kept frozen at-20&#x000b0;C until analyses. A different aliquot served for determination of total nucleated cell count with the help of a Thomas chamber. From the original BAL sample 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L were used to generate a centrifuged slide (Cytospin, Terumo, Belgium) that was Giemsa-stained.

Several studies have shown that inhalation of LPS led to increased neutrophil counts and increased neutrophil ratios in BALF six hours after the challenge in healthy horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Concentration of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was increased in the BALF from horses challenged by LPS, although these changes were lower than in horses challenged with hay dust solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. LPS inhalation increases the concentration of metallo-matrix proteinases in BALF suggesting their role in tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharides are TLR4 agonists that activate NF&#x003ba;B dependent cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as well as induce release of TNF-&#x003b1; from macrophages. TNF-&#x003b1; is also responsible for neutrophil recruitment. In the present study, inhalation of LPS induced significant increases in the mean percentage of neutrophils, and in the mean concentrations of MPO, ELT, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in BALF when compared to control values. This finding is largely consistent with findings of earlier studies and underlies the usefulness of the universal model of LPS-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation. The neutrophilic enzymes MPO and ELT have not previously been studied in an LPS model in horses but MPO has been measured in BALF of horses naturally affected by RAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; as well as in BALF of LPS-challenged rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the present study no change in IL-1&#x003b2; was induced by stimulation with LPS aerosol. This is contradictory to previous studies in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] but can be explained by insufficient sensitivity of the ELISA kit for detection of IL-1&#x003b2; in un-concentrated BALF. A potential effect of NDS27 on IL-1&#x003b2; could, therefore, not be investigated. Unfortunately, more sensitive methods such as real time polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR) were not performed in the present study. PCR analysis would have also allowed investigation of other cytokines and degranulation markers such as matrix metalloproteinases.</p><p>We have previously showed that inhalation of NDS27 attenuates pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation in RAO-affected horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It was hypothesized that NDS27 mediated pro-apoptotic mechanisms inhibited the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B or decreased the neutrophil efflux into the lung. In the present work, the effect of inhaled NDS27 on inflammatory cytokines and enzymes in the BALF of horses submitted to a LPS-model of neutrophilic airway inflammation was evaluated. Treatment with NDS27 significantly reduced MPO, active MPO and ELT concentrations in BALF, compared to the non-treated group, while it had no significant effect on neutrophil recruitment. The previous study was performed on naturally affected RAO-horses, which are mainly suffering from signs of persistent airway inflammation. Horses had reduced relative neutrophil counts after one week of twice daily NDS27 treatment. Comparing the results of both studies, hay-dust induced RAO and LPS-induced lung neutrophilia, it seems that NDS27 is more effective in clearing persistent inflammation than impeding initial neutrophil recruitment.</p><p>Numerous studies showed that curcumins have the ability to control the inflammatory response via either the inhibition of the release or expression of inflammatory cytokines such Il-6, TNF- &#x003b1;, or by decreasing the activity and release of inflammatory enzymes. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that curcumin regulates activation of some receptors and transcription factors such as TLR4, activating protein-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B in stimulated monocytes and alveolar macrophages, thereby blocking expression of cytokine gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Down-regulation of intercellular signalling proteins, such as protein kinase C, may be another way in which curcumin inhibits cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Additionally, the soluble form of curcumin abolished the stimulating effect of LPS on neutrophil stimulation and even decreased the release of two enzymes considered as typical markers of neutrophils stimulation such MPO and ELT. It was showed that the binding site for curcumin overlaps with the binding site for LPS and that curcumin binds at submicromolar affinity to the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2), which is the LPS-binding component of the endotoxin surface receptor complex MD-2/TLR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Since NDS27 could also enter the neutrophil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], it is not excluded that the molecule could interfere with other intracellular pathways involved in the cascade of NADPH activation and degranulation. Beside a scavenging effect of curcumin and NDS27 on RNOS produced by neutrophils, our recent <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that curcumin had the ability to inhibit the assembly and activity of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase and that curcumin and its soluble form inhibited the release and the activity of MPO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, treatment with NDS27 was initialised before stimulation with LPS27, which is not reflecting clinical conditions where insult would happen before the treatment. However, in experimental settings it is not uncommon to start treatment before the challenge with LPS. This has been done in a study, where curcumin was administered one hour before the administration of LPS in order to induce acute lung injury in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Pre-treatment with curcumin reduced neutrophil recruitment, MPO activity, TNF-&#x003b1; concentration, and capillary leakage in response to LPS challenge when compared to treatment with placebo. Interestingly, treatment with curcumin performed almost as good as standard dexamethasone treatment. The rationale for investigating the effect on CCSP was based on its potent anti-inflammatory properties as demonstrated in several studies. Glucocorticoids are largely considered as mainstay therapy for equine RAO and are known to act on the CCSP promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It has been shown previously that LPS decreases expression of CCSP in lung tissue and that this decrease is attenuated by pretreatment with plant-derived antioxidants such as polydatin, a natural precursor of resveratrol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, CCSP production is likely reduced in horses only as a result of long-standing lung inflammation and reduction in the number of Club cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; therefore, absence of significant changes within a few hours after treatment was not unexpected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The main effect observed in this study is that NDS27 reduced neutrophil activation of LPS-induced airway inflammation, which subsequently reduced the oxidative and proteolytic enzyme concentrations in the BALF.
