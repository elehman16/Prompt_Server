After written informed consent was obtained, 80 children (age range, 4 to 16 y) scheduled for the Nuss procedure at Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University between October 2013 and October 2014 were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomization to receive either UG-ICNBs or conventional PCIA for postoperative analgesia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Assignments were enclosed in sealed opaque envelopes before the operation. The exclusion criteria were as follows: requirement for additional surgery, history of analgesic administration (eg, opioids, acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) 24 hours before premedication, history of coagulation disorders or allergy to local anesthetics, history of renal insufficiency or an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status that was higher than II, inability to understand PCIA device use, or parental objection to ICNBs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.

After peripheral intravenous catheterization, anesthesia was induced by midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, propofol 3 mg/kg, fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration, 2%) in oxygen-nitrous oxide (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.5). Intravenous remifentanil (0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) was continuously injected for intraoperative analgesia. Before recovery, patients received intravenous ondansetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg/kg. Isotonic saline was used for intraoperative fluid maintenance.</p><p>After induction, an ultrasonographic probe (M-Turbo with the L25&#x000d7; transducer; SonoSite Inc.) was used to scan laterally from the midaxillary line to identify the required anatomic landmarks, while the patients were in a supine position. The ribs were identified as hyperechoic streaks, while the pleura appeared as hyperechoic lines between and below the ribs. In the UG-ICNBs group, 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was introduced at the level of the incision using a 22-G short-bevel needle placed in-plane. Anesthetic agent spread was monitored by ultrasonography. The needle was advanced until the distal tip was just superficial to the pleura. A tissue plane between the internal and innermost intercostal muscles was delineated as the local anesthetic agent. Expansion of this potential space indicated appropriate spread (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Normal saline solution (0.9%) was injected in the PCIA group. This procedure was repeated bilaterally in one space above and one space below. Accordingly, a total of 6 injections were administered to each patient. All nerve blocks were administered by the same, experienced anesthesiologist (S.S.). Postoperatively, the PCIA group received PCIA with fentanyl, while the UG-ICNB group received normal saline solution for 48 hours. The patients and health care personnel were blinded to the groups. For the PCIA regimen, the pump was programmed with a basal infusion of 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, bolus dose of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg, and lockout interval of 10 minutes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Total Volume of Local Anesthetic Used by Patient Weight</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ajp-33-604-g002"/></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Ultrasound image of the landmarks and local anesthetic injection for ultrasonography-guided bilateral intercostal nerve blocks.

Postoperative FPS-R scores were reduced for the first 6 hours and opioid consumption decreased during the first 24 hours in the UG-ICNBs group. The patients in the UG-ICNBs group also showed a decrease in postoperative opioid-related adverse effects and length of PACU stay.</p><p>Besides conventional PCIA regimens, epidural analgesia is also effective in controlling pain after the Nuss procedure. However, for many practitioners, the risk of potential permanent neurological injury may outweigh these benefits.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The addition of thoracic epidural analgesia is considered an independent risk factor for permanent neurological injury.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Of the 5 reported cases of permanent neurological injury associated with thoracic epidural analgesia in pediatric patients, 3 were undergoing Nuss repair.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In addition, epidural analgesia is associated with side effects such as pulmonary complications, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, and technique failure.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These observations have raised concerns about the safety of thoracic epidural analgesia in combination with the Nuss procedure, particularly in children.</p><p>Numerous studies have been published since 1987, when Shelly and Park<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> first reported ICNBs techniques in children. However, minimal data are available for UG-ICNBs; no randomized controlled trials have been published describing UG-ICNBs success rates, analgesic effects, or complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use UG-ICNB techniques for pediatric patients undergoing the Nuss procedure. Preoperatively administered ICNBs may block noxious afferent inputs from the surgical site to the CNS and decrease CNS sensitization. Meanwhile, local anesthetic infiltration of the dominant peripheral nerve area at the surgical site has been found to decrease the inflammatory reaction and subsequent pain.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, ICNBs may also cause some side effects. Pneumothorax is a common concern with ICNBs, but the reported incidence is low at 0.073%.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Other complications of ICNBs may include penetration of the peritoneum and abdominal viscera, and Horner syndrome.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For these reasons, ICNBs require greater expertise to avoid potential complications. Fortunately, rapid advances in ultrasonography techniques allow anesthesiologists to deliver the local anesthetic or other drugs to the desired location. In the present study, all blocks were performed by an experienced anesthesiologist (S.S.) who had administered more than 200 UG-ICNBs. This might explain why there were no associated complications.</p><p>Previous studies have examined the analgesic effects of conventional<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and ultrasound-guided<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> ICNBs in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> open cholecystectomy,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> breast surgery,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and the Nuss procedure.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> They demonstrated that ICNBs could decrease pain intensity and improve the health-related quality of life in the immediate postoperative period. Lukosiene et al<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> evaluated the effects of conventional techniques for ICNBs on acute pain after the Nuss procedure and showed that ICNBs decreased visual analog scale scores for up to 3 hours and morphine dose for up to 6 hours after surgery, which provided evidence for using the ultrasound device in the present study. Furthermore, the success rates for conventional approaches are highly dependent on operator skills and are associated with potential serious complications.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Therefore, these blocks are often underutilized despite potential benefits with regard to patient outcomes. Qi et al<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of an ultrasound-guided bilateral thoracic paravertebral block for postoperative pain control in children undergoing the Nuss procedure, and showed that the ultrasound-guided bilateral thoracic paravertebral block improved postoperative analgesia compared with PCIA and decreased the incidence of postoperative behavioral disturbance. The use of ultrasound guidance provides real-time information about the needle tip location and local anesthetic delivery to the desired location,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which has also been demonstrated to improve success rates for ilioinguinal and transversus abdominis plane blocks, decrease the volume of local anesthetic solution, and avoid inadvertent needle trauma to surrounding structures.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In summary, ultrasound guidance could increase the accuracy and efficacy of nerve blocks and decrease the incidence of complications.</p><p>We compared FPS-R scores obtained at defined intervals. This scale shows a close linear relationship with the visual analog pain scales used and has been validated for children aged 4 to 16 years.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Accordingly, we used this age range as an inclusion criterion and compared the efficacy of 2 different analgesia regimens. Furthermore, pain after the Nuss procedure is determined by several factors, such as deformity severity<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and patient age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A single injection may not cover all nerve segments and may be inadequate for inhibiting the noxious stimuli of the Nuss procedure. We administered bilateral multiple ICNBs, which can inhibit noxious stimuli more effectively. Moreover, we administered local anesthesia before initiation of the Nuss procedure. The patient may benefit from pre-emptive analgesia and be spared from the noxious stimuli of surgery.</p><p>Ropivacaine, a relatively long-acting local anesthetic with superior postoperative analgesic effects compared with those of lidocaine, has been used for pediatric ilioinguinal nerve blocks,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and is a well-tolerated regional anesthetic with an efficacy that is broadly similar to that of bupivacaine. However, it may be a preferred option for the management of postoperative acute pain because of a lower propensity for motor blockade, and less neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Compared with bupivacaine and lidocaine, ropivacaine is likely to provide a longer duration of anesthesia in digital nerve blocks.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Further studies are required to clarify whether similar findings could be obtained for ICNBs. In the present study, UG-ICNBs decreased FPS-R scores for up to 6 hours and opioid consumption for up to 24 hours after surgery as compared with PCIA. To provide more satisfactory postoperative analgesia, the feasibility of applying longer-acting local anesthetics such as neosaxitoxin or adding epinephrine to ropivacaine for UG-ICNBs should be further investigated.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, pain after the Nuss procedure was highly variable. This was determined by several factors such as deformity severity<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and patient age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We did not make further comparisons of analgesia effectiveness or side effects in young children or older adolescents. Second, we did not directly compare bilateral UG-ICNB techniques with conventional (unguided) ICNBs. Third, we focused on analgesic management with opioids and did not use benzodiazepines or antiepileptics to counter muscle spasms or neuropathic components, respectively. Lastly, we were interested in acute pain control; investigating long-term analgesic effects and life assessments such as rehabilitation time might provide more information. Further studies are necessary to improve the duration of ICNBs and determine the effect of ICNBs on chronic pain after the Nuss procedure in children.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that UG-ICNBs are more effective than PCIA for postoperative analgesia in children who undergo the Nuss procedure for PE during the acute postoperative period.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>M.L. and X.L. contributed equally.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grosen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfeiffer-Jensen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pilegaard</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name></person-group>
