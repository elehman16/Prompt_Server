Awake fiberoptic intubation (AFOI) is one of the principal techniques guaranteed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines to manage these difficult situations.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Therefore, the selection of an ideal agent that can efficiently sedate the patient without compromising the patency of the airway is very important for AFOI procedures done for oral cancer patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Several sedative agents have been used successfully for conscious sedation during AFOI such as dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, remifentanil, propofol, ketamine, and benzodiazepines.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist with central action on presynaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> receptors, resulting in a negative feedback decreasing the availability of epinephrine and norepinephrine on postsynaptic &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> receptors.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In addition, it has an antisialagogue action which is beneficial in AFOI.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Opioids such as remifentanil, sufentanil, and fentanyl had been used in this procedure (AFOI) in previous clinical trials as they can blunt sympathetic response to intubation resulting in more hemodynamic stability and more comfort to the patient during intubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Some authors successfully used dexmedetomidine as a single agent for sedation during AFOI,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and others combined it with other agents as a trial to improve its sedation criteria,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but the combination of fentanyl with dexmedetomidine was not used before.</p><p>To establish a better safe regimen of sedation while maintaining patency of airway, we assumed that the addition of a small dose of fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) can improve the sedative criteria of dexmedetomidine in the form of improving tolerance of the oral cancer patients to intubation during AFOI technique, without the need to increase the dose of dexmedetomidine which may be associated with airway compromise. We conducted this study to evaluate this assumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from the Local Ethics Committee and written informed consent, 150 ASA physical status 1 and 2 patients were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were ages from 18 to 60 years old and surgeries dealing with oral cancer with a plan for awake nasal fiberoptic intubation as an airway management technique to deal with the difficult airway situation in these patients. This study was carried out at the National Cancer Institute&#x02013; Cairo University.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were respiratory, hepatic, renal, neurological or psychiatric diseases, pregnancy, bradycardia (heart rate [HR] &#x0003c;60 beats/minute) or any type of A-V block demonstrated in electrocardiogram (ECG), uncontrolled hypertension, morbid obesity, bleeding disorder with contraindication for nasal intubation, known allergy to one of the study medications, and lack of cooperation or effective communication.</p><p>The awake fiberoptic technique was applied on all patients by the same single anesthesiologist who was unaware of the type of medication given to each patient. Observations were recorded by another anesthesiologist who was also unaware of the type of medication given to each patient.</p><p>After fasting for more than 6 h, all patients were premedicated 30 min before the procedure by metoclopramide 10 mg intravenous (i.v.), ranitidine 50 mg i.v., and atropine 0.3 mg i.v.</p><p>Randomization occurred before entry to the operating theater using a computer-generated random numbers concealed in sealed opaque envelopes assigning the patients into three groups (Group D1, Group D2, and Group DF).</p><p>After entry to operating theaters, routine multichannel monitoring devices were conducted to all patients where baseline hemodynamic variables as HR, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and ECG were recorded. Then, an i.v. line was established and administration of 500 cc lactated ringer infusion started.</p><p>In the operating theater, every patient received his medication as i.v. infusion for 20 min according to the assignment done before as follows: (1) Group D1: Received an infusion of 1 &#x003bc;cg/kg dexmedetomidine diluted in 50 ml saline. (2) Group D2: Received an infusion of 2 &#x003bc;cg/kg dexmedetomidine diluted in 50 ml saline. (3) Group DF: Received an infusion of 1 &#x003bc;cg/kg dexmedetomidine added to 1 &#x003bc;cg/kg fentanyl diluted in 50 ml saline.</p><p>Oxymetazoline nasal drops were applied to both nostrils as a vasoconstrictor to decrease the risk of bleeding. A nasal pack soaked with lidocaine 2% and adrenaline 1/200,000 was placed in the nostril selected for the fiberoptic intubation which was the nostril that was less resistant to the nasal pack, while the other nostril received oxygen insufflation through a nasal cannula with oxygen flow 4 L/min. Lidocaine 2% nebulizer was given to all patients for at least 10&#x02013;15 min.</p><p>Airway manipulation started 20 min after the administration of the study drugs. A lubricated spiral tube (7.0 mm diameter in males and 6.5 mm diameter in females) was loaded in the fiberoptic scope after softening of the tube by immersing it in warm water. Airway manipulation started using the spray as you go technique to intensify the topical anesthesia. With visualization of the supraglottic region, 2 ml lidocaine 2% was given through the working channel of the scope, and the manipulation of the scope was performed until visualization of the vocal cords, where 4 ml lidocaine 2% was sprayed in both glottic and infraglottic regions. After that the device was passed through vocal cords, and then the tube was advanced over the scope up to 2&#x02013;3 cm above the carina. After confirmation of the proper position of the tube by capnography and visualization of the carina by the scope, the cuff was inflated and the tube was secured in place. Then, general anesthesia was carried out by propofol 2 mg/kg, rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg, and fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;cg/kg, and mechanical ventilation was applied.</p><p>Atropine 0.5 mg i.v. was given during any recorded bradycardia episode and crystalloid infusion and ephedrine increments of 10 mg were planned to be given to treat any hypotensive episode throughout the procedure.</p><p>Oxygen insufflation through the oxygen port of the scope was planned to correct any episode of hypoxia (oxygen saturation &#x0003c;90%) occurring during the procedure. If this was not enough, temporary removal of the scope and bag mask ventilation with oxygen 100% took place.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Primary outcome measurements</title><p>(1) Airway obstruction score was evaluated using a 3-degree scale (1 = no airway obstruction, 2 = airway obstruction relieved by neck extension, and 3 = airway obstruction requiring jaw thrust).

Increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine (2 &#x003bc;cg/kg) was associated with increased risk of airway obstruction more than a small dose of dexmedetomidine or the combination of small doses of both fentanyl and dexmedetomidine.</p><p>The aim of ideal sedation during AFOI is to achieve smooth patient tolerance of the technique through blunting of airway reflexes and attenuating the hemodynamic sympathetic response to intubation, while simultaneously achieving adequate cooperative and spontaneous breathing through a safe patent airway.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was reported by Abdelmalek <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 to be used successfully for sedation during a series of AFOI in patients with a difficult airway,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and subsequently, dexmedetomidine has been proved to be efficient in sedation during AFOI in multiple clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Inhibition of sympathetic pathway involved in &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> receptors done by dexmedetomidine explains its action of decreasing HR and blood pressure. This action is very useful in attenuating the hemodynamic sympathetic response done in AFOI specially after intubation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Inhibition of sympathetic supply of upper airways by dexmedetomidine results in blunting of airway reflexes, with more comfort to patients during intubation, and this is very helpful in allowing smooth intubation and easy ensuring of endotracheal tube position[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and this explains the favorable outcomes during intubation.</p><p>Increase of norepinephrine production in response to anxiety and stress is done mainly in locus ceruleus which is a pontine nucleus. Locus ceruleus is the principal site of action of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists, unlike other gamma-aminobutyric acid mimetic drugs that act mainly on cerebral cortex. This explains the unique advantage of dexmedetomidine in efficient sedation while the patient is still arousable and cooperative.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The ideal dose of dexmedetomidine should be high enough to blunt airway reflexes and achieve good sedation but not to the extent that results in airway relaxation and collapse which are very critical in such oral cancer patients. This optimum dose is still uncertain.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In a clinical trial to reach to this ideal dose, Dhasma compared two different doses of dexmedetomidine: 1 &#x003bc;cg/kg and 1.5 &#x003bc;cg/kg, and he found that both doses can produce effective sedation with protection of airway reflexes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we compared the first standard dose (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) with a higher dose (2 &#x003bc;cg/kg) to demonstrate if increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine to that level can still cause more favorable outcomes, but we found that at this high dose a significant undesirable increase in the possibility of airway obstruction was found despite improvement in limb movement scores during intubation. The increasing scores of airway obstruction in Group D2 in this study did not result in oxygen desaturation as it was managed by airway opening maneuvers as chin lift and jaw thrust.</p><p>It was mentioned that high dose of dexmedetomidine could cause bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and atrial fibrillation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, we found only bradycardia that was managed easily by atropine.</p><p>Fentanyl was compared with dexmedetomidine for sedation during AFOI in several previous clinical trials. In 2010, when a small dose of fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) was compared with a small dose of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) by Chu <italic>et al</italic>., a better tolerance to intubation was found in the favor of dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In 2015, Mondal <italic>et al</italic>. compared the same low dose of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) with a higher dose of fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;cg/kg), and they found that this higher dose of fentanyl caused more airway obstruction and consequent oxygen desaturation; however, still dexmedetomidine provides a more desirable tolerance to intubation in the form of less cough scores.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, we combined the low dose of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) with a low dose of fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) to avoid respiratory depression associated with the use of fentanyl in Mondal <italic>et al</italic>. trial.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the limitations of this study might be the relatively small sample size that could not show a statistical difference between groups (if actually present in population) regarding intubation comfort scores. Another limitation is the absence of a postoperative feedback from the patients measuring their satisfaction about the sedation regimen used during their intubation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In brief, increasing the dose of dexmedetomidine to 2 &#x003bc;cg/kg can result in more possibility of airway obstruction; however, this high dose achieves good intubation scores similar to that achieved by the use of a combination of low doses of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl. The addition of a low dose fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;cg/kg) to a low dose of dexmedetomidine results in improvement of limb movement scores during intubation with preservation of airway patency.</p><sec
