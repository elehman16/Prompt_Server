Critically ill patients with acute kidney injury are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism and yet are often excluded from these trials. We hypothesized that for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, a dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily would improve thromboprophylaxis without increasing the risk of bleeding. In addition, we seek to utilize urine output prior to discontinuing dialysis, and low neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in dialysis-free intervals, as markers of renal recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In a multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled trial in progress at three intensive care units across Denmark, we randomly assign eligible critically ill adults with acute kidney injury into a treatment (1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily) or control arm (40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily) upon commencement of continuous renal replacement therapy.</p><p>We calculated that with 133 patients in each group, the study would have 80% power to show a 40% reduction in the relative risk of venous thromboembolism with 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 67 patients have been included in each group.</p><p>Enrolment began in March 2013, and will continue for two years. The primary outcome is the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. Secondary outcomes include anti-factor Xa activity, bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, filter lifespan, length of stay, ventilator free days, and mortality. We will also monitor neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and urine volume to determine whether they can be used as prognostic factors for renal recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Critically ill unit patients with acute kidney injury present a particular challenge in the provision of thromboprophylaxis. This study hopes to add to the growing evidence that the existing recommendation of 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin is inadequate and that 1&#x000a0;mg/kg is both safe and effective for thromboprophylaxis.</p><p>In addition, the study seeks to identify predictors of renal recovery allowing for the proper utilization of resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>EU Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2012-004368-23/DK">2012-004368-23</ext-link>, 25 September 2012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Enoxaparin</kwd><kwd>Thromboprophylaxis</kwd><kwd>Critically ill patients</kwd><kwd>Anti-factor Xa activity</kwd><kwd>Deep vein thrombosis</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary embolism</kwd><kwd>Acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>Continuous renal replacement therapy</kwd><kwd>Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin</kwd><kwd>Renal recovery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Approximately 30% of critically ill patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) develop acute kidney injury (AKI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Biomarker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is associated with the development of AKI, the need for dialysis, and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite ICU patients receiving recommended doses of prophylactic low- molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), between 5 and 15.5% develop proximal leg deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. ICU patients with AKI frequently have activated coagulation pathways triggered by increased tissue factor and fibrinogen, reduced fibrinolysis, activation of endothelial surfaces, and thrombocytes. Thus such patients have a four-fold higher risk for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with ICU patients without renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Critically ill patients with AKI are also predisposed to bleeding because of uremic platelet dysfunction, coagulopathies, and comorbidities. However many bleeding episodes are deemed as minor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Major or fatal bleeding is very rare in the ICU, whereas VTE is relatively more common. VTE may not be detected in the ICU patient population as the symptoms are often minimal or atypical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In many studies high-dose enoxaparin yields high peak and trough anti-factor Xa (anti-X<sub>a</sub>) values, but no increase in bleeding complications regardless of the degree of renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A delay in starting thromboprophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients on the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the risk-benefit ratio seems to favor use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, we showed that a weight-based dose of enoxaparin subcutaneous (sc) once daily (QD) contrary to the standard dose of 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin sc QD yielded satisfactory levels of anti-X<sub>a</sub> for critically ill patients, was more likely to maintain anti-X<sub>a</sub> levels within the therapeutic range for longer periods of time and did not result in bioaccumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to reduce the incidence of VTE among AKI patients on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) by using 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin sc QD, versus the standard dose of 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin sc QD. We hypothesized that higher doses of enoxaparin would optimize thromboprophylaxis without increasing the risk of bleeding in these patients. Secondary objectives of the trial include examining the utility of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels and urine output as predictors of renal recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted at three ICUs across Denmark to assess whether a dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin versus standard dose of 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin will improve thromboprophylaxis in AKI patients on CRRT, without increasing the risk of bleeding. We will randomly assign eligible critically ill adults with AKI into a treatment arm (1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin sc QD) or a control arm (40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin sc QD) upon commencement of CRRT. The sample population will consist of 133 patients from ICUs at Odense University Hospital (OUH), Svendborg Hospital, and SVS Esbjerg Hospital. An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 67 patients have been included in each group. Enrolment began in March 2013 and will continue until March 2015. Patients will be followed until either: (1) a combination of VTE and renal recovery, (2) a combination of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and renal recovery, (3) ICU death or discharge, or (4) change from continuous to intermittent dialysis. Investigators will obtain consent for the collection of data on treatments and outcomes for participants who withdraw prematurely from the project. Many of the current investigators have participated in other trials and, as such, have a proven track record with respect to enrolment and follow-up of participants and collecting complete data sets. We will document the reasons for missing data, collect auxiliary variables that may predict outcome and/or determine which patients are more susceptible to dropout, and follow-up on all such patients until 24&#x000a0;hours after the last dose of enoxaparin.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval for this protocol was obtained from the Danish national scientific ethical committee (reference number: 1210528) and the study was also approved by Danish Health and Medicines Authority (reference number: 2012100176) (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

Patients, family members, clinicians, research personnel, radiologists, laboratory technicians, and the trial biostatistician will all be unaware of study-group assignments. They will remain blinded until the study database is locked at the end of the trial. Nurses who administer the drug will be the only party privy to the actual dose given to each patient as it is impossible to prepare an enoxaparin dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg beforehand. In the event of an emergency (major bleeding, need for major surgery), a participant&#x02019;s allocated intervention may be revealed to the attending duty physician by the nurse providing care for that participant. The actual allocation will not be disclosed to the patient or study personnel, and there will be no disclosure of the code in any of the corresponding patient documents.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention for the treatment arm will be 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin sc QD, and the intervention for the control arm will be 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin sc QD.

If creatinine-clearance (CrCl) is &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> during CRRT-free intervals, group allocation will be discontinued and participants will receive 40&#x000a0;mg QD. Once CrCl is &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;ml/min/1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>, group allocation will be resumed. In the event of VTE, group allocation will be discontinued, and patients will receive a full treatment dose of enoxaparin. Enoxaparin will be temporarily discontinued in the case of oozing, and packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and protamine sulphate may be administered at the discretion of the attending physician. Enoxaparin will be resumed according to the group allocation when oozing is no longer observed. Should the platelet count decrease to less than 50 &#x000d7; 109/L, or if there is an unexplained platelet count decrease to less than 50% of baseline, or other suspicion of HIT, enoxaparin will be stopped and mechanical prophylaxis or the HIT-safe anticoagulant, argatroban(Novastan&#x02122;; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum A/S, Lyngby, Denmark), will be started.

ICU patients with AKI present a particular challenge because of their increased risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Existing guidelines in Denmark recommend 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis, but this is thought to be inadequate. A previous pharmacokinetic trial suggested that a dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin may offer optimal thromboprophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our current study aims to confirm 1&#x000a0;mg/kg enoxaparin is the optimal dose in this high-risk population. As the study design is one of a randomized double-blinded multicenter trial, it should be considered a high quality trial aiming to provide class I evidence of the primary endpoint.</p><p>So far, only one type of LMWH (dalteparin) has won approval for use in patients with severe renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Critically ill patients have decreased levels of protein, and thus a larger free fraction of enoxaparin. The volume of distribution of enoxaparin is only 5&#x000a0;L and this, coupled with a small molecular weight, allow for normal dosing as the drug would be expected to be cleared by the high volumes of fluid employed in hemofiltration. Thus, our study has implications for clinical practice as our findings may challenge the premise that selected LMWHs should be avoided in such patients.</p><p>Finally, there are currently no established guidelines for the discontinuation of dialysis. We seek to use a combination of a clinical indicator (urine volume) and a biomarker (NGAL) to predict renal recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is active.
