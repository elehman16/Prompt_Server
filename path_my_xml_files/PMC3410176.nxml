It is influenced by factors such as education, family, society, law, availability of drugs and exposure to advertisements. This study was performed to evaluate self-medication with analgesics and its pattern among different groups of Iranian University Students.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized, cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted from December 2009 to February 2010. The target population of this study was 564 students out of 10,000 students attending four medical and non-medical science universities in Qom state. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16, and analysis was conducted with descriptive analysis procedures.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>76.6% of the students had used analgesics in self-medication in the previous 3 months. The frequency of analgesic use in the study period was once in 19.2% of the participants, twice in 22.2%, three times in 16.3% and more than three times in 35.5% of the participants, although 6.8% of them were not sure when they were used. Of all the respondents, 49.8% reported headache as the problem. This was the most common problem, after which came Dysmenorrhea,headache and stomach ache. Bone and joint pains were other problems that led to the use of analgesics. The most commonly used source of information for self-medication with analgesics was advice from friends and family (54.7%), previously prescribed medications (30.1%), their medical knowledge (13.3%) and recommendation of a pharmacist (1.9%).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Self-medication with analgesics is very high among Iranian students in Qom city. This could be an index for other parts of the Iranian community. Because the source of information about analgesics is inappropriate, we would recommend education courses about analgesics and self-medication on the radio and television for the entire population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Analgesics</kwd><kwd>Iran</kwd><kwd>students</kwd><kwd>self-medication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Self-medication is an old problem worldwide,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] and is defined as the use of drugs for the treatment of self-diagnosed disorders or symptoms.

This could save money and even lives in acute conditions. It is also accepted that responsible self-medication for self-care could be beneficial to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical industries, governments and patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] It has also been pointed out by the WHO that responsible self-medication could be helpful in the prevention and treatment of ailments that do not require medical consultation and provide a cheaper alternative treatment for common illnesses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The use of analgesics is widespread worldwide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Some analgesics are categorized as OTC drugs and some are not. Side-effects experienced may vary with different people , and overuse could be harmful.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] These problems could be minimized by raising people's awareness of the indications, contraindications and side-effects of these drugs.

A total of 564 students chosen by simple random sampling participated in this study.</p><p>The questionnaire that consisted of open- and closed-ended questions in the Persian language was used for this study. All respondents were native Persian speakers. There was a total of 18 questions on socio-demographic characteristics, patterns of self-medication with analgesics, type of the most used analgesics, source of information regarding analgesics, health condition that led to the use of an analgesic without prescription and source of analgesics preparation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The questionnaire was pre-tested and validated,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and the Ethics Committee of Qom University of Medical Sciences approved the study protocol.</p><p>The survey was conducted by two trained paramedical sciences students. The respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire and the researcher was present during completion in case the respondents required assistance. On completion, the data was reviewed, organized, tabulated and analyzed by SPSS version 16.

They were all Iranian, and most lived with their families. They were, therefore, all young people, with similar sociocultural backgrounds.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The data demonstrates that analgesic self-medication was high among students of universities in Qom state (a central state of Iran). The study showed that 76.6% of the respondents self-medicated with analgesics once or more than once in the 3 months of the study. Some higher rates were reported by Bahrain university students (81.3%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and some lower rates reported by students in the UK (20%)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Germany (40%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This variation could be partly due to the differences in study design; both studies in UK and Germany were of high school children, but ours and the Bahraini study were of college students.</p><p>However, the selection of samples with sociocultural backgrounds, study design and the measurement timeframe can influence study results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Our findings generally revealed no significant difference in self-medication with analgesics between male and female students. However, the symptoms that led to self-medication were different (headache for men and dysmenorrhea and headache for women). These findings are in agreement with an earlier study of university students in Bahrain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] However, there are data from Spain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Brazil,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and Kuwait,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] indicating higher self-medication among women.</p><p>It was rather unusual that there was also no significant difference in the prevalence of self-medication between medical and non-medical students. This finding is in agreement with three studies done in Pakistan,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Slovenia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and Mozambique,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and in contrast with a study in Palestine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>The reason could be that non-medical students, their friends and families are as knowledgeable about medicines as medical students.</p><p>Residence in this study had no significant association with self-medication with analgesics among students. Results of other studies vary, in that in a study in Spain, self-medication was more frequent among those who lived alone,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] but there was no significant association of self-medication with residence in the study in Brazil.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>In summary, self-medication with analgesics is highly prevalent among Iranian college students in Qom city, and we believe that it could represent college students in general in Iran. However, we suggest a complete study on self-medication in Iran. We suggest that students be made aware of the potentially dangerous effects of self-medication and the side-effects of various analgesics. Student health groups in universities could help in promoting awareness o these issues in their friends with the help of pharmacists or physicians. The production of multimedia programs or animations could be helpful in improving the knowledge of the entire community about the potential dangers of self-medication.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation of this study is that it was a cross-sectional survey. Therefore, it illuminates the current situation, which may differ in other seasons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors would like to thank the students of Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom University, Azad Qom University and Mofid University for making this study possible.
