This single-blind, multisite randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a mindfulness-based psychoeducation group program (MPGP in addition to usual care) versus a conventional psychoeducation group program (CPGP) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) alone, in schizophrenia spectrum disorders over a 6-month follow-up. In each of the two study sites (outpatient clinics), 69 outpatients with schizophrenia or its subtypes (N=138) were randomly allocated to one of the three study groups (n=46) after baseline measurements and underwent 6 months of intervention. Primary outcomes including patients&#x02019; mental state and rehospitalization rate and other secondary outcomes were assessed at entry and at 1 week and 6 months. One hundred and thirty-one (95%) participants completed the interventions assigned and one to two post-tests. Multivariate analyses of variance (followed by univariate contrast tests) indicated that the MPGP participants reported greater reductions in their psychotic symptoms (<italic>P</italic>=0.003) and length/duration of rehospitalizations (<italic>P</italic>=0.005) at 6-month follow-up. Patients in the MPGP group also reported greater improvements in their insight into illness/treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.0008) and level of functioning (<italic>P</italic>=0.002) than the CPGP and TAU alone at the 1-week and 6-month follow-up. Overall, the findings suggest that MPGP can be useful in improving the short- to medium-term clinical outcomes of outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, not only in terms of their mental state and risk of relapse but also their insight into illness/treatment and psychosocial functioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mindfulness intervention</kwd><kwd>psychoeducation</kwd><kwd>functioning</kwd><kwd>insight into illness</kwd><kwd>psychotic symptoms</kwd><kwd>rehospitalization</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia patients, constituting more than half of those with severe mental illness in global communities,<xref rid="b1-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> are characterized by profound disturbances and worsening in their cognition, emotion, and psychosocial functioning.<xref rid="b2-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These patients often experience high relapses and demands for mental health services.

They should also include those aiming to improve their insight into and self-management of the illness.

There is an increasing interest to find out whether mindfulness-based intervention can be important for people with schizophrenia who are often characterized by unexpectedly low adherence to treatments, or only partially responsive to standard treatment and/or psychosocial interventions.

One trained psychiatric advanced practice nurse (with 5 years of psychiatric rehabilitation and 3 years of mindfulness group experiences) facilitated all the treatment groups in the two clinics. The mindfulness theory used in the MPGP targeted at enhancing patients&#x02019; awareness, acceptance, and management of their illness and psychotic symptoms; improving their insight into the illness/treatment; resolving the illness-related problems and their poor functioning, help-seeking, and self-care.</p><p>The program contained seven domains, including 1) program overview and engagement; 2) enhancing awareness and understanding of bodily sensations, thoughts, and feelings regarding illness experiences or symptoms; 3) guided body awareness and mindful exercises and homework practices; 4) education workshop of illness (schizophrenia) management; 5) encountering with and controlling negative thoughts and perceptions, and life difficulties caused by symptoms, and practicing most effective problem-solving strategies; 6) behavioral rehearsals of means for relapse prevention; and 7) effective mindfulness practices, utilization of community support resources, and making realistic future plans. The MPGP could also promote an individual&#x02019;s restructure of individual thoughts and emotions in specific traditional Chinese culture (beliefs and behaviors). For instance, during the early sessions, participants were encouraged to practice regularly (not less than twice daily and 20 minutes per practice) of focused attention of their bodily sensations, thoughts and feelings, and mindful exercises (on breathing and walking), in which the facilitator also focused on understanding their Chinese cultural beliefs/behaviors &#x02013; strong interdependence, encouraging better mutual support, practicing expression of feelings openly, and exploring ways of looking at life situations among group members.

The nurse was trained by the research team and one rehabilitation specialist (social worker) with a 2-day workshop, consisting of lectures (1 hour each), discussion, sharing experiences, and supervised practices for group sessions. The CPGP consisted of four phases: 1) program overview, engagement, and setting goals for illness management (two sessions); 2) mental health education and information sharing about schizophrenia and survival skills training (four sessions); 3) relapse prevention, resilience promotion, and life skills training (four sessions); and 4) reviews on learned knowledge and skills and establishing future plans (two sessions).</p><p>All of the group sessions were tape-recorded (with participants&#x02019; consent) and reviewed for monitoring the progress and fidelity of the two programs between two sessions, by the research team, and then, they discussed and solved the problems encountered in the group sessions.</p><p>TAU comprised the routine psychiatric outpatient care received by all of the 138 participants, which was found similar between the two clinics.

The MPGP for these Chinese patients demonstrated more superior and wider variety of positive results than the CPGP, as well as the usual psychiatric care alone. It is highly encouraging and important to find out that the MPGP can produce significantly greater improvements in different aspects of patient functioning (including self-maintenance, social interactions, and living skills), both positive and negative (psychotic) symptoms, and insight into their illness and treatments over the 6-month follow-up, with moderate large effect sizes. The MPGP can also enhance these patients&#x02019; progress of recovery (eg, accepting responsibilities and tasks to rebuild one&#x02019;s life and ability to engage in self-reflection on the ways that recovery is influenced by one&#x02019;s interpersonal relationships).<xref rid="b26-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Despite that the MPGP could not demonstrate its effect on reducing readmissions significantly, the average number and duration of rehospitalizations among the MPGP participants progressively decreased over the follow-up period, whereas the other two study groups had slightly changes or increases in these rehospitalization rates across time.

However, the therapeutic mechanisms of mindfulness training to improve the control of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia are still unknown, thus needing to be explored in future research.</p><p>Importantly, the findings can support the benefits of the MPGP in improving patients&#x02019; psychosocial functioning and inducing their insight into the illness (schizophrenia).

This study can provide higher quality of evidence about the effects of mindfulness-based intervention by using randomized controlled trial design with adequate randomized sample (study power) in early stage of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, low attrition and noncompletion rates, and a wider variety of patient outcomes, when compared with a CPGP. Nevertheless, further multisite, randomized, controlled trials in more diverse patient populations with different comorbidities and a longer-term follow-up, with different structures (eg, individual versus group basis) of the intervention, and/or adopting other clinical outcomes (eg, service utilization and quality of life) are recommended.</p><p>In contrast to the common beliefs or cautions about the possible impacts of mindfulness training on exacerbation of psychotic symptoms during meditation practices or mindful exercises,<xref rid="b5-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> this clinical trial provides supporting evidence for the MPGP that can largely improve psychotic patients&#x02019; mental and psychosocial health conditions and gain insight into the illness, thus reducing risk of their relapse. In this study, there was not any adverse event or reaction relating to the mindfulness-based intervention noted. A few core elements of mindfulness training and psychoeducation might constitute the therapeutic components of the MPGP, including &#x0201c;being aware and accepting/controlling thoughts, feelings and emotions&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;coping and problem-solving ability&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;self-empowerment and regulation&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;seeking help and support&#x0201d;,<xref rid="b4-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which have not been examined or tested in this study. Therefore, further research is recommended to examine these potential therapeutic components individually or interactively and mechanism of actions of this psychosocial intervention (MPGP) used in this study.</p><p>The benefits of the MPGP to these psychotic patients can be started from responding to their symptoms in an intentional and acceptable manner through an improvement of their awareness, acceptance, and relationships with unwanted thoughts and emotions/feelings. Throughout the mindfulness practices, the intervention may help an individual develop cognitive changes (eg, higher acceptance and motivation in rehabilitation and management of the illness), gradually become more focused on the present, and finally relieved from the symptom-related distress.<xref rid="b45-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Recently, there have also been suggestions that mindfulness-based interventions may function through top-down and/or bottom-up mechanisms of cognitive remediation.<xref rid="b46-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Top-down mechanism occurs in the development of interoceptive attention to visceral bodily sensations, facilitating through daily mindful practices such as breathing monitoring. As the meditation practice deepens, interoceptive attention networks increase and alter information processing in the brain to enhance perceptual experience and, at the same time, promote reduced conceptual cortical activity.<xref rid="b47-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Bottom-up regulations have also been suggested as modulation of emotion-generative brain regions (limbic) without involving the frontal regions for cognitive regulation (eg, appraisal and suppression).<xref rid="b46-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b48-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Therefore, it is important to further examine in future research whether the patients who have undertaken the MPGP can experience such cognitive changes and reduce the distress relating to psychotic symptoms; hence, the results may inform the physiological benefits or a new cognitive remediation model for psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations and delusions), as suggested by Freeman et al.<xref rid="b49-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p><p>In addition, the MPGP participants in this study could demonstrate significantly higher improvements in most of the primary and secondary outcomes than the CPGP and TAU alone, over 6-month postintervention.

Its limitations on adherence to mindfulness training and practices, small sample size, and taking adequate care of patients&#x02019; educational and resources needs were addressed in this study. Indeed, the MPGP can demonstrate more substantial and diverse therapeutic effects to those patients with early stage of schizophrenia (ie, within 5 years of the illness), in consistent with the findings of Moritz et al&#x02019;s<xref rid="b44-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> mindfulness intervention trial.</p><sec><title>Achieving better participation and completion rates</title><p>While the anticipated benefits were induced by the mindfulness-based practices with the 12 biweekly face-to-face training/education, those review and learning for self-practice sessions may motivate the participants to continue attending and complete the program.

First, the patients in the early stage of the illness who agreed to participate in the interventions (and study) could be highly motivated to improve their illness condition and much involved in their community rehabilitation or any interventions potentially beneficial to the illness.

First, the participants who had mainly a short duration of illness and were volunteers to participate were very likely to adhere to and complete the intervention and be motivated to get improved in their health outcomes. In addition, all of them were not blind to the intervention allocation, which could produce an expectation or desirable response bias.</p><p>Second, the sample consisted of patients with a higher education level, low- to moderate levels of antipsychotic medication, and a better family support. Despite having randomized samples from two clinics, the characteristics of the participants were selective and thus might not be representative of the wider patient (schizophrenia) populations in Hong Kong. To increase the generalization of the findings to these patient populations, the sample could have included those with different chronicity and severity of schizophrenia, as well as those with different comorbidities of other mental disorders.<xref rid="b2-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As mentioned in the above discussion, this selective sample might also contribute to higher levels of completion and lower dropout rates. Therefore, the findings of this study may not be fully generalizable to the Hong Kong/Chinese populations of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and further research in this patient group with different sociodemographic, illness, and ethnic characteristics is, therefore, recommended.</p><p>Third, although the levels of performance in mindfulness practice (FFMQ score) in the MPGP participants have been monitored (ie, significantly enhanced from the postintervention to 6-month follow-up), their adherence and regularity of daily practices could be difficult to standardize/address as what may be achieved by applying a manual- or protocol-driven psychoeducation program.<xref rid="b13-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The extent of engagement and review on mindfulness practices with the therapists might contribute to much psychological and/or treatment effects in these patients;<xref rid="b29-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> but these impacts have not been examined. In addition, the individual/combined benefits of multiple components of mindfulness and psychoeducation approaches in the MPGP are not known in this trial. To better understand the therapeutic effects of mindfulness-based intervention and its components, the relationships between patient outcomes and action mechanisms of the MPGP, as well as the potential moderators (eg, symptom severity and duration of and insight into illness) and mediators (eg, acceptance, psychological flexibility, and compassion) of outcomes,<xref rid="b11-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> should also be investigated in future controlled trials.</p><p>Third, this controlled trial was planned by the research team and conducted by the extensively trained advanced practice psychiatric nurses, thus increasing risk of allegiance bias,<xref rid="b50-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> although the study outcomes were measured by an independent assessor. This might also reduce the applicability of the intervention to the usual psychiatric outpatient care that is likely to favor brief and user-friendly or even mobile/online modes of interventions with simple training. Together with no concealment of intervention participation to clinic staff, the participants could have shared and discussed the study participation/intervention received with the staff and thus might inflate/overstate the treatment effects.<xref rid="b20-ndt-12-3097" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Last, there were changes in the symptom severity but not the remission rates among the participants over 6 months of follow-up.

Compared with CPGP and usual outpatient care alone, the MPGP participants reported significant positive changes in a few psychosocial outcomes, including improved different aspects of functioning, reduced psychotic symptoms, and enhanced progress of recovery and insight into their illness across the follow-up. This controlled trial supports the use of the MPGP to aid for relapse prevention and improving psychosocial health and functioning, and thus the community-based rehabilitation for patients with early schizophrenia and related disorders. The findings support further research on the mindfulness-based program in psychotic disorders with those from wider sociodemographic and clinical characteristics in Asian/Chinese populations, or those with chronic or comorbid mental illness and/or study settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau (Ref No: 12131641) and the General Research Fund (PolyU 156038/15H), University Grant Council, The Hong Kong SAR&#x02019;s Government for supporting this research project.
