In Europe, medium-molecular weight HES with a low degree of substitution (0.5) has been preferred. The present study investigated, whether a long-term, high-dose volume therapy with a newly developed 6% HES 130/0.4 (Voluven<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is safe in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. In particular, the effects on hemostaseology were examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study carried out in accordance with GCP and ICH guidelines, 40 patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke received either 6% HES 130/0.4 or crystalloid solution, after giving their informed consent. There were no differences between the treatment groups regarding demography and baseline characteristics. Each patient received a loading dose of 500 ml HES or crystalloid solution over 1 hour and subsequently 1500 ml HES or crystalloid solution per day over a period of 4 days for a total dose of 6500 ml. Hemostaseological parameters (platelets, prothrombin time, aPTT, fibronectin, Factor VIII:C, von Willebrand factor antigen, von Willebrand Ristocetin cofactor) were measured daily. Patients were followed-up until 90 days post treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 390 g HES per patient was administered and well tolerated by all patients in the study group. Only one serious adverse event was noted in the crystalloid group, whereby a relation with the study medication was unlikely. The most frequent adverse event was itching, reported by two patients in the crystalloid group and three patients in the HES group.</p><p>At baseline all hemostatic parameters were within the normal range and no clinically relevant changes were observed with respect to any parameter between the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Medium molecular weight HES 130 with a low degree of substitution (0.4) was well tolerated and can be administered in larger doses over longer periods of time without relevant effects on hemostaseology compared to a crystalloid group. In particular, there is no increased risk of bleeding in this clinical setting.</p></sec></body></article>
