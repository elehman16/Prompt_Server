In this two-arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial, we sought to compare an in-person nominal group technique (NGT) approach with an online wiki-inspired alternative to determining the top 10 CKD research priorities, and to evaluate stakeholder engagement and satisfaction with each process.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eligible participants included adults &#x02265;18 years with access to a computer and Internet, high health literacy, and from one of the following stakeholder groups: patients with CKD not on dialysis, their caregivers, health care providers who care for patients with CKD, or CKD-related health policymakers. Fifty-six participants were randomized to a wiki-inspired modified NGT that occurred over 3 weeks vs. a 1-day in-person NGT workshop, informed by James Lind Alliance methodology, to determine the top 10 CKD-related research priorities. The primary outcome was the pairwise agreement between the two groups&#x02019; final top 10 ranked priorities, evaluated using Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient. Secondary outcomes included participant engagement and satisfaction and wiki tool usability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Spearman&#x02019;s rho for correlation between the two lists was 0.139 (95 % confidence interval &#x02212;0.543 to 0.703, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71), suggesting low correlation between the top 10 lists across the two groups. Both groups ranked the same item as the top research priority, with 5 of the top 10 priorities ranked by the wiki group within the top 10 for the in-person group. In comparison to the in-person group, participants from the wiki group were less likely to report: satisfaction with the format (73.7 vs.100 %, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011); ability to express their views (57.9 vs 96.0 %, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0003); and perception that they contributed meaningfully to the process (68.4 vs 84.0 %, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A CKD research prioritization approach using an online wiki-like tool identified low correlation in rankings compared with an in-person approach, with less satisfaction and perceptions of active engagement. Modifications to the wiki-inspired tool are required before it can be considered a potential alternative to an in-person workshop for engaging patients in determining research priorities.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com">ISRCTN18248625</ext-link>)</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12911-016-0351-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Research priorities</kwd><kwd>Patient preferences</kwd><kwd>Wiki</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, affects approximately 5&#x02013;7 % of the adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and contributes to excess morbidity, mortality and health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the tremendous burden CKD places on health care delivery, care for persons affected by CKD remains suboptimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These care gaps may result from the lack of research that is relevant to end-users, including patients with CKD, their caregivers, and the clinicians involved in their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To address these gaps, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of engaging key stakeholders in determining research priorities and establishing user-relevant research objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in Canada and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are two initiatives that aim to engage patients in research and knowledge translation and to focus on interventions and outcomes that are important to research end users.</p><p>Although few established methods for involving key stakeholders in research prioritization exist, the James Lind Alliance (JLA) priority setting partnership model is widely considered an inclusive and transparent process and has been applied to a number of disease conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The final step of the four-step JLA partnership involves an in-person workshop with a nominal group technique (NGT) to use a list of the top 30 research priorities to develop a ranked list of the top 10 research priorities from key stakeholders through small and large group activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While considered the reference standard, this approach has some clear limitations for participants and coordinators, including time and resource requirements, travel, and logistical consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These challenges may be particularly problematic for patients with chronic illness who have difficulty with or are unable to travel, which could limit participant involvement and generalizability of findings. Alternative Internet-based approaches to research priority setting, such as an interactive wiki-like platform, could obviate some of these limitations. A &#x02018;wiki&#x02019; is a collaborative web-based platform that allows users to add and edit content online in real time, and in the context of research prioritization can be used to summarize the preferences of multiple stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Wiki-inspired tools have been successfully applied in similar, multi-stakeholder consensus approaches, including the creation of an asthma action plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but have not been studied in research prioritization exercises that require significant patient involvement.</p><p>In this randomized controlled trial we sought to compare the in-person workshop and NGT approach with an online wiki-inspired alternative as the final step in the JLA research prioritization process for key CKD stakeholders, including patients with CKD not on dialysis, their caregivers, and the health care professionals and policymakers involved in their care. We aimed to compare the top 10 research priorities resulting from each process and to evaluate the engagement and satisfaction of participating stakeholders with their assigned intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This trial is reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.org">www.isrctn.org</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN18248625">ISRCTN18248625</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of the JLA CKD priority setting partnership</title><p>The JLA priority setting partnership uses established methods to identify and prioritize unanswered disease- or treatment-related questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our CKD priority setting process involved: 1) creation of a 12-person steering group of patients with non-dialysis CKD, caregivers, clinicians and researchers; 2) identification of research uncertainties through a national survey of representative CKD stakeholders; 3) refinement and prioritization of the research uncertainties identified in the survey to determine a shortlist of the top 30 research priorities by the steering group; and, 4) participation by stakeholders from across Canada in a 1-day priority setting workshop to determine the top 10 CKD research priorities from a shortlist of 30. Steps 1&#x02013;3 took place from July 2014 to June 2015; this trial involved step 4 only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial participants</title><p>The steering group enlisted the support of nephrology networks, partner organizations, and nephrologists from across Canada to identify potential participants. Eligible participants were &#x02265;18 years of age, English speaking, had access to and were comfortable using high-speed Internet, and had high health literacy (determined by asking the following question: &#x0201c;How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). Participants were also required to be a member of a stakeholder group: patients with CKD not on dialysis or with a prior transplant; informal caregivers of persons with CKD (relatives, family members, or friends who help patients manage their illness); health care professionals (primary care physicians, nephrologists, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, or dietitians) who care for patients with CKD; or health policymakers (non-clinicians with the ability to influence or determine policies and practices related to health care delivery for CKD at an international, national, regional, or local level). The following individuals were not eligible to participate: patients receiving dialysis and/or who had received a kidney transplant; persons with an underlying diagnosis of dementia or cognitive impairment; and patients deemed unfit to travel. A research assistant confirmed the eligibility of potential participants, described the trial to them in detail, and obtained their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions</title><p>Participants were randomized 1:1 to an in-person NGT-based workshop or an online wiki-inspired platform. Randomization occurred by random number sequence generation using a central electronic system to ensure allocation concealment. Patients and their caregivers were randomized as a dyad to avoid contamination. Additionally, the 6 patient and caregiver steering group members were allocated to the in-person workshop group only, and not randomized, as they had originally committed to participate in the NGT process of the study and it was therefore deemed important to include them in the NGT arm. Participants in both groups were provided with the top 30 uncertainties shortlist (derived from a national survey and prioritized by the steering group) to review and consider prior to the intervention; participants in the in-person workshop group ranked the 30 uncertainties prior to the workshop, while participants in the wiki-inspired group ranked the top 10 (due to logistical issues of ranking 30 online).</p><p>Individuals in the 1-day in-person workshop group participated in a NGT approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in Toronto, Canada, which included a combination of small and large group exercises facilitated by four individuals with experience in the JLA process. The final ranking of the top 10 research priorities was determined by large group consensus, with voting when needed.</p><p>Wiki group participants were provided with a 1-h training webinar on use of the wiki and were given unique usernames and passwords to access the secure website before they began the following tasks to determine the top 10 research priorities. The wiki-based intervention took place online over 3 phases: 1) an individual ranking phase (7 days), where participants submitted their preferences for the top 10 research priorities individually, 2) a group ranking phase (12 days), where participants determined the final top 10 research priorities collaboratively, and 3) a sign-off phase (2 days), where participants could review to confirm their agreement, but not re-order the final list. Following the individual phase, individual rankings were aggregated across participants using reverse scoring, such that items ranked first received a score of 10, and those ranked last received a score of 1. These scores were aggregated and presented as a summary rank list to which participants could refer throughout the collaborative ranking phase. During the collaborative ranking phase, participants could re-order the top 10 priorities in real time and discuss their selections using a chat feature. The chat feature consisted of a text box and display of all participant comments in chronological order, organized by unique user identifier (ie identifying information and stakeholder role were not apparent during chat to avoid differential perception of input by provider role). A facilitator monitored the site daily and stimulated discussion through comments using the chat feature. Technical support was available throughout the process. Due to the nature of the interventions, study participants and intervention administrators were not blinded to group assignment; however, statistical analysis was blinded. The in-person workshop took place during the wiki process; participants in both groups were blinded to the ranking results of the other group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the pairwise agreement between the two groups&#x02019; final top 10 ranked priorities recorded upon conclusion of the workshop and group ranking phase for the in-person and wiki groups, respectively. Secondary outcomes included perceived engagement of participants in their assigned prioritization process and participant satisfaction. We also evaluated usability aspects of the online wiki tool including content, features, and accessibility (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for details on outcomes and methods of measurement). The electronic questionnaire assessing participant engagement and satisfaction and wiki usability was administered using the FluidSurveys platform (FluidSurveys platform, Fluidware Inc., Ottawa, Ontario)., Key elements of stakeholder engagement were evaluated in the participant engagement section of the questionnaire, including trust, respect, accountability, legitimacy, fairness, and competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary outcome was the pair wise agreement between the two groups&#x02019; top 10 priorities, therefore the correlation analysis was driven by the number of research priorities considered, which was fixed at 10 for the purposes of this study. As the JLA recommends 20 to 30 participants in the in-person priority setting exercise, with approximately equal representation of patients, clinicians, and caregivers, we estimated that a total of 40&#x02013;60 participants would be required (we aimed for 50). Inflating this by 10 % to account for potential dropouts, an overall; sample size of 56 was felt to be a conservative estimate for the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline demographic information was compared between the in-person workshop and wiki groups using univariate analyses. The unit of analysis for the primary outcome was at the group level, and the pairwise agreement between the two groups&#x02019; priorities (provided as ranks) was examined using Spearman&#x02019;s correlation coefficient and its associated 95 % confidence interval (CI). We also compared the rank order of the top 10 research priorities from each group descriptively, noting the proportion that were within the top 10 across both groups. Our secondary outcomes were obtained by survey for both the in-person and wiki groups, with responses measured using a 5-point Likert scale (where 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly disagree, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;strongly agree), and the proportions of participants who agreed with each statement (4 or 5 on the scale) were compared between groups using chi-square tests. Written comments also obtained from the survey by both groups were examined qualitatively. Two researchers (MJE and BRH) reviewed all written comments and independently coded them for emerging categories and themes. Resulting themes and discrepancies were discussed, and a final coding scheme describing participants&#x02019; experiences with each process was established. Participant observation data collected during the in-person workshop was summarized quantitatively (ie frequencies) and qualitatively (ie brief researcher notes). The time requirements to undertake each process were compared descriptively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-six individuals were randomized to either the in-person workshop (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) or online wiki-inspired group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). In addition the 6 patient and caregiver steering group members were allocated to the in-person workshop group only, as established a priori, for a total of 34 participants for the in-person workshop. Overall 25 individuals took part in the 1-day workshop (12 patients, 6 caregivers, 6 health care professionals, and 1 policymaker), and 26 individuals participated in the 3-week online wiki-like process (12 patients, 8 caregivers, 5 health care professionals, and 1 policymaker).

There were also important differences between the groups, with fewer health-services research questions ranked by the wiki-inspired group, and differences in perceptions of engagement. In comparison to participants in the in-person workshop, those in the wiki-inspired group were less satisfied with the format of the exercise and felt they were less likely to contribute meaningfully to the process. Whereas all individuals who attended the in-person workshop contributed to the group discussions (either spontaneously or with prompting), 80 % of individuals in the wiki group accessed the tool at least once, and only half were considered &#x02018;active&#x02019; participants. We are unable to determine if the differences in research priorities identified were due to the different processes, or differences in the groups themselves (including the patient and caregiver steering group members participating in the in-person workshop), as priorities may vary by group irrespective of the process used to establish them. This will be important to address in future work.</p><p>Our study is one of the first to evaluate an online wiki-based tool to engage patients and other stakeholders in health care research prioritization and to undertake a randomized comparison of two distinct research prioritization methods. Although both techniques are based on a NGT approach, the online wiki-inspired option had attractive features including flexibility to contribute at a convenient time during a process that occurred over a longer period of time compared to the 1-day in-person workshop, which the majority of participants felt was adequate. However the longer duration required for participation may be perceived as a disadvantage by some. The standard JLA methodology for stakeholder involvement in health care research prioritization, including a final in-person workshop, has been implemented to date in more than 20 chronic diseases, including prior work by our group to identify research priorities for patients on or nearing dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent systematic review on research priority setting in kidney disease identified 16 studies, only 4 of which involved patients in the prioritization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The studies cited in this review used a variety of methods to elicit research priorities, none of which were described in detail nor used an electronic or online collaborative platform to engage stakeholders, and none of which were evaluated in a randomized trial such as this one.</p><p>Wiki-like tools have been applied in other collaborative health care-related activities involving patients and other stakeholders. Gupta et al. included patients and clinicians in a wiki-inspired collaborative design of an asthma action plan (WikiBuild), where groups of 14 participants contributed to the action plan&#x02019;s content and design over a 1-week period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other studies examining the application of wiki-based tools in patient-centered research, including the development of clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and patient information leaflets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], have found these tools to be promising alternatives to more traditional approaches. In contrast to our study, these other studies generally involved input from a large numbers of patients (&#x0003e;300) and lack the personalized and multi-stakeholder interactions endorsed by the JLA format.</p><p>Potential advantages of an online wiki-inspired approach for collaborative research prioritization include flexibility in participation, lack of travel requirements limiting participant eligibility, and lower costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A particular advantage is the ability to include those whose illnesses may preclude easy travel; for example, one patient in the wiki-inspired group in our study was admitted to hospital during the study period and participated in the process while in hospital. The complex group dynamics often seen with in-person techniques can lead to the development of status hierarchies that favour clinicians over patients and caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which could limit the openness of individual contributions to the discussion and influence the final product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], although our qualitative results would suggest that was not the case in our study. Although neither the wiki group nor the in-person workshop group indicated the presence of overly influential individuals, wiki-inspired participants indicated the ability to contribute honestly and explicitly in this format.</p><p>Although 61 % of wiki-inspired participants responding to the post-intervention questionnaire felt that the chat feature was useful for explaining their views and preferences, many expressed concerns that this format did not allow for as comprehensive a discussion and understanding as is possible with face-to-face interactions. Gupta et al. described similar participant concerns for the wiki online chat, as well as the lack of individual accountability for changes made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other barriers to the adoption of wiki-inspired tools for patient engagement activities described include concerns regarding suitability of the format to its objectives, poor participation rates, and technical challenges, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is unclear whether patients with poor health literacy or cognitive impairment would be able to participate in a wiki-inspired priority setting process, and this is an area for future work. The participant feedback provided during our trial highlights the need to refine the online collaborative tool, and the chat feature in particular, to ensure participants feel engaged and able to contribute meaningfully to the process.</p><p>Our study is one of the first to describe the application of a wiki-inspired tool to a research prioritization exercise, with a randomized comparison of methods for eliciting input from a diverse group of stakeholders to determine research priorities. The results, however, should be interpreted in light of the study limitations. The requirement for participants to have regular access to a computer and the Internet may have limited eligible participants and thus the generalizability of findings. However, Internet access is increasingly common among patients with chronic disease (up to 70 % of patients with chronic illness are Internet users) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and approximately half of patients with advanced CKD access the Internet to obtain health information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further, little evidence exists to guide the evaluation of stakeholder engagement with such consensus-driven processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While quantitative and written responses on the post-intervention survey provide valuable information, additional insights could be gained through participant interviews evaluating individual experiences with the interventions. Finally, 6 of the patient and caregiver steering group members participated in the NGT in-person workshop, and were not part of the randomization process. Although these steering group members were involved in the earlier stages of the CKD priority setting partnership (ie identification of research priorities through national survey and refinement of these priorities into a top 30 shortlist), the final ranking of the top 10 priorities was a collaborative process involving all stakeholders participating in the workshop. All participants were encouraged to contribute to the final ranking process, and the top 10 priorities reflect group consensus rather than the views of any one individual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Involving patients and other stakeholders in determining research priorities has the potential to enhance the quality and relevance of research for end users. In our randomized controlled trial of patients, caregivers, clinicians and policymakers, we found that an online collaborative wiki-inspired process identified different top ten CKD-related research priorities compared with an in-person workshop, and participants in the wiki group were less likely to feel engaged and satisfied. We are unable to determine if the differences in research priorities identified were due to the different processes or differences in the groups themselves, as priorities may vary by group irrespective of the process used to establish them. This is important to address in future work. Modifications to the wiki tool, including optimization of a communication feature to improve the ability of participants to communicate their views and preferences, need to be designed and evaluated before a wiki process can be considered a feasible alternative to an in-person workshop for engaging patients in determining research priorities.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12911_2016_351_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Table summarizing methods used for assessing primary and secondary outcomes.
