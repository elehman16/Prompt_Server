<article-title>Comparison of Homocysteine-Lowering Drugs</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><sec id="st1"><title>Background</title><p>Betaine (trimethylglycine) lowers plasma homocysteine, a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, studies in renal patients and in obese individuals who are on a weight-loss diet suggest that betaine supplementation raises blood cholesterol; data in healthy individuals are lacking. Such an effect on cholesterol would counteract any favourable effect on homocysteine. We therefore investigated the effect of betaine, of its precursor choline in the form of phosphatidylcholine, and of the classical homocysteine-lowering vitamin folic acid on blood lipid concentrations in healthy humans.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We measured blood lipids in four placebo-controlled, randomised intervention studies that examined the effect of betaine (three studies, <italic>n</italic> = 151), folic acid (two studies, <italic>n</italic> = 75), and phosphatidylcholine (one study, <italic>n</italic> = 26) on plasma homocysteine concentrations. We combined blood lipid data from the individual studies and calculated a weighted mean change in blood lipid concentrations relative to placebo. Betaine supplementation (6 g/d) for 6 wk increased blood LDL cholesterol concentrations by 0.36 mmol/l (95&#x00025; confidence interval: 0.25&#x02013;0.46), and triacylglycerol concentrations by 0.14 mmol/l (0.04&#x02013;0.23) relative to placebo. The ratio of total to HDL cholesterol increased by 0.23 (0.14&#x02013;0.32). Concentrations of HDL cholesterol were not affected. Doses of betaine lower than 6 g/d also raised LDL cholesterol, but these changes were not statistically significant. Further, the effect of betaine on LDL cholesterol was already evident after 2 wk of intervention. Phosphatidylcholine supplementation (providing approximately 2.6 g/d of choline) for 2 wk increased triacylglycerol concentrations by 0.14 mmol/l (0.06&#x02013;0.21), but did not affect cholesterol concentrations. Folic acid supplementation (0.8 mg/d) had no effect on lipid concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Betaine supplementation increased blood LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations in healthy humans, which agrees with the limited previous data. The adverse effects on blood lipids may undo the potential benefits for cardiovascular health of betaine supplementation through homocysteine lowering. In our study phosphatidylcholine supplementation slightly increased triacylglycerol concentrations in healthy humans. Previous studies of phosphatidylcholine and blood lipids showed no clear effect. Thus the effect of phosphatidylcholine supplementation on blood lipids remains inconclusive, but is probably not large.</p><p>Folic acid supplementation does not seem to affect blood lipids and therefore remains the preferred treatment for lowering of blood homocysteine concentrations.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Lowering homocysteine might reduce the risk for heart disease.

Diet may play a crucial role in the aetiology of CVD. However, clinical trials that test the effects of diet on CVD are complicated to conduct. Hence, risk factors that are predictive of CVD risk are frequently used to test the effects of diet on disease prevention. Examples of such risk factors are homocysteine concentrations and cholesterol concentrations. A limitation of studying effects of dietary changes on risk factors is that often a single factor is measured, whereas multiple factors might be affected by changes in diet. Whether homocysteine lowering indeed lowers risk of CVD is not yet established, but evidence for a causal relationship is accumulating [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The effects of increased blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations on CVD risk are well established.</p><p>Betaine is used as therapy to lower plasma homocysteine in hyperhomocysteinemic patients with genetic defects in their homocysteine metabolism who are unresponsive to pyridoxine, folic acid, and vitamin B12 [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It also lowers plasma homocysteine in healthy humans with homocysteine concentrations in the normal range [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Betaine occurs naturally in the diet, or it can be produced endogenously through oxidation of choline. Dietary intake of betaine is estimated at 0.5&#x02013;2 g/d generally, and major food sources are wheat products (e.g., bread), beets, and spinach [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently we showed that supplementation with 1.5 g/d of betaine, which is in the range of daily intake, lowers fasting and post-methionine plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy humans [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The homocysteine-lowering properties of betaine would predict a decrease in risk of CVD. However, betaine and its precursor choline are also involved in lipid metabolism. In animal studies betaine supplementation increases serum cholesterol concentrations relative to control [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies in humans have also found that betaine supplementation increases serum cholesterol in obese individuals who are on a weight-loss diet, and in patients with chronic renal failure [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in these studies betaine was not the only intervention, so the observed effects on lipid concentrations could have been due to factors other than betaine supplementation. Furthermore, in the study with obese individuals, weight changes might have contributed to the changes in serum lipids [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The effects of betaine on lipid metabolism in healthy humans are not well established.</p><p>Choline, the precursor of betaine, also occurs naturally in foods, mainly as phosphatidylcholine. Daily intake of choline is generally estimated to be 0.3&#x02013;1 g [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and is therefore involved in lipid metabolism. Animal and human studies indicate that choline deficiency decreases serum cholesterol, which can be prevented by addition of choline [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Data on the effects of choline supplementation on blood lipids in humans are scarce.</p><p>Increases in blood lipid concentrations due to betaine or choline supplementation might offset the potential beneficial effects of their homocysteine-lowering properties. Folic acid is the most commonly used homocysteine-lowering agent. The betaine remethylation and folic acid remethylation pathways are interrelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020135-g001">Figure 1</xref>), so effects of folic acid supplementation on lipid metabolism cannot be excluded [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><fig id="pmed-0020135-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Role of Folic Acid, Choline, and Betaine in Homocysteine Metabolism and in Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism</title><p>Phosphatidylcholine is necessary for synthesis of VLDL, which exports lipids from the liver.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0020135.g001"/></fig><p>In this study we investigated the effects of supplementation of three homocysteine-lowering nutrients, betaine, choline (as phosphatidylcholine), and folic acid, on blood lipid concentrations in healthy humans.

The statistician supplied the principal investigator with sealed envelopes with the treatment allocation per participant. The participants and all others involved in this study were unaware of treatment allocation. The statistician performed unblinding of the treatment allocation after the study had ended, laboratory analyses were complete, and datasets were locked. Phosphatidylcholine and placebo supplements were matched for fat content and fatty acid composition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020135-t002">Table 2</xref>). The amount of choline in 34 g of the phosphatidylcholine supplement was 2.6 g, as measured by Koc et al. [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and by TNO.

Participants ingested half of the daily supplement dose two times per day (i.e., at breakfast and at dinner). The individual portions of half the daily dose of the supplements were mixed with 200 ml of custard. Participants returned 99.5&#x00025; of the bowls empty, which indicated good compliance.

For the measurement of choline at TNO, choline was liberated from the sample by boiling the sample for 4 h with nitric acid (17 v/v&#x00025;). After filtration of the sample, the pH of the extract was raised to 9.0 with sodium hydroxide solution. To an aliquot part of the extract a solution of ammonium reineckate in methanol was added, which formed the insoluble choline reineckate. The precipitate was filtered off and dissolved in acetone.

So choice of matrix could not have been responsible for differences in results between the studies. First we calculated the mean change in lipid concentrations relative to placebo after supplementation with the treatments for each study. Means were compared with the General Linear Models procedure in SAS (ANOVA; SAS version 6.12, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, United States).

Phosphatidylcholine supplementation for 2 wk increased only serum triacylglycerol concentrations. Folic acid supplementation did not affect lipid concentrations.</p><p>The three studies on betaine supplementation were not originally designed to investigate changes in blood lipids. Therefore, we did not perform power calculations for changes in blood lipids for each study beforehand. We combined the lipid data of the three studies to have a better estimate of the effects of betaine on blood lipids, and thereby increase the statistical power afterwards. Similarly we did not do power calculations for effects of folic acid on blood lipids. The increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations with betaine supplementation that we found in healthy humans is in accordance with results from previous studies in renal patients [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and obese individuals who were on a weight-loss diet [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Doses of betaine lower than 6 g/d also raised LDL cholesterol, although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020135-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our study was not designed to investigate the dose&#x02013;response relationship between betaine doses and changes in LDL cholesterol. Establishing the dose&#x02013;response relationship between betaine and LDL cholesterol might require more than three betaine dose groups<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, betaine supplementation affected blood lipids already after 2 wk of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020135-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The increase in triacylglycerol concentrations with betaine supplementation is well in line with the results of Schwab et al. in obese individuals [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the obese individuals betaine supplementation increased triacylglycerol concentrations by approximately 12&#x00025;, although this increase did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Our observations should be of specific concern for clinical practice as well as for the general population. Patients with inborn errors in the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism and who are not or only partially responsive to pyridoxine are generally prescribed betaine in doses of 6 g/d or higher in order to lower their plasma homocysteine [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our data imply that betaine treatment in these patients may have adverse effects on lipid concentrations. No one has systematically reported changes in serum cholesterol concentrations in hyperhomocysteinemic patients who are on betaine treatment, although this may be warranted. Clearly in these patients, the benefit of the substantial homocysteine-lowering effect of betaine outweighs the effect of any modest lipid-related changes. Furthermore, our data imply that among the general population intake of extra betaine, e.g., from supplements or through increased intake of betaine-rich foods, may not bring the expected benefits for CVD prevention predicted from the homocysteine-lowering effect of betaine.</p><p>Phosphatidylcholine supplementation increased serum triacylglycerols, but did not affect serum cholesterol concentrations. We supplemented phosphatidylcholine for only 2 wk, and it is possible that this was too short to induce changes in serum cholesterol, although betaine supplementation did increase blood cholesterol concentrations within 2 wk. We carefully matched the fat content and fatty acid composition of the control and the phosphatidylcholine supplements. Previous studies that also attempted to control for the fatty acid component of lecithin (the trivial name for phosphatidylcholine) [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or that tested choline bitartrate [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], suggest that there is little or no effect of the choline moiety of lecithin on blood lipids, provided that the fatty acids in lecithin are balanced in the placebo treatment. Only two of the studies that investigated phosphatidylcholine included a concurrent control group [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the randomized cross-over study of Childs et al. [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] triacylglycerol concentrations in 12 normolipidemic individuals were 0.01 mmol/l lower after they had consumed lecithin for 3 wk than after they had consumed placebo. Oosthuizen et al. [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found in a parallel study with seven hyperlipidemic men per group that the median triacylglycerol concentration decreased by 0.19 mmol/l in the lecithin group relative to the placebo group after 2 wk of intervention. After 4 wk of intervention this difference had disappeared. The increase in triacylglycerol concentrations with phosphatidylcholine treatment in our study could be a chance finding. However, our study was larger than previous studies, we used a cross-over design with a wash out period, and participants received supplements in random order. Moreover, the dose of phosphatidylcholine we used was higher than in the previous studies. Therefore, our study leaves open a real possibility that the choline moiety of phosphatidylcholine in high doses raises serum triacylglycerol concentrations.</p><p>We propose that the mechanism by which betaine and phosphatidylcholine supplementation increase blood lipid concentrations involves increased export of lipids from the liver into the circulation. Lipids are exported from the liver through VLDL particles, which consist of a triglyceride core packaged in an amphipatic shell of phospholipids, mostly phosphatidylcholine, and apolipoprotein B-100. More VLDL will increase transport of lipids from the liver into the blood, and concentrations of lipids in the liver decrease accordingly [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Betaine and phosphatidylcholine supplementation could increase VLDL synthesis via increased availability of phosphatidylcholine, an essential component of VLDL (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020135-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, betaine might increase phosphatidylcholine synthesis owing to increased availability of S-adenosylmethionine via increased remethylation of homocysteine into methionine, because S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor for the formation of phosphatidylcholine out of phosphatidylethanolamine [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, betaine supplementation could promote phosphatidylcholine synthesis through increasing the activity of the enzyme betaine&#x02013;homocysteine methyltransferase [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Betaine&#x02013;homocysteine methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from betaine to homocysteine, but it also catalyzes the first step in the three-enzyme pathway that promotes methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine into phosphatidylcholine [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>We speculate that betaine and phosphatidylcholine supplementation increase lipid concentrations in blood because of increased synthesis and availability of phosphatidylcholine, which promotes VLDL secretion from the liver into plasma, resulting in higher lipid concentrations in blood [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Our data indicate that folic acid supplementation does not affect serum lipid concentrations, which is in agreement with other studies [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The consequences of betaine or phosphatidylcholine supplementation for risk of CVD are difficult to predict. In healthy participants, betaine supplementation lowers plasma homocysteine after methionine loading by 20&#x00025;&#x02013;40&#x00025;. Betaine as well as phosphatidylcholine supplementation lower fasting plasma homocysteine by 12&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020135-t006">Table 6</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is estimated to lower CVD risk by 10&#x00025;&#x02013;15&#x00025; [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, it is not yet firmly established that homocysteine lowering indeed lowers risk of CVD, although evidence for a causal relationship is accumulating [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We now find that betaine not only decreases homocysteine, but also increases LDL cholesterol by approximately 10&#x00025; and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio by approximately 6&#x00025;. This is estimated to increase CVD risk by approximately 10&#x00025; [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Betaine (6 g/d) and phosphatidylcholine (providing approximately 2.6 g/d of choline) supplementation increase triacylglycerol concentrations by up to 13&#x00025;, which is estimated to increase risk of CVD by approximately 6&#x00025;, after adjustment for other risk factors [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This implies that betaine supplementation is expected to increase risk of CVD if homocysteine is not a cause of CVD, or does not affect risk if homocysteine is causally involved. Whether phosphatidylcholine affects CVD risk remains uncertain so far.</p><table-wrap id="pmed-0020135-t006" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><title>Percentage Change in Fasting Concentrations of Plasma Homocysteine after Participants Had Ingested Betaine and Folic Acid for 6 Wk</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0020135.t006"/><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt601"><p>Sources: [<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020135-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></fn><fn id="nt602"><p>

In summary, the adverse effects of betaine on blood lipids make it less suitable as a homocysteine-lowering agent in healthy humans. Phosphatidylcholine may be more suitable because it only slightly increases serum triacylglycerol concentrations and does not affect LDL cholesterol. Folic acid has no adverse side effects on blood lipids, and therefore folic acid supplementation should remain the preferred homocysteine-lowering treatment in healthy humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><title>Protocol for Study 3</title><p>(95 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd002"><label>Protocol S2</label><caption><title>Protocol for Study 4</title><p>(840 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd003"><label>Protocol S3</label><caption><title>Amendment 1 of Protocol for Study 4</title><p>(585 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.sd003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sd004"><label>Protocol S4</label><caption><title>Amendment 2 of Protocol for Study 4</title><p>(470 KB PDF).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.sd004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist for Study 1</title><p>(47 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.st001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist for Study 2</title><p>(47 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.st002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist for Study 3</title><p>(47 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.st003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><title>Consort Checklist for Study 4</title><p>(38 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.st004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st005"><label>Table S5</label><caption><title>Overview of Non-Serious Adverse Events per Study</title><p>(25 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020135.st005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><sec id="sb5a"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Study 3 is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT00102843. Study 4 is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT00102232.</p><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background</title><p>Homocysteine is an amino acid in the blood (amino acids are the building blocks of proteins). Too much homocysteine in the blood is related to a higher risk of stroke and heart disease. Mildly elevated levels (which are quite common) might promote atherosclerosis (furring up of the arteries), but this link has not been proven yet. Studies are currently under way to test whether reducing homocysteine levels in people who have mildly elevated levels could prevent heart disease or stroke. Again, the results are not yet known.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In people who have dramatically elevated levels of homocysteine, different food supplements have been shown to bring down homocysteine concentrations and to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes. These supplements include folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, betaine, and phosphatidylcholine. This study looked at the effects of betaine, folic acid, and phosphatidylcholine on blood lipids in healthy people. The researchers wanted to study blood lipids, especially &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; cholesterol (LDL cholesterol), because they are known to influence the risk of heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do?</title><p>They analyzed data from four different studies that looked at the ability of the three substances to lower homocysteine levels. They analyzed the blood samples (which had previously been used to measure homocysteine) for lipid levels.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Did They Find?</title><p>They found that betaine increased the level of &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; cholesterol. Folic acid did not affect lipid levels. The data for phosphatidylcholine were not conclusive.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>What Does This Mean?</title><p>This suggests that the beneficial effects of betaine (which lowers homocysteine) might be undone at least in part by its negative effects on blood lipids. Based on these results, folic acid would be a better choice for people who want to lower their homocysteine levels, since folic acid doesn't cause a rise in &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="sb1f"><title>More Information Online</title><p>More information on the link between homocysteine and heart disease can be found at the following Web sites.
