This article reports a sub-analysis from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in people with COPD and EID (COPD/EID). The primary aim, in people with COPD/ EID, was to determine the repeatability of the distance and time walked in the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), respectively. A secondary aim was to determine whether any participant characteristics predicted those who did not demonstrate improvements on a repeat ISWT or ESWT. Participants with nadir oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &#x0003c; 90% on the 6-minute walk test were recruited to the RCT. Two ISWTs and two ESWTs were then performed as part of the baseline assessments, and participants were included in this sub-analysis if their nadir SpO<sub>2</sub> was &#x0003c;90% during the better of two ISWTs. Repeatability of the tests was analysed using Bland&#x02013;Altman plots and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Participant characteristics of age, lung function, level of nadir SpO<sub>2</sub> and end-test dyspnoea were used to predict those who were not likely to demonstrate improvements on a repeat test using receiver operating curves. Eighty-seven participants (mean age (standard deviation, SD) 70 (7) years; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) 47 (17)% predicted) were included. The mean differences (coefficient of repeatability) for the ISWTs and ESWTs were 9 m (55 m) and 19 seconds (142 seconds) respectively (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). No participant characteristic predicted the absence of improvement on the second ISWT (area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.49 to 0.58, all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.2) or the second ESWT (AUC ranged from 0.43 to 0.52, all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.3). Although repeating the tests showed only small improvements in distance (ISWT) and time (ESWT) walked in people with COPD/EID, the variability was large making definite conclusions about test repeatability in these individuals difficult.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>exercise test</kwd><kwd>exercise induced</kwd><kwd>oxygen desaturation</kwd><kwd>repeatability</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1479972317729051"><funding-source id="funding1-1479972317729051"><institution-wrap><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1479972317729051">1019989</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1479972317729051"><title>Introduction</title><p>Field walk tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) are commonly used in the assessment of exercise tolerance in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation (EID) during field walk tests is common in people with COPD. A few studies<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> showed that between 47% and 74% of patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation demonstrated a nadir oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) during 6MWT of &#x0003c;90%. Although the definition of EID that is clinically important for people with COPD has not been determined, it is often reported as a decline in SpO<sub>2</sub> of &#x02265;4% or &#x0003e;4% to &#x0003c;90% during a 6MWT.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>

Whether people improve with test familiarization on the ESWT was less clear.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The repeatability of the ISWT and ESWT has not been investigated in the subgroup of people with COPD who demonstrate EID (COPD/EID). Given that EID in people with COPD is common,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and field walk tests are regularly used as part of exercise assessment in rehabilitation programs and to determine the need for ambulatory oxygen therapy in this group, a better understanding of the need to repeat these field walk tests in this subgroup is warranted. There is a possibility that the learning effect in performance of the ISWT and ESWT is not as pronounced in this subgroup as they may experience primarily symptom limitation associated with EID, such as dyspnoea and/or fatigue, to end the test rather than test termination being associated with lack of familiarization. If the learning effect is not as pronounced in those with COPD/EID, there could be resource implications and repeating the walk tests may not be required. It would also be useful for clinicians to know if any patient characteristics could predict those who are not likely to demonstrate improvements on a repeat test in this subgroup; however, this has not been previously determined.</p><p>This article reports a sub-analysis from a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) where people with COPD/EID were recruited.

People with COPD were recruited from referrals to pulmonary rehabilitation programs at seven Australian sites (Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, New South Wales (NSW); Concord Repatriation General Hospital, NSW; Liverpool Hospital, NSW; Austin Health and Alfred Health, Victoria; Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital, Western Australia; Prince Charles Hospital, Queensland) and were screened using a 6MWT to ensure evidence of EID (i.e. SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 90% during the 6MWT performed on room air).

The main findings of this study were that the distance walked in the ISWT and the duration of walking in the ESWT showed only small differences between the first and second tests. In addition, there was a statistically significant difference with the end-test dyspnoea score for the ISWT and ESWT with repeat testing, but the difference was only small and not clinically relevant.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> While these main findings might suggest that repeat tests are not needed for a group of people with COPD/EID, the coefficient of repeatability was wide, indicating variability in individual responses. We were not able to identify any participant characteristics that could predict those who did not demonstrate improvement on a second test.</p><p>This study has shown that people with COPD/EID walk significantly further and longer on a second test for the ISWT and ESWT, respectively, but the overall mean difference was small (ISWT = 9 m; ESWT = 19 seconds). Interestingly, this amount of difference was lower than that reported for people with COPD without specified EID (20&#x02013;25 m on the ISWT and 26 seconds on the ESWT).<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> No study has previously reported on repeatability of the ISWT and ESWT in a large group of people with COPD/EID. One study discussed a subgroup analysis involving people with COPD/EID when reporting the repeatability of the ISWT in people with COPD and showed a difference of 26.5 m between repeat ISWTs in this subgroup.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The details provided about the participants in this subgroup analysis were inadequate to enable comparison with the current study.</p><p>When reviewing the Bland&#x02013;Altman plots for both the ISWT and ESWT, the mean differences were small but the upper bounds of the CR were high being 64 m for the ISWT and 161 seconds for the ESWT indicating that some participants had large differences between repeat tests. The proportion of the sample who demonstrated an improvement in ISWT and ESWT on repeat testing was 49% and 53%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479972317729051">Figure 1(a) and (b)</xref>). In stable COPD, it has been suggested that two tests are required for the ISWT in order to account for the learning effect but that one test may be sufficient for the ESWT.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1479972317729051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> As approximately 50% of the group improved on either the ISWT or ESWT with repeat testing, it seems that repeat testing is needed in order to adequately interpret changes in these measures following an intervention.</p><p>Understanding whether there are any participant characteristics that can be used to predict who does not demonstrate an improvement on a second ISWT or ESWT would be useful to guide clinicians in their decisions about who requires repeat testing. Obviously, this issue has resource and time implications for assessment clinics or rehabilitation programs. The results of the ROCs in this study for age, FEV<sub>1</sub> (%predicted), end-test dyspnoea, end-test RPE and nadir SpO<sub>2</sub> during the first ISWT or ESWT indicated AUC values were &#x0003c;0.6 and not significant, suggesting that no participant characteristic was able to predict lack of improvement on a second test.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study was that results may have been affected by order bias, as testing sequence was standardized rather than random. In addition, this study has only demonstrated the size of the learning effect in the ISWT and ESWT before exercise training in people with COPD/EID. The learning effect in ISWT and ESWT after exercise training in people with COPD/EID remains unknown. In this study, all testing took place on room air so conclusions can only be made about repeat testing on room air. Given that tests such as the ESWT may also be used to determine response to ambulatory oxygen in people with COPD/EID, in future studies, it would be important to identify whether repeat testing is needed under these conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section9-1479972317729051"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a group of people with moderate to severe COPD with EID, repeating the ISWT and the ESWT resulted in only small improvements in walk distance and walk time, respectively. However, the wide CR coupled with the inability to use participant characteristics to predict those who did not improve on repeat testing make conclusions on whether repeat testing should be performed for any given individual with COPD/EID difficult.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all the assessors at each research centres for their contribution to the study.
