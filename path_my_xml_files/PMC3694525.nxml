The primary care-based IMPACT (IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy) trial evaluates whether fixed dose combination therapy (a &#x0201c;polypill&#x0201d;) improves adherence to guideline-based therapy compared with current care among people at high risk of CVD. Interventions shown in trials to be effective do not necessarily reduce ethnic disparities, and may in fact widen them. Indigenous populations with poorer health outcomes are often under-represented in trials so the effect of interventions cannot be assessed for them, specifically. Therefore, the IMPACT trial aimed to recruit as many M&#x00101;ori as non-M&#x00101;ori to assess the consistency of the effect of the polypill.

Additional funding and M&#x00101;ori research nurses were sought to allow home-based assessment, establishment of the relationship between research nurse and participant, more family involvement prior to enrollment, continuity of the research nurse-participant relationship, and acknowledgement of other M&#x00101;ori culturally important procedures, interactions, language and manners. Primary care practices with high enrollment of M&#x00101;ori were targeted, with over-sampling of potentially eligible M&#x00101;ori patients, lower thresholds for screening of M&#x00101;ori and 6 months continued M&#x00101;ori recruitment after non-M&#x00101;ori recruitment had finished.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 257 M&#x00101;ori and 256 non-M&#x00101;ori participants were randomized.

Potentially eligible M&#x00101;ori were more likely than non-M&#x00101;ori to proceed to subsequent stages of recruitment.

These include the rights to self-determination and health comparable to that enjoyed by others in NZ. Despite these rights, M&#x00101;ori are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The age-standardized prevalence of CVD in 2007 was greater among M&#x00101;ori (7.41%) than among other groups (Pacific 5.68%, Indian 4.96% and the rest of the NZ population 4.45%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. M&#x00101;ori age- and sex-standardized public hospitalisation rates (2003&#x02013;2005) and mortality rates (2000&#x02013;2004) were approximately twice that of non-M&#x00101;ori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the life-expectancy of M&#x00101;ori is eight years less than non-M&#x00101;ori, primarily due to CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other countries also experience inequalities in CVD between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>One approach that may improve the management of CVD is fixed dose combination therapy (a &#x0201c;polypill&#x0201d;). The IMPACT (IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy) trial is a NZ primary care-based randomized controlled trial assessing whether a polypill of four CVD preventive medications improves adherence to guideline-based therapy compared with usual care, where medications are prescribed as single tablets or double combinations tablets only, among people with or at high risk of CVD, and for whom all components of the polypill are indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Interventions shown in trials to be effective do not necessarily reduce ethnic disparities, and may in fact widen them. Indigenous populations with poorer health outcomes are often under-represented in trials so the effect of interventions cannot be assessed for them, specifically. Therefore, the IMPACT trial aimed to recruit as many M&#x00101;ori as non-M&#x00101;ori to assess the consistency of the effect of the polypill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, researchers have often found it challenging to recruit sufficient numbers of indigenous participants to intervention trials, including M&#x00101;ori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] so specific strategies were developed to achieve equal recruitment of M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori participants.</p><p>The trial was also developed from an indigenous rights-based perspective. Priority was therefore placed on supporting indigenous rights to self-determination to the extent feasible throughout the trial. Equal recruitment of M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori was sought so that information about M&#x00101;ori would be obtained to at least the same depth and breadth as that obtained for non-M&#x00101;ori. This meant oversampling of M&#x00101;ori who comprised just 14% of the total NZ population in the latest reported Census [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

(&#x0201c;quadruple therapy&#x0201d;) was higher amongst non-M&#x00101;ori than M&#x00101;ori participants (51 vs 37%, p = 0.0011).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite previous low levels of M&#x00101;ori participation in clinical trials, equal numbers of M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori participants were recruited in this study among patients at high risk of CVD. The trial will therefore be able to assess the consistency of the effects of the polypill in M&#x00101;ori compared with non-M&#x00101;ori, though it is not adequately powered to separately assess these effects in M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori.</p><p>The two key aspects to achieving the recruitment target were supporting indigenous self-determination and making equal recruitment a priority. Indigenous self-determination was supported by: having experienced M&#x00101;ori researchers in trial governance; employment of M&#x00101;ori research nurses or research nurses with significant experience working with M&#x00101;ori; and ensuring that contact with participants was culturally appropriate. Equal recruitment was prioritised by: having a commitment to this by the trial Steering Committee; obtaining sufficient extra funding for additional research nurse time required to recruit M&#x00101;ori; targeting practices with high M&#x00101;ori populations; over-sampling and broadening the search strategy to identify potentially eligible M&#x00101;ori; and extending recruitment duration for M&#x00101;ori. It is also likely that perceived acceptability of the polypill to M&#x00101;ori contributed to recruitment onto the trial.</p><p>Once M&#x00101;ori were identified as potentially eligible from electronic practice records, they were statistically significantly more likely than non-M&#x00101;ori to proceed to each subsequent stage of recruitment. M&#x00101;ori were also more likely than non-M&#x00101;ori to be excluded once their consent had been obtained, primarily due to the greater proportion of M&#x00101;ori with a CVD risk that was too low for inclusion. This is most likely because of the broader search strategy used to identify potentially eligible M&#x00101;ori (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). M&#x00101;ori may have been more likely than non-M&#x00101;ori to have no or incomplete laboratory results because they were younger and less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease. If research nurses (or other research staff) had obtained laboratory specimens directly (rather than requiring patients to attend a community laboratory), the trial may have been even more accessible to M&#x00101;ori.</p><p>Higher triglyceride levels may explain why M&#x00101;ori were more likely than non-M&#x00101;ori to be excluded because in these circumstances LDL is unable to be calculated. The differences in baseline characteristics between randomized M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori are also likely to reflect the broader search strategy used to identify potentially eligible M&#x00101;ori, plus the greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes among M&#x00101;ori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The differences between M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori do not undermine the validity of the comparison between treatment groups (polypill-based care or usual care) because participants are randomly allocated to treatment groups. However, these differences will need to be taken into consideration when interpreting any differences in treatment effect in M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori.</p><p>While the trial has oversampled M&#x00101;ori, people from the other major ethnic groups in the NZ population (Pacific, Asian, European and Other) have also been included. The proportion of Pacific people in the trial is greater than in the general population (9 vs 6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). This is most likely because practices that were targeted by the trial for their high M&#x00101;ori enrollment also had high enrollment of Pacific people.</p><p>Self-reported adherence to quadruple therapy was lower among M&#x00101;ori than non-M&#x00101;ori but this difference became statistically non-significant when we stratified participants by history of CVD, suggesting it is likely to be at least partially due to the higher prevalence of CVD amongst non-M&#x00101;ori participants in the trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recruitment of equal numbers of M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori participants is possible if it is prioritised, adequately resourced and self-determination supported. Equal recruitment of indigenous and non-indigenous participants allows the assessment of the consistency of treatment effects between these groups, and therefore the potential of interventions to not only improve health but also to reduce health inequalities. Differences in the characteristics of M&#x00101;ori and non-M&#x00101;ori participants will need to be taken into account when assessing the consistency of treatment effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr Reddy&#x02019;s Ltd (DRL) provided a polypill free of charge for this trial.
