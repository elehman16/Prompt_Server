The lack of reproducibility of satiety measurement using this approach however results in the tool being unable to distinguish between foods that have small, but possibly important, differences in their satiety effects. An alternate approach is used in sensory evaluation; panellists can be trained in the correct use of the assessment line-scale and brought to consensus on the meanings of descriptors used for food quality attributes to improve the panel reliability. The effect of training on the reliability of a satiety panel has not previously been reported.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Method</title><p>In a randomised controlled parallel intervention, the effect of training in the correct use of a satiety labelled magnitude scale (LMS) was assessed versus no-training. The test-retest precision and reliability of two hour postprandial satiety evaluation after consumption of a standard breakfast was compared. The trained panel then compared the satiety effect of two breakfast meals containing either a viscous or a non-viscous dietary fibre in a crossover trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>A subgroup of the 23 panellists (n = 5) improved their test re-test precision after training.

The trained &#x0201c;satiety expert panel&#x0201d; determined that a standard breakfast with 5g of viscous fibre gave significantly higher satiety than with 5g non-viscous fibre (area under curve (AUC) of 478.2, 334.4 respectively) (p &#x02264; 0.002).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Training reduced between panellist variability.

Satiety is the inhibition of eating which occurs as a consequence of having eaten [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Specifically, satiety involves an individual recognizing hunger and the feeling of being full after a meal and using this perception to control food intake [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The effect of foods on satiety has potential importance in the control of overeating since highly satiating food may increase the time in between eating occasions, leading to a reduction in overall energy intake [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The most common experimental approach for measuring satiety involves fasted subjects consuming the test food or meal and rating their feeling of fullness or hunger. Fullness and hunger in the fasted state and at prescribed time intervals post-meal are recorded on a line scale marked with descriptive anchors. The panellists&#x02019; line scale markings are enumerated by their distance from the start or mid-point [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] on the line scale and this score is plotted against postprandial time to generate a postprandial satiety response curve. The area under this curve (AUC) can be used as a summary value to quantify the individual panellist&#x02019;s satiety response. In addition, the mean value of the AUC of all panellists can then be used as a total satiety response to the experimental food or meal [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Researchers routinely use a visual analogue scale (VAS) in satiety studies though awareness of the multifactorial nature of satiety [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Raben et al [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported measuring hunger sensations under certain circumstances to be a reliable measure with many researchers stating the 100mm VAS satisfactory but suggested variation was due to methodological and biological day to day variability. Raben et al [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also reported researchers could infer the extent of variability from fasting scores. Similarly, Horner et al [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found mean postprandial results less variable than fasting results.</p><p>Knowledge of the factors that contribute to panellist&#x02019; variability would be of value to satiety research. Individuals differ widely in their self-evaluation of the satiety effect of the same meal using line-scales [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] since they are not accustomed to differentiating and scoring the intensity of perceptions such as hunger and fullness that are encountered in daily life. In addition, the expected satiety from a familiar meal may influence the decisions about meal size, as personal perception is determined by experience [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The satiety effect reported for a meal can change in response to external factors such as anticipation of food, emotions, time of day, level of hunger and proximity to food [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore efforts to carefully control factors which influence satiety are needed when designing satiety studies to ensure adequate precision [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Reliability, which includes precision, relates the degree of consistency of repeated measurements. High reliability is important in all studies using panellists and has been highlighted as very important in sensory evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The ICC provides a statistical measure of reliability that can be used to monitor and assess panels and panellists. The ICC compares ratings by a single panellist to total panel rating variation and quantifies the strength of correlation between panellists [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Only when precision and reliability are controlled can the satiety responses of the different foods or meals under evaluation be confidently quantified and differentiated. Reliability of panels for the sensory evaluation of foods has been reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but that of satiety panels is limited [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Reproducibility is defined as test-retest reliability and experts suggest that VAS are ideal for use within subject repeated measure designs [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Aspects that may limit the power of the line scales used in satiety assessment to differentiate the satiety effects of foods include the floor/ceiling effect [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] where panellists rate their hunger or fullness as the lowest or highest possible point on the line scale and consequently, greater or lesser hunger/fullness cannot be assessed. Panellists can also cluster their responses at the anchors (descriptors) on line scales [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which may limit the ability of a line-scale as a tool to differentiate between the satiety effects of different foods. Both floor/ceiling effects and clustering may reduce the ability of satiety studies to detect small, but significant differences between the satiety effects of different foods, although it is important not to limit the usage of the scale if panellist feel the extreme is where there level of fullness or hunger is best described [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Training of panellists in the use of line-scales is commonly used in sensory evaluation of foods in order to increase the reliability of the panel to describe attributes of foods [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126202.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Training approaches used for sensory panels include reaching consensus on the meaning of the descriptors on the line scale (for example when describing a quality parameter such texture or colour) and also orientation training where the panellists become familiar with using the use of line scale [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Trained panellists have previously been used to measure the satiety effects of alginate and whey protein-based foods [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a study by Solah et al [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], training involved consumption of a standard meal by fasted panellists who then completed a VAS and subsequently reached a consensus on the meaning of the VAS descriptors. It was concluded however that the effect of training on the precision and reliability of a satiety panel and the benefits of training a satiety panel need further investigation.</p><p>The primary outcome measure of satiety research is postprandial satiety response measured by a labelled magnitude satiety line scale (LMS).The primary aim of this study was to investigate if training satiety panellists in the interpretation and use of the satiety line-scale could improve the test-retest precision and reliability of satiety response to a standard breakfast meal using a parallel intervention of either (i) training or (ii) no-training. A secondary aim was to select a &#x0201c;satiety expert panel&#x0201d; from the trained panel to compare the satiety effect of two breakfast meals containing either a viscous or a non-viscous dietary fibre.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study 1&#x02014;The effect of training on the reliability of satiety evaluation</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty four healthy subjects (17 females and 7 males; BMI 18.1&#x02013;29.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), aged 19 to 53 years were recruited from the staff and student population of Curtin University (Perth, Australia) over the period September 2, 2013 to May 30, 2014. The study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee on August 14, 2013 and informed written consent was obtained from all subjects before the start of the study. The study was retrospectively registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) after the enrolment of participants. Curtin University satiety studies that do not involve blood collection are not routinely registered as clinical trials, however a second related study on postprandial glycemia and satiety entailed clinical trial registration. The clinical trial application was submitted for the combined research. In response however, ANZCTR requested this training study and the second satiety study be separate applications. Despite, the delay in ANZCTR registration, the authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.</p><p>The exclusion criteria used for this research were individuals that: were smokers; pregnant women; taking medication known to affect satiety; had food allergies; were unwilling to avoid alcohol during the study; normally consumed more than three standard alcoholic drinks per day or; had any history of diabetes, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular diseases.

Prior testing, panellists arrived at the Sensory Evaluation Laboratory at Curtin University and were given instructions about the procedures for the day. Panellists marked their fasting level of hunger/fullness on the LMS scale. Panellists were then requested to consume a standard breakfast meal, in its entirety, within 12 minutes. Panellists were required to mark their feeling of post-meal hunger/fullness on a separate LMS each 15 minutes after the commencement of eating for the first hour and each 30 minutes during the second hour. A postprandial satiety curve was generated for each panellist by plotting their satiety score (mm) against time from start of meal (minutes). The AUC of postprandial satiety was calculated using the trapezoid rule [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Standard breakfast formulation and composition</title><p>The standard breakfast (total weight 228g) contained cereal flakes (15g each of Kellogg&#x02019;s Branflakes, Cornflakes and Special K), sultanas (8g) and whole milk (175g) with an energy content of 1261kJ [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This breakfast was developed by conducting a preliminary satiety evaluation (data not shown) to provide a meal that would induce immediate post-meal satiety of at least &#x0201c;Moderately full&#x0201d; using the LMS in a previously fasted panellist. The nutritional composition of the standard breakfast meal was: protein 11.9g, total fat 6.7g, available carbohydrates 51.8g calculated using the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Nutrition Panel Calculator [<xref rid="pone.0126202.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Training intervention</title><p>The training session of one hour was conducted once during the study with the training group (<xref rid="pone.0126202.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

During the training intervention, fasted panellists consumed the standard breakfast meal at time point 0 and completed the LMS. All LMS results were then transcribed on a whiteboard and the results discussed. Consensus was reached by the panellists on the meaning of the descriptor words and more detailed definitions of the descriptors were generated by the panellists and voted upon. The descriptive terms generated served to increase participants&#x02019; understanding of the groups accepted meaning of descriptors and thereby decreasing inter panellist variability.</p><p>The second aspect of the training was to instruct the panellists on the correct use of the LMS as a continuous scale i.e. to avoid clustering marks at the anchors. During the training session if one panellist voted for &#x0201c;cannot eat another thing&#x0201d; as the definition for &#x0201c;very full&#x0201d; but 11 panellists voted for &#x0201c;cannot eat another thing&#x02019; as the definition for &#x0201c;extremely full&#x0201d;, this was accepted by all 12 panellists as the definition to be considered in the satiety study.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using Stata statistical software (SE 12.1, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and values of p &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered as significant.</p><p>Each panellist&#x02019;s satiety score (n = 23) at each test time point (baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes), was used to generate postprandial satiety curve for each test occasion and the area under the postprandial satiety curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. While most satiety studies adjust for baseline, this the data was used as presented by panellists and not adjusted for baseline because fasting satiety scores gave greater within subject variation than postprandial scores, as also reported by Horner et al.

ICC was used to reflect the proportion of total variance in difference of AUC that was accounted for by clustering. ICCs were determined from estimation after mixed random effect modeling, in which each subject&#x02019;s identification code was included as a random effect to account for the intra-group correlation i.e. the lack of independence of measurement within a same subject at different test point, which is the repeated measurement in this case.

If individual postprandial satiety responses (within subject after the same meal) are highly variable because panellists are not able to adequately describe their feelings or experiences, training serves to reduce this variation. Trained panellists can describe their feelings of hunger and fullness using a scale in a more reliable way. There is a danger that training may change panellist thinking to be analytical and unnatural.

The panel, after training, provided more reproducible assessment of the postprandial satiety response to a standard breakfast. Training was also found to reduce between panellist variability. This research indicates that the trained panel has the potential to increased discriminatory power to detect differences in the satiety effect of treatments. The ICC, which quantifies the strength of correlation was used as a measure of reliability, and found to increase with training. Panellists were screened for individual precision and a &#x0201c;satiety expert panel (SEP)&#x0201d; selected from those meeting preset precision criteria. This SEP detected a significant difference in the postprandial satiety effect of control breakfast containing non-viscous fibre and a breakfast containing a viscous fibre. Further research is needed to verify if training is as effective with alternate study designs with a different group of trained panellists such as older or obese panellists who may respond differently.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, the assessment of individual&#x02019;s test re-test precision is highly recommended prior to their inclusion in a satiety panel. Furthermore screening for test-retest precision and conducting the training protocol described in this study is recommended to ensure the most reliable panel. In circumstances when this training program cannot be undertaken, it is recommended that panellists practice in the use of the satiety line scale prior to commencement of a satiety study; as we have demonstrated that this experience can improve test re-test precision. In conclusion, training improved the reliability of the satiety line-scale and using a trained panel should therefore be beneficial in satiety evaluation studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0126202.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
