Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) is a promising fixed-dose ACT with limited information on its safety and efficacy in African children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The non-inferiority of DHA-PQP versus artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in children 6&#x02013;59 months old with uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria was tested in five African countries (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia). Patients were randomised (2&#x02236;1) to receive either DHA-PQP or AL. Non-inferiority was assessed using a margin of &#x02212;5&#x00025; for the lower limit of the one-sided 97.5&#x00025; confidence interval on the treatment difference (DHA-PQP vs. AL) of the day 28 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) corrected cure rate. Efficacy analysis was performed in several populations, and two of them are presented here: intention-to-treat (ITT) and enlarged per-protocol (ePP). 1553 children were randomised, 1039 receiving DHA-PQP and 514 AL. The PCR-corrected day 28 cure rate was 90.4&#x00025; (ITT) and 94.7&#x00025; (ePP) in the DHA-PQP group, and 90.0&#x00025; (ITT) and 95.3&#x00025; (ePP) in the AL group. The lower limits of the one-sided 97.5&#x00025; CI of the difference between the two treatments were &#x02212;2.80&#x00025; and &#x02212;2.96&#x00025;, in the ITT and ePP populations, respectively. In the ITT population, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of new infections up to Day 42 was 13.55&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 11.35&#x00025;&#x02013;15.76&#x00025;) for DHA-PQP vs 24.00&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI: 20.11&#x00025;&#x02013;27.88&#x00025;) for AL (p&#x0003c;0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>DHA-PQP is as efficacious as AL in treating uncomplicated malaria in African children from different endemicity settings, and shows a comparable safety profile. The occurrence of new infections within the 42-day follow up was significantly lower in the DHA-PQP group, indicating a longer post-treatment prophylactic effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Controlled-trials.com <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN16263443/">ISRCTN16263443</ext-link>

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends their use for treating uncomplicated malaria <xref rid="pone.0007871-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In Africa, their introduction on a wide scale began in 2003 and currently most African countries have adopted or are using ACTs as first or second line treatments, either artesunate-amodiaquine or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) <xref rid="pone.0007871-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, available as co-formulations produced under GMP, though the former is also used as a co-blistered or non-co-formulated product. The co-formulation of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolite of artemisinin derivatives, with piperaquine (PQP), a bisquinoline structurally close to chloroquine, seems to be a promising combination and a good alternative to AL, whose optimal use in the public health system is challenged by the twice-daily dosing scheme and the need for co-administration with fatty food <xref rid="pone.0007871-Ezzet1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, necessary for improving the absorption of lumefantrine. DHA-PQP provides a simpler dosage scheme (a single daily dose over 3 days) than AL and is generally administered without specific food instructions, though recent data indicate that co-administration with fat (milk, biscuit, or other food) increases bio-availability of piperaquine and possibly efficacy <xref rid="pone.0007871-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Several trials <xref rid="pone.0007871-Grande1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0007871-Myint1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> have assessed DHA-PQP safety, efficacy and effectiveness <xref rid="pone.0007871-Smithuis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, mostly in Asia, reporting an efficacy of about 90&#x00025; over 28&#x02013;63 days <xref rid="pone.0007871-Myint1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. There is little information on the safety and efficacy of DHA-PQP in African children, as only a few single-centre trials <xref rid="pone.0007871-Kamya1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0007871-Zongo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have been done in Africa. DHA-PQP is registered in several countries in Africa and South-East Asia and has been widely used in Vietnam or Cambodia, though these formulations are not manufactured according to internationally recognised GMP. In 2005, a public-private partnership programme funded by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and led by the Italian Company Sigma-Tau I.F.R. SpA (Rome) in collaboration with the University of Oxford was set up to fill the gaps needed for the international registration of DHA-PQP. This included a phase III, randomized multicentre trial to test the non-inferiority of DHA-PQP compared with AL in treating uncomplicated malaria in African children.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting non-inferiority adapted <xref rid="pone.0007871-Piaggio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> CONSORT checklist are available and annexed as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007871.s001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007871.s002">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Considerations and Patient Safety</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, the Ethical Committee of the Antwerp University Hospital, the University of Heidelberg Ethics Committee and by the National Ethics Review Committee or Institutional Review Board at each trial site.

Patients satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled if the parent/guardian signed a detailed written informed consent.</p><p>Patients were individually randomised according to a 2&#x02236;1 (DHA-PQP&#x02236;AL) scheme, so as to have more patients in the DHA-PQP arm to provide better estimates for its cure rates and more cases for the integrated safety data base. A randomisation list stratified by country was generated by an independent off site contract research organisation (CRO), with each treatment allocation concealed in opaque sealed envelopes that were opened only after the patient's recruitment.</p><p>Both drugs were administered under direct supervision during 3 consecutive days, according to the patient's body weight. AL (Coartem&#x02122;, Novartis, Switzerland) was administered twice a day (at enrolment and at 8, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h) according to the following dosage: weight 5&#x02013;14 kg: one tablet per dose; weight 15&#x02013;24 kg: two tablets per dose; weight 25&#x02013;34 kg: three tablets per dose. DHA-PQP (Eurartesim&#x02122;, Sigma-Tau, Italy) was given once daily, at the standard dosage of 2.25 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg per dose of DHA and PQP, respectively, rounded up to the nearest half tablet. To facilitate the correct dosing of DHA-PQP, two formulations were used (DHA 20 mg &#x0002b; PQP 160 mg and DHA 40 mg &#x0002b; PQP 320 mg). In case of vomiting, a full dose was repeated if this occurred within the first half an hour, or half a dose if it occurred between 30 minutes and 1 h. AL was administered concomitantly with milk (as recommended by the manufacturer) while for DHA-PQP no specific instructions regarding co-administration with food were given. For infants, drugs were crushed, mixed with water and administered as slurry.</p><p>Both patient allocation to the different analysis populations and assessment of the primary end-point were made by staff blinded to the treatment assignment and before availability of the PCR results.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment Follow-Up, Clinical and Laboratory Procedures</title><p>All children were kept at the health facility for the 3-day dosing period. The mother/guardian was asked to return with the child for scheduled visits on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 post-treatment, or if any symptoms occurred. Field workers traced patients missing any visit. For each visit, a physical examination was performed by the study clinicians, vital signs were recorded, and axillary temperature measured with an electronic thermometer. Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded and monitored throughout the study. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed at enrolment and repeated on days 2 and 7 to assess any QT/QTc interval prolongation. Any ECG abnormality detected at enrolment requiring urgent management was considered an exclusion criterion. All ECG records were transmitted daily online to a central cardiologist (Paris, France) who interpreted them in a blinded manner, and feedback was sent to the sites as soon as available. The QTc interval (ms) was evaluated after correcting for the heart rate with Bazett's or Fridericia's formulae and classified according to the following categories: Normal &#x0003c;430 ms; Borderline: 431&#x02013;450 ms; Prolonged &#x0003e;450 ms.</p><p>The study was supervised by monthly monitoring visits. Rescue treatment for recurrent parasitaemia was according to local national guidelines. All participants, with the exception of those in Kilifi, received a free insecticide-treated bed net at recruitment.</p><p>Capillary or venous blood was taken at every visit. Thick and thin blood films were prepared, dried and Giemsa-stained, and parasite density estimated by counting the number of asexual parasites in 200 white blood cells (WBC), assuming a standard WBC count of 8,000/&#x000b5;l. Quality control was performed in blind conditions on 20&#x00025; of all the slides at a central laboratory. Samples for haematology (full blood count) and biochemistry (liver and renal function) were taken at enrolment, at days 3, 28 and 42, and at any other visit if judged necessary by the clinician. For PCR analysis, three blood spots were collected on filter paper (Whatmann 3 MM) at enrolment and at any visit after day 7. Each filter paper was dried and individually stored in a plastic bag containing silica gel. All filter papers were subsequently transferred to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (Antwerp, Belgium) where centralised genotyping was conducted. Purification of DNA was conducted as previously described <xref rid="pone.0007871-Plowe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Three polymorphic genetic markers MSP1, MSP2 and GluRP were used to distinguish recrudescence from new infections <xref rid="pone.0007871-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007871-RanfordCartwright1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Recrudescence was defined as at least one identical allele for each of the three markers in the pre-treatment and post-treatment samples. New infections were diagnosed when all alleles for at least one of the markers differed between the two samples. All gels were re-read under blinded conditions by an independent expert (National Museum of Natural History, Paris, France). In addition, 20&#x00025; of the filter papers were re-analysed and assessed by an independent laboratory (Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome Classification</title><p>The primary endpoint was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28; secondary efficacy outcomes included PCR-corrected cure rates at days 14 and 42, PCR-uncorrected cure rates at days 14, 28 and 42; parasite and fever clearance times, presence and clearance of gametocytes, and haemoglobin (Hb) changes from baseline to day 28. All standard safety outcomes such as incidence of adverse events, changes from baseline on haematology and clinical chemistry parameters, ECG findings and vital sign variation during the study were also evaluated.</p><p>Treatment outcome was analysed in two ways. The first, based on a pre-defined (in the protocol) procedure further developed with the Data Monitoring and the Clinical Development Committees, complemented the WHO definitions (see below) with a set of rules allowing the evaluation of each individually randomised patient, e.g. patients having taken not-allowed anti-malarial drugs or with halfway missing data such as blood parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007871-t002">Table 2</xref>). Such an approach was defined as primary because it was deemed in line with the requirements of the most stringent regulatory authorities. All cases not strictly matching the WHO definitions and/or the described procedure were reviewed individually at the data review meetings in blind conditions. The second approach, based on the standard definitions of early/late clinical and parasitological failure (World Health Organization) <xref rid="pone.0007871-WHO4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, was used to allow comparison with previously published results. Accordingly, true treatment failure (TTF) was defined as the sum of the early and late (either LPF or LCF) treatment failures occurring until Day 13 (recrudescence by default) and the late treatment failures from Day 14 onwards classified as recrudescence by PCR analysis.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007871-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007871.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Day 28 and Day 42 uncorrected ACPR (steps 1&#x02013;11) and PCR-corrected ACPR (steps 1&#x02013;16) in the different populations of analysis.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007871-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0007871.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Event to be assessed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ePP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ITT</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Withdrawal BEFORE OR AT D28: any reason except lost to follow-up (LFU)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depending on reason, a patient can be: Excluded or Failure</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Failure</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Withdrawal BEFORE OR AT D28: LFU</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excluded</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Failure</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">&#x0002a;</xref>

Indeed, PQP is highly lipid-soluble and its oral bioavailability is enhanced when given with food <xref rid="pone.0007871-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007871-Sim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, though an additional study in Vietnamese healthy volunteers reports no influence of food intake (standardised Vietnamese meal) on PQP pharmacokinetics <xref rid="pone.0007871-Hai1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The issue on whether to recommend the administration of DHA-PQP with a biscuit or a glass of milk remains unanswered. Though co-administration with food may improve the drug's bioavailability, it is unclear whether this will translate in a higher efficacy. In our study, DHA-PQP was given without specific instructions regarding co-administration with food but its efficacy at day 42 was over 90&#x00025;, similar to that reported in a study carried out in Uganda <xref rid="pone.0007871-Kamya1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> but lower than in two other African studies <xref rid="pone.0007871-Yeka1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007871-Zongo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, no clinically relevant heterogeneity was shown across the five African countries despite the high chloroquine resistance previously reported from most study sites <xref rid="pone.0007871-Talisuna1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. When taking into account all recurrent infections observed during the follow up period, i.e., without the PCR correction, the cure rates for DHA-PQP were significantly better than AL, indicating a better post-treatment prophylaxis (PTP) than AL <xref rid="pone.0007871-White1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and confirming that chloroquine resistance did not interfere with DHA-PQP efficacy. The significantly higher Hb change from baseline to the last available data in the DHA-PQP group is in line with this observation. Therefore, the longer PQP's elimination half-life (about 20 days) as compared to lumefantrine (4&#x02013;10 days), provides a longer PTP, prevents the emergence of new infections and improves the patient's haematological recovery, despite a significant chloroquine resistance background. While this is clearly an advantage for the individual, at the population level, it may increase the risk of selecting resistant parasites among the new infection <xref rid="pone.0007871-White2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and stress the need of matching the large scale deployment of DHA-PQP with the careful monitoring of resistance <xref rid="pone.0007871-Talisuna2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>One hundred twenty nine infants aged 6&#x02013;11 months treated with DHA-PQP responded as well to treatment as older children, though the study was not powered to confirm non-inferiority between the two treatment groups. Infants represent a special group as they are more at risk of malaria and of receiving inadequate doses of antimalarial treatments. In Papua, Indonesia, the PQP plasma concentration at day 7 was the major determinant of the therapeutic response to DHA-PQP <xref rid="pone.0007871-Ratcliff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The best cut-off for the day 7 PQP concentration predicting any treatment failure was 30 ng/ml and children had a higher risk of having lower levels <xref rid="pone.0007871-Price2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Similarly, in PNG, a trend toward a lower risk of treatment failure (PCR uncorrected) and plasma PQP levels at day 7 has been reported <xref rid="pone.0007871-Karunajeewa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, suggesting that an increase of the weight-adjusted dosage in children may be required. In our study, preliminary results on predictors of treatment failure seem to confirm the need of reviewing and possibly increasing the weight-adjusted dosage for children.</p><p>Patients treated with DHA-PQP had a significantly higher rate of person-gametocyte-weeks compared with those having received AL. This contrasts with a previous study in Papua, Indonesia, which showed no difference in gametocyte carriage between DHA-PQP and AL <xref rid="pone.0007871-Ratcliff1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but is in line with comparisons between DHA-PQP and mefloquine-artesunate, where a higher production of gametocytes in patients treated with DHA-PQP was observed <xref rid="pone.0007871-Grande1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007871-Smithuis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Such an effect has been attributed to the lower dose of artemisinin derivative used in the DHA-PQP. Gametocytaemia is a proxy measure of transmission potential and the increased gametocyte production related to DHA-PQP use may be a public health disadvantage that should be nevertheless balanced against a better PTP, particularly useful in areas of intense transmission.</p><p>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was well tolerated, with few adverse events of clinical relevance. A higher frequency of abdominal pain and diarrhoea has previously been reported for DHA-PQP compared with mefloquine-artesunate <xref rid="pone.0007871-Myint1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> but this disadvantage of DHA-PQP was not observed in this trial where the comparator treatment was AL. The statistical significant difference in the QTc interval at day 2 was observed only when applying Bazett's but not Fridericia's correction. This was not considered as clinical relevant because of the discrepant results obtained with the 2 methods and because both the proportions of patients with a QTc prolongation between day 0 and 2 higher than 60 ms or with an absolute QTc value greater than 500 ms were extremely low and balanced between groups. Therefore, considering that no cardiovascular AEs were reported, this study adds to the evidence <xref rid="pone.0007871-Myint1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> that, at therapeutic doses, DHA-PQP and AL do not have any clinically significant cardiotoxicity.</p><p>It has also been previously reported that the only potentially serious adverse effects of artemisinin derivatives are rare type 1 hypersensitivity reactions <xref rid="pone.0007871-Myint1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0007871-Nosten1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, no evidence of moderate or severe adverse reactions of this kind was observed in the current study and this was despite the larger sample size compared with other published studies in which the number of patients recruited for each arm did not exceed a few hundred. Indeed, it is reassuring that no major safety problem has been observed in more than 1,000 children treated with DHA-PQP. Nevertheless, such a sample size is unable to detect rare and unexpected serious adverse events and the development of a pharmacovigilance system should be a priority, not only for DHA-PQP but also for all other ACTs. African countries should be encouraged, as the use of ACTs increases, to establish pharmacovigilance systems <xref rid="pone.0007871-Talisuna2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and drug developers and funding agencies should contribute to their development.</p><p>In conclusion, DHA-PQP is a safe, efficacious, tolerable and affordable new antimalarial treatment option in Africa. Its longer PTP period may be particularly useful in areas where transmission is intense, though it may exert an important drug pressure on the parasite populations, possibly selecting resistant strains. The deployment of several ACTs as multiple first line treatments may overcome this problem. Indeed, assuming that different treatments are used in equal amounts in the host population, the use of multiple first line therapies would have two main benefits, i.e. the inability of the parasite to adapt to a variable environment and the reduced drug pressure as the rate at which a given treatment is used would be lower than if it was the only one available <xref rid="pone.0007871-Boni1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. DHA-PQP can definitely play an essential role in our effort to reduce the currently high malaria burden.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007871.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol</p><p>(0.46 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007871.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007871.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.36 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007871.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to the children and mothers who participated in the study.
