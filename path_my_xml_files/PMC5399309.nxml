A simple device that detects mandibular movements can accurately identify patients with CSB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p>Central apnea/hypopnea assuming the pattern of Cheyne Stokes breathing (CSB) is an independent risk condition for mortality in patients with chronic heart failure with a prevalence similar to obstructive sleep apnea or hypopnea (OSA) reaching 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CSB has also been described in patients who have experienced cerebrovascular accidents and among those with end-stage renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, the presence of idiopathic central apneas carries an increased risk of atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, screening and early detection of CSB could be valuable in large populations of chronic disease at-risk patients.</p><p>CSB is a particular form of periodic waxing and waning respiration. The diagnosis is made in presence of periods of central apnea or hypopnea alternating with a crescendo/decrescendo pattern of ventilation. The International Classification of Sleep Diseases diagnostic criteria for CSB requires 10 central apneas per hour of sleep. The cycle length (the time from one zenith in airflow during the respiratory phase to the next zenith in airflow) varies with the underlying disease. In systolic heart failure, cycle lengths are longer (between 45 and 90&#x000a0;s), when compared to the cycle lengths reported for other disorders associated with CSB (~35&#x000a0;s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. During the crescendo/decrescendo phases, respiratory efforts are driving changes in ventilation reflecting variations in respiratory drive. Recurrent arousals occur usually at ventilation peaks, promote ventilatory instability, and perpetuate CSB breathing patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The diagnosis requires expensive and poorly accessible type 1 or 2 polysomnography but could be addressed with a portable monitoring in a high pre-test probability population of CSB for early detection and intervention.</p><p>We have previously showed that respiratory effort are well characterized by an increase in the amplitude of mandibular movements (MM)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.3&#x000a0;mm during episodes of OSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, we have also documented that MM reliably identify cortical arousals ending respiratory events and closing the mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The MM patterns observed are 1) large-amplitude MM (MML), and 2) &#x0201c;sharp&#x0201d; large-amplitude MM (MMS), and these two specific and easily recognizable features readily identify respiratory efforts and cortical arousals, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because MM are simple to acquire using magnetometry, and since the quality of MM signals remains more stable than nasal flow, throughout the night, measurements of MM could be used as a single channel monitor or screener, particularly for use in out of sleep laboratory conditions use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on early empirical observations of magnetometry recordings during CSB events, we hypothesized that periodic MML (LPM) and periodic MMS (SPM) would identify classical CSB which is characterized by periods of respiratory effort with increased ventilation alternating with periods of no (or substantially reduced) effort during apneas (or hypopneas). We therefore evaluated the concordance of LPM and SPM with CSB identified during in-lab PSG.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This prospective study included all adults patients referred to a sleep laboratory (University Hospital UCL Namur site St Elisabeth, Belgium) over a 12-month period for in-laboratory PSG for evaluation of suspected sleep disordered breathing (SDB) of moderate to high probability.

To maximize the visibility of respiratory events of interest, the total sleep period was divided into 3-min segments, and typical events of CSB were identified. CSB periods consisted of at least five breaths demonstrating waxing and waning flow amplitude and separated by central apnea or hypopnea. The duration of CSB periods was analyzed to measure the cycle length.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Analysis of mandibular movements (MM) signals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)</title><p>

</p><p>The MM signal was acquired during the PSG. However, scoring was performed manually by two scorers blinded from the rest of the PSG signals. Prior to main analysis, the inter-observer agreement was evaluated for both SPM and LPM in 100 different samples, each one contains 200 randomised observations. The result shows a high agreement level between two scorers with Cohen&#x02019;s kappa coefficients of 0.89&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 (min&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82, max&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.95) and 0.88&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 (min&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80, max&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93) for SPM and LPM, respectively. The within-observer was also evaluated by validating the manual classification of periodic MM against Central respiratory event. Such validation was also repeated through 100 different samples of 200 randomised observations. The Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa coefficients were steadily above 0.81. Mean Kappa coefficient for both scorers was 0.88&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 (min&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81, max&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.94).</p><p>Normal MM signals consist of oscillatory displacements of the mandible with inspiration and expiration with an amplitude&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.3&#x000a0;mm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). MM&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.3&#x000a0;mm have been shown to occur during increased respiratory effort and are denominated as large MM (MML); these displacements occur at the breathing frequency. Sharp large-amplitude MM occur during cortical arousals, are&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;mm, and termed as MMS. These movements participate to mouth closure. They are all the time well depicted because greater than 200% with regards to the baseline mandibular motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Arbitrarily, periodic MM had to be present at least three times during the 3-min fragments to be considered as a period of CSB. The periodic occurrence of MM was searched by examining the time period between LPM and SPM as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study measurements</title><p>Routine laboratory-based PSG were recorded with B3iP&#x000ae; Medatec Brussel Belgium. The parameters monitored included EEG (Fz-A+, Cz-A+, Pz-A+), right and left electro-oculogram, submental EMG, tibial EMG, chest and abdominal wall motion by respiratory inductance plethysmography (SleepSense S.L.P.Inc, St Charles, USA), nasal and oral flows respectively with a pressure transducer and a thermistor, and O2 saturation by digital oximeter displaying pulse waveform (Nonin&#x000ae;, Nonin Medical, Plymouth USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>A mid-sagittal MM magnetic sensor (Brizzy&#x000ae; Nomics, Liege, Belgium) measured the distance in mm between two parallel, coupled, resonant circuits placed on the forehead and on the chin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The transmitter generates a pulsed magnetic wave of low energy, at 10Hz. The change in the magnetic field is inversely related to the cube of the distance (d) between the chin and forehead probes. The probes were connected to an electronic module, and the distance was computed with a resolution of 0.1&#x000a0;mm before transmission to the PSG through a wireless connection. For each measurement, the zero value of the mandibular displacement was assigned to a position of completely closed mouth. The signal was processed in such a way that, when the distance between the probes increases, it actually decreases. Therefore, the more negative the signal, the lower the mandibular position and the greater the mouth opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, scoring of the MM signals reliably indicated the presence or absence of CSB in patients being evaluated for suspected SDB. Our findings show that the presence of LPM and/or SPM can accurately detect CSB because the periodicity of these typical movements of the mandible. In contrast, MM ruled out CSB in absence of LPM and SPM. These findings support conducting a prospective validity assessment studies of MM recordings in a home-based type 4 device to detect CSB in chronic disease at-risk populations.</p><p>Use of MM signals has emerged as sensitive and specific for identifying underlying respiratory events during OSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, sharp large-amplitude movements of the mandible (MMS) detect cortical arousals that occur after OSA events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the presence of respiratory efforts, even without pharyngeal obstruction, the forces produced by the displacement of the thorax are transmitted through the mediastinum to the upper airway. During each breath, the negative swings of intrathoracic pressure exert caudal traction stretching and improving upper airway patency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Accordingly, similar to the MM patterns observed in OSA, changes in mandibular position directly reflect changes in respiratory effort during the hyperventilation phase of CSB. During the apneic period, no MM is observed.</p><p>In the present study, classification approaches using two binary predictors (LPM and SPM) reliably detected a single binary response variable (presence of CSB detected by PSG). Although different statistical methods may differ in their algorithms, their level of complexity and their overall performance, decision rules in classifying and analyzing the relationship between the binary predictors (LPM, SPM) and the predicted in-laboratory PSG CSB were clearly apparent and involved interpretable models (a traditional logistic model and a decision tree (CART model). Compared to a traditional logistic model and odds-ratio, the CART algorithm has more advantages as the decision tree can be visualized and easily interpreted by straightforward prediction rules, and accordingly is simple and robust for clinical decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As the validation results were identical for both logistic and CART models, any of them could be used to predict the probability of CSB using MM signals.</p><p>Notwithstanding the unique predictability of CSB from MM recordings, we should mention some potential limitations of MM signals. MM signals may fade or become less easily detectable in presence of the muscle atonia during REM sleep. However, CSB is more common during NREM sleep and usually abolished during REM sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>MM signal artefacts from magnetic interferences have only been observed in CT scan rooms or in presence of metal parts placed very close to the probes, or moving in the space around or between the probes. Steady state magnetic signals are filtered out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Some drugs such as sedatives could increase the threshold for arousals and accordingly reduce the frequency of arousal events, and therefore of SPM, affecting the ability of the signal to detect CSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This risk is limited in a model where two independent variables (LPM and/or SPM) are employed. Others movements of the mandible (due to bruxism, chewing or swallowing) have been described during sleep but the latter are void of the typical CSB periodicity. They are not driven at the breathing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The false negative and positive rates could have been affected by scoring error and the simplicity of the classification rule (exclusive use of binary predictor). However, the study is strengthened by the blinded scoring approach, the large sample size used with random assignments into a training and validation sets, a large and comprehensive range of classifiers with potential machine solutions, a repeated K-fold cross validation on random data subsets, and an independent and random model of validation. Based on the present findings, we posit that the models developed herein could contribute the development of an algorithm to evaluate CSB diagnosis based on MM manual analysis, particularly considering that the CART model classification tree is appropriate for human decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of note, even more complex algorithms may have potential applications when used in the development of automated interpretation software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Isolated analysis of mandibular movements enables accurate identification of CSB in patients during in lab PSG.
