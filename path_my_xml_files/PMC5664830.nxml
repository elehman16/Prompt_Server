Different groups of individuals are affected by air pollution in different ways. Pregnant women and their fetuses, for example, belong to a very vulnerable group and are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of hazardous air pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Some of the adverse outcomes of exposure to outdoor air pollution for pregnant women include low birth weight of the baby, preterm labor, and intrauterine growth retardation that in turn can lead to morbidity and mortality in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

It assesses an individual's readiness to act on a new healthier behavior, and provides strategies, or processes of change to guide the individual through the stages of change.

The &#x02018;stages of change&#x02019; places people in one of five stages of readiness/openness to engage in a given behavior. These are: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The proposed stages of change indicate that individuals who are changing their behavior move through a series of stages. Precontemplation is the stage in which individuals do not intend to change their behavior in the near future. In contemplation, individuals are considering it but are not committed to it and in preparation; individuals are committing to and planning for imminent change. Action is the stage in which behavior has changed and maintenance is the stage in which people are working to prevent relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Transition between the different stages depends on an individual's motivation and self-efficacy levels, which can be enhanced by the use of cognitive and behavioral processes such as consciousness raising, dramatic relief and helping relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">2.

</p><p id="Par17">To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated behavioral change in terms of prevention of air pollution exposure in pregnant women. Such a study is needed, given the importance and relevance of this topic in a critically polluted environments such as Tehran,. As metioned before this becomes more crucial considering that it has serious adverse health effects at population level and particularly vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and their fetuses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a TTM-based educational intervention to persuade changes in exposure behavior of pregnant women in response to air pollution and to eventually promote health in this population subgroup.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par18">This was a parrall group randomized controlled trial to assess effectivness of a theory-based intervention to minimize air pollution exposure among pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par19">In all 135 women were contacted, but five women (3.5%) refused to participate. No differences in socio-demographic variables between women refusing to participate and women interested in participating could be detected. Out of the 130 interested potential participants 110 women met the eligibility criteria. These criteria included: aged 18 to 35 years, having a history of pregnancy without any adverse outcomes (e.g. Preterm labor); not suffering from any chronic disease (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, kidney of cardiovascular problems), no previous history of infertility, gestational age between 20&#x02013;24 weeks, and having owning a mobile phone for receipt of daily messages. Women were excluded from the study if they were experiencing complications during their pregnancy such as bleeding, hypertension, or any other complication resulting in permanent bed rest or hospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting and procedure</title><p id="Par20">The study was conducted between June 2012 and September 2012 at the prenatal care ward of a teaching hospital in Tehran, Iran. The center is one of the largest obstetrics hospitals in Tehran. Women attending the hospital were approached by their visiting midwife and after declaring their interest to participate in the study, they received detailed information regarding the aim of the study and were asked to provide informed consent. Then participants were randomly assigned to either the control or the intervention group according to simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers). After data collection at 2- month follow-up, women in both the control and the intervention group were given a doll as a thank you gift. Participants by pen and paper completed questionnaires at clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par21">The educational intervention consisted of three components including 1. A one-hour motivational interviewing session conducted by principal investigator focusing on preventive behaviors to air pollution exposure, 2. Daily small message service (SMS) over a one-month span. 3. An educational booklet regarding air pollution. The goal of the intervention was to transit the participants from the precontemplation stage into the action stage of the TTM. Motivational interviewing sessions were held in small groups of six participants and aimed at helping the participants expressing their own reasons for and against change and how their current behavior or health status affects their ability to achieve their life goals or fulfill core values. Key motivational interviewing methods used in the intervention included asking open-ended questions (e.g., what are benefits or barriers to minimizing exposure to air pollution?), affirming (to enhance self-efficacy) and supporting the participants during the session (e.g., it is great that you manage your time so that you not to go outdoors in the peak hours of air pollution in the morning or evening, and ensuring participant that SMS will be sent to them in order to informing participants of air pollution levels). During these sessions, participants were asked to report about their own current behaviors and the reasons for such behaviors. Together with the interviewer, these behaviors were analyzed and discussed and participants were motivated to change their unhealthy behaviors, full description about this part has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. At the end of the sessions, each participant was provided with an educational booklet containing information about air quality in Tehran, the health risks of air pollution for both mother and fetus during pregnancy, motivating illustrations and pictures, and short statements to encourage participants to engage in preventive behaviors. Daily SMS was sent to the participants to inform them about Tehran&#x02019;s daily air quality and to encourage participants to behave as recommended in the educational sessions. The SMS, as well as information regarding the air quality, were provided by Tehran Air Quality Control Company (AQCC). The control group received neither motivational interviews nor any detailed information regarding air quality in Tehran but only routine prenatal care. No interventions were performed for the control group. Yet, the data of air quality status could be found on Tehran Air Quality Control Company website that is available to public at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://air.tehran.ir/">http://air.tehran.ir/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par22">

Overall, women in the intervention group performed the suggested preventive behaviors better and more often (reduce exposure time to hazardous outdoor air pollutants) than the control group. The results further showed that focusing on self-efficacy and own beliefs to change helped women in the intervention group to perform the desired behaviors. This is consistent with the findings from Bazargan and Downer and colleagues whose study results suggested that improving people&#x02019;s self-efficacy via motivational interventions and sending text messages could lead to an increase in preventive health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">In line with our study Karatay et al., found that motivational interviewing could change pregnant women&#x02019;s perception regarding the importance of behavioral changes and enable them to eliminate unhealthy behaviors in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] while another study conducted by Hayes et al., did not support the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in changing towards healthy behavior in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One possible explanation for such differences might be due to the fact that they have assessed different types of behaviors. For instance, while air pollution preventive behavior needs more time management, smoking preventive behaviors needs more complex psychological process.</p><p id="Par40">Our findings are in accordance with previous study results of theory-based health behavior changes for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Aveyard et al., investigated the stages of smoking cessation behavior in a sample of pregnant women in England and concluded that TTM-based intervevtions are more effective than interventions which use only the stages of chang construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Results from another study conducted by Lawrence and colleagues showed that quittng smoking in pregnancy could be increased using TTM-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In the present study, the best interventional effects were observed in the constructs &#x0201c;perceived benefits&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;self-efficacy&#x0201d;. This is in line with reports from previous studies. where TTM-based educational intervention significantly enhanced the stages of behavioral change and increased perceived benefits and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These findings could be better understood when bearing in mind the strong and weak points of the TTM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]; Progression from precontemplation to the stage of action leads to a one SD increase in perceived benefit (pros) whereas it also leads to a one-half SD decrease in perceived barriers (cons).</p><p id="Par42">Although reducing exposure to air pollution protect pregnant women' health, staying indoor may interfere with needing to go to work, getting children to school or on the bus or needing to do household jobs and shopping. Perhaps pregnant women may plan to do their duties on hours which air pollution is not critical to protect their health and their growing baby.</p><p id="Par43">A previous study showed that although the knowledge regarding air pollution health risk seems to be desirable, they did not comply preventive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, just being knowledgeable about something does not trigger doing desired action. Since determinants of behavior are unlimited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we should go beyond knowledge and should change attitude, beliefs and other important determinants of behavior.</p><p id="Par44">Long-term environmental health education programs at the level of population are needed to change attitude and behaviors regarding air pollution of Tehran.
