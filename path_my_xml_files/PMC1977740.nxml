All patients had axillary nodal involvement. Primary treatment consisted of a radical mastectomy or simple mastectomy with radiotherapy. The rarity of the disease precluded a randomised trial. Thirty-nine patients are available for analysis at a median follow-up of 49 months. The actuarial survival of the Tamoxifen treated patients is 61% (range 42-80%) at 5 years compared to 44% (range 35-53%) for historical controls (P = 0.006). Disease-free survival was 56% (37-75%) vs 28% (17-33%) at 5 years (P = 0.005). There were no serious side-effects recorded. The conclusion from this, the first reported series on adjuvant Tamoxifen therapy for MBC, is that significant improvement in disease-free survival can be achieved with minimal upset to the patients. Recruitment to the study continues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00066-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="252" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00066-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="253" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00066-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="254" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
