This change was a consequence of the WHO recommending an extension to the exclusive breastfeeding phase from 4 to 6 months to 6&#x000a0;months (180&#x000a0;days) of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. By 6&#x000a0;months of age, the infant&#x02019;s renal function, digestive function and oral motor skills (i.e. chewing and swallowing) have developed enough to manage solid foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, by this age complementary feeding is needed to &#x02018;complement&#x02019; the nutrients and energy provided by breast milk to ensure appropriate growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although there has been considerable debate about this change in the age when complementary feeding should be initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], there has been surprisingly little attention paid to whether advice on <italic>how</italic> to introduce complementary foods should also be changed given the substantial development in gross, fine and oral motor skills that occurs between 4 and 6&#x000a0;months of age.</p><p>Traditionally, complementary feeding has been based on graduated exposure to solid foods with different textures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This means that infants are given pur&#x000e9;ed foods before progressing to mashed and chopped foods, with &#x02018;finger&#x02019; foods not contributing a large part of the diet until later in the complementary feeding period (typically around 8&#x02013;9 months of age). As outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, this advice has changed little in response to the change in the recommended age for introducing complementary foods, despite marked changes in physical development between 4 and 6&#x000a0;months of age. Pur&#x000e9;ed foods may have been necessary at 4&#x000a0;months because infants have a limited ability to chew at this age and most are not able to sit unsupported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, by 6&#x02013;7&#x000a0;months of age most infants are able to chew, sit unsupported and bring foods to their mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting that a gradual transition from pur&#x000e9;es to finger foods may now not be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. If this is indeed the case, then both the types of foods offered, and the role of parents in infant feeding, may be altered and this may have important implications for infant health outcomes including obesity, nutritional status and choking risk.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Appropriate textures for complementary feeding according to current recommendations in New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], United States of America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Approximate age</th><th>Appropriate texture</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td char="&#x02013;" align="char">0 &#x02013; 6&#x000a0;months</td><td>Liquid</td></tr><tr><td char="&#x02013;" align="char">6 &#x02013; 7&#x000a0;months</td><td>Pur&#x000e9;ed</td></tr><tr><td char="&#x02013;" align="char">7 &#x02013; 8&#x000a0;months</td><td>Mashed and &#x0201c;Finger&#x0201d;<sup>a</sup> foods </td></tr><tr><td char="&#x02013;" align="char">8 &#x02013; 12&#x000a0;months</td><td>Chopped</td></tr><tr><td char="&#x02013;" align="char">12 &#x02013; 24&#x000a0;months</td><td>&#x0201c;Family&#x0201d;<sup>b</sup> foods</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

While most countries recommend that finger foods are included in the complementary feeding period, even from as early as 6&#x000a0;months of age in the United Kingdom (UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], they generally only represent a small component of the complementary feeding diet, particularly in the first few months. In contrast, parents following BLW choose a range of foods to offer their infant and the infant decides which of the foods to eat, how much and at what pace they will eat them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The key features of BLW are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Milk feeding &#x02013; the infant will ideally be exclusively breastfed until 6&#x000a0;months of age, although it is acknowledged that some infants will be formula fed. When complementary feeding starts (once the infant is ready, at around 6&#x000a0;months of age) the infant continues to receive milk feeds (breast milk or infant formula) on demand.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Baby-led &#x02013; the infant self-feeds from the beginning of the complementary feeding period. Generally speaking pur&#x000e9;ed foods are not eaten because they need to be spoon-fed and therefore fed by someone other than the infant. Some families may offer the child utensils so that they can feed themselves pur&#x000e9;es or foods with a thin consistency (e.g., yoghurt and custard) but this is unlikely in the first few months for developmental reasons.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Family foods &#x02013; the infant is offered the same foods as the family but as finger food that is large enough for them to pick up. These pieces can get smaller with increasing developmental age.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mealtimes &#x02013; the family eats together at mealtimes.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Although BLW has received considerable attention in both the scientific literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and the lay media, the New Zealand Ministry of Health does not currently recommend BLW as an alternative to current complementary feeding advice because of the paucity of research on the topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although agencies such as the United Kingdom Department of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Health Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggest that finger foods can be offered as <italic>part</italic> of the diet from the beginning of complementary feeding at 6&#x000a0;months of age, they do not recommend a baby-led approach in which the entire diet is self-fed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Potential advantages of Baby-Led Weaning</title><p>A number of potential advantages of BLW have been proposed, including: a lower risk of obesity, as a result of better energy self-regulation; better diet quality; favourable effects on parental feeding practices; and more highly developed motor skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Lower risk of obesity</title><p>One potential advantage proposed by advocates of Baby-Led Weaning is that it may encourage improved energy self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], defined as &#x0201c;the capacity to adjust the quantity eaten according to the physiological needs of the consumer&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In turn, this is expected to lower the risk of obesity. Advocates propose that the milk-only diet that infants consume from birth allows them to be in control of when and how much they consume, particularly if they are breastfed on demand. However, when complementary foods are introduced using the traditional spoon feeding approach, the parent has much more control and is likely to encourage the child to eat until they have consumed an amount of food that the parent, rather than the child, considers is &#x0201c;enough&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By contrast, BLW encourages the infant to be in control of the amount eaten and it is suggested that this may support the responsiveness to internal hunger and satiety cues, leading to better energy self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that better energy self-regulation is associated with a lower risk of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>To date, only two studies have investigated rates of obesity in infants following BLW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Brown and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found no association between the complementary feeding method (BLW or spoon feeding) and parentally reported infant weight at 6&#x000a0;months in a large (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;652) cross-sectional study. However, when they measured a subset (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;298 participants at 18&#x02013;24 months of age who consented to follow-up contact and met inclusion criteria) they found that toddlers who had followed BLW as infants had significantly lower mean body weight (by 1.07&#x000a0;kg), than those who had followed a traditional &#x02018;parent-led&#x02019; spoon feeding approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, the infants who had followed BLW were reported by their parent to be significantly more satiety-responsive (able to regulate intake of food in relation to satiety) and significantly less food-responsive (eating in response to food stimuli regardless of hunger), than their traditionally fed peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, Townsend and Pitchford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported significantly lower Body Mass Index (BMI) and incidence of obesity in children at 20&#x02013;78 months who had followed BLW compared to those who had been spoon-fed. However, different methods were used to recruit the BLW and spoon-fed participants and standardized procedures for measuring body weight were only used in the spoon-fed group, making these results difficult to interpret.</p><p>These initial studies are intriguing and suggest that a baby-led method of complementary feeding may help to address the growing obesity problem worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it is not possible to conclude from these cross-sectional studies that BLW itself was responsible for differences in body weight, or energy self-regulation, particularly because parents who follow BLW have been shown to differ from parents following traditional methods of complementary feeding in demographic, psychological and parenting characteristics known to also be associated with body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Only a randomised controlled trial can confirm whether a beneficial relationship exists between infant self-feeding and body weight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Better diet quality</title><p>While it is often assumed that infants following BLW will consume diets of better quality, there are very limited dietary data from infants following BLW. Rowan and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] used three day diet records to assess foods eaten by parents whose infants were following BLW, in order to determine whether BLW influenced the parents&#x02019; food intake. Although the authors reported that a wide range of foods were <italic>offered</italic> to the infants, the infants&#x02019; actual nutrient <italic>intake</italic> was not determined. Furthermore, the study was a pilot study so was very small (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10 participants).</p><p>It is possible that BLW may promote acceptance of a wider range of foods as a result of early exposure to a range of different tastes and textures from a variety of foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but this has not yet been formally investigated. One cross-sectional study found that infants who were mostly being fed using the BLW method were more likely to be consuming family foods (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018), were more likely to begin this at the start of complementary feeding (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c;0.001) and were less likely to be given commercial infant foods (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002), compared with infants whose parents were following a more traditional &#x02018;parent-led&#x02019; spoon feeding approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Family foods would be expected to be more varied in taste and texture than the foods offered at the start of complementary feeding (predominantly pur&#x000e9;ed fruit, vegetables or cereal). However, a positive effect of family meals on the infant&#x02019;s diet relies on the family having healthy foods that are also suitable for the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Favourable effects on parental feeding practices</title><p>One area of recent interest concerns the role that parental feeding practices may play in promoting excessive weight gain in very young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Exerting greater control over a young child&#x02019;s food intake is thought to negatively impact on the child&#x02019;s ability to regulate their energy intake. Certainly parents who follow BLW have reported lower levels of restriction, pressure to eat and monitoring of the child&#x02019;s food intake and are less concerned about the child&#x02019;s body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether parents with these characteristics are more likely to choose, or to persist with BLW, or whether BLW encourages the development of these characteristics. Longitudinal or intervention studies are needed to help determine the direction of this association.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>More highly developed motor skills</title><p>Carruth and Skinner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have suggested that some feeding behaviours may be achieved later by children whose parents limit their opportunities to explore during feeding time, perhaps because of concerns about mess and spills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They suggest that some parents may need more encouragement to allow their child to engage in activities relating to feeding in order to help their child develop feeding skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The ability of children to learn to self-feed depends, therefore, not so much on the innate development of fine, gross and oral motor skills, but on the opportunity to develop these skills through applying them repeatedly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We hypothesize that a baby-led approach to complementary feeding would provide an infant with greater opportunities (both in frequency and duration) to develop their gross and fine motor skills.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Potential disadvantages of Baby-Led Weaning</title><p>Several concerns have also been raised about this alternative approach to complementary feeding; namely that BLW could increase the risk of iron deficiency, choking and growth faltering in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Iron deficiency</title><p>It is important that complementary foods high in iron are introduced at 6&#x000a0;months of age in order to maintain adequate iron status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Iron deficiency, a common nutritional deficiency globally, can lead to iron deficiency anaemia which is associated with delays in cognitive function that may not be reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, the most common &#x02018;first foods&#x02019; introduced to infants, including fruits and vegetables, are naturally low in iron. Iron-fortified infant cereals can be an important source of iron for this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], however they are not likely to be consumed by infants following BLW because infants of this age will find it difficult to feed themselves this relatively liquid food. Iron rich foods such as red meat may be served in forms that can be easily picked up by a 6&#x000a0;month old so may be useful foods to feed from the start of complementary feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], as long as they are not avoided due to parental concerns about choking. To date, no studies have examined either the iron intake or iron status of children following a baby-led approach to complementary feeding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Choking</title><p>Choking can easily occur in infants learning to eat as they are experimenting with moving foods around the mouth, biting and chewing and they also have small air passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The potential for choking to occur when following BLW is of considerable concern amongst health professionals and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are currently very few data on the rates of choking during the complementary feeding period, and no data on choking in infants following BLW. However, Cameron et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found 30&#x000a0;% of a group of women using BLW with their infants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) reported an episode of choking. This was caused by consumption of raw apple in all cases where the mother was able to recall the food responsible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Growth faltering</title><p>In the first year of life, the majority of infants receive most of their energy from breast milk (or infant formula) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, complementary foods are an important source of energy and many nutrients in the second 6&#x000a0;months of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Some health professionals have expressed concern that infants following BLW may be at increased risk of growth faltering, based on the assumption that not all infants will have the motor skills, or motivation, to feed themselves the amount of food they require, and that many of the first foods offered will be low in energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, only two cross-sectional studies appear to have examined growth in infants following BLW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Townsend and Pitchford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found an association between weaning style and infants classified as underweight. Infants whose parents reported having followed BLW had a higher prevalence of underweight (4.8&#x000a0;%) than infants whose parents reported following a spoon-fed approach to complementary feeding (0&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similarly, Brown et al.

However, both studies were limited by their cross-sectional design, the small numbers of participants classified as underweight (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3-11), parents retrospectively self-reporting the type of complementary feeding method they had used and recruitment of BLW and control groups from different sources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Other potential disadvantages</title><p>Because of the limited research conducted on BLW, it is not known whether BLW poses any risks for nutrients other than iron (which is discussed above). In particular, zinc is found in limited amounts in foods that may be used as first foods in BLW, such as fruit and vegetables, because they are easy to self-feed. Poorer zinc status could have implications for growth, motor and cognitive development, and immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Concerns have also been expressed that family foods may not always be suitable for infants if the family is consuming meals high in sugar or salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], both of which are inappropriate for infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial of a baby-led approach to complementary feeding so it will generate much new evidence in the area of infant feeding, particularly during the second 6&#x000a0;months of life. While some governments are already modifying their advice on the most appropriate texture for first foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], countries such as New Zealand are waiting for evidence from well-designed randomised controlled trials.</p><p>The primary aim of this intervention study is to determine whether a baby-led approach to complementary feeding can improve body weight status at 12&#x000a0;months of age. With childhood obesity rates growing worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], the study will provide insight into the development and establishment of eating patterns from the start of the complementary feeding period and their effect on body weight during infancy and early childhood. We hypothesize that self-feeding throughout the complementary feeding period may help infants maintain and develop the energy self-regulation skills they have developed while exclusively milk-feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and that this behaviour will continue into later childhood.</p><p>The BLISS study will also investigate the potential negative effects of BLW and determine whether this modified approach, BLISS, is able to prevent iron deficiency and minimize any risk of choking or growth faltering. This information is extremely important both to enable health professionals to advise parents who would like to follow a baby-led approach to complementary feeding and to advise policy-makers on whether this approach should replace current advice on complementary feeding for parents in general.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BLISS</term><def><p>Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BLW</term><def><p>Baby-Led Weaning</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IBCLC</term><def><p>International Board Certified Lactation Consultant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IZiNCG</term><def><p>International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMC</term><def><p>lead maternity carer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sTfR</term><def><p>soluble transferrin receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The study is partially funded by Meat &#x00026; Livestock Australia.
