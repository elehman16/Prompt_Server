lower limb balance ability elicited by plyometric training and vibration exercise, of
volleyball players with and without ankle injuries, which frequently occur among Korean
professional volleyball players. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight volleyball players
were divided into the following groups: plyometric with ankle injury (PAI) group;
plyometric with non-ankle injury (PAN) group; vibrator with ankle injury (VAI) group; and
vibrator with non-ankle injury (VAN) group. After exercise and whole body vibration
stimulation, their vertical jumping abilities, side step, and static equilibrium ability
were measured. [Results] The vibration exercise group which had experienced ankle injuries
showed significant improvements in the sidestep test after the intervention compared to
before the intervention. In vertical jumping as well, significant improvements were
observed in the VAI group and the VAN group following vibration exercise. In the balance
ability test, significant improvesments in the PAN group and the PAI group were observed
after the intervention. According to the results of the right side, there was significant
change in the left/back side test and the right/back side test before and after the
intervention; and in the test of one-leg standing with eyes closed, there were significant
group, timing, and interaction effects. [Conclusions] The training method which
effectively improved the jumping ability of volleyball players was plyometric training,
and for balance ability improvement, whole body vibration exercise was effective.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Volleyball player</kwd><kwd>Jumping ability</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>For jumping, the lower limbs&#x02019; explosive and organic motions are required to act on the
ground against a player&#x02019;s weight and gravity with strong force, by effectively delivering
muscle strength generated from the hip and knee joints to the ankles and feet. The physical
stress occurring at this time acts on the ankle joints directly; therefore, they are the
body parts experiencing the greatest load<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies of volleyball players have reported chronic ankle
injuries. As a volleyball game progresses, motions placing burden on the ankle joints, such
as jumping and landing, which are known to place excessive load on the ankle joints are
numerously repeated<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, as interest in systematic and scientific training methods has increased in many
sports, and diverse training methods have been developed and applied. In volleyball, high
jumping ability greatly affects a player&#x02019;s ability and, therefore, diverse methods for
exerting explosive power in the lower limbs have been introduced. Among them, plyometric
training enables the exertion of explosive power using the extension reflex by the action of
actin-myosin within the muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, it is widely applied as a training method to develop greater power, through the
improvement of muscle strength and speed, for to producing superior exercise performance in
ordinary people, as well as in athletes whose sports rely heavily on jumping, such as
basketball, and track and field, as well as volleyball<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The application of whole body vibration exercise, another training method, is being used
for elite athletes of diverse sports since research results have shown that whole body
vibration exercises are safe, convenient, and equally influence the circulation and
endocrine systems, in addition to the musculoskeletal system. Delecluse et al. reported that
whole body vibration training increased knee extension strength and women&#x02019;s speed. Torvinen
et al. reported the effects of vibration training on body composition and the muscles of
women who did not do exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Choi et al. through the improvement of after
conducting whole body vibration training with patients with hemiplegia resulting from
stroke. Bosco et al. reported that after 10 minutes of vibration training of constant
intensity, there was an improvement in the average power of the thighs of female volleyball
players who were national team members<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study of elderly subjects reported significant increases in balance ability, and another
study of concluded that vibration exercise positively affected their lower limb power and
jumping ability male college students in their twenties<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is a considerable
body of previous research demonstrating that whole body vibration exercise positively
affects the body<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, this study investigated differences in jumping ability and lower limb balance
ability elicited by plyometric training and vibration exercise in male professional
volleyball players with and without ankle injuries, which occur frequently in Korean
professional volleyball players.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 28 male athletes registered as professional volleyball
players in the Korean Volleyball Federation. None of them had any orthopedic diseases that
would have made it difficult or impossible to participate in training or regular league

digital meter system had been attached, with one leg contacting the wall. Then, the subjects
raised one arm and stretched it and the height to the end of the fingers was marked. At a
spot 20&#x02005;cm distant from the wall, the subject put both feet together and jumped as high as
possible using rebound. The vertical distance between the height of the fingers at rest and
their maximum jump height was measured in millimeters. The subjects performed this action
twice and the best result was used. For side step measurement, a central line was marked and
120&#x02005;cm lines were marked to the left and right sides. The subjects spread their legs from
the central line to the left and right sides and moved quickly as follows: central line to
the right line, back to the central line, to the left line, back to the central line. This
pattern was repeated for 20 seconds and the number of movements was recorded.</p><p>The Romberg test was conducted in order to measure static balance ability. The subjects
closed their eyes, put both arms on the waist, flexed the hip joint and the knee joint of
one leg to 90 degrees, and stood with the other limb stationary. Then, a stopwatch was used
to measure balance maintenance time twice and the average value was calculated. The Cybex
balance test was used as a postural control test. This equipment measures subjects&#x02019; postural
control ability by quantifying parameters of body sway from the center of the foot plate
based on changes in the ground reaction force with gradual changes in the support plate&#x02019;s
stability. When the subjects stood on the support plate on one leg with both eyes open,
measurements were taken after inputting the location of the foot according to the direction
of the program, and postural control ability was evaluated according to the degree of
stability in the forward, backward, internal, external, and all directions, with stability
of the support plate adjusted from one to eight. The measurement time was 20 seconds. The
test results were converted to indexes with lower values indicating higher dynamic postural
control ability.</p><p>The plyometric exercise was composed of boxes and huddles based on prior research<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise time of one session was a total of 50 minutes,
including warm-up and cool-down exercises. The subjects conducted this exercise three times
per week for eight weeks. The program of plyometric exercise was performed for 10&#x02005;min
warm-up, and double-leg hop/dept jump, single-leg hop (both)/depth jump, side-hop and two
step double-leg hop was also performed for 30&#x02005;min and then cool-down was 10&#x02005;min.</p><p>The whole body vibration exercise was conducted for eight weeks using the Natural Wave,
sound wave vibration training system. The exercise frequency was three times per week, 50
minutes per session. The warm up exercise, main exercise, and cool down exercise were
conducted for 10 min, 30 min, and 10 min, respectively. The first and second weeks were used
for adaptation and three sets of exercises were performed. From the third to the sixth weeks
four sets of exercise were conducted with increased frequency of vibration. The exercise
intensity was adjusted with the frequency of vibration, the number of sets, and motion
composition. The vibration frequency was 8&#x02005;Hz from the first week to the second week and
26&#x02005;Hz from the third week to the sixth week<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The program of vibration exercise was performed for 10&#x02005;min warm-up
in the standing position followed by squat/plank, calf raise, and lunge for 30&#x02005;min, and
cool-down 10&#x02005;min.</p><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS ver. 15.0. In order to examine differences in data between
the pre-test and post-test after the whole body vibration exercise, 2-way repeated analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, and for simple effect verification, the paired t-test was
carried out. Statistical significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The measurements of vertical jumping ability and side-step ability in consideration of

ability is a very important factor in determining victory or defeat. Height is considerably
affected by innate factors, but jumping ability can be improved by training. To this end,
improving the muscle strength of the lower limbs and anaerobic exercise ability may increase
jumping ability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the
thigh muscle group plays a key role in performing jumping motions and its ability can be
evaluated through a test such as the vertical jump<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Plyometric training enables an individual to exert great force instanteously using the
extension reflex through the actin-myosin action in the muscles. Therefore, it is in the
spotlight as a training method in many sports, including volleyball, where jumping ability
is emphasized. However, diverse physical strength, including muscle strength of a certain
level or higher, is required as a precondition for plyometric training. Plyometric training
exerts a considerable physical burden on the muscle joints, and, although it carries the
risk of injury, it has nevertheless been proposed as an effective training method for the
enhancement of jumping ability<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, according to the vertical jump results, in the plyometric group, the group
with ankle injury and the group without it demonstrated improvements in jump height of 3.63%
and 3.72%, respectively, compared to their pre-test results. There was a statistically
significant improvement after training compared to the pre-test values, consistent with
previous research<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> which reported improvements in jumping ability after plyometric
training. On the other hand, the vibration exercise group exhibited improvements in jump
height compared to the pre-test but they were not statistically significant; therefore
plyometric training was more effective than vibration exercises at improving the jumping
ability of the volleyball players.</p><p>In the balance ability test, conducted in order to examine balance ability, there were no
differences between the ankle injury groups of the training methods used, but in the Romberg
test (standing on one leg with the eyes closed) on the right and left sides, the ankle
injury group which performed vibration exercise showed the greatest improvements;
therefore,, the vibration exercise may be recommended as a training for improving volleyball
players&#x02019; balance ability. One hundred adults with ankle injuries performed whole body
vibration exercises and there was an effect on their ankle muscle strength. According to by
Kiers et al. a positive change in ankle muscle strength improves balance ability, suggesting
whole body vibration exercises are effective for the improvement of balance<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Whole body vibration exercise delivers stimulus to the tissues, including the muscles
around the ankle joints, which play an important role in balance ability, thereby increasing
muscle strength, enhancing proprioceptive sense, and mobility; and vibration exercise has
consistently been reported to be very effective at improving balance ability<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, such effects are different according to the direction of
vibration stimulation and the number of vibrations<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, and in order to clarify the effect of one-leg standing with the
eyes closed, research which measures other factors known to affect equilibrium should be
studied together. In addition, in the balance ability test (where another measurement method
was conducted to test balance ability) no significant differences were found, suggesting the
measurement of the effects of vibration exercise using diverse variables of balance ability
should be attempted.</p><p>To summarize the results of this study, plyometric training was effective at improving the
jumping ability of volleyball players, and whole body vibration exercise was effective for
the improvement of their balance ability. In order to clarify the results of this study,
additional research that with larger numbers of subjects and a wider range of measurement
variables is considered necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Haut</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of impact angle on knee tolerance to rigid
