However, its effect on liver tumors when administered via the hepatic artery has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of hepatic artery administration of Rg3 combined with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the treatment of liver tumors. A total of 48 rabbits with VX2 liver tumors were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1, Rg3; Group 2, TAE; Group 3, Rg3 and TAE; and Group 4, control. Abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 2 weeks before and after intervention to assess tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of the angiogenesis biomarkers CD31 and VEGF, and the cell apoptosis marker caspase-3. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting were employed to detect the expression of the caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 apoptosis-related genes and proteins. In addition, HepG2 cells were treated with Rg3 at different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l) <italic>in vitro</italic>. An MTT assay and western blot analysis were used to analyze the cell proliferation and VEGF expression. Compared with the other experimental groups, the Rg3 and TAE group expressed significantly lower levels of CD31 and VEGF (P&#x0003c;0.05), significantly increased levels of the pro-apoptotic genes caspase-3 and Bax (P&#x0003c;0.05), and significantly reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 at the mRNA and protein levels (P&#x0003c;0.05). <italic>In vitro</italic>, Rg3 inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation and downregulated VEGF expression significantly. These results indicated that ginsenoside Rg3 combined with TAE may effectively inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and inducing cancer cell apoptosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ginsenoside Rg3</kwd><kwd>VX2 liver tumor</kwd><kwd>transcatheter arterial embolization</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for the treatment of liver cancers is a minimally invasive procedure which may improve survival and quality of life (QOL) (<xref rid="b1-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, the currently used embolic agents do not congest microvessels sufficiently and therefore TAE is a palliative treatment rather than a curative therapy (<xref rid="b3-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, as a result of cancer cell ischemia and hypoxia, tumor angiogenesis may be induced by TAE and may contribute to tumor recurrence and metastasis (<xref rid="b4-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, liver tumors almost always require repeated TAE.</p><p>Ginseng, a highly valued herb from East Asia has been used by the Chinese for thousands of years. There is extensive evidence on the beneficial effects of ginseng (<xref rid="b6-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The major biologically active components of ginseng are various types of ginsenosides (<xref rid="b7-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Of these, ginsenoside Rg3 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (<xref rid="b8-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and angiogenesis (<xref rid="b9-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The route by which a drug is delivered may have a significant effect on its therapeutic effect. To date, the therapeutic effect of Rg3 on liver tumors when administered via the hepatic artery has not been investigated. The liver VX2 carcinoma derived from a Shope virus-induced papilloma is an accepted and suitable model for interventional therapy due to its continuous tumor growth and rich arterial supply (<xref rid="b10-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Using rabbit liver VX2 carcinoma models, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of hepatic artery administration of Rg3 combined with TAE for the treatment of liver tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sample and randomization</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). A total of 50 adult male New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2.3&#x02013;4.2 kg were acquired from the Experimental Animal Center of West China Medical Center, Sichuan University. The VX2 allografts were provided by The Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. The tumors were implanted in lateral muscles of the hind limbs of donor rabbits. The tumor tissue required for implantation in liver was obtained 2 weeks later. After ketamine hydrochloride (40 mg/kg; ShuangHe Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and xylazine (5 mg/kg; Yaji Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China) anesthesia was intramuscularly injected, laparotomy was performed. A section of tumor tissue (2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;2 mm) was implanted into the left lobe of the recipient liver. The abdominal wall was closed layer by layer. CT scans of abdomen were performed on all animals 2 weeks after tumor tissue implantation. Animals bearing a tumor &#x0003e;10 mm in diameter were included in the experiment. Rg3 was extracted from a sample of ginseng from Northeast China provided by Yatai Pharmaceutical Co. (Changchun, China) and the purity quotient was &#x02265;99.5%.</p><p>A total of 48 rabbits were randomly assigned into 4 groups with the aid of a computer-generated table of random numbers; each group was restricted to 12 rabbits. In Group 1, Rg3 was injected into the tumor via the hepatic artery, in Group 2, lipiodol was injected, in Group 3, a cocktail of Rg3 mixed with lipiodol was injected, and in Group 4 saline was injected.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention technique and tissue preparation</title><p>The rabbits were anesthetized with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection. Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained via surgical cutdown, where a 2.7/2.9 Fr microcatheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was introduced. Arteriography of the common hepatic artery was performed to demonstrate the hepatic arterial anatomy and the location, size and vascularity of the tumor. The catheter was selectively advanced into the tumor feeding artery in which, depending on the subject&#x02019;s group, Rg3 (6.0 mg/kg), lipiodol (0.1 ml/kg) or a mixture of both was injected through the catheter until a reduction of blood flow to the tumor was observed. In the case of Group 4, 1 ml saline was injected through the catheter in each subject. The catheter was then removed and the common femoral artery was ligated with absorbable sutures.</p><p>Two weeks later, all rabbits were sacrificed with high-dose ketamine. The tumor tissue was carefully dissected and divided into two sections. One of the sections was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 mol/l phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.0 and 4&#x000b0;C for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin, and the other was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The primary antibodies for CD31 (Abcam, Boston, MA, USA), VEGF (Abcam) and caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were diluted to 1:500. The primary antibody was omitted as a negative control for the immunostaining. An image of each section was captured using a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at &#x000d7;400 magnification and the integrated optical density (IOD) of the positively stained tissue in each image was determined using Image Pro Plus software, version 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modifed Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) routinely supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus ampicillin and streptomycin, and incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>The MTT assay was performed to examine cell proliferation.

A control group and four Rg3 groups were created, the final concentrations of Rg3 were 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/l. Each group had six replicates. MTT reagent (20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h. After culturing the cells for 4 h, the medium was removed and 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l DMSO was added to each well and incubated for 15 min.

At 2 weeks, the mean tumor volume and growth rate were significantly lower in Groups 2 (TAE) and 3 (Rg3 and TAE) than in the control (P&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the mean tumor growth rate in the rabbits treated with Rg3 and TAE was significantly lower than that in the TAE group (P&#x0003c;0.05).

Thus far, over 40 types of ginsenosides have been isolated and have been demonstrated to affect the central nervous system and immune system, thereby producing anti-stress, anti-ageing, anti-fatigue, anti-hyperlipemic and anti-angiogenic effects (<xref rid="b9-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Of all ginsenosides isolated from ginseng, ginsenoside Rg3 has gained much attention for its antitumor properties (<xref rid="b13-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Rg3 may inhibit cancer cell proliferation, inhibit metastasis, promote cancer cell apoptosis and enhance immunity (<xref rid="b14-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Kim <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that chemotherapeutics combined with Rg3 may have enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced side-effects (<xref rid="b18-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). At present, the oral administration of Rg3 is employed by physicians worldwide. However, the therapeutic effect of Rg3 when administered selectively via an artery has not been investigated.</p><p>Numerous studies in recent years have revealed that angiogenesis is essential for the growth of cancer in solid tumors (<xref rid="b4-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor progression; it is responsible for accelerated cancer cell replication and may also promote tumor metastasis (<xref rid="b4-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For these reasons, the inhibition of angiogenesis in solid tumors is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Arterial embolization is an effective method for the treatment of liver tumors, but its long-term efficacy remains limited (<xref rid="b3-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It has been suggested that ischemia and hypoxia induced by TAE stimulates tumor angiogenic activities (<xref rid="b5-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which may partially explain the poor long-term efficacy and the frequent requirement for TAE to be repeated (<xref rid="b20-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, TAE therapy was combined with selective arterial administration of Rg3 for the treatment of VX2 liver tumors in rabbits. Compared with either Rg3 or TAE monotherapy, the combination of the two modalities may achieve a greater therapeutic outcome. While TAE congests the microvessels feeding the tumor, Rg3 may inhibit angiogenic activities caused by tumor ischemia and hypoxia. In addition, the hepatic arterial administration of Rg3 combined with TAE increases the local concentration of Rg3, which may also facilitate therapeutic efficacy. The results of the present study were in agreement with this hypothesis and demonstrated that the hepatic arterial administration of Rg3 combined with TAE has a better therapeutic effect than either therapy alone.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis demonstrated that VEGF and CD31 expression in Groups 2 (TAE) and 3 (Rg3 and TAE) was significantly lower than in the control group. Group 3 (Rg3 and TAE) displayed a lower VEGF and CD31 expression than Group 2 (TAE). These results indicate that Rg3 may inhibit angiogenesis following TAE. Previous studies have indicated that TAE enhances tumor hypoxia, which upregulates the expression of VEGF (<xref rid="b1-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Notably, in the present study, the VEGF expression was significantly downregulated in the group treated with TAE compared with the control group. This may be due to the TAE therapy causing the necrosis and shrinkage of tumors. The results of histological and morphological examination were also confirmed by the necrosis or apoptosis of tumor cells observed in the group treated with TAE. A previous study has shown that the rate of cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis is closely correlated with the progression of cancer (<xref rid="b21-etm-05-03-0761" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), therefore, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes were monitored in order to evaluate the antitumor and anti-angiogenic activity of Rg3 and TAE. The results of the present study showed that TAE alone and hepatic arterial administration of Rg3 in combination with TAE may downregulate the Bcl-2 expression and upregulate the caspase-3 and Bax expression significantly. Compared with TAE monotherapy, there was a significantly lower Bcl-2 expression and higher caspase-3 and Bax expression in Group 3 (Rg3 and TAE). These results suggest that selective hepatic arterial administration of Rg3 in combination with TAE may significantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote tumor cell apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism.</p><p>This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of hepatic arterial administration of Rg3 combined with TAE for the treatment of VX2 liver cancer in rabbits. The results demonstrated that Rg3 combined with TAE may induce VX2 liver tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis, and showed that it is an effective and safe method for the treatment of VX2 liver tumors in rabbits. However, the application of Rg3 combined with TAE in the clinic requires further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30770984,81171444).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-etm-05-03-0761"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acuna&#x0015f;</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rozanes</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatocellular carcinoma: treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization</article-title><source>Eur J Radiol</source><volume>32</volume><fpage>86</fpage><lpage>89</lpage><year>1999</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10580325</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-etm-05-03-0761"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lo</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Ngan</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tso</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Randomized controlled trial of transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma</article-title><source>Hepatology</source><volume>35</volume><fpage>1164</fpage><lpage>1171</lpage><year>2002</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11981766</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-etm-05-03-0761"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sergio</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cristofori</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardin</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): the role of angiogenesis and invasiveness</article-title><source>Am J Gastroenterol</source><volume>103</volume><fpage>914</fpage><lpage>921</lpage><year>2008</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18177453</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-etm-05-03-0761"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Moon</surname><given-names>HE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in human hepatocellular carcinoma</article-title><source>J Mol Med (Berl)</source><volume>80</volume><fpage>703</fpage><lpage>714</lpage><year>2008</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12436347</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-etm-05-03-0761"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>von Marschall</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000f6;cker</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Dual mechanism of vascular endothelial growth factor upregulation by hypoxia in human hepatocellular carcinoma</article-title><source>Gut</source><volume>48</volume><fpage>87</fpage><lpage>96</lpage><year>2001</year><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11115828</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-etm-05-03-0761"><label>6.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kaku</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawashima</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Isolation and characterization of ginsenoside-Rg2, 20R-prosapogenin, 20S-prosapogenin and delta 20-prosapogenin.
