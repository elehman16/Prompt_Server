Cervical total disc replacements (TDRs) have emerged as an alternative for some patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new TDR device compared with ACDF for treating single-level cervical disc degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulated Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study. A total of 245 patients were treated (164 TDR: 81 ACDF). The primary outcome measure was overall success based on improvement in Neck Disability Index (NDI), no subsequent surgical interventions, and no adverse events (AEs) classified as major complications.</p><p>Secondary outcome measures included SF-12, visual analog scale (VAS) assessing neck and arm pain, patient satisfaction, radiographic range of motion, and adjacent level degeneration. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The hypothesis was that the TDR success rate was non-inferior to ACDF at 24 months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>Overall success rates were 73.6% for TDR and 65.3% for ACDF, confirming non-inferiority (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0025). TDR demonstrated earlier improvements with significant differences in NDI scores at 6 weeks and 3 months, and VAS neck pain and SF-12 PCS scores at 6 weeks (p&#x0003c;0.05). Operative level range of motion in the TDR group was maintained throughout follow-up. Radiographic evidence of inferior adjacent segment degeneration was significantly greater with ACDF at 12 and 24 months (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been established as the primary surgical technique to decompress the spinal cord and nerve roots.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There are three main goals of ACDF: decompression of the neural element, maintenance of lordosis, and stabilization of the motion segment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Typically, bone graft or a cage in conjunction with a rigid anterior plate are implanted to maintain or restore disc space integrity, provide stability, and facilitate fusion. With ACDF good clinical outcomes are generally achieved in a high percentage of patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In particular, procedures which use allograft bone and an anterior plate produce overall positive patient outcomes, reduce post-operative bracing, and reduce complications associated with graft resorption, migration, and subsidence.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Long term reduction in symptoms associated with degenerative disc disease (DDD) has led to ACDF being generally accepted as the gold standard of treatment for indicated patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Despite benefits of ACDF, it is not without complications. ACDF with allograft bone and anterior plating has been associated with complications such as screw back out, plate fracture, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, and pseudoarthrosis.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Artificial cervical discs have been used since the 1990's.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Total disc replacement (TDR), as an alternative to ACDF in the treatment of symptomatic cervical DDD, is becoming increasingly common and potentially provides some advantages over ACDF. Not only does TDR provide the same anterior neural decompression and maintenance of disc space as ACDF<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, it can also preserve segmental mobility.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Recently several Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trials have demonstrated that TDR is at least as safe and effective as ACDF for of single-level symptomatic cervical DDD.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, these studies found that TDR preserves segmental mobility and these patients tended to have better clinical outcomes earlier after surgery and maintained good quality clinical outcomes at 2 years postoperatively. Additionally, longer term studies found that TDR provides excellent clinical outcomes 5 to 8 years post-operatively.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Good clinical outcomes for cervical TDRs have also been demonstrated in European studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>One potential advantages of TDR over fusion was the reduction of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). Reports on the clinical impact of ASD have been mixed, with some variation attributable to there being radiographic findings of ASD not associated with clinical symptoms. Nunley et al. reported a rate of ASD in TDR patients of 3.1% per year.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Although not a primary part of their study, comparison to ACDF found no significant difference in the occurrence rate. Other studies have found an increased rate of ASD in fusion patients based on either radiographic findings<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> or a trend toward a higher rate of re-operation at the adjacent segment to treat new symptoms.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The Mobi-C Artificial Cervical Disc (LDR Medical; Troyes, France) was introduced outside the United States in November 2004. A European non-comparative, prospective, multi-center study evaluated the safety and efficacy of this device in the treatment of cervical DDD in 335 patients. This study found statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes and pain scores compared to baseline at 24 months post-operatively.<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The current study reports the 2-year follow-up results of a prospective, randomized, concurrently controlled, multicenter clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of TDR with the Mobi-C Artificial Cervical Disc versus ACDF at a single level for treatment of symptomatic cervical DDD. The hypothesis was that clinical outcomes of patients treated with TDR would not be inferior to outcomes of patients with the control treatment at 24 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Study design</title><p>A non-inferiority study design with a 2:1 randomization (TDR: control) was prospectively planned for this FDA-regulated IDE study. A 5% advantage was hypothesized based on pilot study data. A projected 75% success rate for control and 80% success rate for TDR with respect to the primary endpoint was used along with the 2:1 randomization scheme. A total sample size of 222 randomized cases (148 TDR vs. 74 control) was determined to meet statistical power requirements to test for non-inferiority with the one-sided 95% lower confidence bound on the difference exceeding -10%. An additional 10% was added to the 222 to account for patients that may be lost to follow-up, bringing the total sample size to 245. The population discussed in this report, with the exception of peri-operative data and adverse events, is the Intent-To-Treat population (ITT), which consisted of all subjects who were randomized and received study surgery. The ITT population consisted of 164 TDR patients and 81 control patients. Peri-operative data is presented for the Safety Population, which included all patients in the ITT population as well as the 15 non- randomized training cases.</p><p>All principle investigators were trained on the surgical technique for the study device as part of this IDE; which did consist of a separate two-level arm ran concurrently and using the same investigational device.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Each site was allotted one training case with the investigational device; 15 sites performed training cases for a one level indication, all others performed training with a two level case. This resulted in 15 additional TDR patients (the non-randomized training cases) in the one level IDE.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the investigation was a composite measure assessed at 24 months. To be considered a success a patient had to be successful in each of the following three measures: 1) NDI success, a 30 point improvement in score if baseline NDI score was greater than or equal to 60, or a 50% of baseline score improvement in NDI score if baseline NDI scores were less than 60, 2) No device related subsequent surgical intervention at the index level (defined as removal, revision, supplemental fixation, or reoperation), and 3) No study defined major complications which were defined as radiographic failure, neurologic deterioration, and adverse events determined to be major complications by an independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). In the TDR group, radiographic failure deemed to be a major complication was defined as: Spontaneous fusion of the treatment level with radiographic evidence of bridging bone across the treated disc space and less than 2&#x000b0; of angular motion from flexion to extension. In the ACDF group, radiographic failure deemed to be a major complication was defined as: Pseudoarthrosis at the treated level demonstrated by greater than or equal to 2&#x000b0; of angular motion on flexion to extension, or radiolucent lines at greater than 50% of the graft vertebral interfaces, or absence of bridging bone across the graft vertebral interfaces. This composite measure of success was used to determine overall success rates for both groups.</p><p>Study surgeries were performed for the 245 patients in the ITT population and the 15 non- randomized training cases that received the investigational device between April 2006 and March 2008. The study was conducted by 25 principal investigators at 23 sites. All patients were randomized to groups by an Interactive Voice Randomization System (IVRS). The investigator or study coordinator called the IVRS after the pre-operative inclusion/exclusion checklist confirmed eligibility and informed consent form was signed. Patients were assigned to the TDR or control group by IVRS according to a stratified randomization schedule (by baseline Neck Disability Index (NDI) score) with institutional balancing. Due to the fact that the implant was evident to the surgeon, blinding the physician to treatment was not possible. Patients remained blinded to the treatment group assignment until after surgery had been performed to minimize the potential for disproportionate patient dropouts.</p><p>The primary study hypothesis tested TDR non-inferiority against ACDF using a 10% margin with respect to patient success at 24 months. Additional secondary endpoints were: neck and arm pain (VAS), neck disability (NDI), patient satisfaction, quality of life (SF-12), and radiographic outcomes (adjacent segment degeneration, range of motion (ROM), significant radiolucency, and displacement or migration). Further measurements of interest were analyzed and included operative time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, and time to return to work. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and post-operatively at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Patients completed the following questionnaires: NDI, VAS for neck and arm pain, SF-12 (Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form Health Survey), Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale (FOSS) for dysphagia, and patient satisfaction. Neurological examinations were conducted and classified according to a pre-determined algorithm. Three neurological tests were performed including motor, reflex, and sensory assessments. Diminished neurological status was defined as a decrease in two points when compared to baseline status in any of the treated level motor or reflex assessments or a decrease of one point when compared to baseline of the treated level sensory tests. Any new or worsening signs were reported as an adverse event (AE). A baseline for Nurick's classification of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) was established pre-operatively.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Patient selection criteria</title><p>The primary inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of DDD with radiculopathy or myeloradiculopathy from C3 to C7 at one level without prior cervical fusion. DDD was defined as discogenic neck and/or arm pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history and by radiographic study. Patients were to have been unresponsive to non-operative treatment for at least six weeks from symptom onset or had progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression despite continued nonoperative treatment (i.e. acute presentation).

This prosthesis is a three component, mobile-bearing device comprised of two titanium plasma-sprayed and hydroxyapatite (HA) coated cobalt chromium alloy endplates and an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) mobile insert.</p><p>The superior endplate incorporates a convex shape to match the natural cervical anatomy, and both the superior and inferior endplates feature low-profile, inclined teeth along the lateral edges to provide initial stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The shape of the device and inclined teeth were designed to facilitate a bone sparing surgical technique. The device is available in several footprints and a range of heights to satisfy individual anatomical requirements. The device allows five independent degrees of freedom, two translational and three rotational (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mobi-C Artificial Cervical Disc (LDR Medical; Troyes, France).

This position was maintained throughout surgery and head rotation was minimized. A standard Smith Robinson approach was used to access the anterior cervical spine. A discectomy was performed in which the disc and the osteophytes were removed and the involved neural structures were decompressed.</p></sec><sec id="S20007"><title>ACDF Procedure</title><p>For the control group, a standard ACDF technique was used. The disc space was filled with corticocancellous allograft bone and an anterior cervical plate was placed over the graft and secured with screws to the vertebrae according to the manufacturer's published surgical technique. Anterior cervical plate selection was limited to the SLIM-LOC&#x02122; Anterior Cervical Plate System (Depuy Spine; Raynham, MA) and the Sofamor Danek ATLANTIS&#x02122; or ATLANTIS&#x02122; VISION Anterior Cervical Plate Systems (Medtronic; Memphis, TN).</p></sec><sec id="S20008"><title>TDR Procedure</title><p>In the TDR group, following the discectomy, the disc space was distracted in parallel using a vertebral distractor. With normal disc height restored, distraction was maintained with a Caspar distractor. The cartilaginous endplates were removed to expose the underlying bone but no endplate shaping was performed. Using fluoroscopy and the trial instruments provided, the appropriate Mobi-C footprint and height were selected. The assembled prosthesis was then impacted into the prepared disc space using a self-retaining inserter. An adjustable stop allowed precise modification of the implant's anteroposterior (AP) position. Once final position was obtained, the distraction was released and slight compression was applied via the Caspar distractor to facilitate seating of the implant teeth into the vertebrae. AP and lateral fluoroscopy was used to confirm final implant position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>TDR device in proper placement.

Antibiotic coverage and rehabilitation were continued in accordance with the surgeon's standard procedures. In order to ensure consistent treatment between the TDR and ACDF groups and to avoid any potential handicapping of the ACDF group, patients were instructed not to use NSAIDS for one week prior to surgery and the treating physician was instructed not to prescribe NSAIDs prophylactically for 3 months following surgery. However, physicians were allowed to prescribe NSAIDs to treat diagnosed incidence of heterotopic ossification (HO).</p></sec><sec id="S20010"><title>Radiographic Assessments</title><p>The following X-ray views were obtained pre-operatively and at all follow-up visits: neutral AP, neutral lateral, flexion-extension, and left-right bending. For consistency, an independent provider of radiographic assessments performed the radiographic analysis for this study. All assessments were made according to a pre-determined radiographic analysis protocol. This protocol specified that measurements of disc angle, angular motion, translational motion, anterior disc height, and change in disc height were quantitatively determined using validated QMA software (Medical Metrics Inc., Houston TX).<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Specific vertebrae were outlined and the 4 corners of the vertebral centrum specified. Using the radiograph made with the spine in the neutral position, anatomic landmarks were selected. Using an algorithm based on gray-scale correlation, the software found the specific vertebrae in each of the images (flexion, extension, and neutral) and calculated the geometric coordinates of each anatomic landmark on the vertebra. This process was repeated for each vertebra and intervertebral motion was calculated based on the geometric coordinates.</p><p>All other assessments such as bony bridging, radiolucency, fusion status, device condition, device migration, device subsidence, device position, and adjacent level degeneration were made by qualified independent radiologists affiliated with Medical Metrics Inc. Subsidence was defined as greater than 3 mm cranial or caudal motion of the device (or device component) perpendicular to the vertebral endplates. Migration was defined as greater than 3 mm anterior or posterior motion of the device (or device component) parallel to the vertebral endplates. Significant radiolucency was defined as more than 50% coverage of radiolucent lines along device/endplate interface. Radiographic success was defined as the absence of fusion of the treated level in the TDR, requiring 2&#x000b0; or more of angular motion from flexion to extension or no radiographic evidence of bridging bone across the treated disc space. In the ACDF group radiographic successful fusion at the treated level was defined as evidence of bridging bone across the disc space, less than 2&#x000b0; angular motion from flexion to extension, and less than 50% radiolucent lines at graft vertebral endplate interfaces. Adjacent segment degeneration was assessed at baseline and at the 12 and 24-month visits. Levels both superior to and inferior to the treated level were scored on the Kellgren-Lawrence scale of disc degeneration<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Each disc was classified as having none (0), minimal (1), definite (2), moderate (3), or severe (4) degeneration and was given the corresponding numerical score. To assess adjacent level degeneration over the course of the study, change in disc degeneration score from the baseline score of both adjacent levels was calculated at 12 and 24 months and any negative change (increase in score) was classified as adjacent level degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S20011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis goal was to establish non-inferiority using the composite success measure. Non-inferiority was tested using an exact 95% one-tailed confidence bound for the study-control success rate; if a 10% offset could be ruled out, then superiority was to be tested. A closed testing procedure was used to allow for superiority to be tested in the event that non-inferiority was established for the primary effectiveness endpoint. VAS, NDI, and SF-12 results are described using summary statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, inter-quartile range, minimum, and maximum) and compared across treatment groups using two sample t-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0012"><title>Results</title><sec id="S20013"><title>Patient accountability and demographics</title><p>Demographics characteristics of the ITT population are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>.

These results are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. For this analysis, all patients that were failures due only to radiographic failure were treated as a study success. The composite success rates in this analysis were 76.3% for the TDR group and 72.0% for the ACDF group. This analysis led to an increase in ACDF success, resulting in smaller differences between TDR and ACDF overall success, however overall success still favors TDR (8.4% difference with radiographic failures and 4.3% difference between groups without radiographic failures). This result further confirms non-inferiority of TDR to ACDF even when radiographic only failures are excluded (p = 0.0094).</p><p>Additionally, in this analysis TDR patients achieved success sooner than patients in the ACDF group. Even excluding those patients who failed the study only due to defined radiographic failure, only 64.3% of ACDF patients were deemed an overall study success at 6 months and 63.8% at 12 months.

The primary endpoint assessed individual patient success as demonstrated by functional improvement (NDI), no need for subsequent surgical intervention (removal, revision, supplemental fixation, and reoperation), and the absence of study defined major complications. A non-inferiority result, measured by the primary composite endpoint, was not surprising as the fundamentals of these two surgical procedures are very similar. Both surgeries involve the same surgical approach, a thorough discectomy, nerve decompression, disc height restoration, and placement of a device in the disc space. With disc height restored and nerve impingement eliminated, the authors of this study anticipated similar improvements in both groups in terms of decreased neck and arm pain, increased muscle strength, and elimination of abnormal sensations (hyperesthesia or hypoesthesia) and/or abnormal reflexes. Indeed, patients in the both the TDR group and the ACDF group showed marked improvement after surgery reporting decreased neck and arm pain, low rates of neurologic deterioration, improvement in quality of life, high patient satisfaction, and low rates of study defined major complications.</p><p>However, TDR demonstrated some advantages over ACDF particularly when clinical outcomes are analyzed in the short term. Notably, TDR achieved a higher patient success rate by 6 months than ACDF achieved by 24 months for the primary composite endpoint. This higher success rate for TDR at 6 months compared to ACDF at 24 months was still present when radiographic complications were excluded as a reason for overall study failure. Clinical outcome measures also indicated that patients in the TDR group generally achieved positive results earlier than the patients in the ACDF group. There were statistically significant differences in favor of TDR observed for mean NDI improvement at 6 weeks and 3 months, mean neck pain VAS improvements at 6 weeks, and mean SF-12 PCS improvement at 6 months.</p><p>Furthermore, while both ACDF and TDR treatment achieve restoration or maintenance of the disc height and anterior neural decompression, another advantage of TDR over ACDF is thought to be preservation of motion at the treated segment. Range of motion results demonstrate that, as expected, the patients in the ACDF group showed restricted ROM at all post-operative study visits. The mean values at Month 24 were less than 1&#x000b0; for both left/right lateral and flexion/extension bending. However, the TDR group patients on average maintained or increased ROM post-operatively by the 6 week visit and this result is consistent through 24 month visit. This maintenance or increase in ROM occurred in both flexion/extension and left/right lateral bending. It has been postulated that the restriction of motion at the treated segment with an ACDF is one factor contributing to the development of adjacent level disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In this study fewer TDR patients had deterioration of the adjacent segments during the course of the study and this difference was statistically significant for the inferior adjacent segment. These results suggest that the preservation of motion by the TDR may play a role in reducing the rate of deterioration of the adjacent segments, in particular the inferior adjacent segment.</p><p>In order to ensure consistent treatment between TDR and ACDF patients, the protocol disallowed the use of NSAIDs from 1 week preoperatively and instructed physicians not to prescribe NSAIDs prophylactically postoperative in either group unless intended to treat diagnosed heterotopic ossification. The prophylactic use of NSAIDs may have benefitted TDR patients by reducing the likelihood of heterotopic ossification, but could have been detrimental to ACDF patients by delaying fusion. The use of NSAIDs prophylactically in the prevention of heterotopic ossification formation after hip arthroplasty is well documented.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> 97.0% of TDR patients achieved radiographic success; leaving only 3.0% defined as radiographic failures (the unwanted spontaneous fusion at the treatment site) at 24 months. This is compared to 10.7% of the ACDF patients that were defined as radiographic failures (the failure to fuse at the treated level) at 24 months. Although a 3.0% radiographic failure rate is relatively low, it is possible that had NSAIDS been used prophylactically for the TDR group the radiographic failure rate may have been even lower.</p><p>The results of this study are similar to those reported for FDA IDE trials evaluating other cervical TDR devices with 2-year follow-up comparing the results to ACDF using allograft and an anterior plate.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> These prospective, randomized trials have produced consistent results finding TDR to be non-inferior to ACDF with additional post hoc analyses finding TDR to be superior on some measures. In all studies, significant improvement was seen at early follow-up and maintained throughout 24-month follow-up in both treatment groups. Unfortunately, some of the definitions and assessments used in the studies varied, making data pooling and/or direct comparisons between studies potentially unreliable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prospective, randomized trial comparing TDR to fusion showed that the TDR is a viable alternative to ACDF, with some advantages in early recovery and potentially some advantage to reduce adjacent segment degeneration. These results are similar to previously published TDR trials in that overall success rates of TDR are shown to be non- inferior to overall success rates of ACDF, and patients in the TDR group tended to see earlier success in terms of both overall study success and clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The robustness of the non-inferiority of TDR was confirmed by analysis of overall success rates in both groups while ignoring radiographic complications, as radiographic complications may have limited clinical relevance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> TDR was also associated with reduced adjacent segment deterioration evident on radiographs compared to fusion, however the clinical implication of the reduced adjacent segment degeneration may require longer follow-up. This study demonstrated that TDR preserved physiologic motion, while providing clinical benefits consistent with ACDF. The authors believe that the current study provides evidence that TDR with Mobi-C Artificial Cervical Disc is as safe and clinically effective as ACDF at 2-years follow-up, and that TDR with this device has potential benefits over ACDF.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Financial Disclosures</title><p>Ralph Rashbaum has stock in LDR Spine.
