Today most patients may expect to live years following the diagnosis and may thus experience significant morbidity due to disease progression and treatment toxicity. In order to address some of these problems exercise has been suggested and previously studies have shown improvements of disease specific quality of life and a reduction in treatment-related toxicity. Cohort studies with long term follow up have suggested that physical activity is associated with improved survival in prostate cancer patients. Previously one randomised controlled trial has examined the efficacy of football in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy to usual care and reported positive effects on lean body mass and bone markers. Against this background, we wish to examine the effectiveness of community-based football for men diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using a randomised controlled parallel group, multicenter, superiority trial design, two hundred prostate cancer patients will be recruited and randomised (1:1) to either community-based football one hour twice weekly or to a control group. The intervention period will be six months. The primary outcome is quality of life assessed after 12&#x000a0;weeks based on the change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#x02013;Prostate questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are change from baseline to six months in quality of life, lean body mass, fat mass, whole body and regional bone markers, as well as physical activity and functional capacity at 12&#x000a0;weeks and six months. Safety outcome variables will be falls resulting in seeking medical assessment and fractures during the six-month period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Football is viewed as a case for non-professional, supervised community-based team sport for promoting long-term physical activity in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. This randomised trial will provide data on effectiveness and safety for men with prostate cancer when football training is delivered in local football clubs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02430792">NCT02430792</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>Soccer</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>TrygFonden</institution></funding-source><award-id>106471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Midtgaard</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in men worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In comparison to most other malignant diseases, PCa progresses slowly. Presently more than 90&#x000a0;% of all cases of PCa are detected early, with the 10 and 15-year relative survival rates at 98.8 and 94.3&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, treatment of PCa is often associated with side effects and as the patients are likely to survive many years following diagnosis and primary treatment, quality of life (QoL) is of growing interest. PCa patients managed with hormonal therapy face an elevated risk of becoming overweight and for developing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which regular physical activity may counteract. Despite this fewer than half of men living with PCa follow the official physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, unlike many other cancer patient groups, PCa patients do not change their health behaviour spontaneously after being diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cohort studies examining the relationship between physical activity and disease progression and survival in men with PCa have shown that vigorous activity is associated with better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Recent systematic reviews of exercise intervention trials in men with PCa indicate that exercise has a beneficial effect on muscular fitness, cardio-respiratory fitness, functional task performance, lean body mass (LBM), fatigue and QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore exercise has been shown to meet the requests male cancer patients have for active, rational activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The vast majority of existing trials, however, have examined the effects of hospital-based, short-term and cost-intensive exercise interventions with a short follow-up period and low degree of adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore the long-term effects and applicability of interventions promoting physical activity remain undocumented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Participation in sport is acknowledged as important for public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The most common sport for men in Denmark and many other countries is football [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Growing evidence suggests that recreational football, i.e. non-tournament-based small-sided games, can have significant health promoting effects in various populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It has also been shown that football may provide peer-to-peer psychosocial support and improve social capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], potentially increasing long-term adherence. Therefore, we recently examined the efficacy of recreational football in men with PCa undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The results show that the football training improved LBM, muscle strength and markers of bone strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and that men experience football as an opportunity to regain control and responsibility for their own health without being in the role of patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Usual care for men with PCa in Denmark is rehabilitation (often aerobic and/or strength training) offered by local authorities. However, substantially fewer men than women (30 vs. 70&#x000a0;%) participate in rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], indicating that rehabilitation efforts might should be gender-oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this study, the participants in the control group are informed of the official physical activity guidelines and advised to continue their daily living, as they normally would do, not guiding them to other interventions neither preventing them to do so.</p><p>Thus, we will examine if recreational football, delivered in local football clubs (i.e. community-based), may complement existing rehabilitation approaches by promoting adherence to exercise and improving QoL and physiological health measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective of the FC Prostate Community Trial (FCPC) trial is to determine whether community-based football is superior to usual care for improving cancer-specific QoL after 12&#x000a0;weeks of participation.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to determine whether community-based football is superior to usual care for improving PCa-specific QoL, lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral density and bone mineral content after six months and functional well-being and physical activity after 12&#x000a0;weeks and after six months. The safety of the intervention will also be evaluated based on falls resulting in seeking medical assessment and fractures after six months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The FCPC Trial is a randomised controlled parallel-group superiority trial with two parallel groups (community-based recreational football and usual care) that examines QoL after 12&#x000a0;weeks as the primary endpoint.

The football training sessions consist of a 20-min warm-up based on the FIFA11+ concept, though modified to suit older players [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Next, participants will spend 20&#x000a0;min practising dribbling, passing and shooting. The training sessions will then end with 20&#x000a0;min of 5&#x02013;7-a-side football. Two coaches recruited from the local football club will be in charge of all training sessions. The coaches are expected to have experience as either a player or coach but no other formal qualifications are required. The coaches will be required to have passed a first-aid course and to complete a 10-h course involving lectures on PCa treatment, patient experiences of PCa and a manual describing the content of the training, including the FIFA 11+ concept intended to prevent injuries. Participants will be told to avoid hard tackles and other actions that carry a risk of injury. In the event of injuries participants will remain in their allocated group and will be encouraged to participate in football practice again after recovery. Adherence to the intervention will be recorded by the coaches. Participants allocated to football training will be able to track their individual adherence and compare it to an average adherence rate of participants in the football group.

Data accuracy will be ensured, as participants will add questionnaire responses directly into the trial data system, while DXA outcomes extracted from DXA scanners will also be directly added into the trial data system. The trial data system adheres to the International Council for Harmonisation Guideline on Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and the Danish data protection legislation.

In particular, patients will be analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomly allocated according to the intention-to-treat principle. The appropriate method for addressing this effect will depend on the assumptions made about missing data (dropouts). Our main analysis is valid under the missing at random assumption but we will also present sensitivity analyses robust to non-ignorable patterns among patients with incomplete data.</p><p>Per protocol analyses will be performed to estimate the de jure effect of the treatment for compliant patients. The per protocol population will be defined as intervention group participants who attended the football intervention at least 12 times in the first 12&#x000a0;weeks and 24 times in the six-month intervention period.</p><p>Significance tests will be two-sided with a maximal type I error risk of 5&#x000a0;%. To address the problem of multiple comparisons for secondary analyses when several outcomes are tested or multiple constracts are extracted from the same statistical model, p-values will be adjusted using the step-down Bonferroni method of Holm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or appropriate modern alternatives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial profile</title><p>A CONSORT diagram will show trial participant flow. The number of screened patients, the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and trial subjects included in analyses will be reported together with reasons for exclusion of trial subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The continuous FACT-P outcome score will be calculated using the official scoring guideline. As described in the scoring guideline missing items will be prorated by multiplying the sum of the subscale with the number of the items in the subscale, then divided by the number of items answered. This will be done if more than 50&#x000a0;% of the items are answered in the subscales and 80&#x000a0;% are answered in the total questionnaire. The change score of the total FACT-P at 12&#x000a0;weeks will be calculated by subtracting the total 12-week score from the respective trial participant&#x02019;s baseline score. Analysis of covariance will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], group and ADT status will be set as factors, the response will be change in FACT-P and covariates will be age and baseline score. The results will be presented as least squares means (LSMEANS) differences between the two groups with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary outcomes including safety outcomes</title><p>Changes from baseline to six months for LBM, BMD, BMC and total body fat mass will be analysed in the same manner as the primary outcome.</p><p>QoL, functional well-being and physical activity (based on metabolic equivalent of task values derived from IPAQ) measured at baseline, 12&#x000a0;weeks and six months will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements. Changes from baseline to 12&#x000a0;weeks or six months will be treated as the response. The model will include fixed effects of factors: group, ADT, sampling time and their interactions, and the analysis will be adjusted for age and baseline value. The correlation between measurements on the same participant will be modelled using a random effect of participant.</p><p>Safety outcomes will be listed for each group and the number of falls that resulted in seeking medical assessment and fractures will be compared across groups using Fisher's exact test.</p><p>Subgroup analyses will be reported for the patients treated with ADT, which means that results will be given for both the overall treatment effect and for the subgroup obtained by stratifying according to ADT. To verify the credibility of our subgroup analyses, we will apply the criteria proposed by Sun and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], i.e. the subgroup variable is a baseline characteristic, a stratification factor, specified a priory and includes only a small number of analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outline of figures and tables</title><p>The first figure in the main publication will be a CONSORT diagram and the second figure will illustrate changes in the primary and secondary outcomes, with the exception of safety outcomes, at 12&#x000a0;weeks and six months, according to treatment group.</p><p>A third figure will display mean curves for the primary outcome for participants in different groups according to the pattern of missing data. In particular, mean curves will be shown separately for completers and participants with missing data at one or more assessment times. The figure will be used to guide the type of sensitivity analyses performed to adjust results for a potentially deviating pattern for patients with incomplete observations.</p><p>The main publication will also include three tables, one delineating the characteristics of trial subjects, one showing changes in primary and secondary outcomes at 12&#x000a0;weeks and at six months, and one presenting safety outcomes according to group and type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Ethics Committee for the Capital Region of Denmark (file number H-2-2014-099) and the Danish Data Protection Agency has approved the trial and the trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02430792.</p><p>Any changes to the protocol that influence the conduct of the study, affect the safety or benefits for participants, i.e. study objectives, study design, eligibility criteria and study procedures, will be documented in protocol amendments, which must be approved by the Ethics Committee for the Capital Region of Denmark and which will be reported when the study is disseminated.</p><p>Patients will receive written and oral information about the study.

The effects of exercise on side effects of treatment has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, previous exercise trials for men with PCa reporting positive effects had short follow ups and took place in clinical settings, thus not utilising community-based structures for sport and exercise.</p><p>The FCPC Trial will provide empirical data on whether local sport clubs are possible venues for clinical health promotion through a team-based exercise intervention. With experience from this study, we hope to gain further insight into the effects in a real-world setting and, through subgroup analyses, confirm findings from a previous study on PCa patients undergoing ADT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Since numerous men currently live many years with PCa, it has been recommended that the disease be considered similar to other chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. With this in mind, issues affecting QoL are of primary concern, not just for the patient but also for the treating urologist, who is often the primary treating physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We argue that football training is a supportive intervention where short-term QoL is of primary concern both for the patient and in the context where long-term adherence is a prerequisite for maintaining physiological benefits. In a recent review on supportive interventions designed to improve QoL for men with PCa, FACT-P was most frequently used to measure QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Other instruments, such as the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire&#x02013;Prostate Module (QLQ-PR25) or generic health-related QoL measurements like the Short-Form 36 Health Survey, are possible alternatives. Our aim, however, is to employ a prostate-specific, validated and frequently used QoL instrument to enhance comparability and validity, which is why we have chosen to use FACT-P for the primary outcome.</p><p>Large trials examining exercise interventions for improving QoL in cancer patients have been shown to be at risk of bias in a number of domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], e.g. selection bias and attrition bias due to unclear allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. It has been argued that one of the barriers preventing decisions-makers from supporting this kind of intervention is that exercise science is not of the same calibre as other fields of medical science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Due to the nature of non-pharmacological interventions, blinding often proves impossible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] but that does not prevent behavioural studies from adhering to the majority of the ICH-GCP principles. The present study will adhere to these principles in order to conduct a high trial with enhanced comparability with medical drug trials while simultaneously preventing outcome reporting bias and erroneous interpretations of post-hoc analyses.</p><p>A key aim of the FCPC Trial is to generate scientific knowledge to help support decisions on whether to use football in community-based clubs as a strategy for promoting health in men with PCa. For that reason the trial has utilised the PRECIS-2 wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] to help define the pragmatic approach of the various domains, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The study was designed with this in mind and the recruitment of participants in multiple centres and delivery of the intervention in the community were chosen in order to enhance the generalisability of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>PRECIS-2 score of the FCPC Trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2016_2805_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADT</term><def><p>Androgen deprivation therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMC</term><def><p>Bone mineral content</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMD</term><def><p>Bone mineral density</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHG-GCP</term><def><p>Council for Harmonisation Guideline on Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAS&#x02013;7</term><def><p>Seven-item Dyadic Adjustment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DXA</term><def><p>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCPC</term><def><p>FC Prostate Community Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBM</term><def><p>Lean body mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCa</term><def><p>Prostate cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p>12-Item Short Form Health Survey</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This protocol would not have been possible without the contributions of the FCPC Steering Committee involved in the initiation and implementation of the FCPC Trial.
