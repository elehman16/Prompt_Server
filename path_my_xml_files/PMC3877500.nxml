Selection of the procedure was done randomly by alternation method to minimize the risk of selection bias. Alternation was done every 3<sup>rd</sup> case according to the following order:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="AJNS-8-139-g002.jpg"/></p><p>After medication and general anesthesia, all patients were positioned prone on frame or rolls to avoid abdominal compression and reduce venous congestion. All the revision surgeries were performed from the original site of the primary surgery. By using a curette, the epidural scar tissue at the previous laminectomy area was separated from the margin of the residual lamina. Access to the normal anatomic planes of the epidural space was achieved by removal of the residual lamina. The epidural scar tissue was detached and partially resected. Exposure was carried out laterally, so that the lateral edge of the nerve root was visualized. The nerve root was then mobilized gently and retracted medially to expose the disc fragment. Occasionally, the nerve root was adhered to the extruded disc fragment or to the ligamentous structures and required sharp dissection for separation.</p><p>In group B and C, facetectomy was done before dissection of the nerve root, until the pedicle was visible. This would facilitate the identification of the nerve root and disc structure for a complete decompression without extensive dissection and retraction of the neural tissues.</p><p>In group B, a nearly complete discectomy was performed using disc shavers, curettes, and rongeurs. End-plate decortication was performed. Intervertebral disc space spreader was then sequentially inserted and opened to restore the normal disc space height. Once the disc space was distracted, a single TLIF PEEK cage (Boomerang, TLIF PEEK Interbody Cages, Medtronic, TN) packed with autogenous bone from the removed residual lamina and the spinous process was inserted. A lateral fluoroscopic image projection was obtained to confirm proper positioning of the cage. Then, the intervertebral disc space spreader was removed. This was followed by bilateral single level posterior transpedicular screws (CD Horaizon M-8, Posterior Transpedicular Systems, Medtronic, TN) fixation under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>In group C, decortication of the lateral aspect of the superior articular facets, pars interarticulars, and transverse processes was performed bilaterally after discectomy. Autogenous bone graft from the spinous process and the removed residual lamina was placed across the transverse processes on both sides. This was followed by bilateral single level posterior transpedicular screws (CD Horaizon M-8, Posterior Transpedicular Systems, Medtronic, TN) fixation under fluoroscopic guidance.</p><p>Closure was then done in a routine fashion after insertion of a subcutaneous suction drain. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively and were encouraged to ambulate the day after surgery. The use of lumbar corset for two months was suggested for the patients in group B and C.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Postoperative evaluation</title><p>The patients were followed up at regular intervals for at least two years.

Our study was conducted on 45 patients with first time recurrent lumbar disc herniation after exclusion of cases with disc herniation with other pathology such as (multi segmental spinal canal stenosis, adjacent level disc herniation, spondylolythesis, and spinal deformities). After a mean follow-up of 37 (&#x000b1;7.85 STD) months, the mean postoperative recovery rate was 87.2% (&#x000b1;19.26 STD) and the satisfactory rate was 88.9%.</p><p>Considering these data, patients can be advised that revision discectomy is effective for improving patient's complaint with satisfactory rate up to 88.9%.</p><p>The optimal surgical approach for recurrent disc herniation remains a subject of controversy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Despite simple revision discectomy can be an effective treatment for first time recurrences,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] many surgeons would consider the addition of fusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Discectomy with fusion has several theoretical advantages. It reduces or eliminates segmental motion and reduces mechanical stresses across the degenerated disc space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Lehmann and LaRocca[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] treated 36 patients with failed previous lumbar surgery by spinal canal exploration and spinal fusion. Solid fusion correlated closely with satisfactory outcomes, and the patients in the fusion group tended to have better outcomes than those with disc excision alone. In our study, the patients were classified into three groups according to the surgical procedure. Comparison between the three groups showed better outcomes in fusion groups (group B and group C) than non fusion group (group A) with regard to the mean total postoperative JOA score, recovery rate, and satisfactory rate, but these differences were statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). However, the postoperative low back pain was significantly higher in group A than that of group B and C (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Universally, adhesions are present between the disc fragment, annulus, and the overlying neural elements in revision surgery. Developing a plane between these structures can be tedious and difficult and can risk dural tear and neural injury. The incidence of dural tear during repeated lumbar discectomy was reported up to 20% of the patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Also, and according to the report by Choi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] permanent foot drop developed in one (2.9%) of 35 patients after repeated lumbar discectomy. Often this plane is best identified through aggressive facetectomy to enter unscarred virgin tissue. Therefore, the surgeon can approach the disc fragment safely without demanding dissection of the fibrotic scar tissues, and excessive retraction of scarred nerve root and dura.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In our study, there were seven cases of intraoperative dural tear. In group A (non fusion group), where the facet joint was preserved and meticulous dissection of the nerve root and disc fragment from the adhesions has been done, there were four (26.7%) cases with dural tear. While in the fusion groups (group B and C), where more aggressive facetectomy was done to develop a new plane for disc removal away from the adhesions, there was less incidence of dural tear (2 (13.3%) cases in group B and 1 (6.7%) case in group C). For the same reason, the incidence of postoperative transient neurological deficit was higher in the non fusion group than the fusion groups; two (13.3%) cases in group A, one (6.7%) case in group B and no cases in group C had transient postoperative neurological deficit.</p><p>If a large portion of the joint was removed during the primary procedure, destabilization of the joint might be anticipated during revision discectomy and this would lead to postoperative mechanical instability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In our study, there was one case in group A (non fusion group) that developed postoperative spondylolithesis and instability that required another operation 30 months postoperatively for fusion, but none of the cases had postoperative instability in the fusion groups (group B and C).</p><p>Many studies proposed that fusion across the disc space reduces, if not, eliminates the risk of recurrent herniation at the level of surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In our study, there was one case of re-recurrent disc herniation in group A (non fusion group) that required third operation for discectomy and fusion 24 months postoperatively, but there were no cases of re-recurrence in the fusion groups (group B and C).</p><p>Considering these data, it seems that fusion with revision discectomy improves the postoperative low back pain score, decreases the risk of intraoperative dural tear or neural damage and decreases the postoperative incidence of mechanical instability or re-recurrence.</p><p>Fusion with revision lumbar discectomy can be broadly categorized as PLF and interbody fusion. Theoretically, interbody fusion provides the most reliable fusion technique for the lumbar spine. It immobilizes the painful degenerated spinal segments and restores disc height and root canal dimensions, as well as load bearing ability of the anterior structures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Various techniques for interbody fusion have been described, including ALIF, PLIF, and TLIF.</p><p>ALIF was performed for a recurrent lumbar disc herniation. In a retrospective review of 22 patients who underwent ALIF for recurrent herniation, Choi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] found that leg pain, back pain, and functional status demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with preoperative values. A total of 19 of the 22 patients (86.3%) were satisfied with their clinical results. The ALIF procedure is technically demanding. The disadvantages of ALIF include the risk of injury to the great vessels or the presacral plexus, which may result in retrograde ejaculation in male patients. ALIF provides limited access to repair dural tears. The technical aspects of ALIF at L5-S1 are also important. The inclined angle of the disc space may be so steep that it renders adequate visualization of the posterior disc margin very difficult.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>PLIF had been used for surgical treatment of recurrent lumbar disc herniation. Chitnavis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] prospectively followed 50 patients with recurrent lumbar lumbar disc herniation. After revision discectomy and PLIF, 92% reported significant relief of preoperative symptoms, and 90% stated that they would have the surgery again. The results of PLIF by using a single, threaded, cylindrical cage placed through the contralateral &#x0201c;virgin&#x0201d; side were reported by Niu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] in 14 patients with recurrent disc herniations and 93% of patients reported good or excellent outcomes. Similarly, Huang and Chen[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] studied 28 patients after PLIF was performed with a single cage and pedicle screws and 92% of patients were satisfied with the clinical results. However, the PLIF procedure is technically difficult and some problems such as graft collapse, slippage, cage migration, dura and nerve root manipulations had been observed in 4 to10% of the cases with PLIF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>To avoid the problems and disadvantages of ALIF and PLIF, TLIF had been used for treatment of recurrent lumbar disc herniation. TLIF affords the opportunity to achieve stable three-column fixation through a single posterior surgical approach and unilateral placement of interbody cage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Chen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] prospectively studied 43 patients who underwent revision discectomy and TLIF for recurrent lumbar disc herniation. After a mean follow-up of 45 months, all patients had significant leg pain improvement and only 86% reported satisfactory outcomes. Complications included two incidental durotomies, one superficial wound infection, and three transient paresthesias that resolved by three months.</p><p>The use of PLF had been the predominant surgical modality in the treatment of degenerative spinal conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Fu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] evaluated the results of repeated surgery for recurrent lumbar disc herniation, and compared the results of disc excision with and without PLF. They revealed excellent or good clinical outcomes in 78.3% of patients who had revision discectomy alone (23 patients) and in 83.3% of patients with PLF (18 patients). In the fusion group, there was one superficial infection and two dural tears. Greenleaf <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] stated that &#x0201c;Although they have used various other techniques in the past, it is the authors&#x02019; current preference to perform a stand-alone PLF (when fusion is indicated) in conjunction with revision discectomy&#x0201d;. Also many authors reported that the effect of posterolateral fusion on the adjacent discs was slight in comparison to the anterior (interbody) fusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we used two types of fusion with revision discectomy; TLIF (group B), and PLF (group C). Comparison between the two groups showed no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the mean total postoperative JOA score, postoperative low back pain score, mean recovery rate, and satisfactory rate. In group B (TLIF group), one patient (6.7%) developed temporary foot drop and sensory disturbance, two patients (13.3%) had intraoperative dural tear and one patient (6.7%) had postoperative deep venous thrombosis. In group C (PLF group), one patient (6.7%) had intraoperative dural tear and one patient (6.7%) had postoperative superficial wound infection. There was no significant difference between both groups with regard to the intraoperative blood loss, length of operation, and length of postoperative hospital stay. However, the total cost of the procedure was significantly higher in group B (TLIF group) than group C (PLIF group). Of note, both groups had significantly higher length of operation, intraoperative blood loss and total cost of the procedure than non fusion group (group A), but there was no significant difference between the three groups with regard to the length of postoperative hospital stay.</p><p>Considering these data, we can note that both TLIF and PLF have comparable results when used with revision discectomy but PLF has significantly less total cost than TLIF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Revision discectomy is effective in patients with recurrent lumbar disc herniation with satisfactory rate up to 88.9%. Fusion with revision discectomy improves the postoperative low back pain, decreases the intraoperative risk of dural tear or neural damage and decreases the postoperative incidence of mechanical instability or re-recurrence. TLIF and PLF have comparable results when used with revision discectomy, but PLF has significantly less total cost than TLIF.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>TT</given-names></name><name><surname>Niu</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Long-term results of disc excision for recurrent lumbar disc herniation with or without posterolateral fusion</article-title><source>Spine (Phila Pa 1976)</source><year>2005</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>2830</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16371913</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cinotti</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Roysam</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenstein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Postacchini</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ipsilateral recurrent lumbar disc herniation.
