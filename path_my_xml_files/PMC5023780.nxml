Of the 153 women who completed therapy, 141 had adequate material for immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment biopsies. An antibody to HE4 (clone 12A2 monoclonal IgG1 antibody, Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.) was used for the immunohistochemical staining of the pre- and post-treatment biopsies from each participant.

As much as 80&#x00025; of endometrial cancers are preceded by a preliminary stage called endometrial hyperplasia. Therefore, the development of optimal diagnostics and individualised therapy for endometrial hyperplastic lesions should be of high priority to prevent this trend. However, national routines for therapy and follow up for endometrial hyperplasia have thus far been arbitrary or non-existing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurman <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013b</xref>). In recent decades, progestin has been accepted as a conservative therapy for low- and medium-risk endometrial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferenczy and Gelfand, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jobo <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bese <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). A levonorgestrel-impregnated intrauterine device (LNG-IUS, Mirena, Bayer, Berlin, Germany) has recently been demonstrated to be superior to oral progestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wildemeersch <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Varma <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buttini <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallos <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), but oral regimens are still preferred by many women with intolerance to intrauterine therapy. However, most of the published data indicate a high frequency of progestin resistance or therapy failure after oral regimes compared with intrauterine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013a</xref>). In a recent RCT, we found that 31&#x00025; of individuals failed to respond after cyclic oral therapy lasting for 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, to date, no objective molecular marker for resistance to progestin therapy has been identified.</p><p>Human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4, belonging to one of four WAP gene products), has been shown to be secreted into the serum as a glycoprotein overexpressed in serous and endometrioid types of ovarian carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drapkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouchard <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The exact function of the HE4 protein is unknown, but previous studies have demonstrated that HE4 overexpression promotes cell adhesion and migration whereas HE4 suppression markedly inhibits tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the past decade, HE4 has drawn attention as a serum marker for endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalapotharakos <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Thus, HE4 has been shown to be a promising marker for the detection and prognosis of endometrial cancer with respect to the Figo stage, myometrial invasion, and grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bignotti <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mutz-Dehbalaie <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Immunohistochemical detection of HE4 in endometrial tissue samples revealed that the rate of expression of HE4 in endometrial hyperplasia was higher compared with normal controls and lower compared with individuals with endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, hormone-mediated regulation of HE4 tissue expression by progestin has never been described, and no studies exist of HE4 as a predictive marker of the therapy response after progestin therapy for endometrial hyperplasia.</p><p>The present study was based on a national multicentre RCT comparing different progestin regimens as a treatment for endometrial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Our main intention was to investigate whether variation in the tissue expression of HE4 during different progestin therapy regimens could predict therapy response or therapy failure and whether HE4 might be considered a potential marker for progestin resistance for medium- and low-risk endometrial hyperplasia.</p><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The biopsy material was obtained from 153 women with low- and medium-risk endometrial hyperplasia in a national multicentre randomised study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The women had been treated with either LNG-IUS (Mirena, Bayer), 10&#x02009;mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for 10 days per cycle, or 10&#x02009;mg of MPA daily for 6 months (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01074892, Regional Ethical committee number 25/2004) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). The study inclusion period was from 1 January 2005 to 1 November 2011. The treatment period was completed on 1 May 2012. After 6 months of treatment, all therapy was withdrawn. One pre- and one post-treatment biopsy (after 6 months) was obtained from each participant using a Pipelle (Endometrial suction curette, Jiangsu Guard King Medical Equipment, Jiangsu, China) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). For the present study, paired adequate biopsy material from 141 women was available for the immunohistochemical analyses; 48 of these women had been treated with LNG-IUS; 44 with continuous MPA; and 49 with cyclic MPA. Insufficient biopsy material in the paraffin blocks was the reason for excluding eight of the original 153 women. Patient characteristics, such as age, menopausal status, parity, and WHO diagnosis, were registered and related to the staining of HE4 in tissue specimens taken before the start of therapy and when therapy was discontinued (after 6 months). To monitor relapse, all the included patients were followed up at 6-month intervals for 24 months after therapy was discontinued.</p></sec><sec><title>Endometrial biopsies</title><p>The endometrial biopsy material was sent to the Department of Pathology at the University Hospital of North Norway for routine assessment. The specimens were fixed in buffered formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and further processed in the laboratory before standard histological sections were obtained. Diagnostic assessment of the WHO classification by light microscopy was performed by a trained gynaecology pathologist (AO) and one additional routine pathologist; each was blinded to the other's diagnosis. Agreement after discordant results was always obtained after discussion at a two-headed microscope. The index biopsies were classified into one of the three groups: simple hyperplasia, complex hyperplasia, or atypical hyperplasia, according to the WHO classification, which was considered the gold standard for the evaluation of endometrial hyperplasia at the time the study was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurman <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013b</xref>). Normalised histology in the control biopsies after therapy was defined as ordinary proliferative endometrium or endometrium with a progestin effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurman <italic>et al</italic>, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013b</xref>). All information from the WHO classification of the index and control biopsies was registered and maintained in a separate database and subsequently supplemented with information from hospital records.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed according to customers' advice. Slides with a thickness of 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m were routinely cut from paraffin blocks and placed on Super frost&#x0002b; glasses (Fisher Scientific, Oslo, Norway), followed by incubation overnight at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which was necessary for fixation. Deparaffinisation, pretreatment in a Tris-based, slightly alkaline reagent (CC1 mild) for 30&#x02009;min at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and staining were automatically performed in a Benchmark XT from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc (Tucson, AZ, USA). The primary antibody used in the present study was HE4 clone 12A2 monoclonal IgG1 antibody (Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., PA, USA). The initial concentration was 15.1&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>-1</sup>, and the antibody was used at a dilution of 1out of 4000 in Antibody Diluent (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.). After addition of the primary antibody, the slides were incubated for 32&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and automatic DAB staining was performed in several steps with an Ultraview Universal DAB Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.) before dehydration, counterstaining with haematoxylin, and mounting.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of immunohistochemical expression in endometrial glands (<italic>H</italic>-score)</title><p>The results of immunostaining in endometrial hyperplasia specimens taken before therapy and immediately after 6 months of progestin therapy were assessed by light microscopy. The HE4 staining, which was concentrated mainly within the cytoplasm of endometrial glandular cells, was examined using a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical histological score (<italic>H</italic>-score), which incorporates both the intensity and the distribution of specific staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). The immunohistochemical staining results were classified as follows: light-brown granular cytoplasm = 1, medium-brown granular cytoplasm =2, or dark-brown granular cytoplasm = 3. The <italic>H</italic>-score has been previously formulated as HS=&#x02211;(Pi &#x000d7; <italic>i</italic>)/100, in which Pi denotes the percentage of stained cells and <italic>i</italic> denotes the intensity of the staining, ranging from 1&#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). The <italic>H</italic>-score evaluation was performed visually as a consensus between a trained gynaecological pathologist (AO) and a trained technician (MA). Both investigators were blinded to the different patient groups, and three specific areas within each specimen (hot spots) were defined for investigation in the pre- and post-therapy biopsy specimens. The staining intensity and the number of positive cells were evaluated. The <italic>H</italic>-scores for the cells in the pre-treatment biopsies were used to divide the samples into three groups: low (<italic>H</italic>-score &#x0003e;0.5), medium (<italic>H</italic>-score 0.6&#x02013;1.5), and high (<italic>H</italic>-score &#x0003e;1.6). A statistical evaluation of the differences in the <italic>H</italic>-scores between the pre- and post-treatment biopsies related to therapy group, therapy response, and relapse was used to divide the patients as follows: patients with reduced <italic>H</italic>-scores after therapy were placed in group 1, and patients with unchanging or increased <italic>H</italic>-scores were placed in group 2. Aggregates of dark-brown, well-defined material (bodies) were observed within the cytoplasm of the endometrial glands. These bodies showed variations in size and were classified as follows: absence of bodies&#x02014;0;&#x0003c;2&#x02013;4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m in diameter&#x02014;1; 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m in diameter&#x02014;2; and 11&#x02013;15&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m diameter&#x02014;3. Changes in the diameter of the bodies between pre- and post-treatment specimens were divided into two separate groups and evaluated according to the therapy group, therapy response, and relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study following the Helsinki declaration was designed according to the CONSORT statement for randomised clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schulz <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (number 25/2004), by the Norwegian Council of Medical Advice, and by the Norwegian Medicines Agency.

Consequently, significant differences in the HE4 score were observed between pre- and post-treatment biopsies for the three progestin therapy groups. A greater reduction in the HE4 score was observed with the LNG-IUS compared with oral therapy. The concentration of levonorgestrel, obtained by the LNG-IUS in the uterine mucosa, has been shown to be more than 100 times higher than the concentration observed after oral treatment with the same type of progestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nilsson <italic>et al</italic>, 1982</xref>). All the women treated with the LNG-IUS in the present study obtained a complete therapy response after 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Thus, the reduction in the tissue expression of HE4 (reduced <italic>H</italic>-score) appears to be associated with the given progestin dose.</p><p>However, the function of the HE4 protein family, known to serve as endogenous peptide protease inhibitors, remains obscure, and no specific molecular link between HE4 and progestin has ever been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In cell studies of ovarian cancer overexpression and knockout of HE4-related genes, HE4 has been shown to regulate malignant mechanisms such as cell adhesion, invasion, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Evidence exists that the tumour-promoting effects of HE4 are effectuated by the activation of the EGFR-MAPK molecular pathway, which further activates PI3K/Akt-mediated proliferation and other types of malignant behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that the influence of progestin hormones on the PI3K signalling pathway can counteract the malignant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minaguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minaguchi <italic>et al</italic> (2007)</xref> demonstrated that medroxyprogesterone had an anti-tumour effect through the dephosphorylation of Akt. In another study, progesterone was shown to inhibit the oestradiol-stimulated Akt/CyclinD1/pRB pathway, blocking endometrial proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus, according to several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, the possibility exists that progestin can counteract the malignant effect induced by HE4 in a dose-dependent manner, and this might be effectuated by the regulation of the PI3K signalling pathway. The exact mechanism for progestin resistance remains unknown. In the present study, 18 women showed resistance to progestin therapy with persistent hyperplasia after 6 months. Among these 18 women, 17 showed increased <italic>H</italic>-scores after therapy. All of these women had been treated with either oral cyclic (16 out of 18) or oral continuous progestin (2 out of 18). Thus, higher progestin doses might be required to reverse and suppress the unfavourable influence of high HE4 levels. Studies have been performed to investigate the molecular events related to progestin resistance and the reversion of progestin resistance in endometrial cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu <italic>et al</italic> (2011)</xref> have shown that low concentrations or the absence of progesterone receptors in endometrial cancer cells are associated with a poor response to progesterone therapy. Their results also indicated that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by progestin without PR mediation has an important role in progestin resistance to endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In contrast, we have observed that progesterone receptors were completely absent after 3 months of LNG-IUS therapy in endometrial hyperplasia, even though the treatment effect was efficiently maintained over several years and all the included patients had responded to the therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vereide <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orbo <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In the same study, both progesterone receptor A and progesterone receptor B were present in women with therapy failure after 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vereide <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). In endometrial cancer cell lines, we showed dose-dependent progestin effects using supra-physiological concentrations of progestin to ensure that the progesterone receptors were thoroughly saturated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moe <italic>et al</italic>, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2009b</xref>). Taken together, these former studies indicate that non-genomic signalling pathways are activated by high progestin concentrations and that the effective suppression of HE4 may be dependent on high progestin concentrations.</p><p>Thus far, a link between the synthesis, cell transport, and serum levels of HE4 has not been clearly demonstrated. In recent studies, the tissue expression of HE4 localised in the cytoplasm in glands has been shown to increase in proportion to the increase in malignancy in endometrial proliferative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). The absence of HE4 occurred in benign endometrial lesions, but severe hyperplasia and low-grade cancer were characterised by stronger HE4 staining compared with simple and complex hyperplasia without atypia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). This is consistent with our results showing that the majority of the included women, who were treated conservatively, obtained a medium score of HE4 before therapy started. Human epididymis-specific protein 4 is a small secretory glycoprotein detected in the plasma, and HE4 levels have been described to increase proportionately with Figo stage and tumour grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). In addition, high levels of HE4 in the plasma have been shown to preoperatively identify high-risk patients with low-grade endometrial cancer with increased risks of lymph node metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Our finding of HE4 bodies localised within the cytoplasm in endometrial epithelial cells has never been described. Even if our results indicate that changes in diameter of these bodies during therapy predicted relapse, the statistics was not powerful and these findings need to be further analysed in future studies.</p><p>The possibility exists that these aggregates of HE4 molecules might represent HE4 marker glycoproteins ready to be transported from intracellular compartments to the bloodstream, representing the missing link between tissue expression and measurable serum levels of HE4. Although immunohistochemistry has its limitations, the present study is based on a recently published RCT, which ensures the quality of the results.</p><p>In the current study, we found that changes in HE4 expression during therapy for endometrial hyperplasia were significantly related to the progestin therapy regimen and correlated to the therapy response but could not predict relapse. Our results suggest that changes in the expression of HE4 after various progestin therapy regimens can predict therapy response <italic>vs</italic> therapy resistance. Thus, HE4 may be a useful tissue marker for women with medium- and low-risk endometrial hyperplasia who are intolerant to LNG-IUS and who can be successfully treated by oral progestin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Fujirebio kindly provided the HE4 antibody but had no influence on the study project or the evaluation of the results.
