AI438011 is a Phase IIb, randomized, active-controlled trial investigating the safety, efficacy and dose&#x02013;response of BMS-663068 versus atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) in treatment-experienced (TE), HIV-1-positive subjects.</p></sec><sec id="st2_19529"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Antiretroviral TE subjects (exposure to &#x02265;1 antiretroviral for &#x02265;1 week) with susceptibility to all study drugs (BMS-626529 IC<sub>50</sub> 100 nM), were randomized equally to four BMS-663068 arms (400 or 800 mg, BID; 600 or 1200 mg, QD) and a control group (ATV/r 300/100 mg QD) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + raltegravir (RAL). A sub-group analysis of viral efficacy and immunologic reconstitution is presented.</p></sec><sec id="st3_19529"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 251 subjects were treated. Median age was 39 years, 60% were male and 38% were white. Median baseline (BL) viral load (VL) was 4.85 log<sub>10</sub> c/mL (43%; 100,000 c/mL) and median CD4+ T-cell count was 230 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (38%; 200 CD4 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>). Through Week 24, response rates (HIV-1 RNA 50 c/mL) were comparable across all BMS-663068 arms and the ATV/r arm regardless of gender, age and race. Response rates for subjects with BL VL 100,000 c/mL (BMS-663068, 82-96%; ATV/r, 93%) were higher than those for subjects with BL VL &#x02265;100,000 c/mL (BMS-663068, 70-87%; ATV/r, 73%); however, there were no substantial differences in response across the BMS-663068 and ATV/r arms in either sub-group. Response rates for subjects with BL CD4+ cell counts &#x02265;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (87-96%) were higher than those for subjects with BL CD4+ cell counts 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (62&#x02013;82%); however, no substantial differences in response were seen across the BMS-663068 and ATV/r arms in either sub-group. Mean changes in CD4+ T-cell counts from BL were similar across all arms regardless of gender, age and BL CD4+ T-cell count.</p></sec><sec id="st4_19529"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Virologic response rates were similar across the BMS-663068 and ATV/r arms in TE subjects, regardless of BL demographic characteristics (gender, race, age), BL HIV-1 RNA, or BL CD4+ T-cell count. Mean increases in CD4+ T-cell counts across the BMS-663068 arms were consistent with ATV/r, regardless of gender, age and BL CD4+ T-cell count. These results support continued development of BMS-663068.</p></sec><sec id="st5_19529"><title>Note</title><p>Previously submitted at IDWeek, Philadelphia, PA, 8 October 2014.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
