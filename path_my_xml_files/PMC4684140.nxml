During its course AD also affects most of the other cognitive functions, such as language, visuospatial perception, constructive and ideational praxis, and executive functions. AD is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, accounting for two-thirds of dementia cases in adults over the age of 65 years [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Alzheimer disease affects approximately 5.3 million people in the United States alone, and the annual number of new cases of AD and other dementias is projected to double by 2050 [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Between 2000 and 2013, deaths attributed to AD increased by 71%, while those attributed to the number one cause of death (heart disease) decreased by 14% in the US [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is established that the degeneration of cholinergic system in the brain and the deficiency of acetylcholine in synapses plays a major role in pathogenesis of AD cognitive symptoms [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Symptomatic therapies are the only treatments approved for AD at this time. Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors interfere with the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and promote its accumulation in the synapse, thereby enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission and cognitive function in AD patients [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Donepezil is a centrally acting selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), and is the most commonly used cholinergic medication in AD treatment. Pivotal clinical trials demonstrated that approximately 3 months of stable-dose donepezil treatment leads to the highest possible improvement, followed by a plateau lasting several months, and then a cognitive decline in line with the natural course of AD, but with the MMSE score remaining 2&#x02013;3 point above those with placebo [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The long-term efficacy of DZP treatment and the magnitude of the treatment effects are highly variable among individual AD patients [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Significant efforts have been devoted to the identification of factors that may influence the response of AD to ChEIs, and can be used as predictors of treatment response in individual patients [<xref rid="b12-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A wide variety of predictors have been investigated, ranging from genetic polymorphisms in AD risk genes, to neuroimaging predictors, demographic factors, clinical and cognitive features, and more. Many genetic polymorphisms were explored: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], CYP2D6 gene [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Butyrylcholinesterase K Variant [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], ChAT gene [<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], FOXO1 gene [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and CHRNA7 gene encoding the agr;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] have been reported to be useful in predicting clinical response to donepezil. ApoE &#x0025b;4 allele is by far the most studied genetic risk factor that may influence the response to donepezil. However, due to the complex network of genetic and environmental interactions, the search for reliable predictors of treatment response cannot be limited to a single special indicator (genetic or not), but should rather analyze a wide variety of predictors. Some researchers reported that APOE &#x0025b;4/&#x0025b;4 carriers are the worst responders to conventional treatments [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while other reports showed that AD patients carrying at least 1 &#x0025b;4 allele may respond better to donepezil therapy [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other, non-genetic, predictors of the response of AD patients to donepezil include: measures of hippocampal volume [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], atrophy of the substantia innominata on MRI [<xref rid="b22-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and FDG-PET studies [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The effect of genetic and neuroimaging predictors of response to treatment is usually influenced by other genetic polymorphisms and demographic factors, such as age. Because of frequently contradictory reports on the same predictors, unsuccessful efforts to reproduce the results, and quite limited direct quantitative evidence about interaction of factors related to response, it might be suggested that a complex network of interacting factors of very different natures influences the response to AD treatment. It has been demonstrated that demographic and clinical factors, such as dementia severity and age of the AD patients, significantly influence the response to donepezil [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some results indicated that lower cognitive ability and older age predicted better cognitive response but worse functional response [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Comorbidity also has been found to influence the response to ChEI treatment: improvement is more likely to occur only in AD patients without concomitant diseases and only for those who had demonstrated a positive response at 3 months of treatment [<xref rid="b27-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Cognitive predictors of response to donepezil therapy in AD have also been studied, leading to conclusions that the domains of visual-spatial motor abilities and lexical-semantic functioning are the most reliable predictors of response to donepezil in AD [<xref rid="b28-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Quite substantial information is available about the predictive value of baseline cognitive, clinical, and demographic characteristics in relation to long-term donepezil treatment efficacy. However, there has been very limited research focussed on establishing the value of the initial cognitive response to the first single dose of donepezil as a predictor of long-term efficacy. Therefore, we investigated whether the cognitive changes produced by the first single DPZ dose in Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) test measures and the baseline scores of the same test measures are able to predict the long-term efficacy of DPZ in AD. The CANTAB is a validated, automated, neuropsychological battery [<xref rid="b29-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with vast possibilities to assess various cognitive functions, such as attention, learning, memory, problem solving, and executive function [<xref rid="b30-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We tried to determine this in a systematic way, and our analysis included not only cognitive data, but also a wide variety of clinical and demographic characteristics that could affect the efficacy of long-term administration of donepezil, such as age, gender, general dementia severity (MMSE), depression level (GDS), and vascular comorbidity (Hachinski Ischemic Index). Baseline cognitive measures of CANTAB tests and their changes due to the first single dose of donepezil were included in our analysis as separate predictors. GRM models were built for various CANTAB battery tests and different measures provided by these tests. Computerized tests have many advantages over &#x0201c;paper and pencil&#x0201d; cognitive tests: their administration is simple, most computerized tests have multiple alternate versions, and they usually do not exhibit floor or ceiling effects. A computerized test battery may provide more objective results in the individual test than the classical &#x0201c;paper and pencil&#x0201d; tests [<xref rid="b31-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While it was reported that the CANTAB battery, especially the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, may be very informative in early prognosis of the development of AD, there has been virtually no research using computerized tests with the aim of establishing a value of the first single-dose response (the change in cognition after the first dose of donepezil) for prediction of a long-term treatment response [<xref rid="b35-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Having a reliable, simple, and inexpensive cognitive function-based tool for prediction of long-term responders and non-responders might aid in selecting the optimal medication or a combination of medications when more symptomatic treatment options become available. Personalization of the treatment of AD may be achieved through various approaches and using various methods from genomics and advanced neuroimaging to perform detailed, in-depth cognitive assessment [<xref rid="b39-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, there is an increased need for simple and inexpensive diagnostic markers to reliably predict treatment response in AD. One promising strategy is to search for these markers in the same field in which AD exhibits its main symptoms &#x02013; cognitive functions and their changes.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to establish the ability of the response to the first single dose of donepezil and the baseline scores, measured by means of the CANTAB battery tests, to predict the long-term efficacy of donepezil in AD and to compare the significance of CANTAB-based cognitive predictors with other clinical and demographic predictors of the long-term efficacy of donepezil in treatment of AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>This prospective, randomized, rater-blind follow-up study was performed at the Memory Disorders Unit of the Neurology Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos, and 102 subjects were enrolled in the study. We recruited 62 consecutive, <italic>de novo-</italic>diagnosed, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve AD patients: 10 patients taking the stable Donepezil dose of 10 mg/day for at least 3 months (Treatment group, TG), and 30 healthy controls (Control group, CG) matched according to age, education, and gender. All patients were diagnosed with AD in standard clinical practice settings by a neurologist not involved in this study. Patients started their treatment with donepezil when the medication was prescribed by the neurologist of the Memory Disorders Unit. After the day of the first assessment, the patients continued their treatment with donepezil as per usual clinical practice rules according to the treatment guidelines established by the Lithuanian Ministry of Health. No modifications to the patient treatment were made due to this research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>Informed consent was obtained, screening evaluation (MMSE, GDS, and others) performed, Inclusion/Exclusion criteria verified, and both assessments 1 and 2 (CANTAB test 1and 2) were performed on the same day (baseline day of the study), when the <italic>de novo</italic> patients took their first dose of donepezil. Newly diagnosed AD patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 research groups with the ratio 1: 1 using the sequence of random numbers 1 or 2, produced by the on-line Research Randomizer at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org/">http://www.randomizer.org/</ext-link>. Thirty AD patients were assigned to the New AD+DPZ group and 32 patients were assigned to the New AD-DPZ group. Ten patients taking the stable dose of donepezil for no less than 3 months were enrolled into the Treated AD group; they took donepezil after Test 1 and Test 2 (i.e., there was no donepezil usage in this group between Test 1 and Test 2). Patients allocated to the New AD+DPZ group received a 5-mg donepezil tablet immediately after the CANTAB Test 1. Test 2 was performed 4 hours after the New AD+DPZ group patients took donepezil. The 4-hour period was selected because this is consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of a single-dose oral administration of donepezil. The peak plasma concentration is observed at 4.1 hours [<xref rid="b40-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Patients in the New AD-DPZ group underwent both Test 1 and Test 2 without taking donepezil between these tests (i.e., the New AD+DPZ group and the New AD-DPZ group completed the CANTAB Test 1 while treatment-na&#x000ef;ve). CANTAB Test 2 was completed by New AD+DPZ group 4 hours after the first single 5 mg dose of donepezil. The New AD-DPZ group completed the CANTAB Test 2 after the same period of 4 hours after Test 1, but still being treatment-na&#x000ef;ve. The New AD+DPZ, New AD-DPZ, and Treated AD groups did not differ by age, education, or gender, as was verified after the completion of the recruitment period. The neurologist performing CANTAB testing was blinded to the participant&#x02019;s assignment to a specific group. Global severity of dementia was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [<xref rid="b41-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used for the assessment of depression [<xref rid="b42-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the Hachinski Ischemic Index was used to evaluate vascular comorbidity [<xref rid="b43-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. MMSE, GDS, and Hachinski Ischemic Index were assessed and donepezil usage instructions were provided by another neurologist. Control group participants were recruited from a group of older adults with no medical history of AD or other dementia. No significant differences were found between the study groups according to education, age, and gender. For each group, the study required 2 testing days. On Day 1 all participants completed the CANTAB Test 1 (Baseline assessment) and Test 2 at 4 hours post-baseline. Day 2 occurred 4 months later. The participants then completed the CANTAB Test 3.

Were defined the following Removal Criteria: p1, enter: 0.05; p2, remove: 0.05; F1, enter: 1; F2, remove: 1; Maximum steps: 100; Sweep delta: 1.E-7; Inverse delta: 1.E-12.</p><p>Difference of Scores on the CANTAB test measure at Test 3 and Test 1 was entered in a GRM as a dependent variable.</p><p>As Categorical predictors were entered in the GRM model: 1) The participant group; 2) Disease status: Alzheimer&#x02019;s patient or healthy control subject; 3) Gender; 4) Was the participant using donepezil before the Test 1?; 5) Did the participant take the dose of DPZ between Test 1 and Test 2?</p><p>Subsequent independent continuous predictors were entered in the GRM model: 1) Difference of scores on the CANTAB test measure at Test 2 and Test 1 was entered into a GRM as a dependent variable; 2) The Baseline Test 1 score of the CANTAB test measure; 3) Age (in years); 4) Education (in years); 5) Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score on Day 1 (when the Test 1 and Test 2 were performed); 6) Hachinski Ischemic Index (HII) on Day 1 (Baseline day); 7) MMSE score at Day 1 (Baseline score of global dementia severity).</p><p>Overall, 21 GRM models were built for different measures of 6 CANTAB tests (PRM in 2 modifications &#x02013; immediate and delayed) used in this study. Thirteen GRM models stopped stepping during backward removal process, leaving from 3 to 5 predictors, which did not include the baseline result of CANTAB test or the cognitive change due to the first dose of donepezil. While results with the main predictors such as the age, gender, education, baseline dementia severity (MMSE score) and their interactions are interesting and worthy of further analysis, they are not in line with the main purpose of this study and are not analyzed further in this article. Two GRM models stopped stepping with no variable left at all, leaving only the Intercept. In this case further analysis of the predictive value of the corresponding test measure is meaningless. The results of 6 GRM models, which showed that corresponding CANTAB test measures or their change due to the first single dose of donepezil have a significant predictive value, are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 1</xref>. For any of these models, the Regression coefficients and Pareto charts of t-values for the regression coefficients of significant predictors are presented along with the linear graphs of Means of CANTAB test scores for any of 4 participant groups in Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3 sessions.</p><p>While the cognitive change over a 4-month period from Test 1 to Test 3 represents donepezil treatment efficacy expressed only in 1 separate Test measure and most probably corresponds only to 1 cognitive domain or a part of it, we performed correlation analyses, trying to evaluate how improvements in 1 separate test measure correlate with the general measure of dementia severity. The results of correlation analysis are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Only 2 of 4 CANTAB PAL test measures, identified in our previous study as the tests that are able to detect significant cognitive change due to a single dose of donepezil, were found to be significant predictors of long-term donepezil treatment efficacy [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Both &#x0201c;PAL Mean trials to success&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;PAL Total trials (adjusted)&#x0201d; were able to detect significant cognitive change due to the first single dose and the long-term efficacy (4-month period) of donepezil in AD [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While &#x0201c;PAL Total errors (adjusted)&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;PAL Total errors (6 shapes, adjusted)&#x0201d; were able to detect significant cognitive change due to a single dose of donepezil, these 2 PAL measures did not significantly predict long-term efficacy of treatment [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. On the other hand, &#x0201c;PAL Stages completed&#x0201d; detected significant differences of cognitive change due to a single dose of donepezil in groups with and without donepezil after the first test, but was not able to show the difference between the first and the second test results inside the New AD+DPZ group itself (insignificant within group effect) [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It seems that &#x0201c;PAL Stages completed&#x0201d; did not identify the change after taking the first single dose of donepezil in the New AD+DPZ group, but showed significant difference of change, mostly due to the worsening of the results, in the New AD-DPZ group. Despite that, &#x0201c;PAL Stages completed&#x0201d; was successful in predicting long-term treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 1</xref>). According to the results of GRM models, &#x0201c;PAL Mean trials to success&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;PAL Stages completed&#x0201d; were similar in that both the cognitive change due to the first single dose of donepezil and the baseline results of these PAL test measures at Test 1 were significant predictors of long-term efficacy of donepezil, but for &#x0201c;PAL Total trials (adjusted)&#x0201d;, the change, but not baseline score, was significantly predictive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>An even more interesting finding of this study is that while no CANTAB test except for PAL was able to detect significant cognitive change due to the first single dose of donepezil, at least 1 measure of 3 other CANTAB tests was a significant predictor of long-term donepezil treatment in AD. &#x0201c;CRT Mean correct latency&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;PRM delayed; Number correct&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;SWM Total errors&#x0201d; were significant predictors of cognitive improvement after 4-month treatment. The nature of the predictive indicators of CRT, PRM delayed (PRMd), and the SWM was different. Although for PRMd, both the baseline results at Test 1 and the cognitive change between Test 1 and Test 2 were significant predictors of treatment efficacy, and no other significant predictors were left in GRM by Backward removal procedure, a very different predictive structure was found in CRT and SWM. For CRT, only the baseline result at Test 1 was a significant predictor of a cognitive nature, with Education and donepezil usage before Test 1 (treated AD group) being other significant predictors of long-term efficacy of treatment. The change of &#x0201c;CRT Mean correct latency&#x0201d; between Test 1 and Test 2 had no predictive value. For &#x0201c;SWM Total errors&#x0201d; only the change between Test 1 and Test 2 was a significant predictor for the long-term treatment efficacy of donepezil in AD, while baseline results of &#x0201c;SWM Total errors&#x0201d; at Test 1 had no predictive value. In addition, the &#x0201c;SWM Total errors&#x0201d; was the significant predictor with a group of other predictors: the global dementia severity at baseline (MMSE result in the Test 1), baseline depression level (GDS score at the time of Test 1), and Age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 1F2</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the predictive value of CANTAB tests for MMSE results (as a global measure of dementia) after 4 months of treatment, significant correlation of change of MMSE over 4 months-long treatment period was found with the change between Test 1 and Test 3 (4 months of treatment) of &#x0201c;PAL Mean trials to success&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2A</xref>), &#x0201c;PAL Stages completed&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2B</xref>), and &#x0201c;PAL Total trials (adjusted)&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2C</xref>). The correlation was weak and statistically insignificant for &#x0201c;CRT Mean correct latency&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2D</xref>), &#x0201c;PRM delayed; Number correct&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2E</xref>), and &#x0201c;SWM Total errors&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-medscimonit-21-3887">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, the initial response to the first single dose of donepezil is a significant predictor of long-term response of MMSE only for PAL test measures. This kind of PAL advantage over other CANTAB tests regarding the successful prediction of global dementia severity (MMSE results) may be explained by the fact that PAL assesses episodic recall memory and new learning [<xref rid="b45-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]; the decline in these cognitive processes is a major constituent of dementia syndrome in mild and mild-to-moderate AD. The explanation may be of another kind: PAL test seems to be more sensitive to cholinergic stimulation than other CANTAB battery tests [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but cholinergic deficiency is a hallmark of AD. As PAL test results rapidly react to cholinergic changes in the brain, PAL retains its significance as a predictor from the first single dose to the more long-term treatment efficacy, even though cholinergic receptors become down-regulated over time due to repetitive cholinergic stimulation.</p><p>We wondered why in the PAL test the GRM backward removal method leaves no other significant predictors except for PAL-related indicators (contrary to other CANTAB tests). It may be hypothesized that the predictive ability of PAL-related indicators (baseline result and the change in response to a single dose of DPZ), which are so much stronger than other predictors like age, education, and gender, are not able to withstand the GRM backward removal stepping procedure according to the indicated removal criteria and are eliminated from the model as insignificant. As the final result is the best model of the simplest models, it does not show that another indicator has no influence at all, but only that this influence is relatively small in comparison with the influence of PAL-related predictors, especially the change from Test 1 to Test 2.</p><p>Another interesting problem is why there is a lack of correlation between CRT and MMSE. It might be related to the fact that the CRT is a measure of time and time is not evaluated in MMSE at all. If so, then CRT is an additional measure of efficacy not present in MMSE or ADAS-Cog. CRT, as SWM did not show significant changes due to a first single dose of DPZ, which might be related to the fact that they are not very rapidly reactive to the cholinergic status of the brain. It may be supposed that the improvement in cholinergic neurotransmission is able to improve the functioning in other neurotransmitter systems or mechanisms; therefore, CRT and SWM results showed significant improvement after 4 months of treatment, while still not correlating with MMSE. In addition, it should be noted that SWM measures reflect different cognitive domains underrepresented in the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. Working memory and strategy use, which are reflected by SWM, are frontal functions, while MMSE and ADAS have no constituents representing working memory or frontal function. In the case of SWM, the lack of correlation with MMSE may be merely a consequence of the different cognitive domains assessed by SWM and MMSE.</p><p>The change in PRMd is not significant after a single dose, but showed significant improvement after 4 months [<xref rid="b46-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Again, this suggests that global improvement due to cholinergic treatment over longer periods of time is not associated with improvement in the cholinergic system alone, but may be related to a much wider systemic up-regulation of many brain systems, providing their own share in the overall improvement.</p><p>Our results suggest that for more comprehensive assessment of the global severity of dementia and for more accurate measurement of change in clinical trials, it would be desirable to use a computerized, reasonably short, but still comprehensive selection of psychometric tests as a mean for assessment of end-points. This may allow achieving more exact and reliable evaluation of the efficacy of an investigational drug.</p><p>This study has some limitations and may have some valuable and significant extensions. Only typical amnestic AD patients were included in the study. Significant vascular comorbidities and depression were eliminated by Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Recent evidence demonstrates that the severity of vascular factors correlates directly with the intensity of cognitive disturbances in AD [<xref rid="b47-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recent research in AD showed significant heterogeneity of AD itself [<xref rid="b48-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="b49-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This heterogeneity of AD is not reflected by the results of our study due to restrictive Inclusions/exclusion criteria. But in all pivotal large clinical trials for AD medications, Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are similarly strict. Homogeneity of typical AD and exclusion of comorbidities is beneficial for the confirmation of the efficacy of the investigational medication, but do not represent the situation in real clinical practice, in which many AD patients have significant vascular comorbidities, depression, and atypical variants of AD. Vascular dysfunction and insulin resistance associated with Type 2 diabetes may play a significant role in the pathogenic processes of Alzheimer disease [<xref rid="b50-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We did not investigate the neuroimaging indicators of progression in this study. Neuroimaging indicators may be able to significantly strengthen the predictive value of the cognitive and demographic predictors, as has been shown in the case of quantitative MRI with the measurement of diffusion and perfusion alterations [<xref rid="b51-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this study we did not use electrophysiological indicators of AD progression, such as P300 and N200 Event-related Evoked Potentials (ERPs), which are the indicators of neurobiological nature and may provide additional and independent information regarding AD progression in comparison with the cognitive markers, which are behavioral indicators by their very nature [<xref rid="b52-medscimonit-21-3887" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The cognitive changes produced by the first single DPZ dose in CANTAB PAL, PRM, and SWM test measures are able to predict the long-term efficacy of DPZ in AD. Baseline CANTAB PAL, PRM, and CRT test results were predictive.
