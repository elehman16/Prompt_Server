Re-methylation pathway is the most common pathway that recycles tHcy back to methionine and requires vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid as cofactors [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In physiological conditions, homeostasis is usually maintained between the formation and degradation of tHcy, the absence of which would result in hyperhomocysteinemia. [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Following McCully <italic>et al.</italic> in 1969, several epidemiological studies found that elevated plasma concentration of tHcy was an independent risk factor for thrombosis, cardiovascular disorders, and cerebrovascular disorders (CVD). [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Several studies during last decade had demonstrated that prolonged treatment with first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may potentially cause hyperhomocysteinemia due to depletion in serum folic acid. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] AEDs that induce cytochrome P450 isozymes, including carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), and oxcarbazepine (OXCZ), may cause a depletion of the cofactors necessary for the metabolism of tHcy. [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Metabolism of homocysteine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-5-93-g001"/></fig><p>The total tHcy level is the lowest in children and may vary with ethnic background. It increases with age and is higher in male sex. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In children, the cut-offs for tHcy level range from 8.3 to 11.3 &#x003bc;mol/l, and hyperhomocysteinemia is defined as tHcy &#x0003e;10.4 &#x003bc;mol/l, which corresponds to 95<sup>th</sup> centile of a large population group. [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The tendency toward lower folate and higher tHcy concentrations may put children on AEDs at special risk for atherosclerosis. [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Compared to adults, children taking valproic acid (VPA) suffer from folate depletion and hyperhomocysteinemia, which is an atherosclerotic risk factor. [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The factors of early childhood origin of adult cardiovascular risks are now known, which demand early intervention. In Asian Indian children who are genetically more exposed to CVD risks, AED therapy is an additional risk for future development of CVDs. Elevated tHcy levels due to AED use can alter the circulatory markers of vascular risk, such as common carotid artery intima thickness which is positively correlated with the duration of AED therapy. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Studies reported that in those on AEDs, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) due to cerebrovascular disease attributed to atherosclerosis was high. [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Children born to women taking AEDs during the first trimester of pregnancy have been shown to have higher chances of cardiovascular malformations with relative risk of 4 and neural tube defects with relative risk of 3. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The impacts of folic acid deficiency are more in childhood period when there is increased cell division. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The children on AED have to take it for long years, and tHcy elevation itself has got epileptogenic potential and can cause the risk of resistance to treatment leading to development of refractory epilepsy. [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The association of folate depletion and hyperhomocysteinemia with reduced cognitive performance in children was reported. [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Few studies reported that in patients on AEDs, increasing tHcy levels were negatively correlated with decreasing serum folic acid levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.003), and to normalize the tHcy levels, oral supplementation of folic acid was found to be effective. [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Considering the biological plausibility, many doctors are now prescribing folic acid to those undergoing treatment with AEDs, though there is a paucity of data from India. In this context, the present study was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to assess the level of tHcy in children taking AEDs and (2) to study whether daily oral supplementation of folic acid will reduce the tHcy level in them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Our study was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in the Pediatric Neurology Department of Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH) at Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Kerala.</p><p>The study subjects were the children belonging to the age-group of 5-12 years with a diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy, and attending the epilepsy clinic and undergoing AED therapy for more than 6 months. Institutional ethical committee approval was obtained before the study. The enrolment of subjects and randomization were done after taking written informed consents from the legal guardians/parents of the subjects, as well as assent from the children above 7 years of age.</p><p>Expecting a mean difference of tHcy value of 2 &#x003bc;mol/l and standard deviation (SD) of 0.2 at an &#x003b1;-error of 5%, power of 80, and a 2:1 ratio (<italic>r</italic>) between experimental and control groups, the minimum required sample size was 30:15. During the 2 months enrolment period, a total of 60 patients were recruited consecutively, of whom 8 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria and 4 patients whose parents were not willing to give informed consent were excluded. Thus, 48 patients were enrolled of whom 32 were assigned to the experimental group and 16 to the control group randomly in 2:1 ratio [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The random assignment scheme was created using a table of random numbers.

The baseline data were collected directly by the investigators using a pre-tested proforma from the informants (mothers in most cases).

[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The tHcy level exceeded the 90<sup>th</sup> age percentile in 13.8% Japanese and 40.4% of Spanish children taking AEDs. [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A prospective study reported that 5 &#x003bc;mol/l higher tHcy level was associated with a 27% higher risk for venous thrombosis. [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] A meta-analysis of 27 epidemiological studies estimated that a 5 &#x003bc;mol/l increase of tHcy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.6 for coronary artery disease in men and 1.8 in women, and the same increase was also strongly associated with increased cholesterol and peripheral vascular disease (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] An increase in tHcy concentration will promote overproduction of reactive oxygen, enhancement of platelet aggregation, inhibition of protein C, activation of nuclear factor-kB, and increase in the release of inflammatory mediators, all of which can create a prothrombotic environment. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] tHcy also affects peripheral arteries by influencing apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-dependent transport of cholesterol. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The mean ages of the groups were 7.5 years (experimental group) and 6.9 years (control group) and the age of the first episode of seizure was above 2 years. The duration of AED treatment was 3.3 (1.9) and 2.6 (1.6) years, respectively. As reported earlier, there was no positive correlation of age or duration of treatment with tHcy in our study, which may be due to the short duration of treatment in our subjects. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In both groups, majority were taking mono-drug therapy (60% and 80%, respectively), which is similar to the results of other studies. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The drugs used in both groups in descending order were VPA, CBZ, and PHT (63%, 26%, and 20% in the experimental group and 60%, 33%, and 7% in the control group, respectively), the proportion of which was similar [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. It was reported earlier that patients treated with CBZ and PHT had increased biomarkers of CVD risk factors like C-reactive proteins and cholesterolemia, and those on VPA had hyperhomocysteinemia. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In a study among adolescents, 12 months of CBZ or VPA treatment resulted in a significant increase of tHcy and decrease of folate. [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] VPA is a broad-spectrum AED that inhibits specific cytochrome P450 isozymes and is the most commonly administered drug in children, along with CBZ. Studies have shown that the use of VPA for treatment led to significant elevation in tHcy concentration and folate depletion compared to baseline data in children, which was not observed in adults. [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Although VPA has less enzyme-inducing activity than CBZ, it can still impair the intestinal absorption of dietary folic acid. A study done in pregnant Wistar rats has shown that VPA directly impaired the activity of methionine synthase &#x02013; the enzyme that re-methylates tHcy to methionine &#x02013; resulting in elevated tHcy. [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Since the majority of the subjects in our study use VPA and CBZ, this effect may be well reflected.</p><p>In our study, after folic acid administration for 30 days, the mean tHcy concentration in the experimental group was reduced from 11.90 (6.3) to 9.98 (4.7) &#x003bc;mol/l, which was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04), without any observable effect on anticonvulsive efficiency. In the control group, it increased from 13.02 (2.4) to 14.07 (4.2) &#x003bc;mol/l with placebo (nonsignificant). On comparison, contrary to the basal level of tHcy levels, the difference of post-tHcy levels in both groups was significantly different with higher value in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). The reduction of tHcy after folic acid supplementation in our study was 1.92 (2.2) &#x003bc;mol/l, which was lower than the earlier reported 5.2 (0.50) &#x003bc;mol/l possibly due to shorter duration of supplementation. [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In one study, oral supplementation of 0.5-5 mg folic acid daily reduced tHcy by 25% and the reduction was 32% when used in combination with cyanocobalamin. [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In our study, 16% of the subjects had reduction in tHcy levels.</p><p>A dosage of 1 mg/day folic acid is considered safe in children, [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in the National Program of Prophylaxis for Nutritional Anaemia in India, the daily dose for children is 1 mg. Since our study subjects are children from 5 to 12 years of age, we used 1 mg tablets. Since folate stores (5-10 mg) from the body would rapidly become depleted, folic acid supplementation must be given continuously; otherwise, tHcy values would reverse. [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A meta-analysis reported that in areas where the mean population level of folic acid was lower, the supplementation in AEDs may not be effective. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In countries were folic acid was given as nutritional supplements, the population tHcy value was found to be lower, which may be applicable to our subjects. [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Independent of its tHcy-lowering capacity, folic acid may improve endothelial function; the folate metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate appears to enhance endothelial nitric oxide synthesis in healthy adults. [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] It was reported that after oral supplementation with folic acid, flow-mediated vasodilatation was improved in children with type I diabetes. [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Therefore, the study suggests that the drug-induced risk for atherosclerosis and associated Non communicable disease NCD risks for children taking AEDs can be prevented by folic acid supplementation.</p><p>Formerly, folic acid was considered to be epileptogenic, but recent data disproved this assumption. [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] A published meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials observed that 30% reduction of tHcy concentrations occurred following daily intake of oral multivitamin preparations containing folic acid (0.5-5.0 mg) and cyanocobalamin (0.5 mg), without any adverse effects. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] As the safety and efficacy of folic acid in children has been proved, it can be given cost effectively for long term. Also, since the long-term AED therapy depletes the folate through induction of the hepatic enzymes, folate intake has been proposed to provide benefit in preventing cardiovascular events related to high levels of tHcy in pediatric patients with epilepsy. [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A daily oral nutritional supplement drink containing physiological amounts of folate significantly reduced plasma tHcy concentrations in older patients recovering from acute illness. [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Whether dietary supplementation with folate would prove to be equally effective in children undergoing treatment with AEDs is worth exploring.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The present study is limited by its short duration of 1 month. It could be improved by a crossover design. Due to resource constraints, we could not estimate the folate levels in subjects before or after treatment. For better evidence, an RCT with larger sample size and longer duration may be needed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Epilepsy is a medical condition that requires long-term therapy with AEDs, which may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia associated with metabolic consequences resulting in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CVD) and Cerebrovascular disorders.</p><p>Daily oral folic acid supplementation reduces tHcy level, thus reducing future CVD risks.
