It has been reported to affect six to 7 % of the adolescent population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and one in six adults who consult their GP with knee pain will be diagnosed with PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of major concern is that recent studies have shown that 40 to 62% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] of individuals with PFP, at one-year follow-up, report unfavourable outcomes following treatment according to current paradigms.</p><p id="Par31">One solution for improving PFP therapy, proposed by the international PFP community, is to establish subgroups of the wider PFP population, to allow targeted treatment, matched according to specific subgroup characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Currently, a multimodal treatment approach (a combination of individual treatments) is recommended as best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it is likely that people with PFP will benefit from being stratified and matched to specific interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite successive international consensus papers since 2011 recommending subgrouping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], very little literature has focused on subgrouping and targeted therapy. A small number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have targeted treatment based on single clinical features, although no definitive studies exist to support targeted interventions in PFP.</p><p id="Par32">Reduced hip muscle strength is considered an associated feature of PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A number of authors have reported promising clinical outcomes after prescribing hip strengthening exercises for people with PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been proposed that individuals with PFP present with a propensity towards increased hip adduction and internal rotation during dynamic movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is a significant predictor of pain in PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], thought to be linked to increasing patellofemoral joint contact stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Subsequently, correcting this altered movement pattern is often seen as a desired outcome in interventional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">There are however, conflicting findings around the mechanistic effect of hip strengthening in PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Some studies have demonstrated a post-interventional change in kinematics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], whilst others have reported no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The reason for these conflicting findings is unclear, however, the previous studies showing no kinematic change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] have included athletic cohorts and with one of the cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] clearly showing a higher than normal baseline strength. Selfe et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] recently classified people with PFP into three subgroups: &#x02018;strong&#x02019;&#x02009;, &#x02018;weak and tighter&#x02019; and &#x02018;weak and pronated foot&#x02019;. Notably, 22% were classified into the &#x02018;strong&#x02019; subgroup with higher knee extension and hip abduction strength that may not gain from a treatment approach based on strengthening. A strengthening intervention would likely have the greatest effect on the kinematics of those with baseline weakness.</p><p id="Par34">Large trials exploring a stratified approach for PFP are required, however, to ensure the success and effectiveness of such trials, a number of feasibility questions need to be answered. The primary purpose of this study was therefore to explore the feasibility of treatment matched to the specific clinical criteria of a selected subgroup compared to usual care (UC) management to inform a future stratified approach to PFP treatment. The a priori selection of a subgroup with a specific characteristic such as hip abductor weakness also provides the opportunity, as a secondary aim, to explore the mechanism of effect as this has also been recently advocated for trials of physical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par35">The study was a pragmatic, randomised controlled feasibility study in which participants were selected from an on-going longitudinal cohort study. Twenty-six participants were identified from larger group of 70 PFP cases on the basis of having hip abductor weakness at clinical examination and were randomised into receiving either a matched treatment (MT) or UC in a 1:1 ratio. Ethical approval was obtained prior to commencement of the study (14/NE/1131). All participants completed written informed consent prior to entering the study.

Participants were followed up to 8 weeks post-intervention as this has previously shown to be sufficient time to demonstrate an effect in PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par38">The random allocation sequence was made according to the output from a random number generator and concealed within pre-sealed, opaque envelopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

The biomechanical outcomes were acquired in accordance to a strict study protocol to minimise variation and bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, the biomechanical outputs are automated so the lack of blinding is less of an issue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par40">Participants randomised to the MT group were asked to attend six supervised sessions of approximately 30&#x000a0;min in duration once per week for 6 weeks at a local hospital. Each week they also performed two additional sessions on non-consecutive days independently at home, with the intervening days allowing adequate rest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Consideration was made to the recommended determinants of resistance exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] when developing the study intervention. The sessions were face to face, 1:1 sessions provided by the lead author (BD) a senior musculoskeletal physiotherapist with over 8 years of clinical experience. During these sessions, participants were given education and justification of the treatment followed by three exercises aimed at targeting coronal, sagittal and transverse strength of the hip using resistance bands. Each week at least one of the exercises would change with the aim of providing variation and minimising tedium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The supervision sessions served as a means of ensuring both treatment fidelity and tailoring. Fidelity was ensured by checking the exercise technique and making corrections to performance prior to these being performed independently at home. Subsequent visits ensured this instruction had been correctly applied or not. Tailoring the intervention based on progressive loading was in line with current recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Participants were issued yellow (least resistance), red or green (most resistance) resistance tubing (66fit Ltd. &#x02122;) and were allowed to take it home. To progress the load and resistance, a Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion scale (RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] was used based on the recommendations when using resistance band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A RPE of &#x0003e;6 was considered desirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and participants were monitored after a few repetitions to ensure this was what was being achieved. As participants were stratified for strength, the intervention required participants to perform 10 repetitions within three sets as recommended for strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Participants were advised to ensure the time under tension was 8 s (3 s concentric, 2 s isometric hold and 3 s eccentric contraction). Strengthening was performed on each leg alternatively providing a standardised rest between sets. Exercise diaries (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were issued to participants to provide a reminder of the exercises and to allow a measure of adherence. Participants were asked to document each time each exercise was performed on their diary sheet and return these at each visit.</p><p id="Par41">Participants randomised to the UC group continued with the same management of their condition as they were planning to receive prior to the commencement of the study.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par67">The aims of this study were: i) to determine the feasibility of treatment matched to the specific characteristics of selected PFP sub group and ii) to explore the proposed mechanism of effect of employing strengthening in a subgroup with baseline hip weakness. A definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) appears achievable in terms of adherence, attrition, eligibility and outcome data. Some consideration is required to develop strategies to enhance the ability to quantify clinical differences between groups. In terms of the potential mechanism of effect for hip strengthening, an improvement was shown for peak IR following MT.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Feasibility outcomes</title><p id="Par68">Based on our eligibility thresholds for selecting a &#x02018;weak&#x02019; hip group, we predetermined that for feasibility; eligibility should reach or exceed 32%. Our observed eligibility rate of 37% provides reassurance. It is also expected that other people with PFP, ineligible for the current study based on hip strength, may well classify into other subgroups as shown in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This eligibility rate for hip weakness is less than the 88% (at 1SD) reported by Selfe et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] but may be explained by the current study measuring an isokinetic contraction rather than an isometric contraction and as a consequence the different strength thresholds applied. Furthermore in order to minimise potential bias, future multicentre RCTs would need to ensure cross-site calibration of the isokinetic systems and site visits to monitor fidelity of the testing procedures and the intervention.</p><p id="Par69">Recent studies have reported that a greater adherence to treatment is associated with increased probability of better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An adherence to treatment and adherence to appointments over 90% is promising. Approximately 30% (4/13) achieved complete adherence to all treatment sessions and 9% of appointments required rearranging. Our adherence rate is comparable to a larger RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who found a 80.3% adherence rate for a 6 week hip strengthening in PFP. It&#x02019;s anticipated that rearranging appointments for participants would be more challenging for a larger sample over multiple sites. Consequently, strategies to enhance adherence with the use of activity monitoring technology and reminder services need to be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">No differences between groups were found for either the average or worst NRS values. This might be explained by the difference in almost a score of one in average baseline NRS, a feature that would likely be minimised in a larger full-scale trial. Previous RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] have also used eligibility criteria requiring a minimum NRS score of three out of 10 pain score. Setting a minimum pain score as part of the inclusion criteria is suggested for a future RCT.</p><p id="Par71">The difference between groups for the AKP score did not reach the predetermined minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of eight points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], although there was a trend towards a meaningful benefit. These findings are similar to the only other RCT to have stratified a PFP cohort, used in a study of a foot orthotic intervention over 6 weeks. Mills et al. (2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] selected their participants based on predictors shown to predict success with orthotics, which included age, height, baseline pain severity and a static foot measure. They also found a significant difference between groups in terms of GROC with no differences in AKP score or VAS pain. They suggest that GROC is able to capture the multidimensional nature of PFP (characterised by pain, disability and functional limitation) compared to AKP score and VAS pain which are more one dimensional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Mechanistic outcomes</title><p id="Par72">Stratifying for hip abductor weakness led to a reduction of approximately 13% for peak IR in the MT group following strengthening treatment. This is important considering that an increase peak IR has been associated with PFP during stair descent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This reduction in peak IR occurred with a slight worsening of their transverse ROM suggesting that following treatment, people in the MT group were initiating stance phase in a more desirable externally rotated hip position. A reduction in peak IR and a slight increase in peak ADD are perhaps surprising considering that participants were stratified for hip abductor weakness. However, recent strength measures conducted on 501 healthy athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] have shown that hip abductor and hip external rotation strength are highly correlated (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.66) indicating this subgroup were likely to have also demonstrated weakness into both hip abduction and external rotation.</p><p id="Par73">Hip strength increased in both groups by a similar difference, which is likely the result of over a third of participants in the UC group being engaged in physiotherapy. Post-hoc analysis of those participants in the UC group who received <italic>no treatment</italic> show an increase of only 3.9&#x000a0;Nm in hip abductor strength (results not shown). In the MT group the change in hip strength was 9%, which is a comparable improvement to previous hip strengthening programmes over a similar training duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The increase in strength for both groups but with only kinematic improvements seen in the MT group might suggest that strength, on its own, cannot explain the improvement seen in peak IR. Direct comparison with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] remains difficult due to the differences in assessment tasks (e.g. running, stairs etc.) and the specific kinematic outcomes (e.g. peak, average angles etc.) investigated. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] that have observed the effect of hip strengthening on running kinematics in people with PFP found no change in kinematics despite increases in hip abductor strength. Only Baldon et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported changes in kinematics, during a single leg squat, following a hip strengthening programme. Yet, this training programme, did include constant feedback on lower limb alignment which suggests a more movement retraining approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] rather than pure strength training. It remains possible that the improvements observed in peak IR in the current study was the result of using progressive loading within a tailored treatment regime and selecting participants who were most likely to benefit from strengthening.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par74">This feasibility study presents with several limitations. Firstly, the study was performed in a single centre. Future RCTs would be required to be multicentre to improve generalisability, which is anticipated to introduce new feasibility issues. The findings of the current study would, however, inform the documentation of standard operating procedures in terms of recruitment; data collection and intervention provision to ensure any future study could be operationalised across different geographical locations. Secondly, the current study did not blind assessors to group allocation, which could lead to potential bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Every effort was made for participants to complete PROMs in isolation and objective biomechanical outcomes were acquired in accordance with strict protocols with little chance of introducing bias. Future RCTs should make every effort to introduce outcome assessor blinding and consider measuring the level of this outcome assessor blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] Thirdly, the use of a UC group was intended to represent the heterogeneity of management available in real, daily practice and thus improve the external validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. For the purposes of exploring the mechanism of hip strengthening, however, the fact that over half of the UC group received physiotherapy input potentially dilutes the between-group findings. Comparison with a control group receiving no active intervention would remedy this issue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par75">The potential benefits associated with stratification and subgrouping within PFP have been advocated since the first International Patellofemoral Pain Retreat Consensus statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This study suggests that targeted treatment provides a greater improvement in overall function and self-reported improvement in comparison to usual care. Additionally, the improvements seen in peak IR following MT suggest this may be a plausible mechanism of effect for hip strengthening when treatment is matched to an appropriate subgroup. Strategies to enhance the ability to detect clinical difference should be considered and might be improved by selection of participants with a minimum pain score. Ultimately, a pragmatic, multicentre RCT with a sufficiently powered cohort appears achievable and should be conducted to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a stratified treatment approach versus usual care for people with PFP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
