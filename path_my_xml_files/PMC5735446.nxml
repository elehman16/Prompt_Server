There has been an upsurge of interest in recent times in newer agents and adjuncts which can be employed for epidural anesthesia that may offer quicker recovery and earlier ambulation along with fewer side effects.</p><p>Ropivacaine, a long-acting amide local anesthetic, is an optically active pure S-enantiomer of propivocaine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Numerous comparative studies between ropivacaine and bupivacaine suggested that ropivacaine produces less cardiac as well as central nervous system toxic effects and lesser motor block.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This favorable clinical profile prompted many clinicians to switch from bupivacaine to ropivacaine for the neural blockade. Ropivacaine's latency of sensory analgesia is approximately two-thirds that of bupivacaine; therefore, it was not effective in prolongation of postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine, a &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic agonist, acts on inhibitory &#x003b1;-2 adrenergic receptors to reduce central neural transmission in the spinal neurons.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Its analgesic potency has been described as being comparable to epidural-administered morphine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The coadministration of clonidine and local anesthetic produces better analgesia than either drug alone.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There is only a few literature available comparing addition of clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine; hence, there is a need to fill this void based on empirical evidence. Thus, the present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of epidural clonidine as an adjuvant with ropivacaine compared to ropivacaine alone in patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objective</title><p>

</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Methods</title><p>All patients were kept nil per oral for at least 6 h, premedicated with oral ranitidine 150 mg, alprazolam 0.25 mg, and metoclopramide 10 mg the night before surgery. Intravenous line secured, Ringer's lactate solution (10 ml/kg) was infused for 15 min before the initiation of the procedure. Noninvasive monitors connected and baseline values of heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded before the procedure. Electrocardiogram monitoring was enabled.</p><p>Before the commencement of anesthesia, patients were instructed on the methods of sensory or motor assessments. After proper positioning under strict aseptic precaution, L3-L4 epidural space was identified. Local infiltration was done using 2 ml of 2%xylocaine at the puncture site. 18 Gauze Tuohy's needle was inserted and epidural space was confirmed by loss of resistance method. Group I and II patients received the epidural anesthetics as they have been scheduled. The patient and observing anesthesiologist were blinded to the drug group. After establishing adequate sensory and motor blockade, surgeons were asked to proceed with the surgery.</p><p>The baseline value of vital signs (blood pressure BP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>) was recorded before performing the procedure and once in every 5 min inside the operation theater, then after every 15 min in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit till the recovery of sensory and motor function. Sensory block was assessed by pinprick sensation using a hypodermic needle. Motor function was assessed by modified Bromage scale. Bromage scale for the lower extremities consists of the following four scores (0 = no motor block, 1 = unable to raised extended legs, 2 = unable to flex knees, 3 = unable to flex ankle joint). Postoperative pain was assessed using visual analog scale.</p><p>The duration of sensory or motor blockade was defined as the interval from intrathecal administration to the point of complete resolution of the sensory block or to the point in which the Bromage score was back to zero, respectively. The measurements were obtained at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, and after 4 h intervals following the block. Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and shivering were also documented and managed symptomatically.</p><p>The statistical analysis was done using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) Version 15.0.

It also exerts a vasoconstricting effect on smooth muscles, which results in a decreased absorption of the local anesthetic drug and eventually prolongs the duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Keeping this pharmacological interactions in mind, we have tried to use clonidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in lower limb orthopedic surgeries.</p><p>Clonidine has a potent regressive effect on HR within 15&#x02013;90 min of epidural administration, that is why, in the present study, a significantly lower mean HR in RC group as compared to R alone was observed between 15 and 30 min intervals. The results in the present study were similar to those observed by Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who showed similar variations in HR but at different time intervals. In their study, significant differences in mean HR between two groups were observed from 20 min of administration and continued till 120 min. In the present study, such difference was observed at 15 min interval only. For the remaining part of our study, the results were similar to those obtained by Laha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who observed no significant difference in HR between ropivacaine alone and ropivacaine with clonidine.</p><p>Clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow resulting in lower blood pressure. Addition of clonidine either as a fixed dose or as an infusion has been shown to have a lowering effect on arterial pressure as observed in the present study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Despite reduction in mean blood pressure levels, no event of hypotension was noticed in any group thus highlighting that the given dosage of clonidine did not reduce the arterial pressure substantially. Moreover, there are limited reports suggestive of hypotensive effect of clonidine when used as an epidural adjuvant.</p><p>With respect to onset of motor and sensory block, both the blocks were achieved earlier in ropivacaine with clonidine (RC) group as compared to ropivacaine alone (R). Similarly, regression of sensory and motor blockade was longer in RC Group compared to R group. The results are in agreement with the study of Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Gecaj-Gashi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who observed that addition of clonidine reduces the onset time for blocks and enhances the duration of block when added to ropivacaine.</p><p>Duration of analgesia was better in Group II (RC) as compared to Group I (R). Coadministration of clonidine with local anesthetic has been documented to have better analgesia than either drug alone[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and observations in the present study support the same. Adding clonidine as an adjuvant in the epidural space has an additive effect, which results in a lower dose of narcotic necessary for optimal pain control.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The present study did not have any severe side effect. Dry mouth and nausea/vomiting were the most common side effects observed in all the three groups. None of the patient had respiratory depression. Although side effects were minimum in ropivacaine alone group yet except for sedation, no significant intergroup difference was observed. The sedative effect of clonidine has been discussed in solitary use as well as when used as adjuvant.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The findings in the present study show that ropivacaine in combination with clonidine provides a hemodynamically stable, faster, and prolonged epidural block and a longer analgesic effect as compared to ropivacaine alone.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McConachie</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>McGeachie</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Barrie</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Regional anaesthetic techniques</article-title><source>Wylie and Churchill Davidson's &#x02013; A Practice of Anesthesia</source><year>2003</year><volume>37</volume><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Arnold</publisher-name><fpage>599</fpage><lpage>612</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Checketts</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Analgesia for primary hip and knee arthroplasty: The role of regional anaesthesia</article-title><source>Contin Educ Anaesth Crit Care Pain</source><year>2008</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>56</fpage><lpage>61</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Visser</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidural anesthesia</article-title><source>Update Anesthesiol</source><year>2009</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>13</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Casati</surname></name><name><surname>Fanelli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Aldegheri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Berti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Colnaghi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Cedrati</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Torri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interscalene brachial plexus anaesthesia with 0.5%, 0.75% or 1% ropivacaine: a double-blind comparison with 2% mepivacaine</article-title><source>Br JAnaesth</source><year>1999</year><volume>83</volume><fpage>872</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10700785</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fanelli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Casati</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Garancini</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Torri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nerve stimulator and multiple injection technique for upper and lower limb blockade: Failure rate, patient acceptance, and neurologic complications.
