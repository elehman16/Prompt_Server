The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were median percent reduction in weekly POS frequency and responder rate (proportion of patients with &#x02265;50% reduction in seizure frequency). Seizure freedom was also assessed. Safety (adverse events, clinical and laboratory findings), as well as treatment effects on quality of life (QOLIE-31-P) and clinical global impression of change (CGI-C), were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Across the entire 11-week treatment phase, USL255 significantly reduced the median percent seizure frequency and significantly improved responder rate compared with placebo. Efficacy over placebo was observed early in treatment, in patients with highly refractory POS, and in those with the most debilitating seizure types (i.e., complex partial, partial secondarily generalized). USL255 was safe and generally well tolerated with a low incidence of neurocognitive adverse events.

Compared with immediate-release (IR) antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), extended-release (XR) formulations reduce fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations, which may mitigate adverse events (AEs) caused by peak-dose toxicity or alleviate breakthrough seizures that can occur at trough concentrations.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Immediate-release topiramate (TPM-IR) is a broad-spectrum, well-established AED with multiple mechanisms of action.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> TPM-IR is approved in many countries as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures (POS) or primary generalized tonic&#x02013;clonic (PGTC) seizures in adults and children. The maintenance TPM-IR dosage of 200&#x02013;400 mg/day is administered as a divided dose. USL255, Qudexy XR (topiramate) extended-release capsules (Upsher-Smith, Maple Grove, MN, U.S.A.), is a proprietary once-daily XR topiramate formulation that was developed using a coated-bead technology to deliver consistent drug release over a 24 h dosing interval.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> USL255 provides plasma topiramate exposure equivalent to TPM-IR with a significantly lower maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and higher minimum concentration (C<sub>min</sub>), leading to decreased fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In addition, USL255 maintains the therapeutic minimum topiramate concentrations achieved by TPM-IR following a formulation switch.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> USL255 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 11 March 2014) as initial monotherapy in patients &#x02265;10 years of age with POS or PGTC seizures and adjunctive therapy in patients &#x02265;2 years of age with POS, PGTC, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Presented here are the efficacy, safety, and tolerability results from the global phase III PREVAIL study of once-daily USL255 for the adjunctive treatment of refractory POS.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial conduct</title><p>PREVAIL was conducted between May 2010 and December 2012 at 66 centers in 16 countries (Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, and the United States). This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6, Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements. Institutional review boards and ethics committees supervised and safeguarded the rights, safety, and well-being of all study participants. Prior to randomization, all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>Adults (18&#x02013;75 years) diagnosed with refractory POS, with or without secondary generalization, for &#x02265;1 year based on the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> were eligible. They must have had &#x02264;21 consecutive seizure-free days and &#x02265;8 POS during the 8-week baseline period. Only seizures classified as simple partial with motor signs, complex partial, or partial with secondary generalization qualified patients to meet inclusion criteria; however, patients could have &#x0003e;1 seizure type. To ensure that seizures were classified correctly at study centers, a seizure-training and review program developed by The Epilepsy Study Consortium was utilized.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Investigators/study center coordinators were trained using a seizure identification video and required to pass an interactive quiz. Each site submitted a Seizure Identification Form (SIF) for all patients, which included patient and/or caregiver seizure descriptions and the investigator's classification(s) of seizure(s). SIFs were reviewed independently by The Epilepsy Study Consortium immediately after the screening visit and approved prior to patient randomization; misclassifications were communicated to the study team to allow for investigator/coordinator retraining, and correction of seizure classification prior to the first dose of study medication.</p><p>Patients must have been on a stable dosing regimen of one to three AEDs for &#x02265;4 weeks (or &#x02265;12 weeks for phenobarbital and primidone) prior to visit 1 (screening). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was considered an AED and must have been in place for &#x02265;6 months and on a stable setting for &#x02265;1 month prior to visit 1. Benzodiazepine use was not allowed during the trial, except in the event of seizure emergency. Benzodiazepines taken more than once per week for any indication, or taken as rescue medication for a prolonged convulsive seizure, were counted as an AED.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included any predisposing condition or medication that might interfere with the absorption of USL255 (e.g., Crohn's disease, ileostomy, short bowel syndrome), psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, status epilepticus, or seizure episodes lasting &#x0003c;30 min (in which several seizures occurred with such frequency that the initiation and completion of each individual seizure could not be distinguished), within 3 months prior to visit 1, a history of metabolic acidosis, nephrolithiasis, ureterolithiasis, or narrow angle glaucoma, or a history of suicidal attempts, suicidal ideation, or uncontrolled psychiatric illness within 2 years of visit 1. In addition, patients currently or formerly taking felbamate (within 18 months) or vigabatrin were excluded, as were patients who had taken topiramate within 6 months, had a history of lack of efficacy to topiramate for epilepsy despite adequate exposure (200 mg/day), or had a history of safety or tolerability issues with topiramate not related to dosage titration.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>PREVAIL was a phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study consisting of baseline (8 weeks), titration (3 weeks), and maintenance (8 weeks) phases. The 11-week treatment phase (titration + maintenance) was followed by downtitration or entry into a 1-year open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT01191086).</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to once-daily USL255 or matching placebo. Randomization by an independent statistician was generated using permuted blocks with a block size of 4 without stratification (SAS 9.1.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.). The interactive voice response group programmed the randomization schedule for investigators to dispense study drug. Treatment remained blinded throughout the study. Titration occurred in 50 mg/week increments to maintenance dosage of 200 mg/day. Patients were discontinued if they were unable to tolerate any dosage of USL255. At the end of maintenance, patients not entering the OLE were downtitrated by 50 mg/week for 3 weeks. Dosing of study medication was permitted any time during the day, as long as dosing remained consistent throughout the study. VNS settings and concomitant AED dosing were to remain unchanged throughout the course of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was median percent reduction from baseline in weekly POS frequency during the double-blind phase. The key secondary endpoint was responder rate (proportion of patients with &#x02265;50% reduction from baseline in weekly POS frequency). A priori analyses of these endpoints by study phase (titration vs. maintenance) were also performed, as well as post hoc analyses evaluating the first and last 4 weeks of the maintenance phase. Additional post hoc analyses included efficacy by seizure type (seizure-type groups were not mutually exclusive), number of concomitant AEDs during the trial (1, 2, &#x02265;3 AEDs), and trial week. Seizure freedom (exploratory endpoint) was determined by evaluating the proportion of patients with 100% reduction in seizure frequency during treatment (titration plus maintenance) and during maintenance alone, as well as by post hoc evaluation of the number of patients demonstrating &#x02265;21 days with no seizures prior to the last dose of study drug. Clinical-status assessments included the clinician-reported Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and the patient-reported Quality of Life in Epilepsy&#x02013;Problems (QOLIE-31-P) survey. A post hoc analysis of the number of patients at end of maintenance with CGI-C scores corresponding to improvement (scores of 1 [very much improved], or 2 [much improved]) was performed.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluating treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical and neurologic examinations, and 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). TEAEs were analyzed over the treatment period (a priori) and by study phase (post hoc; titration, maintenance, first 4 weeks and last 4 weeks of maintenance). Suicidality was monitored using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Treatment adherence, defined as the ratio of number of doses taken to the number of doses that should have been taken based on duration of treatment (days), was calculated based on the number of unused capsules returned at each visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To detect an 18% treatment difference with 91% power using Wilcoxon rank-sum test (WRST), a sample size of 118 patients/treatment arm was estimated.</p><p>Safety and tolerability analyses were performed using all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug. Efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study drug and had &#x02265;1 evaluable postrandomization diary entry). For the primary efficacy endpoint, WRST was used to evaluate the effects of treatment as nonnormal distribution of data was expected. The treatment difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using asymptotic Hodges-Lehmann methods. Differences between treatment groups in the key secondary endpoint were assessed using the Fisher's exact test. The treatment difference and 95% CI for the responder rate were calculated using exact unconditional method. Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoint were evaluated using WRST and Fisher's exact test, respectively. For the post hoc by-week analysis of the primary efficacy outcome, seizure rates were calculated during each consecutive 7-day interval within the titration and maintenance phases, and USL255 and placebo-treated patients were compared using the WRST. Differences between treatment groups in the number of patients achieving 100% reduction in seizure frequency were assessed using Fisher's exact test for the treatment phase (titration plus maintenance) and for the maintenance phase alone. Percentages of patients who were seizure-free for &#x02265;21 days prior to the last dose of study drug were estimated using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, with differences between treatment groups assessed using the log-rank test.</p><p>Changes from baseline to the end of maintenance phase in QOLIE-31-P survey (each domain and overall) were evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model controlling for geographic region with the baseline score as a covariate. Treatment effect on the CGI-C score was assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model, where the CGI-C score was the response variable and treatment and geographic region were fixed effects. For the post hoc analysis of CGI-C scores corresponding to improvement, treatment groups were compared with the Fisher's exact test.</p><p>For safety/tolerability assessments, TEAEs were summarized by frequency, treatment relatedness, and maximum severity, as well as by study phase (titration vs. maintenance); changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG studies were summarized. Normal-range shift tables of laboratory data were generated using the Bowker test of symmetry.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Change from baseline to the last postbaseline weight measurement was summarized by treatment group, and the difference in the change from baseline in weight was analyzed using ANCOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline demographics, patient disposition, and medication adherence</title><p>All 249 randomized patients were included in the safety and ITT populations (n = 124 USL255; n = 125 placebo).

As an adjunctive treatment, USL255 reduced weekly median seizure frequency by approximately 40% during the 11-week treatment (titration and maintenance phases), with more than one third of patients demonstrating a &#x02265;50% reduction in seizure frequency. Trends of improved seizure control with USL255 were observed for all seizure types assessed, and were significant for the most disabling and potentially harmful seizure types (complex partial seizures and partial seizures with secondary generalization). Of note, the rate of seizure misclassification in PREVAIL (&#x0003c;4%) was lower than rates previously reported by The Epilepsy Study Consortium for other AED trials in patients with POS (14% and 10%).<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>USL255 was efficacious even in patients receiving &#x02265;3 concomitant AEDs, and about twice the number of USL255-treated patients achieved 100% seizure freedom during treatment compared to placebo, although the rate was low (3.2% [4/124] vs. 1.6% [2/125]). The rate of seizure freedom observed in other AED trials ranges from approximately 1&#x02013;20% for treatment versus 0&#x02013;5% for placebo.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The proportion of USL255-treated patients who were seizure-free for &#x02265;21 days prior to the last dose of study drug was significantly higher than placebo.</p><p>Although people with epilepsy usually report a lower QoL than the general population,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> meaningful changes/improvements in QoL can occur with appropriate treatment, and improved QoL has been recognized as a component of the management of patients with epilepsy.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Following treatment, QOLIE-31-P scores indicated that USL255 significantly reduced the effect of seizure worry and did not cause significant unwanted physical or mental medication side effects. Although overall QOLIE-31 scores were not significantly different from placebo, the duration of treatment during PREVAIL was relatively short, which may have precluded detection of differences in quality of life. In addition, significant improvements were observed by the investigators as measured by the CGI-C scale.</p><p>All AEDs can produce adverse effects, most notably AEs related to the CNS, which can be additive or synergistic with polytherapy.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In the PREVAIL study, USL255 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile when used in combination with other AEDs, although the proportion of patients reporting a new TEAE was greatest in those taking &#x02265;3 AEDs, as would be expected. Consistent with a favorable safety profile, the most common AEs associated with either USL255 or placebo in this study (somnolence and dizziness) were each reported by &#x0003c;15% of patients. This is of particular interest as other AEDs have reported dose-dependent incidence from 15% to 50% for one or both of these CNS-related TEAEs; however, differences in design and dosing complicate direct comparisons between trials.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Rapid titration and higher initial dose of topiramate are associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related AEs,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and individual neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric AEs have been observed in up to 20% of patients with 200 mg topiramate using rapid titration.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Slower titration of topiramate improved the cognitive AE profile, with the only cognitive AE reported in &#x02265;5% of patients being concentration/attention difficulty (5% topiramate, 0% placebo).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In PREVAIL, which used a similar slow titration, the proportion of USL255-treated patients who experienced individual neurocognitive or neuropsychiatric AEs was &#x0003c;2.5%. The low rate of these AEs in the PREVAIL study may be due to the more uniform release of topiramate with USL255 as well as slow titration, but specific cognitive testing would be needed to fully address the potential difference between topiramate formulations.</p><p>The limitations of the PREVAIL study included fixed-dose treatment and a treatment population restricted to patients with highly treatment-resistant POS. In practice, AEDs are titrated for each patient to maximize efficacy and tolerability of the drug. The single dose used in the study is the lowest topiramate maintenance dosage approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures (200 mg/day). Treatment with USL255 resulted in efficacy outcomes comparable to TPM-IR 200 mg/day<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and other newly approved AEDs, such as perampanel,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> lacosamide,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and ezogabine.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Of interest, USL255 50 mg/day demonstrated an almost 30% reduction in seizure frequency during the first week of the titration phase, suggesting that antiseizure effects may occur early in treatment. As significant antiseizure effects were achieved with USL255 &#x0003c;200 mg/day, consistent with other observations of low-dose topiramate efficacy,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> it is possible that some patients may be effectively treated with doses lower than the maintenance dose studied here, thereby further reducing the potential for TEAEs.</p><p>USL255, once-daily XR topiramate, was designed to provide a simple dosing regimen and limited fluctuations in plasma concentrations, with the goal of achieving seizure control and improved adherence. Medication nonadherence contributes to undesirable social and clinical consequences (e.g., increased rates of hospitalization, emergency department visits, vehicle injuries, and death<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Similar to other chronic conditions, adherence rates in epilepsy have been shown to be higher among patients on once-daily treatment regimens.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Acknowledging that measurement of adherence in short-duration studies is not ideal and the accuracy of the method used in this study (return of unused capsules) is limited,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the high rate of adherence observed in PREVAIL suggests that treatment with once-daily USL255 may have a positive impact on adherence, although comparative study of immediate-release topiramate versus USL255 would be required to address this question.</p><p>The PREVAIL phase III clinical study demonstrated that, compared with placebo, USL255 can significantly reduce weekly seizure frequency, even in patients with debilitating seizure types. USL255 was generally well tolerated, with a favorable safety profile and a low incidence of neurocognitive side effects. These results, combined with convenient once-daily dosing, support the role of USL255 as a valuable treatment option for the management of epilepsy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01142193.
