<italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the primary cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide. In 2003, an estimated 536 million people aged 15&#x02013;49 years were living with the infection, with seroprevalence varying widely across settings and populations.<xref rid="pone.0091513-Looker1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> Most infected individuals are unaware of their infections.<xref rid="pone.0091513-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> In symptomatic infections, the virus causes painful ulcerative lesions that can take two to four weeks to heal in primary outbreaks, and recurrences can be frequent. The prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the general population ranges from 10 to 60 percent, with higher prevalences in female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), and certain regions of the world. <xref rid="pone.0091513-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected populations, the estimated seroprevalence of HSV-2 is 60&#x02013;95 percent, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and individuals coinfected with HIV have increased susceptibility to HSV-2 shedding and clinical manifestations of HSV-2 disease. <xref rid="pone.0091513-PazBailey1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Observational studies have found a two-to-three-fold higher risk of HIV acquisition among individuals with HSV-2 infection, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Wald1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> although randomized trials of HSV-2 treatment have not reduced HIV acquisition or transmission <xref rid="pone.0091513-Celum1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Celum2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to protecting against HIV acquisition, antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using tenofovir has been shown to have a protective effect on HSV-2 in women.

Using data from the randomized iPrEx study, our primary aim was to determine the effect of daily oral FTC/TDF on HSV-2 seroincidence; secondarily, we examined the effect of FTC/TDF on ulcer occurrence.

Participants were randomized to receive either daily oral FTC/TDF or placebo. Monthly visits included medical history and symptom-directed physical examination, adverse event (AE) assessment, study drug dispensation, HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, and adherence assessment. Serologic testing for HSV-2 and physical examinations for signs of sexually transmitted infections (STI) were performed by clinicians at screening (baseline), every six months during follow-up, and when the study drug was suspended, or when prompted by symptoms reported during the monthly medical examination. HIV infection status was determined using two rapid antibody tests and confirmed by Western blot or RNA testing. Sexual practices during the previous three months were assessed by interviewer-administered questionnaires at screening and quarterly visits during follow-up. The primary analysis of iPrEx data included visits through the pre-specified cutoff date of May 1, 2010, while the current analyses include follow-up visits through September 30, 2010, the last visit at which participants would have been expected to have had exposure to study drug.</p><p>HSV-2 infection status was determined using ELISA (HerpeSelect, Focus Diagnostics). A negative HSV-2 test was defined as having an index ratio (i.e., the ratio of the optical density of the color generated by the sample to the optical density of a standard calibrator; IR) &#x0003c;0.9, while a positive HSV-2 test was defined as having an IR &#x02265;3.5. <xref rid="pone.0091513-LeGoff1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Tests with an IR &#x02265;0.9 and &#x0003c;3.5 were classified as indeterminate; participants with an IR &#x0003c;3.5 were retested at the next testing time point. The date of HSV-2 seroconversion was the date of the first positive HSV-2 test. Perianal and groin ulcers were recorded if there was any ulcerative lesion identified during STI examination, which may have included ulcers associated with herpes, syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, or excoriation. Ulcer AEs were identified by a clinician as an increase in ulcer severity or frequency from baseline, including new onset of ulcers in individuals without preexisting ulcer disease; severity was defined according to the infection criteria in the National Institutes of Health Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, December 2004. Only clinical AEs that were Grade 2 or above were reported in iPrEx, per protocol; thus, Grade 1 ulcers were not reported as ulcer AEs. Ulcer AEs were identified during STI examination, or were self-reported by participants and not confirmed on clinical examination if symptoms resolved before the examination visit. Additionally, ulcers that were self-reported but confirmed to be a different clinical manifestation during examination were not classified as ulcers or included in this analysis. In a subset of participants assigned to the active arm, levels of FTC and tenofovir were measured in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Participants with drug level tests were 1) in the DEXA substudy, which evaluated the impact of FTC/TDF on bone and body composition at seven sites in Peru, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States; and/or 2) matched active-arm controls in the case-control substudy of HIV seroconverters (from nine iPrEx sites with active-arm seroconversions). Approximately one-third of the cohort had at least one drug level test.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For HSV-2 prevalence analyses, the dependent variable was HSV-2 status at the screening visit, and independent variables were randomization group and other baseline characteristics, including age, level of education, transgender identity, number of alcoholic drinks on days when drinking in the past month, and sexual behaviors in the past three months. Sexual behavior variables were number of anal sex partners, any receptive anal intercourse with a condom (cRAI), any receptive anal intercourse with no condom (ncRAI), any insertive anal intercourse with a condom (cIAI), and any insertive anal intercourse with no condom (ncIAI). We used chi-square tests and log-binomial models to identify factors associated with HSV-2 prevalence at baseline. We also examined the association of age with HSV-2 prevalence and HSV-2 seroincidence using chi-square tests for trend.</p><p>For HSV-2 seroincidence analyses, the dependent variable was time to HSV-2 seroconversion during follow-up, and independent variables were randomization group and the demographic and behavioral variables examined in HSV-2 prevalence analyses. We calculated crude rates of HSV-2 seroincidence by randomization group and baseline demographic and behavioral characteristics, including only participants who tested seronegative for HSV-2 at the screening visit. Person-time at risk included time from study enrollment to the first of HSV-2 infection, study drug discontinuation, or loss to follow-up. We estimated the time-to-event distribution by randomization group using Kaplan-Meier methodology. We used Cox regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for time to HSV-2 seroincidence. An intent-to-treat analysis included only randomization group; to identify factors associated with time to HSV-2 seroincidence, a multivariable model additionally included demographic and behavioral variables that were statistically significant at the <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 level in unadjusted analyses. Sexual behavior variables were time-updated in models at approximately three-month intervals, while other covariates were treated as fixed. All models were stratified by study site.</p><p>Among the same participants, we also conducted an as-treated analysis that accounted for study drug use among participants receiving FTC/TDF. Because drug level testing was only conducted in a subset of participants and visits, drug levels were imputed for participants in both arms at any monthly visit missing drug level data using chained equations and predictive means matching. Predictors in the imputations included study week, study site, baseline number of sexual partners, baseline ncRAI, transgender identity, body mass index, weight, report of an STI in the six months before screening, secondary education, circumcision, baseline HSV-2 infection, age, and number of drinks on days when the participant drank in the prior month. Covariates were used to predict the probability of having detectable drug and the probability that the level of tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in PBMCs was &#x0003e;16 fmol per million viable cells, the concentration associated with an estimated 90% reduction in HIV acquisition. <xref rid="pone.0091513-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Drug levels were multiply imputed <xref rid="pone.0091513-Rubin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> for visits at which drug level testing was not conducted but the participant was still taking study drug, with 200 imputations per observation. <xref rid="pone.0091513-White1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> We then used site-stratified Cox regression to estimate HRs for HSV-2 seroincidence associated with being randomized to the FTC/TDF arm and having detectable drug with TFV-DP &#x02264;16 or being randomized to the FTC/TDF arm and having detectable drug with TFV-DP &#x0003e;16. Unadjusted models included only a time-dependent covariate for drug detection, while adjusted models also included age, level of education, transgender identity, number of alcoholic drinks on days when drinking in the past month, and sexual behaviors in the past three months (number of anal sex partners, cRAI, ncRAI, cIAI, and ncIAI). Sexual behavior variables were time-updated at approximately three-month intervals.</p><p>To examine the effect of FTC/TDF on HSV-2 disease expression, we analyzed the occurrence of ulcers among those who tested seropositive for HSV-2 at baseline or during follow-up. To eliminate the potential effect of HIV infection on ulcer occurrence, participants were excluded if the HSV-2 diagnosis occurred at or after HIV seroconversion, and ulcers were excluded if they occurred at or after HIV seroconversion. We estimated the proportion of participants with &#x02265;1 ulcer AE classified as Grade 2 or above (i.e., moderate, severe, or potentially life-threatening), &#x02265;1 STI examination during which a perianal ulcer was detected, and &#x02265;1 STI examination during which a groin ulcer was detected, using chi-square tests to compare proportions by randomization group. We assessed the proportion of visits at which symptoms were reported that prompted an STI examination, using a chi-square test for comparison by randomization group. We also examined ulcers occurring after HIV seroconversion to determine whether there were differences in ulcer occurrence by randomization group in the absence of study drug.</p><p>All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.3 or Stata 12.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study participants</title><p>Characteristics of the 2,499 iPrEx participants have been described previously. <xref rid="pone.0091513-Grant1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> Briefly, all participants were born male and 313 (13.0%) identified as transgender or as women.

In contrast to the 51% reduction in HSV-2 incidence among women randomized to use a 1% tenofovir topical gel in CAPRISA 004, <xref rid="pone.0091513-AbdoolKarim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> our results suggest that tenofovir in daily oral FTC/TDF may reduce the occurrence of ulcers in individuals with HSV-2 infection but does not protect against HSV-2 incidence among MSM.</p><p>The difference between the effects on HSV-2 incidence seen in CAPRISA and iPrEx may be due to differences in the route of transmission, method of drug delivery, or level of drug exposure. We found that the primary risk factor for incident HSV-2 infection in iPrEx was receptive anal intercourse without a condom, a finding that has been reported in several studies of behavioral risk factors for HSV-2 acquisition in MSM. <xref rid="pone.0091513-vandeLaar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Lupi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Okuku1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> The rectal mucosa and cervicovaginal mucosa may differ in their susceptibility to HSV-2 infection.

</p><p>We found that FTC/TDF was associated with a reduction in moderate or severe ulcer AEs among participants with HSV-2 infection, although this was not confirmed by clinical examination findings. Given the inhibition of HSV-2 replication observed after administration of tenofovir, it is biologically plausible that FTC/TDF reduced the frequency or severity of ulcers. Unlike acyclovir, tenofovir does not require the presence of the herpes virus for drug activation, suggesting that it may suppress ulcers before phosphorylation occurs. However, topical dosing may be required to achieve a concentration of drug in tissue sufficient to inhibit HSV-2 shedding, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Andrei1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and a study of adults coinfected with HIV and HSV-2 found no impact of oral tenofovir on rates of HSV-2 shedding. <xref rid="pone.0091513-Tan2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> More information is needed about the impact of oral and topical tenofovir on the clinical expression of HSV-2 infection.</p><p>There are several limitations of our analysis. First, although our intent-to-treat incidence analysis by treatment arm was strengthened by randomization, our findings may have been diluted by low levels of adherence among participants. While drug levels were not available for all participants or visits, we were able to conduct an incidence analysis that accounted for drug exposure but was subject to the limitations of multiple imputation of a substantial amount of missing data, potential unmeasured confounding, and wide confidence intervals. Of participants with prevalent or incident HSV-2, a small proportion were prescribed acyclovir or valacyclovir during study follow-up; if use of these medications biased our analysis toward the null, it is possible that the effect of FTC/TDF on ulcers is stronger than what we observed in our study. Our behavioral risk factor analysis included number of anal sex partners, position during anal sex, and condom use in the last three months, but we did not include oral sex as a potential risk factor for HSV-2 seroincidence; however, because HSV-2 is infrequently transmitted through oral sex, we expect this had a negligible effect on our analysis. There may have been some misclassification of HSV-2 results, particularly among participants with HSV-1 antibody, <xref rid="pone.0091513-Golden1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> but there is no expectation that this would differ by randomization arm. Some ulcer AEs were identified by self-report, which may be subject to inaccuracy or low sensitivity for HSV-2 recurrences, and we were not able to use HSV PCR to confirm that ulcers were herpetic. Finally, AEs only captured ulcers that increased in severity or frequency; thus, the reduction in ulcers associated with FTC/TDF may have been greater than what we observed.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the effect of daily oral FTC/TDF PrEP on HSV-2 incidence and ulcer occurrence among MSM. In our study, oral FTC/TDF did not reduce the acquisition of HSV-2 infection. Although we found that FTC/TDF was associated with a reduction in ulcer AE occurrence, this finding was not confirmed by ulcers identified on clinical examination and should be replicated in settings where ulcer etiology can be confirmed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants for their dedication to HIV prevention and the study, as well as the site investigators and their staff for following the cohort and collecting the data.
