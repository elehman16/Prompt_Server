In the current study, the authors aimed to assess the impact of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on health anxiety by comparing the impact of MBCT in addition to usual services (unrestricted services) with unrestricted services (US) alone. <bold>Method:</bold> The 74 participants were randomized to either MBCT in addition to US (<italic>n</italic> = 36) or US alone (<italic>n</italic> = 38). Participants were assessed prior to intervention (MBCT or US), immediately following the intervention, and 1 year postintervention. In addition to independent assessments of diagnostic status, standardized self-report measures and assessor ratings of severity and distress associated with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis were used. <bold>Results:</bold> In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (<italic>N</italic> = 74), MBCT participants had significantly lower health anxiety than US participants, both immediately following the intervention (Cohen's <italic>d</italic> = 0.48) and at 1-year follow-up (<italic>d</italic> = 0.48). The per-protocol (PP) analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 68) between groups effect size was <italic>d</italic> = 0.49 at postintervention and <italic>d</italic> = 0.62 at 1-year follow-up. Mediational analysis showed that change in mindfulness mediated the group changes in health anxiety symptoms. Significantly fewer participants allocated to MBCT than to US met criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, both immediately following the intervention period (ITT 50.0% vs. 78.9%; PP 47.1% vs. 78.4%) and at 1-year follow-up (ITT 36.1% vs. 76.3%; PP 28.1% vs. 75.0%). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> MBCT may be a useful addition to usual services for patients with health anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</kwd><kwd>mindfulness</kwd><kwd>health anxiety</kwd><kwd>hypochondriasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Severe health anxiety, also described as <italic>hypochondriasis</italic> (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>; 4th ed., text rev., or <italic>DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR</italic>; <xref id="cr1-1" rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) or <italic>hypochondriacal disorder</italic> (<italic>ICD&#x02013;10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders</italic>; <xref id="cr54-1" rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 1992</xref>), is characterized by the preoccupation with the fear of having a serious disease, which persists in spite of appropriate medical reassurance. Up to 9% of patients in general medical practice clinics and up to 5% of the general population meet diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis (<xref id="cr11-1" rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Creed &#x00026; Barsky, 2004</xref>; <xref id="cr14-1" rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">Gureje, &#x000dc;stun, &#x00026; Simon, 1997</xref>). Health anxiety not only causes great suffering for the patient and those around him or her but is also costly in terms of higher medical care utilization (<xref id="cr5-1" rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Barsky, Ettner, Horsky, &#x00026; Bates, 2001</xref>; <xref id="cr28-1" rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Noyes et al., 1994</xref>) and occupational disability (<xref id="cr26-1" rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Mykletun et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, it is a priority for the sake of both patients and health care service providers to develop effective treatments for health anxiety.</p><p>Patients with health anxiety have a preference for psychological treatments over drug treatments (<xref id="cr48-1" rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">Walker, Vincent, Furere, Cox, &#x00026; Kjernisted, 1999</xref>). However, to date, the effects of psychological treatments on health anxiety have been limited. <xref id="cr45-1" rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Thomson and Page's (2007)</xref> Cochrane review concluded that the strongest evidence for a psychological treatment that was effective for hypochondriasis was for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), with several studies reporting positive outcomes (e.g., <xref id="cr4-1" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Barsky &#x00026; Ahern, 2004</xref>; <xref id="cr10-1" rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref id="cr13-1" rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Greeven et al., 2007</xref>; <xref id="cr46-1" rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Visser &#x00026; Bouman, 2001</xref>). However, they noted several limitations of the existing trial data on the psychological treatment of health anxiety. First, the possibility that improvements seen were due to nonspecific factors involved in regular therapist contact cannot be ruled out, emphasizing the need for mediational analyses. Second, it was not possible to determine what proportion of patients were &#x0201c;cured&#x0201d; by the treatments, highlighting the need to give diagnostic outcomes as well as scores on continuous variables. And third, data on the longer term outcome from psychological treatments for health anxiety are limited, highlighting the need for extended follow-up periods. This paucity of follow-up data is especially concerning given the low natural recovery rate of health anxiety (<xref id="cr29-1" rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Olde Hartman et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, in some studies of psychological treatments for health anxiety, as few as 30% of eligible participants agreed to participate (<xref id="cr4-2" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Barsky &#x00026; Ahern, 2004</xref>), and dropout rates of 25%&#x02013;30% have been reported (<xref id="cr13-2" rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Greeven et al., 2007</xref>; <xref id="cr46-2" rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Visser &#x00026; Bouman, 2001</xref>), suggesting that existing psychological interventions are not always acceptable to patients with health anxiety. Taken together, these data suggest that the efficacy and acceptability of existing psychological treatments for health anxiety could be improved.</p><p>Given the limitations of existing interventions, it remains a priority to investigate novel treatments for health anxiety. Recent developments in novel psychological interventions have included mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; <xref id="cr41-1" rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">Segal, Williams, &#x00026; Teasdale, 2002</xref>). MBCT is a cost-effective 8-week class-based program in which participants are taught to observe their thoughts and feelings through the repeated practice of intentionally returning attention to an object (e.g., the breath or body sensations). Participants are taught how to cultivate direct experiential awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of whatever arises in each moment (including negative mood states that trigger anxiety and negative thinking). The cultivation of awareness during mindfulness practice enables participants to recognize when negative and ruminative responses are being triggered and facilitates decentering from such patterns of thought, seeing them as mental events rather than as valid reflections of reality. Unlike standard cognitive&#x02013;behavioral therapy (CBT), where the focus has traditionally been on changing the content of thoughts, MBCT focuses on fostering meta-cognitive awareness and the modification of meta-cognitive processes that maintain unhelpful reactive or ruminative mind states.</p><p>MBCT was designed to target the cognitive processes that render depressed individuals vulnerable to repeated relapse and recurrence, such as rumination and high cognitive reactivity (<xref id="cr43-1" rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale, Segal, &#x00026; Williams, 1995</xref>). MBCT has been shown to reverse processes hypothesized to underlie depressive psychopathology (e.g., <xref id="cr15-1" rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">Hargus, Crane, Barnhofer, &#x00026; Williams, 2010</xref>; <xref id="cr20-1" rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken et al., 2010</xref>; <xref id="cr35-1" rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Raes, Dewulf, van Heeringen, &#x00026; Williams, 2009</xref>) and to reduce the risk of relapse of depression (<xref id="cr44-1" rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale et al., 2000</xref>) as much as maintenance antidepressant medication (<xref id="cr19-1" rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref id="cr39-1" rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">Segal et al, 2010</xref>). Although originally designed for depressed patients in remission, preliminary data suggest that MBCT may be helpful for a broad range of mental health problems including bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, and psychosis, as well as chronic, treatment-resistant, and suicidal forms of depression (see <xref id="cr18-1" rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, &#x00026; Oh, 2010</xref>, and <xref id="cr31-1" rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Piet &#x00026; Hougaard, 2011</xref>, for reviews of the efficacy of MBCT interventions).</p><p>There are several reasons to hypothesize that MBCT may be particularly applicable to the treatment of health anxiety. First, unlike standard CBT, MBCT does not aim to change the content of the patient's thoughts by disconfirming the feared predictions, but to reduce their impact by changing the individual's relationship to their thoughts. This may circumvent the difficulty of disconfirming health anxious fears, which often relate to the distant future and thus are not so amenable to disconfirmation via standard CBT methods such as thought challenging or behavioral experiments. Second, rumination has been shown to maintain health anxiety (<xref id="cr23-1" rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Marcus, Hughes, &#x00026; Arnau, 2008</xref>), and MBCT can reduce maladaptive rumination (<xref id="cr17-1" rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">Heeren &#x00026; Philippot, 2011</xref>; <xref id="cr25-1" rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">Michalak, H&#x000f6;lz, &#x00026; Teismann, 2011</xref>). Hence, it is hypothesized that MBCT may help health anxious patients to learn generic skills of attentional control to enable them to break the pattern of excessive attending to somatic sensations, which leads to an escalation of anxiety via rumination on the potential negative meanings of sensations.</p><p>However, note that cognitive&#x02013;behavioral conceptualizations have emphasized the role of heightened bodily focused attention in the <italic>maintenance</italic> of health anxiety (e.g., <xref id="cr49-1" rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">Warwick &#x00026; Salkovskis, 1990</xref>), and this is supported by experimental studies of attentional bias in health anxiety (<xref id="cr36-1" rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Rassin, Muris, Franken, &#x00026; van Straten, 2008</xref>). Thus, MBCT's focus on attentional awareness of the body may be problematic for patients with health anxiety. The preliminary evidence that training in attentional control strategies can be beneficial to patients with health anxiety excludes attention to the body for this reason (<xref id="cr30-1" rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">Papageorgiou &#x00026; Wells, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, a central tenet of MBCT is changing the <italic>mode of mind</italic> within which a person views him- or herself and the world, leading the individual away from the problem-solving mode that seeks as its first priority to change or &#x0201c;get rid of&#x0201d; unwanted experiences (<xref id="cr52-1" rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 2008</xref>). To this end, patients are taught to see more clearly the patterns of mind that exacerbate and maintain emotional disturbance. This involves seeing directly the distinction between the raw body sensations as actually experienced and the meaning that has become associated with those sensations. Thus, rather than refocusing attention <italic>away</italic> from body sensations, MBCT encourages the person to bring curiosity <italic>toward</italic> the sensations themselves, to register their affective quality, and to observe how the mind and body react to this information (most often with negative and ruminative responses). Despite these intentions, it is possible that MBCT may fail to break into the hypothesized maintenance cycles of health anxiety because patients may find body focus too aversive.</p><p>Preliminary results are encouraging, however. A recent pilot study (<italic>N</italic> = 10) reported MBCT produced significant improvements in health anxiety, disease-related thoughts, and somatic symptoms; the improvements were sustained at 3-month follow-up (<xref id="cr21-1" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Lovas &#x00026; Barsky, 2010</xref>). In addition, both Lovas and Barsky's pilot study and a qualitative study of MBCT for health anxiety (<xref id="cr53-1" rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Williams, McManus, Muse, &#x00026; Williams, 2011</xref>) reported MBCT to be an acceptable treatment to patients with health anxiety. However, to date, there have been no controlled evaluations of the impact of MBCT for health anxiety. The current study reports on the outcome from a randomized clinical trial in which MBCT in addition to unrestricted services (US) was compared with US alone.</p><sec id="S-2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="SS1-1"><title>Study Objectives and Design</title><p>Our objective was to assess the impact of MBCT on health anxiety by comparing the impact of MBCT plus US with US alone in a single center randomized trial conducted in a university setting in the United Kingdom. It was hypothesized that participants who received MBCT in addition to US would have lower levels of health anxiety than those who received US alone, both immediately following the intervention, and at 1-year follow-up.</p><p>Participants were assessed prior to intervention (MBCT or US), immediately following the 8-week intervention period, and at 1 year postintervention. Allocation status was concealed from the independent assessors, and the trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between staff who administered outcome measurements and staff who delivered the intervention. Given that previous treatment trials in health anxiety have been criticized for failing to assess diagnostic status as a primary outcome (<xref id="cr45-2" rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">Thomson &#x00026; Page, 2007</xref>), the primary outcome measures in our study were the diagnosis of hypochondriasis and assessor ratings of interference and distress associated with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, as well as self-report scores on standardized measures of health anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="SS1-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited between July 2008 and September 2009 via referrals from health professionals and self-referral in response to posters placed in local medical and psychiatric services and a local press release. Potential participants were screened via telephone interviews for (a) the presence of the symptoms of hypochondriasis using the <italic>DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR</italic> (<xref id="cr1-2" rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and probe questions outlined in <xref id="cr42-1" rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Asmundson (2004)</xref> and (b) study inclusion/exclusion criteria, such as age and acceptance of random allocation. Those who reported symptoms in line with <italic>DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR</italic> criteria for hypochondriasis and meeting the study inclusion criteria were invited for assessment. During the assessment, we established diagnoses using the <italic>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR Axis I disorders</italic> (<italic>SCID&#x02013;I</italic>; <xref id="cr12-1" rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">First, Gibbon, Spitzer, &#x00026; Williams, 2002</xref>) by a trained assessor. Inclusion criteria were (a) being between the ages of 18 and 65, (b) meeting <italic>DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR</italic> criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis as the principal diagnosis, and (c) having adequate skills in written and spoken English. Exclusion criteria were (a) meeting <italic>DSM&#x02013;IV&#x02013;TR</italic> criteria for the diagnosis of a psychotic illness or for substance dependence or (b) having severity of symptoms or suicidality such that allocation to US (delayed MBCT) would be unethical. Participants were not excluded for being in receipt of other forms of treatment (psychological or drug), but if they were taking psychotropic medication, they were required to have been on a stable dose for 6 weeks prior to inclusion in the study. The flow of participants through the trial, including reasons for exclusion or withdrawal, is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Characteristics of the MBCT and US groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> along with the results of <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.

The mean severity of health anxiety on the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI; <xref id="cr38-1" rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">Salkovskis, Rimes, Warwick, &#x00026; Clark, 2002</xref>) was 32.85 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.22) and on the Whiteley Index (WI; <xref id="cr32-1" rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">Pilowsky, 1967</xref>) 49.34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.64), which is comparable to scores reported for other samples of patients diagnosed with hypochondriasis (e.g., <xref id="cr4-3" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Barsky &#x00026; Ahern, 2004</xref>; <xref id="cr27-1" rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Nakao, Shinozaki, Ahern, &#x00026; Barsky, 2011</xref>; <xref id="cr50-1" rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Wattar et al., 2005</xref>). Thirty-six participants (48.7%) had one or more comorbid diagnoses; 19 had one comorbid diagnosis, 15 had two comorbid diagnoses, and two participants had three comorbid diagnoses, making a total of 55 comorbid diagnoses across the 74 participants. Participants' comorbid diagnoses were as follows: depression (<italic>n</italic> = 13), obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 5), dysthymic disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 2), panic disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 6), social phobia (<italic>n</italic> = 6), alcohol abuse (<italic>n</italic> = 1), generalized anxiety disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 9), specific phobia (<italic>n</italic> = 10), binge eating disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and pain disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Of the 74 participants, 34 (46.0%) had previously had psychological treatment for health anxiety, including the three (4.1%) who were engaged in psychological treatment at the time of the initial assessment. Furthermore, 41 (55.4%) had previously had treatment for a psychological problem other than health anxiety. Although previous experience with yoga or meditation was not assessed, no participants had previously participated in a mindfulness-based psychological intervention.</p></sec><sec id="SS1-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>The study was approved by the local National Health Service Research Ethics Committee and was carried out in the University of Oxford's Department of Psychiatry from September 2008 to January 2010, with follow-up assessments continuing until January 2011.</p></sec><sec id="SS1-4"><title>Allocation Strategy</title><p>Participants were allocated by an independent statistician to either US alone or MBCT plus US using <xref id="cr33-1" rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">Pocock's (1983)</xref> minimization method in random block sizes, whereby each patient was randomized to the group (MBCT vs. US) that minimizes any existing imbalance between the groups in severity, comorbidity, age, and gender.

One previous pilot study (<xref id="cr21-2" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Lovas &#x00026; Barsky, 2010</xref> [<italic>N</italic> = 10]) and a qualitative study (<xref id="cr53-2" rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref> [<italic>N</italic> = 9]) both reported positive impacts and acceptability, but the conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are limited by their uncontrolled designs and small sample sizes. The present study compared the impact of MBCT in addition to usual (unrestricted) services (US) with US alone in a relatively chronic sample of patients diagnosed with hypochondriasis. In addition to meeting diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis, almost half of the participants met criteria for another psychiatric disorder, and over half had previously received psychological treatment for an emotional problem other than health anxiety. Furthermore, almost half of the participants had had previous psychological treatment for health anxiety, and 41.0% were currently taking psychotropic medication.</p><p>While there were no significant differences between the MBCT and US groups in levels of general anxiety or depression, or in the number or presence of comorbid diagnoses, the composite measure of health anxiety showed that the MBCT group's score was significantly lower than the US group's, both immediately following the intervention period and at the 1-year follow-up. This suggests that the MBCT intervention, adapted to focus on symptoms of health anxiety, added significant advantage to US in terms of reducing symptoms of health anxiety. The magnitude of change on measures of health anxiety found here is similar to that reported in <xref id="cr21-3" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Lovas and Barsky's (2010)</xref> pilot study of MBCT for hypochondriasis, and the effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>s) fall within the range 0.28&#x02013;0.78 reported in <xref id="cr47-1" rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">V&#x000f8;llestad, Sivertsen, and H&#x000f8;stmark's (2011)</xref> trial of MBCT versus waitlist for anxiety disorders. However, it is also worth noting that while symptoms of general anxiety and depression improved over time, there was no significant advantage of MBCT over US for either general anxiety or depression. This is in contrast to previous studies showing MBCT to have a significant positive impact on depression and anxiety symptoms (e.g., see <xref id="cr18-3" rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>, for a review). This may be due to the MBCT program being adapted to focus on symptoms of hypochondriasis or to lower power to detect differences in these symptoms as there was greater variability in participants' levels of depression and general anxiety. However, future research should examine carefully the issue of generic versus specific changes when the MBCT protocol is adapted to focus on a specific condition.</p><p>As regards the impact on health anxiety symptoms, in comparison to those who had received US alone, significantly fewer participants who received the MBCT intervention met criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, both immediately following the intervention and at 1-year follow-up. In the ITT sample, 50.0% of MBCT participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis immediately following the intervention, and this increased to 63.9% by the 1-year follow-up, as compared with rates of 21.1% at postintervention and 23.7% at 1-year follow-up in the US group. In the PP sample, 52.9% of MBCT participants no longer met criteria for hypochondriasis immediately following the intervention, and this increased to 71.9% by the 1-year follow-up, as compared with rates of 21.6% and 25.0%, respectively, in the US group.</p><p>A criticism of previous trials is that the better outcomes achieved by the active treatment might have been due to the nonspecific effects of therapy. However, our analysis showed that there were large and significant changes in the supposed mediator of change (mindfulness) that were maintained at 1-year follow-up. Mediational analysis showed that these changes in mindfulness significantly mediated the group changes in health anxiety, whereas the reverse analysis (whereby changes in health anxiety would mediate changes in mindfulness) was not significant.</p><p>The MBCT treatment seemed highly acceptable to those participants who entered into the trial, in that all 34 of the participants who began the MBCT treatment continued through to the postintervention assessment. However, two of the 36 participants allocated to MBCT did not take up the intervention. Of the 34 participants who did attend the classes, attendance was good, with participants attending an average of 6.5 out of eight sessions. While it is encouraging that there was little drop out once the intervention had been initiated, it is also worth noting that 37 potential participants (22.7% of those telephone screened or assessed) declined either further assessment or inclusion in the study. These patients' refusal could have many reasons (e.g., the patient did not wish to participate in a research trial, or the patient accessed alternative treatment elsewhere), and it is not possible to know whether the acceptability of the intervention was a factor in this. However, it is encouraging that 91.4% of the 81 participants assessed as eligible for participation in the study entered into the trial and that the overall attrition rate from MBCT was less than 6%, which is noticeably lower than rates reported in some other studies of psychological treatments of health anxiety (e.g., 25.0% from CBT in <xref id="cr13-3" rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">Greeven et al., 2007</xref>, and 28.2% from cognitive therapy or exposure and response prevention in <xref id="cr46-3" rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Visser &#x00026; Bouman, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The surprising element of these results is that mindfulness interventions involve focusing on the body, and yet such bodily focus is seen as one of the primary <italic>maintaining</italic> factors in health anxiety. On the face of it, MBCT should make people feel worse. However, the theory on which MBCT is based distinguishes <italic>two</italic> modes of self-focus (<xref id="cr52-2" rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 2008</xref>). In the first problem-solving (doing) mode, a person attends to external or internal stimuli through representations (thoughts or images), with the motivation to change the current state being the highest priority using standard discrepancy-based processing. Such motivation drives two &#x0201c;slave&#x0201d; processes&#x02014;rumination and avoidance&#x02014;both of which are intended to help reduce the perceived discrepancy between current and desired state but which actually increase the discrepancy, leading to a rapid escalation of distress. MBCT teaches patients to see these maladaptive patterns as they begin and then to &#x0201c;decenter&#x0201d; from them, switching instead into an experiential mode in which the thoughts and body sensations are seen as passing events.</p><p>The positive outcomes reported should be viewed within the limitations of the study. Participants were predominantly female, highly educated, and White. While this is not the case in all studies of patients with hypochondriasis, other trials of psychological treatments for hypochondriasis have also reported more than 70% of participants to be female and White (e.g., 74.5&#x02013;78.8% female and 70.6&#x02013;74.1% White in <xref id="cr4-4" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Barsky &#x00026; Ahern, 2004</xref>, and 76.4% female and 72.0% White in <xref id="cr27-2" rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">Nakao et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the group nature of the MBCT-based intervention meant that there was a delay between being assessed for inclusion in the study and the time at which sufficient numbers had been recruited to allocate participants to a MBCT group and equivalent numbers to US, which meant that participants had a variable length of delay between the initial assessment and commencement of the MBCT/US period. However, the mean length of delay was not different between those allocated to MBCT or US, so it is unlikely that this could have accounted for the differences between the groups found at the postintervention assessment. A further limitation is that in order to complete the trial within time scales, the sample was actively recruited, with 33.8% of participants self-referring in response to advertisements and 31.1% initiating contact at the suggestion of their general practitioner. Self-referral rates in the current study are consistent with those reported for other trials of psychological treatments for hypochondriasis (e.g., 57.2% in <xref id="cr4-5" rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">Barsky &#x00026; Ahern's 2004</xref> trial of CBT for hypochondriasis), and the sample appears to be comparable to other samples of patients diagnosed with hypochondriasis in terms of having comparable scores on standardized measures of health anxiety, a mean duration of the current episode of over 8 years, and high rates of comorbidity and of previous treatment. Nevertheless, as noted by <xref id="cr21-4" rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">Lovas and Barsky (2010)</xref>, it remains a priority to investigate the dissemination of such novel treatment procedures into routine clinical practice. A final important limitation of the current study is that it employed only a US control as the first step to establishing whether MBCT has a role to play in a diagnosis in which excessive focus on the body is central. It will be a priority for future studies to compare the impact of MBCT with alternative interventions that are matched for therapist time and attention and to compare the comparative cost effectiveness of different approaches to treating health anxiety. Despite these limitations, this trial provides reason for optimism that the effects of MBCT are mediated by change in the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie it and that MBCT has potential as an adjunctive class-based psychological approach to treating severe health anxiety.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Lupina Foundation for funding the current study and to Christie Leung and Marco Cheng for help with data collection and entry.
