TRO40303 is a new cardioprotective compound that was shown to inhibit the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and reduce infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion in a rat model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the rat model, the therapeutic window and the dose effect relationship were investigated in order to select the proper dose and design for clinical investigations. To evaluate post-ischemic functional recovery, TRO40303 was tested in a model of isolated rat heart. Additionally, TRO40303 was investigated in a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous ascending doses of the compound (0.5 to 13&#x000a0;mg/kg) in 72 healthy male, post-menopausal and hysterectomized female subjects at flow rates from 0.04 to 35&#x000a0;mL/min (EudraCT number: 2010-021453-39). This work was supported in part by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the vivo model, TRO40303 reduced infarct size by 40% at 1&#x000a0;mg/kg and by 50% at 3 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg given by intravenous bolus and was only active when administered before reperfusion. Additionally, TRO40303 provided functional recovery and reduced oxidative stress in the isolated rat heart model.</p><p>These results, together with pharmacokinetic based allometry to human and non-clinical toxicology data, were used to design the Phase I trial. All the tested doses and flow rates were well tolerated clinically. There were no serious adverse events reported. No relevant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, laboratory tests or physical examinations were observed at any time in any dose group. Pharmacokinetics was linear up to 6&#x000a0;mg/kg and slightly ~1.5-fold, hyper-proportional from 6 to 13&#x000a0;mg/kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data demonstrated that TRO40303 can be safely administered by the intravenous route in humans at doses expected to be pharmacologically active. These results allowed evaluating the expected active dose in human at 6&#x000a0;mg/kg, used in a Phase II proof-of-concept study currently ongoing.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acute myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>Functional recovery</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial permeability transition pore</kwd><kwd>Phase I clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of death in the world. A large number of people suffering from cardiac ischemia (e.g. myocardial infarction) die or suffer from cardiac dysfunction leading very often to a new cardiovascular event in the following years. These dismal statistics make it indisputable that these diseases are to be considered as having highly unmet medical needs.</p><p>During an acute myocardial infarction, ischemia and subsequent reperfusion each contribute to the loss of viable myocardium leading to alterations in left ventricular structure remodelling, reduced heart function and heart failure. Early myocardial reperfusion with the use of thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most effective strategy for reducing myocardial infarct size and improving the clinical outcome. However, because myocardial reperfusion paradoxically induces cardiomyocyte death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], there has been an increased recognition of the need for treatments that reduce reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Evidence indicates that opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is largely involved in reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and that inhibitors of mPTP such as Cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin) can reduce reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. TRO40303 ( 3,5-seco-4-nor-cholestan-5-one oxime-3-ol) is a newly discovered compound that inhibits mPTP opening via an innovative mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. TRO40303 is targeted to the cardiac mitochondria likely through binding to the cholesterol site of the outer mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (TSPO). TRO40303 has been shown to reduce infarct size in a model of myocardial infarction in rats while at the same time inhibiting AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor) release from mitochondria to the cytosol in the ischemic area, potentially via the reduction of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However TRO40303 does not increase the calcium retention capacity of isolated mitochondria as does Cyclosporine A, probably because TRO40303 inhibits the mPTP by another mechanism than Cyclosporine A, which targets the mitochondrial matrix protein Cyclophilin D.</p><p>Translating a potential therapeutic from the bench to the bedside for an emergency indication such as myocardial infarction presents several important challenges. These include 1) establishing a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship, 2) identifying the therapeutic window with respect to the clinical setting, 3) developing a formulation able to rapidly and safely deliver an effective dose and 4) confirming safety and PK parameters in healthy volunteers. This has not always been adequately investigated in the case of some previously developed cardioprotective compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These issues are especially challenging with a poorly soluble or highly hydrophobic compound such as TRO40303 and for an acute care emergency indication such as an acute myocardial infarction where 1) time is critical so injection time is short making it important to find an excipient that maximizes solubility to minimize volume and injection time and 2) patients are unstable so less able to tolerate side effects known to be associated with emulsion formulations used to deliver poorly soluble compounds.</p><p>To address these challenges, we had to develop specific formulations for the preclinical and the clinical investigations. Previous studies showed that 2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg of TRO40303 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], formulated in hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrine (HPBCD) reduced infarct size by 38% in a myocardial infarction model in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Because of the limited solubility in HPBCD, the maximum dose that could be tested using this vehicle was limited by the volume that could be administered (5&#x000a0;mL/kg). To increase exposure and explore a full dose-response relationship, TRO40303 was formulated in Intralipid&#x000ae; 30 (IL30), an oil-based parenteral nutritional supplement that provides improved TRO40303 solubility to concentrations up to ~6&#x000a0;mg/mL. Using this IL30 formulation, we evaluated the cardioprotective effects of TRO40303 by evaluating infarct size in a model of myocardial infarction in rats in terms of dose-effect relationship and therapeutic window in greater detail to derive a PK/PD relationship and to identify the optimal time of administration. Further studies also explored the functional recovery and gathered further evidence for TRO40303&#x02032;s mechanism of action in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recovery of left ventricular function, as assessed in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> model, is of extreme importance as together with infarct size, as assessed in the <italic>in vivo</italic> model, left ventricle dysfunction has been shown to be correlated with mortality following myocardial infarction in the clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These data, together with pharmacokinetic allometric scaling to human, were used to estimate the expected active dose in humans allowing with the toxicological findings to design a dose escalating Phase I trial to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous dose of TRO40303 in preparation for a Phase II clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless specified. TRO40303 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was synthesized by Synkem (Dijon, France). For <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments, TRO40303 was dissolved in a solution of 30% HPBCD in phosphate buffered saline at 0.5&#x000a0;mg/mL (&#x000b1; 10%).

All subjects gave written informed consent before any study-related procedures. The study was conducted at a single centre (Optimed Lyon, Lyon, France) after approval by the French Regulatory Agency AFSSAPS and the Ethics Committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes IV Lyon, France). The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) as modified in Seoul (2008), the recommendations on Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6) and the applicable French regulatory requirement. The trial was registered with the EudraCT number: 2010-021453-39. All the data were collected and analysed at Optimed Lyon apart from the pharmacokinetic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Myocardial infarction model</title><p>In all groups of rats, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded during 35&#x000a0;min and released for reperfusion as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For the dose range testing, the vehicle (IL30) or TRO40303 solution in IL30 (stock solution diluted in IL30 to administer ~1.5&#x000a0;mL/kg in each group) at increasing doses (0.3, 1, 3 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg) were administered as a 5&#x000a0;min infusion through the jugular vein starting 10&#x000a0;min before coronary artery reperfusion (CAR). To evaluate the therapeutic window, the vehicle or TRO40303 at 1&#x000a0;mg/kg were also administered either 10&#x000a0;min before coronary artery occlusion (CAO) or 10&#x000a0;min after CAR. Infarct size was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and was calculated as a percentage of the area at risk (AAR), 24&#x000a0;h after reperfusion. For the dose range experiment, infarct size was expressed for all doses as a percent of the vehicle group infarct size.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics and TRO40303 heart level measurement in rats</title><p>TRO40303 was administered by intravenous (i.v.) bolus to healthy rats at doses of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg in IL30 under isoflurane gas anaesthesia. A maximum of 0.25&#x000a0;mL of blood was collected into lithium heparin tubes at 5, 15 and 30&#x000a0;min, 1&#x000a0;h, 2&#x000a0;h, 4&#x000a0;h, 8&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h after drug administration (3 rats per time point).

For heart level measurements, TRO40303 was administrated i.v. to rats undergoing the myocardial infarction procedure at the dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg in IL30 either 10&#x000a0;min before CAO or 10&#x000a0;min before CAR. Five min after CAR, rats were anesthetised and sacrificed, hearts were isolated and washed with saline. Tissue from AAR was separated from the remainder of the left ventricle; samples were frozen and stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until analysis. After TRO40303 plasma concentration analysis, TRO40303 plasma AUC<sub>(0-&#x0221e;)</sub> (the area under the curve extrapolated from time zero to time infinity), was calculated using Kinetica&#x02122;, version 4.4.1 (Thermo Electron Corporation, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA).

During the reperfusion period, the following parameters were monitored via a water-filled latex balloon inserted into the left ventricle: left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP); left ventricular developed pressure (Pdev); its first derivative (dP/dt) and heart rate. Coronary flow was measured by collecting the coronary perfusate over 1&#x000a0;min. The rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated as the product of Pdev and heart rate. Some of the hearts from this main experiment were used to assess ascorbate, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Free radical and lipid peroxidation measurements</title><p>To evaluate the effect of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M TRO40303 on ischemia-reperfusion-induced ascorbate release and tissue depletion, effluents from control and treated hearts undergoing the perfusion protocol described above (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6/group) were collected for 15&#x000a0;s, 1&#x000a0;min following onset of reflow, and hearts were frozen in liquid nitrogen at the end of the reperfusion period.

Seventy-two healthy volunteers were randomized, with 18 receiving a placebo and 54 an active liposomal formulation containing 20&#x000a0;mg/mL TRO40303 at final doses ranging from 0.5, 1, 2, 3.5, 6, 10 to 13&#x000a0;mg/kg with escalating flow rates from 0.04&#x000a0;mL/min to 35&#x000a0;mL/min. Within each group, 3 or 6 subjects received TRO40303 and 1 or 2 subjects received the same volume of placebo. The sample size was based on the number of doses and flow rates to be investigated. The 6 verum/2 placebo ratio per group is widely used in single ascending dose studies and provides adequate safety and pharmacokinetic information. The 3 verum/1 placebo ratio used in the last groups was chosen only to explore additional flow rates at previously studied doses.</p><p>The study started on the 14<sup>th</sup> of September 2010 and was completed on the 24<sup>th</sup> of February 2011.

When TRO40303 was formulated in IL30, exposure was higher than previously found with TRO40303 formulated in HPBCD. The dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg TRO40303 in IL30 provided a similar exposure as that obtained with 2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg in HPBCD (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). This correlated well with the level of activity found with both doses in the two formulations.</p><p>The TRO40303 plasma exposure in rats in terms of C<sub>5min</sub> and AUC<sub>(0-&#x0221e;)</sub> together with the corresponding activity in term of infarct size reduction for each dose, were used to establish a PK/PD relationship.</p><p>The plateau of activity corresponding to ~50% infarct size reduction was determined as the maximum achievable cardioprotective activity for TRO40303 in this model and doses achieving this level of infarct size reduction thus corresponded to the target plasma exposure to achieve. The pharmacokinetic parameters for the fully active doses of 3 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg in rats, measured in satellite animals similarly infused, were: C<sub>5min</sub>, 57.9 and 130&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (23.5 and 52.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) and AUC<sub>(0-&#x0221e;)</sub> of 14.0 and 44.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g.h/mL, respectively. The exposure corresponding to the dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg was defined as the minimum fully effective plasma exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic window of TRO40303</title><p>The therapeutic window for TRO40303 treatment was investigated in rats by administering the lowest active dose of 1&#x000a0;mg/kg in IL30 either 10&#x000a0;min prior to 35&#x000a0;min CAO or 10&#x000a0;min after the onset of CAR. The results showed that when administered before CAO 1&#x000a0;mg/kg TRO40303 reduced infarct size by 55% compared to vehicle (versus 40% when administered 10&#x000a0;min prior to reperfusion), whereas infarct size was unchanged compared to vehicle&#x02013;treated rats when TRO40303 was administered 10&#x000a0;min after the onset of reperfusion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). However, in this case it must be noted that the extent of the infarct was lower in the vehicle group when treated 10&#x000a0;min after CAR compared to administration before CAO (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Nevertheless, TRO40303 provided no greater effect when administered 10&#x000a0;min post reperfusion.

Because TRO40303 is highly hydrophobic but liposoluble, a clinical formulation in liposomes was developed having a concentration of ~20&#x000a0;mg/mL. However, liposomal preparations can induce hypersensitivity reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] due to CARPA, which is related to the type of liposomes and the speed of injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To avoid this side effect, a TRO40303 liposomal formulation was developed and selected based on the failure to stimulate production of complement fragment, SC5b-9 in human sera. To this end, candidate liposomal formulations of TRO40303 were assayed <italic>in vitro</italic> and selected based on the failure to induce formation of SC5b -9 in a battery of human sera. The positive control in these studies was AmBisome&#x000ae;, a product that is known to induce CARPA reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which induced a large release (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Absence of CARPA reactions using the liposomal TRO40303 formulation.

The results support the further development of TRO40303 to treat reperfusion injury in patients treated by PCI for an acute myocardial infarction. Preclinical ischemia-reperfusion models confirmed that TRO40303 dose-dependently preserved heart tissue and restored heart function. These studies also provided further evidence that TRO40303 reduces oxidative stress triggered by reperfusion, which along with calcium overload, triggers mitochondrial permeabilization underlying cardiomyocyte cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Similar cardioprotective effects were found when TRO40303 was administered to rats either 10&#x000a0;min prior to 35&#x000a0;min left ventricular ischemia or 10&#x000a0;min before reperfusion but not when administered 10&#x000a0;min after the onset of reperfusion. This results show that TRO40303 targets early events, such as mitochondria permeabilization, leading to reperfusion injury but does not act on later reperfusion events. In the clinical setting, this has an important consequence: TRO40303 should be administered before reperfusion is performed either by angioplasty or thrombolysis. TRO40303 could thus be effective when administered in an emergency situation just before PCI or prophylactically in case of scheduled PCI or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.</p><p>The safety and tolerability of TRO40303 administered by i.v. infusion in humans was then verified in a Phase I trial. Intravenous doses of TRO40303 from 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg to 13&#x000a0;mg/kg were all well tolerated. Infusion flow rates up to a maximum of 35&#x000a0;mL/min were tested with doses between 3.5 and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg and a dose of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg was predicted to be able to deliver a clinically effective level of TRO40303 at the time of reperfusion. Thus, it should be possible to deliver this dose in less than 1&#x000a0;min with TRO40303 formulated in liposomes at a concentration of 20&#x000a0;mg/mL, the desired objective for an emergency indication such as an acute myocardial infarction. The dose of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg assures that all individuals will achieve a C<sub>5min</sub> above 52.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, the plasma exposure found in rats treated with 10&#x000a0;mg/kg that resulted in ~50% reduction in infarct size. At a lower dose it is possible that not all the individuals will have that level of exposure at the time of reperfusion based on the observed inter-individual variability. This dose is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01374321) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Notably, safety, tolerance and most importantly the lack of CARPA-type reactogenicity with TRO40303 formulated in liposomes, which is of particular importance for the security of patients being treated for an acute myocardial infarction, was confirmed in the Phase I study.</p><p>Limitations of these studies are that TRO40303 efficacy studies have only been performed in rodent models and that the formulation used in animal models is different from the formulation used in humans. Additionally, human safety and pharmacokinetics was only tested in 54 individuals exposed to TRO40403 and only 27 with doses of 6&#x000a0;mg/kg or higher. Further development of the product in patients is thus required in order to validate if similar safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy is observed in the target population. Of note, it must be pointed out that several very promising therapies in preclinical models for cardiac reperfusion injury have failed in human.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, TRO40303 timing of administration, dose-dependent efficacy and functional effects were characterised in preclinical models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Safety was demonstrated in humans in a Phase I trial and the pharmacokinetic parameters in humans were determined confirming the therapeutic potential of TRO40303 and the feasibility to perform a Phase II proof of concept trial, which is ongoing. The outcome of the Phase II trial will determine whether TRO40303 reduces infarct size in humans, and provide a path to developing it as a therapy to reduce reperfusion injury, cardiac remodelling and eventually morbidity and mortality following acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AAR: Area at risk; AFR: Ascorbyl free radical; AEs: Adverse events; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; AUC(0-&#x0221e;): Area under the curve extrapolated from time zero to time infinity; BW: Body weight; C5min: TRO40303 plasma concentration at 5&#x000a0;min post end of infusion; Cmax: TRO40303 maximum plasma concentration; CAO: Coronary artery occlusion; CAR: Coronary artery reperfusion; CARPA: Complement activated related pseudo-allergy; CI: Confidence interval; CL: Clearance; DMPO: 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline <italic>N</italic>-oxide; DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide; ECG: Electrocardiogram; ESR: Electron spin resonance; HPBCD: Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrine; IL30: Intralipid&#x000ae; 30; i.v.: Intravenous; KH: Krebs-Henseleit; ln: Natural logarithm; LVEDP: Left ventricular end diastolic pressure; MDA-TBA: Malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid assay; mPTP: Mitochondrial permeability transition pore; PAP: Pulmonary arterial blood pressure; PCI: Percutaneous coronary intervention; Pdev: left ventricular developed pressure; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; RPP: Rate-pressure product; SAP: Systemic arterial blood pressure; thalf: plasma elimination half life; TRO40303: 3,5-seco-4-nor-cholestan-5-one oxime-3-ol; TTC: Triphenyltetrazolium chloride; V1: initial volume of distribution; Vz: Volume of distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>AB has served as consultant and received honorarium from TROPHOS.
