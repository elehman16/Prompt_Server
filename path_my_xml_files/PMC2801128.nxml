Clinical features include joint pain, instability, limitation of motion and function impairment. The pathogenesis of OA, albeit not yet well understood, is often linked to joint injury, biochemical alterations and ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Pharmacological treatment alternatives for OA can be divided into two groups: symptom-modifying and disease-modifying drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Symptom-modifying drugs are at present the prescription of choice for patients with OA. Drugs in this group are analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are effective in relieving the symptoms of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There has recently been a lot of debate about some biological agents that are thought to have both symptom-modifying and disease-modifying properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Most of the compounds suggested as disease-modifying drugs are physiological molecules contained in articular tissues such as glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (CS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A tetracycline antibiotic, doxycycline (DOX), has been successfully used to treat a wide-range of bacterial infections. In addition to its effects as an antibiotic, laboratory studies with animals and with human tissue have shown that doxycycline can inhibit the degradation of cartilage in a way that could be useful for the treatment of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. DOX, reportedly limits cartilage degradation and significantly ameliorates the degenerative changes that occur in OA joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Specifically, DOX orally administered at low dosages appeared to reduce the rate and extent of joint pathology in a canine model of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, most of the papers published about DOX and joint pathology were done <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the long-term use of DOX can favorably modify the progression of OA in dogs. Moreover, to confirm preclinical data suggesting that DOX can slow the progression of OA. The experimental design was developed according to potential clinical use, with clinical score, radiographic findings and serum osteoarthritis biomarkers as primary outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Twenty-five client-owned dogs were included in this study, 12 males and 13 females aged between 1~7 (4.21 &#x000b1; 1.63) years old. Twenty dogs were Golden retrievers and 5 dogs were Labrador retrievers. Informed owner consent was obtained and the trial protocol was approved by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University's Ethics Committee, Chiang Mai, Thailand.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Golden and Labrador retriever dogs with clinical signs of chronic lameness, stiffness and joint pain and radiological evidence of OA of the hip were considered eligible for this study. Animals which were pregnant, receiving medication, or had hepatic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological disease, were excluded. Dogs with lameness due to lumbosacral instability, infection, immune disease and fractures and dogs which previously received drug or dietary supplement for OA treatment were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Pretreatment evaluation</title><p>Dogs were clinically examined and blood samples were collected for baseline hematology, blood chemistry and biomarker for OA. Radiographs of hip joints were interpreted by two veterinarians.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>The dogs were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. The first group (DOX group) received doxycycline (2 mg/kg body weight twice daily; Osoth Inter Laboratories, Thailand) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the second group (CS group) served as control group and received chondroitin sulfate (Fortiflex, 525 mg/dog daily; Virbac, USA). Animal were re-assessed monthly for clinical evaluation and blood collection, while radiographs were taken every 2 months. Treatment was stopped on the end of the 6th month.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment protocol</title><p>Two veterinarians recorded the severity of the clinical signs at each monthly visit using an ordinal scoring system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and all veterinarians scored blind to the group classification. The radiographs of hip joints were taken every 2 months (3 times per animal) and were interpreted by the 2 veterinarians using the Takahashi scoring system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Three milliliters of blood was collected monthly from the cephalic vein to assess the levels of OA biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical score</title><p>Efficacy of the treatment was determined by the mean of a clinical scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] that assessed the animal specific lameness, joint mobility, pain on palpation, weight-bearing and overall score of clinical condition. The dogs had to walk and trot 6 meters 3 times for the evaluation of lameness by 2 veterinarians, following palpation on hip joint for joint mobility and pain evaluation. The palpation was performed by 2 veterinarians, 30 min apart.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographs</title><p>Structural joint changes were assessed on serial radiographs performed according to the standardized technique recommended by Takahashi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Radiographs were taken for each animal at enrollment and at 3 and 6 months after treatment by the same technician using a usual X-ray machine (Kelex, Thailand). Ventrodorsal radiographs were obtained with the dog's hip and the leg in full extension position. Repositioning of the dog for subsequent radiographs were guided by the original film and the same radiographic setting (i.e. kilovolts, milliamperes and milliseconds) were used. All radiographs in a dog set (3 films) were interpreted for all evaluations concomitantly by 2 veterinarians using the criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Hematology and biochemistry</title><p>Blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts, including hematocrit, hemoglobin level, red blood cell count and white blood cell count and the platelet count. Two mililiters of serum were analyzed for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotranferase, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.</p></sec><sec><title>Biomarker assay</title><p>The biomarker assays were enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This study used 2 biomarkers; CS-WF6 epitope and hyaluronan (HA).</p></sec><sec><title>Competitive immunoassay using monoclonal antibody WF6</title><p>A mouse monoclonal antibody WF6 was raised against a shark cartilage aggrecan preparation and a quantitative ELISA for the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody WF6 was modified from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The antibody was specific for intact CS chains and showed no interaction with other sulfated glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronan or other polyanions, such as DNA, RNA or dextran sulfate. The standard used in the assay was shark cartilage aggrecan (A1 fraction) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at concentrations of 19~10,000 ng/mL in 6% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris Incubation (TI) buffer (0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA). Diluted human serum samples (1 : 5 in 6% BSA-TI) were added to 1.5 mL plastic tubes containing an equal volume of WF6 (cell culture supernatant, 1 : 200 dilution in TI buffer). They were incubated at 37&#x02103; for 1 h, and then added to the microtiter plate, which was pre-coated with shark aggrecan (A1 fraction). Non-specific protein binding was blocked with BSA. The plates were then incubated at 37&#x02103; for 1 h, and the wells were then washed and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (1 : 2,000) was added (100 mL/well; in TI buffer). The bound conjugate was detected by adding ortho-phenylenediamine (o-PD) substrate (100 mL/well in 0.05 M citrate buffer, pH 5.0). The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 50 mL/well of 4 M sulfuric acid, and absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (Titertek multiscan Mcc/340; ICN-Flow, USA) at 492/690 nm. The concentration of WF6 epitope in supernatant samples was calculated by reference to a standard curve.</p></sec><sec><title>ELISA-based assay for HA using biotinylated HA-binding proteins (HABPs)</title><p>Human serum samples or standard HA (HealonR; Pharmacia Pharmaceutical AB, Sweden) at various concentrations [19~10,000 ng/mL in 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4] were added to 1.5 mL plastic tubes containing biotinylated HABPs prepared as described above (1 : 200 in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6). The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and then samples were added to the microplate, which was precoated with umbilical cord HA (100 mL/well of 10 mg/mL) and blocked with 1% BSA (150 mL/well). The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed and peroxidase-conjugated antibiotin antibody (1 : 2,000 dilution; Zymed, USA), 100 mL/well in PBS, was added. The plate was incubated at room temperature for another hour. The detection of conjugated antibody was with o-PD substrate and plate reading was carried out as described above. The concentration of HA in samples was calculated from the standard curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and statistics</title><p>The results of CS and HA analyses are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD.

However, all of these effects occurred slower when compared to CS.</p><p>Disease-modifying or symptomatic slow-acting drugs are more interesting because some have been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and in reducing OA cartilage degradation with a reasonable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These drugs have shown onset of efficacy and a prolonged residual effect once treatment is stopped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As this study was a clinical trial, CS was chosen as positive control in order to address ethical responsibilities and the welfare of the participant dogs. According to previous studies, CS has been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory factors, modify the cellular death process and improve the anabolism/catabolism balance of extracellular cartilage matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. At the same time it has proven to have a positive effect on the pathological process involving the synovial tissue and subchondral bone. These mechanisms could, account for the beneficial results observed in some clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The recognized limitation of this study was the lack of an objective assessment of the joint. It was not possible to perform ground force reaction measurements as was done in the trials of Hazewinkel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], Moreau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Vasseur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] as this was a multicenter trial. Subjective assessment of weight bearing by 2 blinded veterinarians was used instead. Our study found that DOX had a slower effect on clinical improvements compare to CS. The overall score was improved 3 months after treatment, while CS had a significant effect 2 months after treatment. Moreover, we found that DOX did not improve the measures of pain as well as CS. Radiographic findings did not show any significant changes. In agreement with a published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], DOX did not significantly prevent the onset of progressive joint space narrowing (JSN) in the contralateral knee, and did not improve measures of pain or function of the OA knee.</p><p>The morphological changes in OA include alterations in the cartilage, subchondral bone, and synovial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Current knowledge points to an important involvement of the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) class in the OA process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Collagenase-3 (MMP-13) was demonstrated to play a major role in cartilage degeneration. It is also suggested that another enzyme, aggrecanase-2, or ADAMTS-5 plays a predominant role in the proteolysis of OA cartilage aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>It is recognized that MMPs play a role in the pathologic breakdown of the joint extracellular matrix in OA. It is known that low-dose regimens of a tetracycline analogue, namely DOX can inhibit some MMPs, hence reducing the extracellular matrix breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A recent study examined the effects of DOX on knee OA progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The primary outcome measure was JSN in the medial tibiofemoral compartment. Obese females with a unilateral OA knee were randomly assigned to receive 30 months of treatment with DOX or placebo. The loss of joint space width in the index knee in the DOX group was less than in the placebo group. This study showed that DOX can reduce the progression of established OA in this patient population. It provides the first proof of concept of the effectiveness of anti-MMP strategies for developing disease-modifying drugs.</p><p>Inhibition of the MMPs superfamily is a very logical objective in OA. Moreover, tetracyclines inhibit collagenase levels and nitric oxide production <italic>in vitro</italic>, thereby decreasing chondrocyte MMPs activity and increasing proteoglycan synthesis attenuating OA in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In agreement with a previous study, Pardy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed DOX treatment conserved bone strain energy density at 72 weeks. Doxycycline had little effect on the degradation of superficial osseous tissue at 36 week after anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT); by 72 weeks, DOX in ACLT canine model limited subchondral bone loss within the first 3 mm of periarticular bone with established OA. Significant bone loss occurred in the deeper trabecular bone for all groups. Substantial architectural adaptation within deeper trabecular bone accompanied changes in mechanics in early and established OA. In 1991, Yu was done <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, and indicated that levels of neutral MMPs in OA cartilage are elevated and that doxycycline inhibits collagenolytic and gelatinolytic activity in extracts of OA cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, before tetracycline and its analogues, or even MMP inhibitors, can be considered to be an effective treatment in preventing knee OA progression, further investigations are needed.</p><p>A novel monoclonal antibody CS-WF6, which recognizes a native epitope in CS chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was elevated after treatment. The finding of elevated levels of serum CS-WF6 epitope after treated with both DOX and CS reflector to alteration the metabolism of the cartilage. In chronic OA, the level of CS-WF6 epitope is higher than normal because the native CS chain in cartilage was degraded and release into the blood system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The elevation of CS-WF6 epitope in this study was shown both drugs induced the synthesis of CS-chain in cartilage lead to have more proportion of CS in the cartilage. This new CSs were source of the degradation process in OA joint which made a CS-WF6 epitope up-regulation. We found DOX had a slower effect on cartilage metabolism than CS. In this study, the level of CS-WF6 epitope was found to be significantly elevated after 1 and 2 months in CS and DOX groups, respectively.</p><p>In an inflammatory rat model of arthritis, it was demonstrated that serum HA levels correlated with the degree of synovitis and clinical arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HA plays the key role in immobilizing aggrecans in articular cartilage; this balances the tension and compressive resilience in the collagen network by its osmotic properties. Also, the HA levels were related to joint inflammation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Serum HA has been studied as a biomarker of disease progression, since significantly increased levels were reported in cases of rheumatoid arthritis and progressive osteoarthritis, compared to the normal population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our study, the HA levels were significantly decreased after 1 and 2 months in CS and DOX groups, respectively. This means that both DOX and CS decreased the level of inflammation in the joint. Compared between 2 groups, CS reduce inflammation significantly faster than DOX.</p><p>The one importance issue in using DOX as disease-modifying drug in OA is the microbial resistance. This trial did not study the effect of using a chronic, sub-antimicrobial dose of DOX on microbial resistance. However, many studies had proved that using sub-antimicrobial dose DOX (20 mg twice a day) had no effect on the microbial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Microbial studies have documented the lack of any antimicrobial effect on the normal flora, periodontal and/or opportunistic pathogens, or change in antibiotic susceptibilities following the use of a sub-antimicrobial dose of DOX up to 9 months in double-blinded, placebo controlled, multicentered studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These studies examined the effect, or lack of effect, of sub-antimicrobial dose DOX on the sub-gingival flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and on antibiotic resistances within this flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] in a periodontitis population. Likewise, there was no detectible effect of a 9-month regimen of sub-antimicrobial dose of DOX on the intestinal flora of a periodontitis population cross-sectionally, relative to placebo control, or longitudinally within the sub-antimicrobial dose DOX treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In 2007 Walker and colleague [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] had reported that there was no evidence that exposure to DOX, 20 mg twice a day, resulted in cross- or multiantibiotic resistance. No evidence was present that the use of a sub-antimicrobial dose of DOX for a period of 24 months in a population of periodontally diseased osteopenic women exerted any detectible effect on the microbial flora as determined by total anaerobic counts and total counts for actinomyces and streptococci. There was no evidence that a sub-antimicrobial dose of DOX resulted in the colonization or overgrowth by periodontal and/or opportunistic pathogens. In our trial, we used 4 mg/kg DOX daily, which is a sub-antimicrobial dose (10 mg/kg daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], related to all publications which mention above that possible is using 4 mg/kg DOX daily has no effect on the microbial resistance. However, all studies on microbial resistance had been done in humans not canine, so to fulfill this hypothesis, the sub-antimicrobial dose effect on microbial resistance needs to be done in canines in the future.</p><p>OA is, by far, the most common type of arthritis in human and animals encountered worldwide, yet the development of effective disease-modifying treatments has lagged behind that of other arthritides. Current challenges that need to be met are an ideal pharmacy by using novel knowledge of the biochemistry, molecular biology and imaging findings that stop progression of disease and recovery of the cartilage function. This study showed one of the drugs which can be used as an OA disease-modifying drug, even though the efficacy was not as great as the positive control. However, comparing the cost-benefit of DOX, we believe that DOX will be the disease-modifying drugs of choice for treated OA in dogs. Indeed, the results of the present study suggest that using DOX 4 mg/kg daily for 6 months had no effect on the liver and kidney functions. This drug can improve the clinical signs of OA in a dog within 4 months. Moreover, we showed orally administered DOX can alter the anabolism of the articular cartilage. This information may prove useful for using DOX as disease-modifying drug in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude and thanks to all veterinarians and technicians at the Bone and Joint Research Laboratory, and the Small Animal Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University for their kind support.
