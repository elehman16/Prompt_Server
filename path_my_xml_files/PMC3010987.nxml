STF2.4&#x000d7;M2e (VAX102) is a recombinant fusion protein that links four copies of the ectodomain of influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e) antigen to <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin, a TLR5 ligand. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of giving VAX102 and TIV in combination in an effort to achieve greater immunogenicity and to provide cross-protection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Eighty healthy subjects, 18-49 years old, were enrolled in May and June 2009 in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial at two clinical sites.

Two weeks after immunization the HAI responses to the H1 and H3 antigens of TIV were higher in those that received TIV &#x0002b; VAX102 than in TIV &#x0002b; placebo (309 vs 200 and 269 vs 185, respectively), although statistically non-significant.

Vaccination is the primary method of prevention. Currently licensed vaccines require annual modifications since the vaccine is comprised of specific strain hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of the influenza viruses anticipated to circulate in the coming year. In addition, concerns have arisen about the immunogenicity and protection provided by trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in populations such as the elderly <xref rid="pone.0014442-Poland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Ideally, a vaccine that induces protective antibodies against viral structures of low or no variability could provide a constant level of long lasting immunity against influenza infection and provide sufficient immune stimulation to provide a protective response in the populations at highest risk for infection. One option is to use a vaccine with a genetically stable protein such as M2e along with TIV to increase immunogenicity and to provide greater cross-protection against other influenza A strains not represented in the seasonal vaccine.</p><p>The M2 protein of the influenza A virus ion channel is a non-glycosylated transmembrane protein that is expressed at high density in the cell membrane of viral infected cells and at low density in the lipid membrane of the mature influenza virus <xref rid="pone.0014442-Webster1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This protein undergoes little sequence variation, and antibodies to a component of the protein have provided significant protective activity in animal models <xref rid="pone.0014442-Treanor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. M2e alone does not produce a significant immune response in humans, but does when presented as four tandem repeats genetically fused to flagellin, a TLR5 ligand <xref rid="pone.0014442-Huleatt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This vaccine, designated VAX102 (STF2.4&#x000d7;M2e), was developed by VaxInnate Corporation as a cross-protective influenza A vaccine. The protein comprises <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin type 2, or fljB, (STF2; TLR5 ligand) fused to four tandem repeats of M2e at the C-terminus of flagellin <xref rid="pone.0014442-Huleatt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The M2e is similar to that of the M2e of the PR8 strain used in vaccine manufacturing except for 3 amino acid residues. It is produced as a fusion protein after purification in a prokaryotic fermentation system.</p><p>When STF2.4&#x000d7;M2e was injected with TIV into mice there was a 3 fold increase to the H1 component of TIV as measured by HAI compared to TIV alone (unpublished data). The stimulation of the innate immune system via the flagellin component of VAX102 appeared to be the possible mechanism to enhance the TIV response. Similarly, work using a synthetic TLR4 agonist given with TIV and an oil emulsion has shown greater IgG2a and IgG titers, higher HAI titers and type I cytokine responses in mice <xref rid="pone.0014442-Baldwin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These results suggest that VAX102 when given with TIV in humans would enhance the immunogenicity of TIV as well as provide better cross-protection for circulating strains through immunity to M2e. This immunopotentiation to TIV would be desirable for populations like the elderly who respond less well to TIV <xref rid="pone.0014442-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immunogenicity of this novel adjuvant-antigen in combination with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in young healthy adults 18&#x02013;49 years of age to determine if this combination is safe and able to immunopotentiate the response to TIV before testing in frail, elderly adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study, a phase I/II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, was designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 1 &#x000b5;g of VAX102 investigational vaccine administered with the previous season's TIV, compared to placebo &#x0002b; TIV in healthy young adults at two clinical centers.

Secondary objectives included the assessment of the immunogenicity of the VAX102 when given with TIV and the antibody response to TIV when given with VAX102 compared to TIV alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Safety assessment included visual assessment of the injection site on day of administration (predose) and at 30 minutes post-dose and on Days 1, 14 and 28; solicitation of local and systemic reactogenicity; and local and systemic reactogenicity reporting in the 7 days after vaccination. The immunogenicity assessment was determined by serum IgG responses to M2e and HAI was assessed before vaccination on Day 0 and on Days 14 and 28 after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample Size and Randomization</title><p>Selection of sample size was based on a calculation using 80&#x00025; power, a type I probability of 0.05, and a 40&#x00025; higher rate of seroconversion of the TIV &#x0002b; VAX102 arm compared to the TIV &#x0002b; placebo arm. The study was not powered to detect a difference of less than 40&#x00025;. The randomization was done by block randomization, block size fixed at 4, and was stratified by clinical site. Eligible subjects were assigned to an arm according to a randomization code provided by an independent statistician. The independent statistician provided the randomization information to the investigational pharmacist or designee. Investigational vaccine was prepared by an unblinded investigational pharmacist who was not involved in vaccine administration or subsequent clinical assessments. Sponsor personnel involved in generation and recording of immunogenicity assays were blinded until all assays and repeats were completed and final data sets were provided to data management personnel and locked in the database.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The study hypothesis was that VAX102 vaccine when administered with TIV, intramuscularly, would be generally well-tolerated and would elicit M2e and HAI antibodies greater than, those elicited by the placebo with TIV delivered intramuscularly. Immunogenicity parameters included the geometric mean of pre- and post-vaccination anti-M2e and HAI serum antibody concentrations and the proportion of subjects with an M2e and HAI specific antibody after vaccination. In general, categorical variables were summarized by study arm as frequencies and percentages in each category. Continuous variables were summarized by study arm as numbers of subjects, means, standard deviations, medians, and minimum/maximum values. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to calculate p-values for the geometric means. Statistical analyses were performed at the two-sided significance level of &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 unless otherwise stated. No adjustments were made for multiple statistical testing. All programs for data output and analyses were written in SAS&#x000ae; version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and STATA<sup>TM</sup> version 9 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p><p>All analyses were based upon a per-protocol cohort with additional analysis performed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) cohort. The per-protocol cohort is defined as all volunteers who completed immunization. The primary immunogenicity population consisted of all subjects who received immunization and had baseline and post-baseline anti-M2e serum antibody or HAI titers. Safety and tolerability analyses included all subjects and included descriptive statistics. Frequency of vaccination site abnormalities; incidence of local and systemic AEs and their relationship to the study drug; and changes in clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and physical examination findings were the primary safety measures.</p><p>Anti-M2e or HAI serum antibody titers were listed and summarized for each time point that data were available. The mean change from baseline to Day 14 and 28 (&#x000b1;2) in the log-transformed anti-M2e or HAI serum antibody reciprocal titers were compared to zero within treatment arms using t-tests and the data was assumed to be log-normally distributed. The 95&#x00025; CI for the geometric mean was calculated by deriving the 95&#x00025; CI around the mean on the log scale and then taking the antilog of the confidence interval on the log scale. HAI results were also stratified by gender. Seroprotection was defined as a post-vaccination HAI titer of &#x02265;1&#x02236;40 and seroconversion was defined either as an initial titer &#x0003c;10 and a post-vaccination titer &#x02265;40 or as an initial titer &#x02265;10 and a four-fold rise or greater increase in titer compared to baseline. Seroconversion for M2e was defined as having a 4-fold or greater increase in anti-M2e antibody concentration compared to baseline and having a post-baseline value &#x02265;0.174 &#x000b5;g/mL of IgG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 80 subjects were enrolled (40 at each site) during May and June 2009.

Only one of these, injection site erythema, was considered to be due to the injection.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0014442-t005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0014442.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) Antibody Response to M2e and flagellin and CRP response after one dose of VAX102.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0014442-t005-5" xlink:href="pone.0014442.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TIV &#x0002b; Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TIV &#x0002b; M2e</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Days post-vaccination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">&#x0002a;</xref>

Although limited by sample size, this study did show a statistically non-significant increase of approximately 1.5 fold in the GMT of the HAI response to both H1N1 and H3N2. In contrast there was little difference in the influenza B component. The immune response to influenza B was the highest compared to the other antigens and it is unlikely that they could be further enhanced with the addition VAX02. Further, in contrast to the 24 residue M2 ectodomain of influenza A, the M2 ectodomain of influenza B has only 7 residues. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Ohigashi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> Thus it is unlikely that A/M2e could enhance the immune response of influenza B. The seroprotection and seroconversion rates were similar for both arms but this is likely due to the high baseline titers in both arms (likely due to a history of prior vaccination and infection) and due to the historically good responses seen to vaccination in this age group compared to adults &#x02265;65 years of age. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Goodwin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> In a recent study by Falsey et al. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Falsey1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> a high dose TIV with a 4-fold increase in HA content was only able to induce a 1.7 fold increase in H1N1 or H3N2 titer in older adults. The current study, performed in young adults, produced a similar rise of 1.5 fold. Interestingly the greatest fold change was seen in men. Two factors appeared to account for this difference. One was that females had a 2&#x02013;3 fold higher response than males. It appears that if the response is poor than M2e can enhance the response, but if the response is strong the addition of M2e does not add much. Gender differences have been previously seen with pertussis vaccination where women had a slightly lower antibody response than men <xref rid="pone.0014442-CherryJames1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>VAX102 also produced an immune response to M2e which was not noted in the placebo arm. Even though the M2e component of VAX102 has a difference of 3 amino acids compared to the PR8 virus which is used for vaccine manufacturing, a prior study has shown that mice are able to generate immune serum that will react to M2e from multiple different origins. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Antibodies to M2e are protective in animal models, <xref rid="pone.0014442-Treanor1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014442-Huleatt1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> but there are no clinical studies testing the efficacy of M2e or any estimates of immunologic correlates of protection. Future studies will need to determine the level of additional protection provided by anti-M2e antibody and increased HAI antibody titers. CRP responses were elevated in the arm that was immunized with TIV &#x0002b; VAX102 but not in the arm that received TIV &#x0002b; placebo. CRP rises when interleukin-6 is elevated which is most likely due to the stimulation of the TLR5 receptor by flagellin. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Black1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> TIV alone does not induce this type of response. The stimulation of the innate immune system by flagellin is what induces the M2e antibody response and appears also to enhance the response to the hemagglutinin component of TIV. The M2e component of VAX102 is derived from the consensus sequence of human influenza A strains. It is interesting that VAX102 increased the immune response to the influenza A components of TIV, namely the H1 and H3 components but did not improve the B component. The response to the B strain was the highest of all three antigens and it is possible that it was maximally stimulated.</p><p>Due to the concerns about the effectiveness of the current TIV in older adults, Poland et al. <xref rid="pone.0014442-Poland1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> summarized the available and previously tested influenza vaccines and influenza vaccine strategies to improve the effectiveness of the current TIV. The combination of VAX102 &#x0002b; TIV would be another possibility for an improved vaccine formulation. The increased immunogenicity and addition of greater strain cross-protection would theoretically increase the number of senior citizens protected from influenza.</p><p>This preliminary work has shown the VAX102 when used in combination with TIV to have the potential to improve the immunologic response to TIV alone. This combination may have promise in high-risk populations such as the elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014442.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(0.22 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014442.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014442.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.36 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014442.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to acknowledge Virginia Suppers, Arthi Krishnappa and Olivia Linton for their technical assistance.
