Vitamin E (&#x003b1;-tocopherol) at dose level 100 &#x003bc;molL<sup>-1</sup> provides attenuation over the histopathological changes generated by pesticide atrazine (100 nmolml<sup>-1</sup>). Small pieces (approximately 1mm<sup>3</sup>) of testicular tissue were divided into three groups (one control group + two experimental groups). Experimental group (A) was supplemented with 100 nmolml<sup>-1</sup> concentration of atrazine and experimental group (B) was supplemented with 100 nmolml<sup>-1</sup> atrazine and 100 &#x003bc;molL<sup>-1</sup> concentrations of vitamin E (&#x003b1;-Tocopherol) and harvesting was carried out after 1, 4 and 8 hrs of exposure. Control was run along with all the experimental groups. In the experimental group (A) treated with atrazine at dose level 100 nmolml<sup>-1</sup>, revealed histomorphological alterations in the seminiferous tubule. After one hour of exposure duration small vacuoles in cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells and spermatogonia were observed. Chromolysis at pycnosis were also noticed in the spermatogonia and spermatids. In the experimental group (B) exposed with atrazine and simultaneously supplemented with Vitamin E also showed degeneration but it was milder as compared with experimental group treated with atrazine without antioxidant. Atrazine exposure induced a decline in diameter of spermatocytes from 10.51 &#x000b1; 0.2052 &#x003bc;m in control to 7.915 &#x000b1; 0.2972, 7.5 &#x000b1; 0.211 and 7.14 &#x000b1; 0.225 &#x003bc;m after exposure of 1, 4 and 8 hrs respectively but in case of atrazine supplemented with vitamin E [experimental group (B)], there was less decline in cell diameter that was 8.5 &#x000b1; 0.1865, 8.1 &#x000b1; 0.1201 and 7.8 &#x000b1; 0.2066&#x003bc;m after exposure of 1, 4 and 8 hrs respectively.

Different endocrine disruptors may not be released individually, into the environment at levels that would exert substantial risks, but the effects of chronic low levels of exposure of the endocrine disrupting chemicals are of concern.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It has been reported that DDT present in the environment was the reason of broken eggs of predatory birds, which results in a sharp decrease in their number around the Great Lakes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Unabated pollution of the environment is considered to be a major reason for the decline of human semen quality over the years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Atrazine, the agricultural pesticide, once one of the most widely used pesticide all over the world, is now recognized as an endocrine disruptor and to have disrupting effects on the reproductive systems of mammals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] More dramatically, it has been shown that fertile men in an agricultural area of Missouri have lower sperm counts (about 40%) than men in three urban US areas, and also have higher concentrations of three currently used pesticides in urine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] It has been reported that environmental toxicants such as lindane, di-n-butylphthalate nonylphenol, methoxychlor, and dioxin induced oxidative stress in the testes and epididymal sperm of rats and thus results in decrease in reproductive potential in animals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Endocrine disrupting chemicals disturb the pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant system of the cells leading to the generation of oxygen free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Mammalian spermatozoa, being rich in membrane bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), are more susceptible to ROS attack, and makes them more vulnerable targets of ROS-producing polychlorinated biphenyls.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In spermatozoa, several antioxidant systems as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] are operating for their normal functioning. In addition, it has been observed in earlier study that alpha-tocopherol is found in various amounts in testicular cells of rat in the order of Sertoli cells greater than pachytene spermatocytes greater than round spermatids, with a factor of 4 in the alpha-tocopherol content between Sertoli cells and round spermatids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Antioxidant therapy appears to be efficient not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Testicular tissue sections (5 &#x003bc;m) stained with haematoxylene and eosin revealed normal histoarchetecture of the seminiferous tubules in control group.

Sertoli cells and all types of the germ cells were present in the seminiferous tubules and were arranged in the specific manner. Spermatogonia were present at the basal portion and next to these spermatocytes occupy the middle potion. Spermatids form the next layer and then mature elongated spermatozoa were present toward the lumen of the seminiferous epithelium.
