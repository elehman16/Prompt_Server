Due to the characteristics of new drugs, including relatively low physical dependence, severe psychological dependence, and strong hallucinogenic and excitatory effects, there is a tendency that they would replace traditional drugs. The monitoring data on domestic drug abuse in 2014 showed that amphetamines count among the most important drugs, accounting for about 36.8%, and top new drugs abused, accounting for 70.5%.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Harms due to amphetamines show a high incidence trend<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>; the induced mental disorders not only result in personal health damage, but also affect social security, such as &#x0201c;drug driving.&#x0201d; The common symptoms of mental disorders due to amphetamine include agitation, aggressive behavior, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, and depression.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>Currently, treatment of mental disorders due to amphetamines is generally symptomatic, with no potent medication available. In China, the revised version of &#x0201c;The guidelines of Amphetamine Drug Dependent Diagnosis and Treatment&#x0201d; published in 2009 clearly proposed that antipsychotics could be used to treat psychiatric symptoms, pointing out that psychological treatment is a therapeutic option.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, studies found that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation and electrical shock can also be used for the treatment of mental disorders.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> A review by Glasner-Edwards describes in great detail the important role of antipsychotics in the treatment of psychiatric symptoms due to amphetamines, while emphasizing the importance of psychotherapy and social rehabilitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>The treatment principle of the Chinese guidelines clearly points out that olanzapine and haloperidol can be used when psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusion, excitement, and agitation, occur in patients abusing amphetamine.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Relevant clinical studies both in China and abroad have confirmed that atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, and clozapine, show better efficacy in the treatment of mental symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Indeed, Leelahanaj et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> found that olanzapine and haloperidol have better therapeutic effects on psychotic symptoms during a 4-week observation; Yap et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> also confirmed that olanzapine has higher effects in emergency treatment for controlling excitatory symptoms.

Exclusion criteria were: dependence on other nonamphetamine-type psychoactive substances; suicidal behavior or serious suicidal tendency; combined with serious physical illness; a history of mental illness; serious impulse and self-injury behaviors; antipsychotic treatment prior to enrollment; allergic reactions to olanzapine or haloperidol; and pregnancy or lactation in women. Treatment termination criteria were: serious adverse reactions; informed consent withdrawal; abnormalities in laboratory or specific examinations, with the clinician deciding the unsuitability of the case to continue; lack of treatment response or disease aggravation after 2 weeks of treatment; and suicide thoughts or other serious diseases. This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the participating units. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p><p>Complete data for a total of 124 patients were collected, including 63 cases in the olanzapine group (42 males and 21 females), and 61 in the haloperidol group (44 males and 17 females).

The dose was gradually increased according to the tolerance of patients during the treatment period; the dose could be adjusted at any time. Moreover, the patients were administered twice daily (noon and night). The patients were not treated with antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and nonspecific anxiolytics. Clonazepam at 1 to 4&#x0200a;mg/day was coadministered at night with sleep disorder not improving; benzhexol at 2 to 6&#x0200a;mg/day was supplemented in case of extrapyramidal reactions; propranolol at 20 to 60&#x0200a;mg/day was used for tachycardia or akathisia; and vitamin B6 at 30 to 60&#x0200a;mg/day should be added for gastrointestinal reactions.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Evaluation of efficacy and adverse drug reactions</title><p>The therapeutic effects were evaluated by BPRS. Including of 5 factors (anxiety and depression, lake of vitality, thinking problems, activation, and hostile suspicion), BPRS was used to assess the psychopathological symptoms by psychiatrists who finished the training and passed the consistency check with a satisfied result. On the basis of the psychiatrists&#x02019; observations and the patients&#x02019; statements, 18 items with scores ranging from 0(absent) to 7(most severe) were scaled and valued. Efficacy was determined by the rate of BPRS reduction 4 weeks after treatment, and reduction rate &#x02265;60% reflected a significant effect; reduction rate &#x02265;30% was considered to indicate effectiveness. Clinical Global Impression Scale Item (CGI-SI) 2 was used to evaluate the onset time, as follows: 0, no evaluation; 1, very obvious improvement; 2, obvious improvement; 3, improvement; 4, no changes; 5, slight degradation; 6, obvious degradation; and 7, very obvious degradation. All evaluations were performed based on the changes of clinical symptoms. Onset time was assessed by the required time to achieve CGI-SI evaluation as &#x0201c;improvement.&#x0201d; Serious adverse events and abnormal results in auxiliary examinations with clinical significance were timely recorded, and their correlations with medicine assessed by clinicians. For patients with abnormal auxiliary examination results but without clinical significance, or those with abnormal auxiliary examination results and clinical significance but with approval from guardians, treatment could be continued.

Meanwhile, olanzapine was superior in improving anxiety and depression, lack of vitality, and thinking disorders.</p><p>Mental disorders due to ATSs are widespread in the abuse population with psychotic symptoms as the main concern.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> ATS has broad effects on the central nervous system, which has an effective role in the dopamine (DA) system.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> ATS may confer to drug abusers a sense of strong pleasure by increasing the release of DA in some areas of the cerebrum; meanwhile, DA dysfunction in long-term abusers may directly cause other psychotic symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In the clinical diagnosis and treatment of ATS abusers, studies<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> have revealed that ATS drugs produce effects similar to schizophrenia. In addition, ATS has significant interference on the 5-HT system in the brain.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Mood changes in patients with acute poisoning or long-term smokers are correlated with 5-HT dysfunction. Relevant basic research<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> has demonstrated that ATS causes anxiety and depression, emotional indifference in humans, and the corresponding behavioral changes in animals.</p><p>Olanzapine is used as an atypical antipsychotic; its functional receptors are mainly 5-HT2 and D2 receptors, and its affinity to 5-HT2 is greater than that to D2. Related studies found that olanzapine is more effective in schizophrenia patients with anxiety and depression.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> This study also confirmed that olanzapine had better effects in improving emotional symptoms such as anxiety and depression at the early stage of treatment. These effects were better than those of haloperidol, which may be related to the 5-HT receptor. Olanzapine more pronouncedly improves psychotic symptoms due to ATS, which is consistent with previous findings.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Moreover, it exerted good antipsychotic effects with few extrapyramidal adverse reactions and better adherence; this may be related to the affinity of D2 receptor of 60% to 80%.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, blockade of olanzapine to M and H1 receptors may explain the presence of excessive sedation and constipation.</p><p>Haloperidol is a D<sub>2</sub> receptor blocker with simple action. This study found that haloperidol was ideal in improving psychotic symptoms, but did not significantly improve anxiety and depression, which may be related to its simple action on D<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, with the improvement of psychotic symptoms, clinical signs secondary to psychotic symptoms were gradually alleviated. This difference with olanzapine may be related to the singularity of its receptor. Meanwhile, we also found that early beneficial effects of olanzapine on factors such as anxiety and depression may be correlated with its impact on the 5-HT2A receptor.</p><p>In addition, adverse reactions of olanzapine were significantly fewer than those of haloperidol, which made olanzapine more easily accepted by the patients despite related excessive sedation and weight gain.</p><p>This study did not include more detailed and quantified horizontal comparisons for medical doses and degrees of adverse reactions; meanwhile, this trial was also limited by the short observation time. These limitations will be addressed and improved in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ATS = amphetamine-type stimulant, BPRS = Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, CGI-SI = Clinical Global Impression Scale Item, DA = dopamine.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>XX and YS contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0051/128740.html">http://www.sda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0051/128740.html</ext-link>.
