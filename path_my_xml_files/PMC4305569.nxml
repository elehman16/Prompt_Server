(TENS) on pain in patients with spinal cord injury. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty-two
spinal cord injury patients with central pain were randomly allocated into two groups TENS
and control with 26 subjects per group. The patients in TENS and control groups were
treated with TENS and sham TENS for 20&#x02005;min (three times a week) for 12 consecutive weeks,
respectively. The two group&#x02019;s pain was assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) and the
McGill Pain Questionnaire (including pain rating index-total, pain rating index-affective,
pain rating index-sensory, present pain intensity, and number of words chosen) before and
after the treatment. [Results] After the intervention, we found significant differences in
VAS, pain rating index-total, pain rating index-affective, pain rating index-sensory,
present pain intensity, and number of words chosen between the TENS group and the control
group. [Conclusion] Our results suggest that TENS effectively decreases pain in patients
with spinal cord injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pain is a common and serious problem in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI), and it
may have negative effects on quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. SCI patients with severe pain have difficulty in performing daily
activities and participating in social events. A recent survey<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that 77.7% of SCI patients have moderate or severe painand
pain interference with function and health status is significantly high among the subjects
with more severe pain. Moreover, in the USA, the total annualized cost due to pain is
$26,270 (direct cost: $8,636, indirect cost: $17,634) per SCI patient.</p><p>Different drugs are used to relieve pain in SCI patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, all medications have potential side effects and some are
serious<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Electrotherapy, a noninvasive
and inexpensive technique, is being used by an increasing number of physical therapists to
treat pain in SCI patients. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is mostly
used in electrotherapy methods to relieve pain. Many studies have shown that TENS is
effective for a wide variety of pain, e.g. cancer pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, neuropathic pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and low back pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TENS is a safe therapeutic intervention with few or no associated side effects for most
people. Many clinical papers have reported the positive effects of TENS in pain management,
but controversy exists over the treatment conditions for TENS and the appropriate parameters
of its use<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, a few randomized controlled trials have focused on
TENS for relieving pain to determine its therapeutic effect on SCI patients. If TENS were
shown to be an effective method of alleviating pain in SCI patients, it would decrease
medical costs and improve quality of life.</p><p>We conducted this study to determine the efficacy of a 12-week TENS treatment versus sham
TENS treatment on the pain intensity of SCI patients. We hypothesized that TENS treatment
would greatly reduce pain intensity compared to sham TENS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The SCI patients (<italic>n</italic> = 52) were recruited from the Department of
Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation Medicine, Shanghai Kaiyuan Orthopedics Hospital in
Shanghai, China. None of the SCI patients had previously received TENS treatment. A
computer-generated random-number sequence was used to assign the patients to either the
TENS group (<italic>n</italic> = 26; mean age &#x000b1; SD, 35.5 &#x000b1; 9.0&#x02005;years) or to the control
group (<italic>n</italic> = 26; mean age &#x000b1; SD, 33.6 &#x000b1; 8.5&#x02005;years). The inclusion criteria
were: over 18&#x02005;years old; suffering from pain; and diagnosed as having SCI. The exclusion
criteria were previous treatment with TENS or pain evoked by specific conditions or
pathologies, such as urinary infection, severe spasticity, or a pressure ulcer.</p><p>Prior to the study, all patients completed a questionnaire on their personal details,
including age, sex, and medical history. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects
prior to their inclusion in the study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Shanghai Kaiyuan Orthopedics Hospital, China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The SCI patients were treated with TENS using a PHYSIOMED machine (PHYSIOMED-Expert,
Physiomed Elektromedizin, Germany). Two electrodes were placed on the region with pain.
The patients in the TENS group were treated with TENS for 20&#x02005;min three times a week for 12
weeks. The treatment parameters of TENS were as follows: pulse frequency, 2&#x02005;Hz; pulse
duration, less than 200&#x02005;ms; and pulse amplitude, 50 mA. The patients in the control group
were treated with sham TENS (electrodes were placed but no stimulation was given) for
20&#x02005;min three times a week for 12 weeks. All TENS applications in each group were conducted
by the same licensed physiatrist. We ensured that the treatment parameters of the machine
were not changed by the patients.</p><p>The measurement of pain intensity was administered by the main research assistant who was
blinded to the group allocation before and after the treatment. The McGill Pain
Questionnaire (MPQ)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> is a self-report
questionnaire used to assess the pain intensity of SCI patients. A higher MPQ score
indicates a more serious pain. The quantitative data of the MPQ used in this study
included the Pain-Rating Index-Total (PRI-T; score 0 to 78), the PRI-Affective (PRI-A;
score 0- to 14), the PRI-Sensory (PRI-S; score 0 to 42), the present pain intensity (PPI,
score 0 to 5), and the number of words chosen (NWC; range 0 to 20). Visual analog scale
(VAS)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> was also used to evaluate
pain intensity. VAS uses a 100-mm horizontal line marked from 0 to 10 from left to right,
with zero representing &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d;, and 10 representing the &#x0201c;worst possible pain&#x0201d;. Subjects
marked the point on the line that represented their perception of their current state. The
amount of pain that patients feel ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount
of pain.</p><p>SPSS 17.0 and Microsoft Excel 2007 software were used to perform statistical analyses.
Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The independent samples t-test and
the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were used to compare the two groups at the baseline. Two-way
repeated measures ANOVA (group &#x000d7; time) was used to compare the MPQ and VAS outcomes of the
TENS group with those of the sham TENS group. The paired t-test was used to compare the
changes in the measurement values within the groups when the ANOVA result was significant.
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study design is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing the study protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-023-g001"/></fig>.

relieving the pain of SCI patients. Based on the VAS, PPI-T, PRI-S, PRI-A, PPI, and NWC
outcomes, our results suggest that 12 weeks of TENS relieves the pain of SCI patients. Our
results also show that pain was significantly relieved in the TENS group unlike in the
control group. The results demonstrate that TENS treatment demonstrate beneficial effects
for SCI patients.</p><p>TENS is a simple and non-invasive analgesic treatment, which is extensively used by
physiotherapists<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. TENS is mainly used
to relieve acute and non-malignant chronic pain. The mechanism of TENS in pain relief is not
well understood; however, gate control theory provides the most widely accepted explanation
of the mechanism<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gate control theory
postulates that the pain gate can be closed by the activity of large diameter A&#x003b2; afferents,
preventing the transmission of noxious information. The closed pain gate results in low
noxious information reaching the brain from the spinal cord, decreasing the sensation of
pain. Therefore, the aim of TENS interventions is to activate A&#x003b2; fibers using electrical
currents.</p><p>Our results are consistent with those of previous studies<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> which reported the
effectiveness of TENS in the pain relief of SCI patients. Celik et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed the effects of TENS treatment versus sham TENS on
pain intensity. A total of 33 SCI patients with pain were enrolled in their study, and the
patients were randomly assigned to the TENS and control groups. The TENS group was treated
with 30&#x02005;min of TENS and the control group with 30&#x02005;min of sham TENS, daily for 10 days. Celik
et al. reported that TENS effectively relieved the pain of SCI patients. A limitation of
their study was the treatment period (only 10 days). In our study, SCI patients were treated
with TENS for 20&#x02005;min three times a week for 12 weeks. Another study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the effects of TENS on 24 SCI patients with pain.
The results revealed the positive effect of TENS on the pain of SCI patients. However, a
control group was not included in that study. In contrast, we conducted this study to
determine the efficacy of a 12-week TENS treatment versus sham TENS treatment on the pain
intensity of SCI patients.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, the sample size of the subjects was insufficient
for generalization of the results. Second, a follow-up was not performed, and finally, we
did not compare the efficacy of low frequency TENS with that of high frequency TENS or any
other electrotherapy because of the limited number of subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all the patients for their willingness to participate in this study.
