exercise on life satisfaction and the prevention of falls by the elderly. [Subjects]
Sixteen elderly subjects aged 65 or more, residents in nursing care facilities, were
randomly divided into two groups. [Methods] One group performed indoor gateball exercise
for 30 minutes a day, five times per week. The Tetrax fall index and life satisfaction
were measured before and after four weeks of gateball exercise. [Results] The indoor gate
ball exercise group showed significant improvements in the fall index and life
satisfaction. [Conclusion] The indoor gateball exercise used in this study should be
considered as a therapeutic method for the elderly, for improving their life satisfaction
and because of its effectiveness in preventing falls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Key wordsElderly</kwd><kwd>Fall</kwd><kwd>Life satisfaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Falls and their accompanying injuries among the elderly, whose population is increasing,
are common issues in modern society<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It
was reported that more than 30% of the elderly, aged 65 or more experience injury at least
once from a fall, and 50% of the elderly, aged more than 80, experience injury from a fall
every year, since the frequency of falls increases with age<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Human proprioception deteriorates with age, muscle strength weaken
and reflexes, the ability to cope with sudden events, decline with increase of age and due
to physiological changes related to the aging process. These declines in function adversely
influence balance, a common cause of falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that gateball can help the elderly to develop
human relations through socializing with others<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. But gateball can only be played by those who can move around
outdoors freely, and it requires the provision of athletic facilities. To address these
issues and to allow people to enjoy gateball indoors, gateball was modified for indoor play.
This study was conducted to investigate whether indoor gateball gives more relaxation than
outdoor gateball, and whether it is suitable for the elderly who have trouble performing
outdoor activities. We investigated the effects of indoor gateball on maintenance of
fitness, feelings of loneliness and quality of life, and whether indoor gate ball can be
used continuously as a physical fitness exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Sixteen elderly persons residing in nursing care facilities in Yong-in city, Kyong-gi do,
were selected as the subjects of this study. They took part in this study which lasted for
4 weeks from January to March 2013, after being randomly divided into two groups. Prior to
participation in the study, written informed consent, accepted by the local ethics
committee, was obtained from all subjects. The subjects who could understand this study&#x02019;s
substance, and had no musculoskeletal disorders or vestibular/hearing/visual organ
disorders. The average age of the experimental group was 69.68&#x02005;years and that of control
group was 71.62&#x02005;years. The average height and weight of the experimental group were
159.43&#x02005;cm and 59.11&#x02005;kg respectively, and those of control group were 160.43&#x02005;cm and
59.30&#x02005;kg, respectively. The gender ratio of the experimental group was 3 males to 5
females and that of the control group was 4 males to 4 females</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An oblong mat, 1 &#x000d7; 5 m<sup>2</sup>, was used. Scoring zones were set at both ends of the
play mat and the players hit the balls to both ends of the mat. A T-shaped mallet,
comprised of head and shaft, was used to strike the ball. One number, out of 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 10, is put on each of the six balls, each of which is 7.5&#x02005;cm in diameter. The number
assigned to each area where the hit ball stops becomes the player&#x02019;s score, and the player
will get double points if the hit ball stops in the area which has the same number as the
ball. The subject&#x02019;s general characteristics and performance data were entered into SPSS
version 18.0. The paired t-test was performed to examine changes within each group. The
independent t-test was used for inter-group comparison. The level of statistical
significance was &#x00251;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the four-week gateball intervention, the experimental group showed a statistically
significant improvement in the life satisfaction scale from 36.87&#x000b1;0.11 to 41.75&#x000b1;0.83
(p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group showed no significant increase, 37.50&#x000b1;0.22 and 38.06&#x000b1;0.45
(p&#x0003e;0.05), respectively. After the intervention, the experimental group showed a
statistically significant decrease in the Tetrax fall index, from 47.12&#x000b1;0.36 to 40.68&#x000b1;0.23
(p&#x0003c;0.05), but the control group showed no significant difference, 47.25&#x000b1;0.25 and
46.25&#x000b1;0.04 (p&#x0003e;0.05), respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Analysis of the causes of falls by the elderly, has identified postural sway as an index of
fall risk<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that the elderly
who participate in physical activities, are better not only in terms of cognitive behavior,
psycho-social characteristics and physical/medical health but also in terms of euphoria and
life satisfaction, compared to those who do not participate in physical activities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, the elderly suffer from social
isolation and economic difficulties as their physical strength deteriorates and their sense
of belonging and human relations declines without a steady job. Under such circumstances,
the elderly&#x02019;s life satisfaction deteriorates, and their stress increases to the point where
they pay little attention to physical activities in a state of no desire for living. The
reality of the elderly in this modern society is that they repeat this kind of vicious
circle without escaping from it. Consequently, sports suitable for the elderly are urgently
required, as sports can help the elderly to improve human relations, get rid of stress, and
maintain their physical strength through exercising regularly. The results of our present
study are similar to those of previous research in that the fall index showed a
statistically significant decrease (p&#x0003c;0.05) after the implementation of the gateball
exercise intervention. The more actively and consistently the elderly participate in
gateball activity, the more they can develop positive elements such as the cognitive aspect
of the consciousness of leisure activity and belief in leisure activity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This means that the elderly participating in indoor
gateball can interact with others and have expectations about their future. It also
signifies that indoor gateball exercise helps the elderly to be optimistic. The fall index
and life satisfaction degree of the elderly improved after the implementation of the indoor
gateball exercise, indicating that participation in sports helps the elderly to maintain
their daily living. The limited number of subjects for the experiment and the lack of time
given to the subjects for performing the exercises were limitations of this study. However,
this study discovered that indoor gateball can help the elderly with physical impairments
recuperate mentally as well as physically. Future studies should address these issues and
include subjects living in the community and care facilities in indoor gateball
activies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jansson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>S&#x000f6;derlund</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>A new treatment programme to improve balance in elderly
