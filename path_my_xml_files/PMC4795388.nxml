Mitomycin C is an antibiotic agent with antiproliferative properties and is metabolically activated into an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA, acting as a cell cycle nonspecific cytotoxic agent. It not only inhibits DNA replication, but also hinders mitosis and protein synthesis. Mitomycin C does not interfere with a metabolite required for DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis and therefore is not classified as an antimetabolite. MMC has an inhibitory effect on fibrosis and vascular growth both of which play important roles in tissue healing and scar formation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The results of glaucoma surgical procedures including trabeculectomy have been improved and lower intraocular pressure (IOP) levels have been achieved since the introduction of MMC. This improved success however, has been associated with a higher risk of both early postoperative complications including shallow anterior chambers, transient hypotony, wound leaks, conjunctival necrosis and choroidal effusions, and late complications such as hypotony maculopathy, excessively thin walled blebs, late onset bleb leaks and bleb associated infections.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The ideal concentration and duration of MMC application for trabeculectomy has not been established and surgeons may vary in their choice of concentration from 0.01% to 0.04% and duration of exposure from several seconds to 4 or 5 minutes in eyes with exceptionally high risk of failure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It appears that the rate of MMC related complications is associated with both the concentration and duration of exposure to this agent.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Decreased corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) is another recognized adverse effect associated with MMC use and has been evaluated in a number of ocular surface procedures including excimer laser refractive surgery, treatment of ocular surface neoplasia, and pterygium surgery. CECD is known to stabilize by 3&#x02013;6 months following exposure to MMC or mechanical stress to the endothelium; corneal endothelial repopulation and migration is believed to compensate for CECD loss in affected areas.</p><p>CECD loss associated with glaucoma surgery has been largely unexplored. MMC can be applied before or after scleral flap dissection; the latter sequence has been associated with increased surgical success rates.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Theoretically, intraocular penetration of MMC and hence possible endothelial cell damage, may be facilitated if the agent is applied after scleral flap dissection. The current study was designed to evaluate changes in corneal endothelial cell density following conventional trabeculectomy comparing two different methods of MMC application, that is, before versus after scleral flap dissection. We also compared success rates for these two surgical sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>This double-masked, randomized clinical trial included patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy for poorly controlled glaucoma at Labbafinejad Medical Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01297803.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Subjects 16&#x02013;80 years of age with juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG) who were scheduled for primary trabeculectomy were evaluated for enrollment. Eyes with any preexisting corneal endothelial abnormality, history of trauma or intraocular surgery were excluded. Eyes with congenital glaucoma, secondary glaucomas such as active uveitis, neovascular glaucoma and those associated with conditions such as aniridia, axenfeld-rieger, iridocorneal endothelial and Peters syndromes were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Informed Consent and Ethical Issues</title><p>The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Ophthalmic Research Center; written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or their legal guardians prior to enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Preoperative Evaluations</title><p>All eligible subjects were interviewed and underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological examination including slit lamp biomicroscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry, gonioscopy and fundus examination. Specular microscopy was performed using the Tomey EM-3000 (Tomey corp, Nagoya, Japan) at the center of the cornea by a masked technician. Corneal endothelial cell density, polymegathism and pleomorphism were measured before surgery and 1, 3 and 6 months after trabeculectomy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>Eyes were randomly assigned to MMC application before (Group A) or after (Group B) scleral flap dissection according to the duration of MMC application (1, 2, or 3 min). Randomization was stratified according to MMC application time to avoid the confounding effect of this parameter. The same concentration of MMC (0.02%) was used in all eyes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] All patients, the ophthalmologist who examined the patients and recorded postoperative data, the technician in charge of specular microscopy and the statistician involved in data analysis were unaware of patient identity and study group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Trabeculectomy was performed in the same manner by two experienced glaucoma specialists (SY and MP) in all cases. A superonasal or superotemporal fornix based conjunctival peritomy was performed followed by dissection of subconjunctival tissues and gentle hemostasis using wet-field bipolar cautery. At this stage the surgeon would choose the duration of MMC application based on factors such as patient age, type of glaucoma, level of glaucomatous damage, and conjunctival vascularity and texture. MMC was applied at a constant concentration of 0.02% in all eyes using 4&#x02013;5 pieces of soaked cellulose sponges under the whole area of conjunctival dissection; depending on randomization the surgeon would apply MMC under the conjunctiva flap at this stage or leave it until scleral flap dissection was completed. The scleral flap was trapezoidal, 3.5 mm at its base, approximately half scleral thickness and dissected into clear cornea in all cases. Placement of MMC-soaked sponges was identical in both groups meaning that in Group B, MMC was simply allowed to seep directly under the scleral flap without actually placing a piece of sponge directly under the flap. Next preplaced 10/0 nylon releasable sutures were placed at the corners of the scleral flap; this stage was followed by a paracentesis, internal block excision and a peripheral iridectomy. The scleral flap sutures were tied using 4 throws without locking the knot and filtration was titrated to reach a desirable endpoint of balanced filtration. Finally the conjunctiva was repaired using 10/0 nylon sutures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The main outcome measure was the percentage of change in endothelial cell density after the procedure; secondary outcome measures included IOP levels, the number of medications, success rates and complications. Complete success was defined as 6&#x0003c; IOP &#x02264;21 mmHg (criterion 1) and 6&#x0003c; IOP &#x02264;18 mmHg (criterion 2) without using glaucoma medications, partial success was defined as the same on a maximum of 2 medications, and total success was considered as the sum of complete and partial success rates. Failure was defined as IOP &#x0003e;21 or 18, and IOP &#x02264;21 or 18 mmHg using more than 2 topical medications, complete loss of vision, and reoperation for further IOP control. IOP levels, medications, success rates and complications were recorded at each follow-up visit; the minimum early postoperative follow-up schedule included days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 but outcomes of the study were assessed 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. Additional examinations were scheduled depending on the clinical condition and if complications were encountered. Study outcomes were evaluated and recorded by a masked ophthalmologist.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Sample Size and Statistical Methods</title><p>Sample size was calculated based on changes in endothelial cell density 6 months after the procedure. Based on a pilot study, the standard deviation (SD) of the percentage of change in endothelial cell density was 8 in both groups. We therefore required 54 eyes in each study group to be able to detect a difference of 5% in CECD loss between the groups with power of 90%.</p><p>Mean, SDs, and percentages were used to describe the study parameters. T-test, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney, Fisher's exact, and Chi-Square tests were used to compare parameters between the study groups. Analysis of Covariance was used to adjust for baseline effect. Repeated measure analysis with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied to evaluate changes within the groups. All statistical analyses were performed by a masked biostatistician using SPSS software version 17.0 (SPSS co, Chicago, IL, USA); the group label was uncovered after the analysis was completed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Initially 150 patients were assessed for eligibility; after applying the study criteria and obtaining informed consent, 108 eyes of 108 patients were enrolled.

Our RCT demonstrated comparable safety in terms of endothelial damage with these 2 different methods of MMC application, that is, before and after dissection of the scleral flap. We avoided direct application of MMC soaked sponges under the scleral flap and performed our routine surgical practice by applying MMC in the same manner in both groups allowing seepage of the antifibrotic agent underneath the scleral flap in Group B. Adverse effects of MMC could be dose dependent; we therefore used the same concentration (0.02%) of MMC in all eyes and also stratified eligible eyes based on the duration of MMC application prior to randomization to equally distribute eyes with different durations of use (i.e., 1&#x02013;3 min) into the study subgroups.</p><p>We observed no significant difference between our study groups in terms of CECD and polymegathism at any time interval, although pleomorphism was slightly better in Group B (MMC application after scleral flap dissection) at 6 months. Decreased CEDC and increased polymegathism which were observed at month 1 in both groups is compatible with initial stress and damage to the endothelium followed by compensatory enlargement and migration of residual cells in order to repopulate the damaged areas; this notion was reflected by improved cell density and reduced polymegathism at months 3 or 6, although these parameters failed to reach baseline values. Hexagonality was comparable between the 2 groups and reduced from baseline at month 1, a finding in line with the pattern of damage mentioned above. However the intergroup difference in hexagonality in favor of Group B at months 6, which was even higher than baseline values, is difficult to account for; causes for this observation may include instrument or measurement variability because one cannot expect an improvement in the percentage of hexagonal cells following intraocular surgery. A single study on 14 cases by Storr-Paulsen et al. reported significantly decreased CECD 3 months after trabeculectomy augmented with MMC but the change was not significant from month 3 to 12.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Similar to our study, these authors measured CECD changes in the center of the cornea and our findings are in line with the pattern of change they observed. Other studies on CECD changes after intraocular surgery have demonstrated that surgically induced changes, usually stabilize 6 months after intervention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Net IOP change and the percentage of IOP reduction was similar in both groups at all-time points. The number of anti-glaucoma medications was significantly reduced 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery in both groups and there was no significant difference between them in this regard. No significant difference was observed between the study groups in terms of complete and partial success rates at any follow-up interval. But overall success rate was higher in Group B at 6 months. This suggests a benefit from applying MMC after scleral flap dissection in terms of success rates. Other studies addressing success rates following trabeculectomy have had conflicting results; 3 groups of investigators have reported no difference with these 2 methods of MMC application, while 2 studies have demonstrated better success rates when MMC is applied after scleral flap dissection [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of similar studies on MMC application in trabeculectomy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOVR-10-391-g010"/></table-wrap><p>Tressler et al.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Vass et al.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Agarwal et al.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported no superiority with intrascleral MMC application while the studies by El Sayyad et al.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Prata et al.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have revealed improved outcomes with subscleral MMC application. The cause of greater IOP reduction with MMC application under both flaps may be simultaneous inhibition of Tenon's fibroblasts, and those causing scleral flap fibrosis. Furthermore MMC application under the scleral flap can be associated with greater intraocular penetration of the agent thereby reducing aqueous production by the ciliary body; this may also be the cause of the higher rate of hypotony we observed.</p><p>Our study groups were comparable in terms of the overall rate of significant complications or those requiring intervention; some conditions were observed with almost the same frequency with both methods of MMC application including bleb leaks leading to resuturing, and choroidal effusions requiring drainage. El Sayyad et al.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Agarwal et al.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also found no significant difference in complication rates with subconjunctival and subscleral/intrascleral MMC application. In contrast Tressler et al.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a greater need for posttrabeculectomy procedures with intrascleral MMC application. The latter study was performed applying MMC for 5 min, while in our study the maximum duration of application was 3 min. The higher duration of MMC application may be the cause of more posttrabeculectomy procedures required with the intrascleral method in Tressler's study.</p><p>Although in our study the rate of persistent hypotony and hypotony maculopathy with after-the flap MMC application was 4 times higher, this difference failed to reach statistical significance which is probably due to the small number of eyes with this condition. Facilitated MMC penetration after scleral flap dissection may be the cause of the higher rate of hypotony and hypotony maculopathy in Group B; a condition similar to that observed in myopic eyes, in which a thin sclera may predispose to hypotony maculopathy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We observed one case (2%) of bleb associated endophthalmitis in Group A which fortunately responded to intravitreal and intravenous antibiotics. This eye with POAG developed a thin cystic bleb following only 1 minute of MMC application before scleral flap dissection. The incidence of bleb related infections and bleb-associated endophthalmitis in large collaborative studies or those enrolling more than 1000 cases have revealed infections rates ranging from 0.45% to 5%.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated comparable corneal endothelial cell loss following trabeculectomy using 2 methods of MMC application, that is, before or after dissection of the scleral flap. Overall success rate was higher with after-the-flap MMC usage at 6 months but both sequences were associated with comparable levels of IOP reduction and similar rates of complications. Although hypotony was more common with MMC application after scleral flap dissection, the observed difference was not statistically significant.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
