Current medical management of OA is mostly palliative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being the mainstay of therapy. Reports of gastrointestinal adverse effects with traditional NSAIDs and cardiovascular adverse effects associated with selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have prompted the hunt for a better NSAID with no or minimal adverse effects.

The total period of treatment was 12 weeks.</p><p>The primary endpoint was clinical improvement in pain, disability, and range of movement. The secondary endpoint was patient's and physician's assessment, VAS and WOMAC composite scores. Adverse events and concomitant use of drugs if any were recorded throughout the study.

A total of 17 (56.6%) patients in etodolac group, 8 (26.6%) patients in lornoxicam group, and 18 (60%) patients in diclofenac group were assessed as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; with statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Significant improvement from baseline was reported in all patients of the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). At the end of study period, physician's and patient's assessment were in favor of lornoxicam-treated group as compared to etodolac- and diclofenac-treated group with significant difference between the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The results of our study are in accordance with a previous 12-week multicenter, randomized, parallel group study done to compare the efficacy and tolerability of lornoxicam and diclofenac in treatment of patients with OA of hip and/or knee with significant intergroup equivalence (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.033) in terms of improvements in disease activity (about 46%), pain intensity (42%&#x02013;48%), patient's and physician's global assessments.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Similar results were seen in other double-blind studies where lornoxicam was compared to other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, piroxicam, and indomethacin in patients with knee OA in terms of physician's and patient's overall assessments.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, the results in etodolac group were in conformity with a previous study, in which patient's and physician's global evaluation had improved by at least 64% of all etodolac-treated patients and 62% of all active-reference preparation-treated patients by the end of the study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In our study, all the study drugs were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events requiring hospitalization. Adverse events of the GIT are often a limiting factor for NSAID use such as mild dyspepsia and nausea which are eventually associated with reduced tolerability and noncompliance to the treatment protocol.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Better tolerability is likely to result in high compliance which was 93% in our study as confirmed by tablet counts and empty blister packs. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences in adverse experiences at baseline evaluation. The most common adverse effects reported includes mild-to-moderate degree GIT disturbances usually manifested as pain abdomen, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea with mild headache, or insomnia which were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) less in lornoxicam and etodolac group than in diclofenac group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. None of the patients reported cardiovascular adverse drug reactions (e.g., increased blood pressure or edema) or any hepatic function abnormality. A total of 11 patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse experiences out of which 4 (10.81%) occurred in etodolac-treated patients, 2 (5.4%) in lornoxicam-treated patients, and 5 (13.5%) in diclofenac-treated patients.</p><p>In our study, lornoxicam proved to be effective alternative in the treatment of OA, as illustrated by significantly better improvement in pain and functional indices of VAS and WOMAC, limited use of rescue medication, and satisfactory patient's and physician's global assessment. Physician's assessment differed slightly from patient's assessments, although both were in favor of lornoxicam over etodolac and diclofenac, along with lesser rate of adverse events. The rapid and long-lasting relief from OA symptoms with lornoxicam 16 mg/day suggests that it has good potential to reduce the disability due to the disease and improve the productivity.</p><p>Better improvement in symptomatology in lornoxicam group could be due to its potential to inhibit migration and release of superoxide from polymorphonuclear (PMN)-leukocytes, release of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) from human platelets and stimulate the synthesis of proteoglycans in cartilage in tissue culture in addition to cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in animal studies that lornoxicam prevents the bone destruction which occurs in OA in the adjuvant polyarthritic rat thereby accounting for some disease-modifying property of lornoxicam.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Lesser rate of adverse effects is due to the reason that unlike other NSAIDs, inhibition of cyclooxygenase by lornoxicam does not lead to an increase in leukotriene formation, as arachidonic acid is not moved to the 5-lipoxygenase cascade, in addition to its short plasma elimination half-life of 4 h further contributing to the minimization of the risk of adverse events.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Etodolac has also compared favorably with lornoxicam over diclofenac. The dose of etodolac in our study was an important distinction from the previous studies. The daily dose of etodolac investigated in European or South American studies was 600 mg.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Consistent with prescribing trends in the United States, a higher dose of 800 mg/day was administered in our study.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The results of our study show that etodolac is also an effective, well-tolerated alternative to traditional NSAIDs in the treatment of OA of the knee joint.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present work has concluded that etodolac, lornoxicam, and diclofenac are useful drugs in the treatment of OA, but lornoxicam led to significantly better improvements in pain and functional indices of WOMAC as well as overall patient and physician assessment compared to etodolac as well as diclofenac along with lesser rate of adverse events.</p><p>As pain is often the limiting factor in degenerate forms of arthritis, the main focus of treatment of OA is on provision of pain relief by NSAIDs. The outcome of our study that patients report significantly better pain relief during lornoxicam treatment is particularly important in the future trends of management of OA. The limitation of our study is it's open-label design. Hence, the results of present study need to be confirmed in larger double-blind, multicentric trials of longer duration.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
