dysplasia (BPD). Female MSC secrete more anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors as compared to male MSC. Whether the therapeutic efficacy of MSC in attenuating lung injury in an experimental model of BPD is influenced by the sex of the donor MSC or recipient is unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that female MSC would have greater lung regenerative properties than male MSC in experimental BPD and this benefit would be more evident in males.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective</title><p>To determine whether intra-tracheal (IT) administration of female MSC to neonatal rats with experimental BPD has more beneficial reparative effects as compared to IT male MSC.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><p>Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to normoxia (RA) or hyperoxia (85% O2) from postnatal day (P) 2- P21 were randomly assigned to receive male or female IT bone marrow (BM)-derived green fluorescent protein (GFP<sup>+</sup>) MSC (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/50 &#x003bc;l), or Placebo on P7. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), vascular remodeling, alveolarization, and angiogenesis were assessed at P21. PH was determined by measuring right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and pulmonary vascular remodeling was evaluated by quantifying the percentage of muscularized peripheral pulmonary vessels. Alveolarization was evaluated by measuring mean linear intercept (MLI) and radial alveolar count (RAC). Angiogenesis was determined by measuring vascular density. Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD, and analyzed by ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant differences in the RA groups. Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in a decrease in vascular density and RAC, with a significant increase in MLI, RVSP, and the percentage of partially and fully muscularized pulmonary arterioles. Administration of both male and female MSC significantly improved vascular density, alveolarization, RVSP, percent of muscularized vessels and alveolarization. Interestingly, the improvement in PH and vascular remodeling was more robust in the hyperoxic rodents who received MSC from female donors. In keeping with our hypothesis, male animals receiving female MSC, had a greater improvement in vascular remodeling. This was accompanied by a more significant decrease in lung pro-inflammatory markers and a larger increase in anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic markers in male rodents that received female MSC. There were no significant differences in MSC engraftment among groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Female BM-derived MSC have greater therapeutic efficacy than male MSC in reducing neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and vascular remodeling. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of female MSC were more pronounced in male animals.

This disease is a chronic multifactorial disorder that affects 12&#x02013;32% of infants less than 32 weeks of gestation, with most cases occurring in extremely low birth weight infants [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the last 2 decades, the characteristics of BPD have been modified by the use of prenatal corticosteroids, postnatal surfactant and gentle ventilation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; BPD is characterized by alveolar simplification, increased alveolar diameter and abnormal vascular development [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants are now surviving in greater numbers and BPD with its associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) now constitute a major source of morbidity and late mortality [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Unfortunately, therapeutic options are limited, with survivors experiencing an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Gender variability in BPD incidence has been described for several decades. Animal studies have demonstrated that gender not only influences lung maturation but also susceptibility to lung diseases [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Male mice are more susceptible to hyperoxic lung injury than female mice [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Population based data from the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network show that preterm males are more likely than females to develop BPD [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, in the MOSAIC cohort from ten European regions, multivariate analysis reveal that male gender is associated with an increased incidence of BPD [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, although the exact mechanisms underlying the gender-specific differences in BPD incidence remain unknown, female mice express less pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in response to hyperoxia [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Whether the efficacy of BPD therapies is modified by their interaction with the gender of the host is unclear.</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been studied extensively as therapeutic mediators in multiple diseases [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These cells are particularly attractive for therapy as they are relatively easy to expand, possess potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and pro-angiogenic effects, with low risk of inciting the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In rodent models of BPD, early administration of MSC is associated with improved alveolarization, decreased vascular remodeling, promotion of angiogenesis and improvement of PH [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a recent phase-1 clinical trial, administration of umbilical cord derived MSC to preterm infants at risk for BPD was shown to be safe and feasible, with some potential beneficial effects [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Data however remains limited on the most efficacious MSC population for lung regeneration in BPD.</p><p>Gender-specific differences in stem cell expansion capacity, differentiation potential, and secretome have been reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This sex-related difference in stem cell function is influenced by the stem cell population, recipient responses and the disease process. Female muscle derived stem cells regenerate skeletal muscle more efficiently than male cells but transplantation of male stem cells into female recipients or pre-treatment of male cells with estradiol fail to yield comparable regeneration, implying that gender-related differences in stem cell function may not be entirely dependent on sex hormones [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, infusion of female derived MSC was associated with more pronounced improvement in left ventricular dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, in a rat model of endotoxin mediated cardiac dysfunction, female MSC showed greater cardiac protection against endotoxemic injury and this was accompanied by an improvement in the myocardial anti-apoptotic profile [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In vitro data also shows that female MSC exposed to either lipopolysaccharide or hypoxia have less apoptosis, release less tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) and more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) than male MSC [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whether the therapeutic efficacy of MSC in attenuating lung injury in an experimental model of BPD is influenced by the sex of the donor or recipient is unknown.</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that female BM-derived MSC would have greater lung regenerative effects than male BM-derived MSC in a model of BPD, and the effects would be preferential to male recipients. We demonstrate in vitro that female MSC secrete more anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors as compared to male MSC. In vivo, we also show that female MSC have greater anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects as compared to male MSC in neonatal pups with experimental BPD. Moreover, female MSC more robustly improves neonatal hyperoxia-induced PH and vascular remodeling. Interestingly, in keeping with our hypothesis, female MSC improved vascular remodeling to a greater degree in male recipients than male MSC. These findings have important clinical implications for cell-based therapies in preterm infants with BPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male and female Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transgenic and pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from The Rat Resource and Research Center (Columbia, MO).

Pups were housed in a plexiglass chamber with O2 monitoring. Litters for each experimental group were limited to 10 pups to control for the effect of litter size on nutrition and growth. Studies were repeated with several litters in order to obtain an equivalent number of pups per experimental condition. Dams were rotated every 48 hours to standardize the nutrition provided to each litter. Oxygen exposure was continuous with brief intermittent interruptions for animal care (&#x0003c;10 min/day). After 3 weeks in the designated exposure, the litters were removed and studied for hemodynamic measurements and morphometry. The sex of the pups was determined by examining external and internal genitalia.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>MSC Administration</title><p>MSC obtained from the bone marrow of adult (6 to 8 week old) male and female GFP<sup>pos</sup> Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and cultured as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For intra-tracheal (IT) injection, fourth passage cells were thawed, assessed for viability, and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They were then re-suspended in PBS at 1 X10<sup>6</sup> viable cells/50 &#x003bc;l. A single IT dose of 50 &#x003bc;l was utilized for administration.</p><p>On P7, the pups were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine via intraperitoneal injection. The trachea was exposed through a small midline incision on the neck. MSC (1 X10<sup>6</sup> cells/50 &#x003bc;l), or phosphate buffered saline/PL (50 &#x003bc;l) was delivered by tracheal puncture with a 30-gauge needle. Pups were placed in a warmed plastic chamber under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions for recovery. Once the pups were fully awake, they were returned to their dams.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Hemodynamic Measurements</title><p>Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was evaluated as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

RVSP was measured and recorded on a Gould polygraph (model TA-400; Gould instruments, Cleveland, OH).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Morphometric Analysis</title><p>Lung morphometry was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, lungs were inflated and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at a pressure of 15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for five min. The samples were allowed to sit in PFA for 24 hours prior to serial dehydration in ethanol solutions the following day. The lungs were then embedded in paraffin.</p><p>Serial 5 &#x003bc;m-thick paraffin-embedded sections obtained from the lung were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images from 10 randomly selected, non-overlapping parenchymal fields were acquired from two lung sections of each animal at 20x magnification. Care was taken to exclude major bronchioles, vessel and artifacts from the field. Images were captured by a blinded observer, and the mean linear intercept, (MLI), a measure of inter-alveolar wall distance, and the radial-alveolar count (RAC), a measure of alveolarization were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Pulmonary Angiogenesis</title><p>Vascular density was evaluated as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Treatment with anti-inflammatory agents reduces PH and vascular remodeling in several lung injury models [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, female MSC are superior to male MSC in reducing monocrotaline-induced PH [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Another important finding in our study is the restoration of lung VEGF concentration to normoxic levels by female MSC. This is in keeping with prior findings of increased VEGF production in female MSC made by Crisostomo et al [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that plays an integral role in lung development. Neonatal hyperoxia-exposure decreases VEGF concentration [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and administration of recombinant VEGF improves neonatal hyperoxia-induced lung injury [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, in our study, sub-group analysis investigating gender donor-recipient interactions revealed that males with HILI benefited more from female MSC administration as compared to male MSC. This was accompanied by higher levels of pulmonary IL-10 and restoration of VEGF in this group of pups. This suggests that female MSC exert their superior regenerative properties by providing a more anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic state in the injured lung. Interestingly, our study did not demonstrate any difference in the degree of hyperoxia-induced lung injury between male and female rats. The profound lung injury in our model may have eliminated these differences in the host lungs. Other studies have however shown that male animals undergo more pronounced injury and develop a more severe form of PH [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is likely mediated by the differential expression of genes in response to injury between the two sexes; with males up-regulating pro-inflammatory pathways [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We postulate that male animals benefited more from female MSC as a consequence of the differential gene expression in response to lung injury between the two sexes [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and the potential effect of estradiol (E2) secreted by female MSC on the male recipient [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. E2 has been shown to increase the efficacy of male MSC in other models of injury [<xref rid="pone.0164269.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164269.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>It is also important to discuss the limitations of our study. Hyperoxia induced lung injury models parallel a more severe form of BPD which in now infrequently seen. Hence, it would be imperative to evaluate the efficacy of MSC from different sexes in milder lung injury models. We also studied engraftment using GFP<sup>pos</sup> localization. The GFP transgene is however unstable and as a result may have underestimated the degree of engraftment. Additionally, hyperoxia exposes multiple organs to injury through systemic inflammation and formation of circulating reactive oxygen species. It would therefore be crucial to examine the differential systemic effects of IT-MSC and any potential long-term side effects in future studies.</p><p>Our study however clearly demonstrates the superiority of female MSC in reducing lung inflammation, improving PH and hyperoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. These benefits were particularly evident in male animals with even more pronounced anti-inflammatory effects evidenced in these recipients. Our present findings have important implications as cell-based therapies to repair the injured preterm lung move from the bench to the bedside, providing firm evidence that female MSC are the more efficacious population to reduce severe BPD complicated by PH in male preterm infants.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0164269.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Northway</surname><given-names>WH</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name>, <name><surname>Rosan</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name>. <article-title>Pulmonary disease following respirator therapy of hyaline-membrane disease.
