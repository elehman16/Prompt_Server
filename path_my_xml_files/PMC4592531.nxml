The objective of this investigation was to test whether a recently developed disease systems analysis model for osteoporosis could describe disease progression in a placebo-treated population from the Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort (EPIC) study. First, we qualified the model using a subset from the placebo arm of the EPIC study of 222 women who had similar demographic characteristics as the 149 women from the placebo arm of the original population. Second, we applied the model to all 470 women. Bone mineral density (BMD) dynamics were changed to an indirect response model to describe lumbar spine and total hip BMD in this second population. This updated disease systems analysis placebo model describes the dynamics of all biomarkers in the corresponding datasets to a very good approximation; a good description of an individual placebo response will be valuable for evaluating treatments for osteoporosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p>WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? &#x02611; A complete mechanism-based model describing osteoblast and osteoclast activity has been reduced in order to apply it in a population approach.

However, in postmenopausal women, mainly due to the decline in estrogen levels during menopausal transition: 1) the activity of osteoclasts (cells responsible for resorbing mineralized bone) increases compared to the activity of osteoblasts (cells responsible for synthesis of new bone matrix); 2) osteoblast activity also increases, but with a delay. The combination of the two processes result in higher bone turnover. The rapid (menopause) and slow (aging) components of disease progression underlie elevated fracture rates in vertebrae and hip joints, increased mortality, and significant healthcare costs.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Various treatments exist that aim to either promote bone formation or inhibit bone resorption, yet postmenopausal osteoporosis still represents an ongoing clinical challenge with decreases in quality of life and increase in healthcare costs. Additionally, given the rapidly aging population (both men and women) the burden of this disease is expected to increase.</p><p>Disease systems analysis models are used to study treatment effects on disease progression within the context of interacting networks.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> By doing so, these models allow for the comparison of effectiveness and safety of different treatment options. In order to estimate the actual treatment effect it is essential to account for the time course of the drug and/or placebo effects and disease progression.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the placebo response and the underlying disease progression, this distinction is important for designing clinical trials and interpreting results. Furthermore, one of the premises of mechanism-based disease systems analysis models is that the model structure and the values of the system-specific parameters would ultimately be independent of the type of treatment. Therefore, in principle, they provide the opportunity to predict disease progression in another comparable population than the population that was used for model development and parameter fitting. In this study we will use the term &#x0201c;disease progression&#x0201d; for disease progression of the placebo arm of the Early Postmenopausal Intervention Cohort (EPIC) study in which all subjects took (at least) 500 mg calcium per day.</p><p>The objective of this study was to test whether a current disease systems analysis model for postmenopausal osteoporosis can adequately describe disease progression in a placebo-treated population of postmenopausal women. To this end, we focused on the contribution of the postmenopausal transition in combination with the placebo effect (i.e., calcium effect) on the osteoblast and osteoclast activity. For the current model, the placebo effect captures the response to daily calcium intake and the underlying disease progression. Variation in placebo response within and among clinical trials can substantially affect conclusions about the efficacy of new medications. Developing a robust population model to describe the placebo arm is of interest to enable quantification of drug effects, and eventually to guide the design of clinical trials for osteoporosis treatment. This outcome of the placebo arm is the result of individual placebo response (including the eventual effect of calcium intake) and progression of the disease.</p><p>For osteoporosis, different models have been proposed. The group of Peterson and Riggs have published a physiology-based mathematical representation of integrated calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> which they later extended to show nonlinear changes in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD) upon denosumab treatment, a monoclonal antibody that decreases bone resorption,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and to describe the impact of progressive loss of kidney function.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This group has also described estrogen-related changes in bone and calcium balance through menopause transition<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with an extension to fracture risks.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In their current form these extensive physiology-based models are challenging to apply in a population approach, which captures the existing variability in addition to the structural dynamics. In order to do so, Danhof and colleagues have shown that a full mechanism-based model of interacting osteoblast and osteoclasts can be reduced to a simpler model, which can describe the dynamics of the full model<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> to a very good approximation (for details on the simplification, see Ref.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The reduced model was then applied to clinical data from postmenopausal women receiving calcium and tibolone.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This reduced systems disease model ensures parameter identifiability and could describe the dynamics of biomarkers that respond at widely different timescales to drug treatment. Even though the Peterson and Riggs model describes cellular through organ level aspects involved in bone and calcium homeostasis, it also contains a high number of differential equations and parameters to be estimated. Due to this model complexity, we will here focus on the disease systems analysis model developed by Post <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In this study, we applied an osteoporosis disease systems analysis model<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> to the placebo arm of a clinical study from the EPIC study.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> It should be noted that the EPIC study was intended as an osteoporosis prevention study.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> As such, patients enrolled were thought to be at risk of osteoporotic bone loss, but they did not meet the usual criteria for low bone BMD that would define osteoporosis (see <bold>Methods</bold>). The range of &#x0201c;years since menopause&#x0201d; (YSM) in the EPIC study population (0.5&#x02013;27 years) is larger than in the population of the tibolone study (1&#x02013;4 years). A characteristic of the disease systems analysis model is that the timescale of the disease process is incorporated rather than the timescale relative to the start of the study. Therefore, this systems pharmacology approach allowed us to 1) qualify the disease systems analysis model using an external dataset; 2) develop a robust placebo model; 3) challenge the model with data over a longer time after the onset of the disease (e.g., the start of the menopause); 4) relate various timescales (short- and long-term biomarkers); and 5) directly address and describe the covariate YSM instead of it being a covariate at baseline. The latter was possible because YSM and not study time was used as the timescale in the model.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Subject population and study design</title><p>Data for the current analysis were obtained from the EPIC study, a clinical trial of oral alendronate in 1,609 postmenopausal women who were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive alendronate, placebo, or open-label estrogen-progestin in order to evaluate the potential to prevent osteoporosis. In this study we only used data from the placebo arm (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;470). Briefly, all participants were between 45 and 59 year of age and at least 6 months past menopause at baseline, were in good general health, and had no clinical or laboratory evidence of confounding systemic disease.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Four study centers (two in the United States and two in Europe) were involved in this trial. To ensure that most women who entered the study did not yet have osteoporosis, only 10% of the women enrolled at each center were allowed to have an LS-BMD below 0.8 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. All women adhered to therapy (had taken at least 80% of the prescribed number of tablets, confirmed by tablet count). Dietary calcium intake was estimated at baseline and annually during the study on the basis of a food-frequency questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of BMD and biochemical markers of bone turnover</title><p>BMD of LS and total hip (TH, defined as the femoral neck plus trochanter and intertrochanteric area) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (model 2000, Hologic, Waltham, MA) twice at baseline and annually thereafter. BMD is reported in g/cm<sup>2</sup>. Blood and morning second-void urine samples were collected after an overnight fast at baseline and every 6 months thereafter. Bone resorption was estimated by using urine N-telopeptide cross-links of type I collagen (NTX) (Osteomark, Ostex, Seattle, WA). NTX is reported as nmol bone collagen equivalents (bce) and corrected for creatinine excretion (nmol bce/mmol cr). In addition, the serum level of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) was measured at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, 36, 42, and 48 in a random sample of 205 women to estimate bone formation (Ostase, Hybritech, San Diego, CA). BSAP is reported in ng/mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism-based disease systems analysis model</title><p>In an earlier publication it was demonstrated that the completely mechanistic bone cell interaction model proposed by Lemaire <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which involves responding but not yet active osteoblasts (R), active osteoblasts (B), and active osteoclasts (C), can be mathematically reduced while maintaining its dynamic properties.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The reduced model is shown in <bold>Figure</bold>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Data from the EPIC study were split into two different datasets: EPIC 1, which only includes women with YSM between 1 and 5 years (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;222), and EPIC 2, which contains the entire range of YSM (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;470). EPIC 1 was created to have demographic characteristics as close as possible to the tibolone study and was used for qualification of the disease systems analysis model. EPIC 2 was used to challenge the model for a longer time after the onset of the menopause. This led to mean YSM for EPIC 1 and EPIC 2 that were, respectively, comparable and higher when compared to the tibolone study. Furthermore, mean age was somewhat lower in EPIC 1 but similar for EPIC 2 in comparison to the tibolone study. There was no meaningful difference between the two clinical studies in terms of BMI. Additionally, for EPIC 1 and EPIC 2 we observed a lower mean value for LS-BMD and TH-BMD. The biomarker for resorption, NTX, was higher in the two EPIC studies than in the tibolone study. NTX, a specific collagen degradation product, is produced by osteoclastic bone resorption. When bone resorption is accelerated, which is known to happen in response to estrogen deficiency,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> NTX levels in urine increase as well. BSAP, on the other hand, was measured using two different assays and is reported in different units.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In order to apply the model (see <bold>Methods</bold>) to this dataset two modifications were applied: first, a scaling parameter was introduced to account for the different units for BSAP in the two clinical studies. The baseline value for BSAP was fixed at the value found in the tibolone study (in units U/L) and we only estimated the value of the scaling parameter. This scaling parameter (&#x003bb;<sub>BSAP,0</sub>) affects the baseline value of BSAP:

<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). All parameter values were in accordance with the original values or with the available data and could be estimated with good precision. Goodness of fit plots indicated that there were no underlying trends of model misspecifications.

classical turnover models in which the loss term is omitted. For EPIC 1 (and the original tibolone study) this zeroth-order process turned out to be a good approximation. However, when analyzing all 470 women in the placebo arm of EPIC 2 a large deviation between model predictions and observed values was found for LS-BMD and TH-BMD, but not for the resorption (NTX) and formation (BSAP) markers. Likely this is due to the fact that a longer disease trajectory is being looked at. Therefore, we used an indirect response model for the BMD dynamics proposed by others.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Changes in BMD are described with osteoblasts and osteoclasts stimulating the production and degradation processes as:

The parameter values as shown in <bold>Table</bold>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> were used for these simulations. For both equations the change of BMD is determined by the balance between the relative changes in y and z (i.e., S&#x02009;=&#x02009;z/y). In <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref><bold>a</bold> it is shown how these relative quantities evolve as a result of the placebo treatment. Both models evolve towards a similar maximal value of S. The underlying dynamics for both models is different, however: the zeroth-order model has reached this maximal value already after 2 years, whereas the indirect response model reached this value only after 4 years. Note that S represents the ratio of relative osteoclast activity over relative osteoblast activity. Therefore, there is net bone loss if this ratio is bigger than 1 and net bone formation when it is smaller than 1. This can also be seen in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref><bold>b</bold>, where the change of LS-BMD (gray lines) and TH-BMD (black lines) over time is plotted and decreases as a result of disease progression. The difference in the two BMD equations can be seen from this plot: the zeroth-order response function (solid lines) has a concave shape, whereas the indirect response model (dashed lines) has a convex shape. This implies that right after onset of disease progression (e.g., beginning of the menopause) the change in BMD is largest. In addition, this change is bigger for LS-BMD compared to TH-BMD. These model predictions were compared to the available observations. So, for every individual we calculated the difference between baseline value and the latest available measurement for LS- and TH-BMD and plotted this difference vs. YSM. As shown in <bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref><bold>c,d</bold>, we also found the biggest change (i.e., decrease) in BMD at the LS and TH shortly after onset of menopause, and the absolute mean change was &#x0223c;25% higher in BMD at the lumbar spine compared to the total hip.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of zeroth-order and indirect response model for BMD dynamics.

The model is based on a mechanistic model describing osteoblast and osteoclast activity<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> that has been reduced in order to apply it in a population approach. It was shown that the model reduction did not jeopardize the dynamic properties of the model.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The reduced model was successfully applied to describe responses in treatment with various doses of tibolone and/or calcium in postmenopausal women.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The current systems pharmacology approach allowed us to test whether the original values of the system-specific parameters allowed for an adequate description of disease progression in a new (external) population. To this aim, we used the placebo arm of the EPIC study.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This led to a total of 470 women who received placebo treatment for a period of 4 years. Although others have looked at the modeling of placebo response,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> to our knowledge this is the first attempt to use a systems-pharmacology population approach for the description of osteoporosis disease progression in response to placebo treatment in an external population. Robust descriptions of the placebo response and disease progression are crucial for the quantification of treatment effects. The placebo effect, P<sub>CA</sub> (Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m3">3</xref>), was updated with an onset and offset parameter and was incorporated into the model in a mechanism-based manner: as an inhibitory factor of the RANK receptor occupancy as calcium promotes its effects on the RANK- RANKL-OPG system through PTH.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>It should be noted that all subjects in the tibolone study received 500 mg calcium carbonate once daily. In the EPIC study, dietary calcium intake from food sources was monitored using validated dietary questionnaires. Women with a calcium intake of less than 500 mg per day were advised to increase their intake (either by diet or supplements). In principle, all women in the EPIC study should thus also have received at least 500 mg calcium per day. Since this was monitored at center visits only via questionnaires, more variation in calcium intake could be expected for this study. In order to characterize the true calcium effect, data obtained following the administration of different doses of calcium would be needed.</p><p>The disease systems analysis model is a mathematical reduced version<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> of the cell interaction model as proposed by Lemaire <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The model reduction did not influence the model dynamics and bears the advantage that all remaining parameter values are identifiable despite the fact that the biomarkers available in this study respond at different timescales upon treatment with placebo. With all system-specific parameter values fixed at their published values, we showed that the model is able to adequately describe the dynamics of the biomarkers within the external population. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed that, with the exception of k<sub>estrogen</sub>, all systemic parameters could be reestimated with the current data and their values were in the same range as the previously reported values. Possibly, the heterogeneity in YSM in the population resulted in the large uncertainty of the k<sub>estrogen</sub> parameter. We anticipate that on the basis of individual serum estrogen levels a better description of the underlying disease dynamics will be feasible.</p><p>The most notable difference between the two clinical studies is the YSM at baseline. In the model the YSM are incorporated as the timescale of disease progression (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Inclusion of the entire range of YSM in our analysis required the adaptation of the equation for the BMD dynamics. The indirect response model<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> used in this study can be seen as a more extensive form of the (originally proposed) zeroth-order process. With this small adaptation we were able to describe the dynamics in all biomarkers for the entire range of YSM with good precision. Furthermore, the fact that the model also accurately describes disease progression far outside the timeframe compared to the timeframe that was used originally in the tibolone study provides evidence for the values of the system-specific parameters. These results provide a strong basis for the potential to use this disease systems analysis model to evaluate the (comparative) effect of other drugs with different mechanisms (e.g., bisphosphonates, unpublished data), or link the mechanism-based core of this model to different biomarkers.</p><p>The core model is defined to describe the dynamics as a relative change related to the information in the dynamics of the markers linked to it (based on their relationship to the system). We believe, and this should be tested, that all types of markers can be linked and inform such a system. Whether that holds remains to be seen based on available data. In contrast to the tibolone study, we did not have measurements on the biomarker osteocalcin available. Osteocalcin is a biomarker for the combined osteoblast and osteoclast activity. Osteocalcin is built into bone&#x02014;when bone is degraded it will become available again in the systemic circulation so the measurement is a composite of building and degradation of bone. We found that removal of osteocalcin from the model did not alter its performance. This also shows the strength of a disease systems analysis model; the core remains the same and the markers supplying the required information on the system can change, which is in contrast to empirical models where (single) marker(s) are directly linked. On the other hand, it remains to be seen how this removal will affect future applications of the model when other drug treatments are considered.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that a recently proposed disease systems analysis model for osteoporosis can be applied to describe the effect of the placebo treatment on disease progression in a new population. The mechanism-based model allowed for 1) an adequate description of the available biomarkers, 2) allowed for the inclusion of the years since menopause (the characteristic timescale in the model) that was more than five times longer than in the original model. These findings can be considered a first step towards model validation and qualification of this osteoporosis model, which will be further elaborated by also applying the model to other therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Lambertus A.
