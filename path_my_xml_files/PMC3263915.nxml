Common adjunctive treatments not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy include the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone (PIO), the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (SITA), and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide twice daily (BID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). PIO and exenatide BID are included in the second tier (less well-validated) of preferred agents in the ADA/EASD algorithm. SITA is not indentified, but may be an appropriate choice for selected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These agents, commonly used only in MET-intolerant patients as monotherapy, have unique risks, benefits, and mechanisms.</p><p>Effective and safe monotherapy treatment options for patients unable to tolerate MET are limited. In the United States, exenatide BID is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. A new formulation of exenatide (exenatide once weekly [EQW]) has been shown to result in greater improvements in glycemic control, with no increased risk of hypoglycemia and similar weight reduction compared with exenatide BID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This randomized trial (Diabetes Therapy Utilization: Researching Changes in A1C, Weight and Other Factors Through Intervention with Exenatide Once-Weekly [DURATION-4]) directly compared the safety and efficacy of EQW monotherapy versus MET, PIO, and SITA monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who were suboptimally treated with diet and exercise but naive to antihyperglycemic drugs.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of EQW compared with MET, PIO, and SITA, as measured by change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 weeks. Secondary and exploratory measures included the proportion of patients achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0 and &#x02264;6.5%, changes in fasting serum glucose, seven-point self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), weight, serum lipids, homeostasis model assessment of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S), and safety and tolerability. Patient-reported outcomes were collected, including Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lite (IWQOL-Lite), Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ), and EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D).</p><p>Safety end points were adverse events, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, hypoglycemia, and antibodies to exenatide. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as those occurring or worsening after the first dose of study drug. Minor hypoglycemia was defined as signs or symptoms associated with blood glucose &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L (either self-treated or resolved independently). Major hypoglycemia was classified as symptoms resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure that showed prompt recovery after administration of glucose, or documented blood glucose &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L that required the assistance of another person because of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior. A subset, defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia, was not confirmed by blood glucose measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>The protocol specified that 822 patients be enrolled, with at least 740 patients (10% dropout before first HbA<sub>1c</sub> collection) available for primary analysis. A sample of 740 patients (222 EQW and MET, 148 PIO and SITA) would provide &#x0223c;90% power to detect true differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> change of 0.4% (EQW vs. MET), 0.5% (EQW vs. PIO), and 0.5% (EQW vs. SITA), respectively (two-sided <italic>t</italic> test significance of 0.05 and common SD of 1.2%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A predefined noninferiority margin of 0.3% and sample size of 444 patients would provide 74% power to test the noninferiority of EQW versus MET, and a sample size of 370 would provide 65% power to test the noninferiority of EQW versus PIO (and SITA).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 820 patients in 22 countries participated between November 2008 and June 2010. Adults with type 2 diabetes met the following inclusion criteria: HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7.1&#x02013;11.0%, BMI 23&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and history of stable weight. Patients were excluded if treated with any antihyperglycemic drug for &#x0003e;7 days within 3 months of screening. Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication changes were only made if medically required.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Study design</title><p>Randomization was determined by computer-generated random sequence using an interactive voice response system. Treatment assignments were stratified by country. MET and PIO dosages were increased in weekly increments up to target doses of 2,000 and 45 mg/day, respectively. MET could be increased up to 2,500 mg/day based on glycemic control. Standard diet and exercise counseling was provided in each treatment group. Following 26 weeks, patients stopped study treatment and were allowed to follow diabetes regimens deemed appropriate by the investigator, with the exception of exenatide BID. Patients returned to the study sites 10 weeks after study end for collection of additional safety data.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were reported for randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (intent-to-treat population). To control family-wise error within 0.05, the Bonferroni-Hommel gate-keeping procedure was used to test hypotheses. Three noninferiority hypotheses (EQW is inferior to MET, PIO, and SITA) were tested first using the Bonferroni test (noninferiority margin 0.3%, Bonferroni-adjusted significance of 0.0167). If any null hypothesis was rejected (i.e., noninferiority was established), the corresponding superiority hypothesis was tested using the Hommel test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and decision matrix algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The nominal significance level based on Hommel adjustment was between 0.0167 and 0.05 depending on the noninferiority hypotheses rejected.</p><p>The primary end point was tested using a maximum likelihood-based mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) ANCOVA with change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> as the dependent variable; treatment, baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>, country, week of visit, and treatment by week interaction as fixed effects; patient and error as random effects; and an unstructured variance/covariance matrix. All scheduled postbaseline measurements were included, with no imputation of missing data. Least-squares (LS) estimates and CIs of the treatment differences between EQW and the three oral comparators were presented. The differences were based on the estimate at 26 weeks of EQW minus the estimate for each comparator at 26 weeks. SEs were also presented. Secondary end points were tested using similar MMRM analyses. Analyses of patient-reported outcomes were performed without adjustment for multiple statistical testing.</p><p>The original primary analysis excluded unscheduled postbaseline observations for unexpected early discontinuations; therefore, a modified analysis was completed, including all postbaseline observations. This modified MMRM analysis was performed after database lock when it was determined that the original analysis excluded patients who discontinued before week 8. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s11"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s12"><title>Patients</title><p>Of 820 intent-to-treat patients, 696 (84.9%) completed the 26-week treatment period and 736 (89.8%) returned for 10-week safety follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Additionally, a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of &#x02212;2.5 mmHg (0.6 mmHg) was observed with PIO treatment. Mean (SD) heart rate (bpm) increases were observed in the EQW [+1.5 (10.0)], MET [+0.3 (9.5)], and SITA [+0.5 (9.7)] groups; mean heart rate decreased in the PIO group [&#x02013;1.7 (8.7)].</p><p>No clinically significant changes in mean amylase, lipase, or calcitonin were observed during the treatment period. One SITA-treated patient with elevated lipase at screening experienced moderate chronic pancreatitis after 8 days of treatment and discontinued from study treatment.</p><p>Lower-titer (&#x0003c;1/125) and higher-titer (&#x02265;1/625) antibodies to exenatide at end point were observed in 43.1% (107/248) and 11.3% (28/248) of EQW-treated patients, respectively. Mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reduced irrespective of antibody status: negative (&#x02212;1.33%), positive lower (&#x02212;1.51%), and positive higher (&#x02212;1.02%) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1107/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>). Events with higher incidence in antibody-positive patients included injection site&#x02013;related events (i.e., injection site erythema, injection site extravasation, injection site hematoma, injection site nodule, injection site pruritus, and injection site reaction). Injection site nodules are expected with microsphere injection and were not reported as an adverse event unless accompanied by symptoms such as pain, erythema, or pruritus.</p><p>Patients in all treatment groups had mean improvements from baseline in perceived treatment satisfaction, weight-related quality of life, and binge-eating behavior (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1107/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables 4&#x02013;9</ext-link>). All treatments with the exception of PIO were associated with significant mean improvements in health status. Significant improvements in weight-related quality of life, binge-eating behavior, and health status were reported for patients treated with EQW compared with PIO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s16"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Head-to-head comparative studies are needed to better inform treatment decisions for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), a disease for which there are numerous treatment options. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of EQW monotherapy, in comparison with MET, PIO, and SITA monotherapy, in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with EQW, MET, and PIO all resulted in improvements in glycemic control, achieving mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> concentrations at 26 weeks of &#x0003c;7%. EQW demonstrated superiority to SITA and noninferiority to MET but not to PIO with regard to HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction at 26 weeks. The lack of noninferiority of EQW monotherapy compared with PIO monotherapy was unexpected based on DURATION-2 study results, where EQW was superior to PIO on a background of MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and the fact that the HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction with PIO was greater than that reported in other PIO studies with a similar baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Several disparate factors could have contributed to the incongruent outcomes, including differences in background therapy and mean duration of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>SITA treatment led to comparatively lesser glycemic improvement than the other agents, which supports the contention that the increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition is not as effective as pharmacological concentrations achieved with receptor agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The similar effects obtained with EQW monotherapy and MET monotherapy in terms of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight reductions support the appropriateness of considering MET as the first-line antihyperglycemic agent in type 2 diabetes. For example, the ADA/EASD recommends MET as a first-line agent; other antihyperglycemic agents are added in stepwise fashion with disease progression after MET failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Findings from DURATION-4 demonstrate that both EQW and PIO offer similar improvements in glycemia as MET, with one key difference between these agents being the effect on body weight. Thus, health care practitioners have more treatment choices for drug-naive patients.</p><p>Clinicians are advised to consider multiple factors when treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Similar to previous studies evaluating PIO as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), patients treated with PIO in the current study gained weight. EQW and MET led to similar significant reductions in body weight after 26 weeks, whereas SITA led to a lesser reduction. Although variability based on study design and patient characteristics was expected, weight reduction observed in this study with EQW was on the lower end of the range (&#x02212;2.0 to &#x02212;3.7 kg) observed in previous DURATION studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Conversely, reductions observed with SITA and MET in the current study tended to be greater than results from meta-analyses and recent monotherapy trials of similar duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The potential for improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight in studies with placebo injection therapy has been noted in a previous study of exenatide therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These data show that EQW and MET provided the best profile in terms of improving glycemic control as well as reducing weight, without increased risk of hypoglycemia, particularly important for treatment of overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The findings with respect to safety and tolerability were consistent with previous studies, including the observance of gastrointestinal adverse events in patients treated with EQW and MET, and hypertension and peripheral edema with PIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Most notably, the safety profile of EQW in the current trial was consistent with previous DURATION studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), with low rates of confirmed minor hypoglycemia and few patients discontinuing treatment due to nausea (one patient) and vomiting (zero patients). Less nausea and vomiting with EQW have previously been reported in head-to-head studies versus exenatide BID. In general, hypoglycemia incidence and incidence of serious adverse events were low across all treatment groups during the current study. The small percentage (2%) of patients experiencing minor hypoglycemia with EQW monotherapy was similar to that observed with EQW adjunct to MET in previous clinical trials (0&#x02013;3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Most treatment-emergent adverse events in this study had resolved by the end of the 10-week safety follow-up period, with few treatment-emergent adverse events starting during the safety follow-up.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study. First, patients were enrolled based on specific criteria and were followed according to the study schedule, which may not reflect real-world use. Second, no specific compliance data were collected; however, patient-reported outcomes indicated that both oral and injectable therapies were associated with increases in treatment satisfaction and quality of life in these previously drug-naive patients. Additionally, 26 weeks is too short a study duration to evaluate long-term glycemic control, weight loss, and &#x003b2;-cell preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). For example, potential implications of the upward shift in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, observed in the EQW group between weeks 16 and 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), cannot be assessed further without additional data points.</p><p>In conclusion, in these patients with type 2 diabetes who were naive to antihyperglycemic therapy, all four treatments resulted in improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and a majority of EQW-, MET-, and PIO-treated patients achieved a target HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x0003c;7.0%. This study recognizes that guidelines typically recommend MET as the first agent used, because it is inexpensive and supported by long-term data. Of the agents studied, EQW and MET provided similar improvements in glycemic control along with the benefit of weight reduction and no increased risk of hypoglycemia. There were no unexpected findings with regard to safety or tolerability. Based on these 26-week data, EQW is a once-weekly dosing option for initial therapy. Longer-term studies will be required to assess the durability of the observations in this study.</p></sec>
