Therefore, there has been controversies regarding possible drug interactions via this metabolic pathway after reports revealed that the anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel could be attenuated by lipophilic statins in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> However, the data from several clinical follow-up studies on major adverse events indicate that peri-procedural co-administration of statins with clopidogrel does not worsen the clinical progress of such patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> Although severe drug-drug interactions between statins and clopidogrel have not been reported in recent <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref> the follow-up durations of these studies (maximal duration=5 weeks) cannot be considered sufficient to reflect the long-term clinical outcomes of such combination therapy. Furthermore, concomitant prescription of statins with clopidogrel is common worldwide in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, but there have been few reports on the impact of co-administering statins and clopidogrel on the anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel in Asians.

Of 260 enrolled patients, 233 were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences using permuted block randomization in blocks of six. Group A was comprised of 119 patients who received atorvastatin first just after coronary stenting, followed by fluvastatin (Lescol XL<sup>R</sup>; Norvatis Pharma AG). In Group B, 114 patients first received fluvastatin just after coronary stenting followed by atorvastatin. All drugs were administered once daily in the morning at a dose of 10 mg for atorvastatin and 80 mg for fluvastatin for each 12 week per treatment period. A 4-week washout interval separated the treatment periods, during which pravastatin, which is not metabolized mainly via the CYP pathway in the liver, was given once daily. The comparative efficacy of the available statins on lipids and lipoproteins showed that the potency of 10-mg atorvastatin is similar to that of 80-mg fluvastatin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref> All patients received 100-mg aspirin and a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel before coronary stenting, and daily doses of 75-mg clopidogrel and 100-mg aspirin after coronary stenting during the study. Compliance with the treatments was monitored through patient diaries and periodic telephonic follow-ups between assessments. Patients were instructed to follow the National Cholesterol Education Programme Step I (or stricter) diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory tests</title><p>Blood samples for platelet activity were drawn 1 hour before (baseline) and 24 hours after the loading dose of clopidogrel, as well as after each treatment period at weeks 12 and 24. A blood sample was taken from the forearm vein and collected in a 3.8% sodium citrate tube. Platelet aggregation was assessed within 2 hours of blood sampling. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> platelet aggregation was measured using a two-channel whole blood aggregometre (Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA, USA). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation of the citrated blood at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The final platelet count was adjusted to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>/mL with autologous plasma. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood at 3,500 rpm for 10 minutes. The maximal light transmission curve was assessed for 5 minutes after adding 10 &#x000b5;mol/L ADP as a marker for platelet aggregation. The platelet-poor plasma was used as the baseline reference.</p><p>All patients were required to fast for 12 hours before blood sampling for serum lipid parameter concentrations. Serum LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were determined at baseline, weeks 12 and 24. The LDL-C concentrations were calculated by using the Friedewald formula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30)</xref> TC and TG concentrations were measured by calorimetric enzyme assay using a Hitachi 747-200 automatic analyzer.

Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and no adverse effects were observed. To our knowledge, this is the longest randomized study investigating the impact of statins on <italic>ex vivo</italic> anti-platelet effect of clopidogrel.</p><p>A number of concerns were raised regarding the possibility of specific deleterious interactions between clopidogrel and statins when studies provided controversial results that short-term therapy with clopidogrel in conjunction with atorvastatin could attenuate the anti-platelet efficacy of clopidogrel, suggesting that the co-administration of CYP3A4-metabolized statins with clopidogrel may competitively inhibit metabolic activation of clopidogrel in the liver.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> However, Serebruany et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20)</xref> showed that atorvastatin did not affect platelet biomarkers after clopidogrel administration, compared with other statins or no statin, within 24 hours in patients undergoing coronary stenting. Mitsios et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref> showed that the therapeutic efficacy of clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome was not significantly affected by concomitant administration of atorvastatin for 5 weeks, and clopidogrel did not affect the therapeutic efficacy of atorvastatin. Mukherjee et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21)</xref> reported that there was no significant difference in the clinical benefit between a CYP3A4-metabolized statin and a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin when used in conjunction with clopidogrel. The present study has contributed to the growing body of evidence that drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and statins has no clinical relevance in patients with cardiovascular disease treated with clopidogrel and a standard statin-dosing regimen.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, its open-label, unblinded design limits its generalizability beyond the study groups. However, randomized assignment of patients and the crossover design of this study could mitigate bias. The crossover design was considered feasible if a sufficiently long washout period could be included between the treatments. Second, we investigated only a single platelet function marker. Neubauer et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> demonstrated that the impact of statins on clopidogrel's inhibitory effect on platelet function was much less impressive when maximal concentrations of ADP (100 mol/L) are used. They speculated that very high concentrations of ADP stimulated platelets via additional, unspecific receptor sites. Furthermore, low concentrations of ADP (1 mol/L) exerted only minor platelet stimulation, but significant results were seen when a moderate concentration of ADP (10 mol/L) was used for platelet stimulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref> Therefore, we chose this concentration of ADP (10 mol/L) as our stimulation dose for platelet aggregometry. Finally, no <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations had been performed, and the study included only the usual basal dosage of atorvastatin. However, data from a post hoc analysis of the Clopidogrel for Reduction of Events during Observation trial showed no adverse effect on the 28-day or 1-year composite clinical end points with clopidogrel and statin co-administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref> Similarly, the prospective Maximal Individual Therapy of Acute myocardial infarction PLUS registry demonstrated that there was no significant difference between atorvastatin therapy and other statin therapies in the clinical outcomes of patients receiving clopidogrel over a follow-up period of 14 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> Further studies on clopidogrel-dependent platelet inhibition with dosing increments of statins may be needed. Polymorphisms of CYP2C19 could have affected clopidogrel resistance in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28)</xref> However, the incidence of clopidogrel non-responders is known to be less than 10%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29)</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the anti-platelet activity of clopidogrel was maintained when co-administered with a statin for 12 weeks in Korean patients with coronary stents. The results support the long-term clinical benefit of a CYP3A4-metabolized and non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins administered concomitantly with clopidogrel.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
