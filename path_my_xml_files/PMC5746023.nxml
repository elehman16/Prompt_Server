Synthetic transvaginal mesh has been employed with increasing popularity in the treatment of POP and is usually highly effective in controlling the principal symptoms of prolapse. However, studies have reported that mesh operations provide fairly unfavorable SUI cure rates. Therefore, additional anti-incontinence surgical strategies are increasingly being scrutinized to achieve better postoperative continence without any significant side-effects for patients with both POP and SUI. We hypothesize that the modification with the fixing of the mesh to the mid-urethra is superior to the original transvaginal mesh operation (TVM) with regard to anti-incontinence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">One hundred and thirty patients diagnosed with POP&#x02013;Q II&#x02013;III and concomitant SUI requiring surgical treatment will be included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.

POP is defined as the protrusion of the pelvic organs from the normal anatomical location toward or through the vaginal opening; the current prevalence of symptomatic POP is in the range of 3&#x02013;8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SUI, classified as involuntary loss of urine during physical activities and a resultant increase in intra-abdominal pressure, is also highly prevalent, reaching as high as 24.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Also of note, one-fifth of women in the United States receives surgery either for SUI or for POP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where the cumulative risk for SUI surgery is 13.6% and that for POP surgery is 12.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both pathologic conditions develop in&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50% of the women affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Synthetic transvaginal mesh (TVM) has been increasingly employed in the treatment of POP and tension-free slings are useful in the management of incontinence. Synthetic mesh during repair has principally been used due to higher efficacy compared to that of native tissue repair and resorbable mesh; however, complications appear to be more prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Common complications include mesh extrusion, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The anti-SUI efficacy of the prosthetic placement is barely 72&#x02013;83% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, it is assumed that a combination of a synthetic mesh with the sling operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] will substantially increase the cure rate for concomitant SUI.</p><p id="Par18">Despite the increased consideration of the combined surgery for both genitourinary pathologies in one session, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal treatment. It is supposed that a combined operation with mesh and sling is highly effective for the treatment of POP and SUI; however, the complication rate is elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Therefore, the research group developed a modification to the transobturator four-arm TVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to increase its anti-incontinence effect. While the sling is located beneath the mid-urethra, the TVM elevates the distal part of the anterior vaginal wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the original TVM, the posterior part of the mesh is anchored to the anterior aspect of the cervix and the anterior arms are spread under the bladder neck with stabilizing sutures. We hypothesize that the original TVM operation can be followed by residual SUI since the strengthening of the back arms may result in a backward dislocation of the entire mesh. The posterior movement of the mesh allows the dorsal rotation of the urethra since the mid-urethra is not suspended. The proposed modification to the original surgical procedure includes the suture of the anterior part of the mesh to the mid-urethra to prevent the mesh sliding. We think that the appropriate elevation of the mid-urethra would thus occur with the anterior arms and that would achieve a more effective anti-incontinence. The pubourethral ligament is usually loose in SUI, but the anchored mesh would theoretically normalize its function and stabilize the urethra. Intra- and postoperative complication rates would be expected to be similar to those with the original four-arm TVM, but the modified TVM with the anchoring suture would be slightly superior with respect to POP repair and remarkably more effective in SUI correction. In our preliminary study, the anterior fixing of the TVM to the mid<italic>-</italic>urethra demonstrates as high an efficacy of anti-incontinence as 96.8% and an enormously reduced recurrence prolapse rate of 3.2% in (unpublished data). The mesh extrusion rate is particularly low and this may be due to the fact that the stabilizing sutures exert a lack of &#x0201c;folding/wrinkling&#x0201d; of the edge of the mesh, preventing a lifting up of the mesh which does not compress the mucosa and derange the periprosthetic vasculature.</p><p id="Par20">A further modification to the TVM surgery is that the positioning of the mesh will occur 1.5&#x000a0;cm below the urethral meatus, leading to an elevation of the entire anterior vaginal wall including the anterior and middle compartments as well. By contrast, the original TVM surgery does not prevent anterior compartment prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par21">The present study is a single-center, prospective, double-blind (participant, investigator/surgeon, outcome assessor), randomized, controlled trial.

Conventional instruments will be employed for the original TVM procedure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Modified intervention surgery</title><p id="Par41">In the modified surgical technique, the prosthesis is placed between 1.5&#x000a0;cm below the urethral meatus and the cervix and the anterior part of the mesh is anchored with a stabilizing suture to the periurethral tissue at the level of the mid-urethra to elevate the middle part of the urethra, leading to potentially more effective anti-incontinence. An additional document file presents the intervention (detailed description of the mTVM) in detail (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Assessment of safety: postoperative complications/reoperations</title><p id="Par42">In the current study, there are no anticipated risks or inconveniences, as the examinations and intervention employed are well-known and widely used in pelvic floor defect surgery. The modification to the TVM surgery does not carry a higher risk for patients than that of the original TVM in the setting of a fully equipped operation theatre. This makes the immediate detection and treatment of adverse events possible. Also, after leaving the operation room, all patients will be closely monitored for the occurrence of potential (severe) adverse events (short-term postoperative complications) on the postoperative intensive ward. Moreover, the inclusion of each individual patient in the study is indicated in the electronic hospital information system and, hence, is visible to all physicians and nurses involved in the care of the patient. This facilitates the reporting of (severe) adverse events to the principal investigator. The principal investigator will report suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the Institutional Review Board.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Hypothesis</title><p id="Par43">Alternative hypothesis for primary outcome: it is hypothesized that the group undergoing the modified transvaginal mesh operation will have a statistically higher improvement of continence measured by gynecological and urodynamic examination, and from the questionnaire administered before and after the intervention phase.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par44">As we have newly developed the modification to the prosthesis surgery, an exploratory pilot study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the modification to the mesh for the treatment of SUI. Twenty patients with SUI and POP were recruited for a mTVM operation by the same two senior surgeons who are conducting this randomization study. The sample size calculation study was designed based on preliminary data on the 20 patients. The newly developed technique yielded an objective SUI cure rate of 92% as opposed to 72% for the original TVM published by Sergent et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sample size calculations were performed with G*Power software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], using the statistical model for an &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> approach. Consequently, sample size was estimated theoretically and an effect size of&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1, indicating a small effect, will be accepted. The sample size was calculated for the primary outcome of the SUI cure rate with the following assumptions: &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, power (1&#x02013;&#x003b2; error probability)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8, number of groups&#x02009;=&#x02009;2. Based on these assumptions, a total sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;130 was estimated. In anticipation of dropouts (10%: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) or a violation of protocol (10%: <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), a final sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;162 (81 participants per group) results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par45">Analysis of the patients will follow the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) through the phases of the study (enrollment [assessed, excluded, randomized], allocation [control group and experimental group with intervention received or not received], follow-up [lost to follow-up, discontinued intervention] and analysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">All statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS software version 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All tests will be two-sided and significance will be set at <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Efficacy measurements were adjusted by intention-to-treat analysis. Missing values will be replaced using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. No subgroup analyses are planned. Standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and median will be used for the descriptive analyses. Primary and secondary outcome analysis: the Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be employed to identify any objective outcome differences among groups.</p><p id="Par47">Generally, continuous data will be checked for normality using the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. If the normality assumption is violated, then PISQ-12 and PFDI scores as tertiary outcomes will be normalized by log transformation (log10(x)). Univariate-repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine the secondary outcome between and within the two groups (mTVM, TVM group) at six endpoints (before intervention and during follow-up clinical appointments 1&#x02013;5 following intervention). Mixed design ANOVA will be carried out to determine the effects of the modified operation on subjective cure rate for POP and SUI, and the Bonferroni post hoc test will be used to test the difference between means. All statistical analyses will be completed after the final measurement of the last patient during the last clinical appointment after intervention. The repeated measure design with seven points in time allows us to monitor how patients change over time in both short-term (before/during intervention) and long-term situations (before/after intervention).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">Coexisting POP and SUI are increasingly recognized as a major health and financial concern affecting 63&#x02013;80% of postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. TVM is the standard surgical method for the anatomical restoration of middle compartment Stage II&#x02013;III prolapse; however, it should be supplemented with a mid-urethral sling to achieve better SUI treatment. Moreover, the combined mesh and sling operations yield unfavorably more frequent complication rates and may provoke voiding dysfunction and recurrent UTI. Furthermore, following the original TVM, some residual SUI can develop because of the backward dislocation of the mesh.</p><p id="Par49">To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate a surgical modification to TVM for more effective anti-incontinence. Should this newly developed modification be proved successful in treating SUI, it could be introduced in clinical practice due to its simplicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
