CT-P13 (5&#x02005;mg/kg) was administered intravenously every 8&#x02005;weeks from week 62 to week 102. Efficacy end points included the proportion of patients achieving Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20. Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were measured using an electrochemiluminescent method.

ASAS40 and ASAS partial remission were also similar between groups. ADA positivity rates were comparable (week 102: 23.3% vs 27.4%).

Biosimilar drugs such as CT-P13 are generic versions of innovator biologics, or &#x02018;reference products&#x02019; (RPs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Regulatory authorities in Europe, the USA and elsewhere have defined strict criteria for biosimilar approval. Although exact criteria vary in different countries or regions, it is usually necessary to show that a biosimilar is highly similar to its RP in physicochemical and biological terms. In addition, clinical studies must establish statistical equivalence in pharmacokinetics and efficacy, and comparability of safety.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>CT-P13 has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for all indications held by the infliximab RP. Extensive testing has shown that all major physicochemical characteristics and in vitro biological activities of CT-P13 and RP, including affinity for soluble and transmembrane TNF, are highly comparable.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> CT-P13 and RP were also compared in two 54-week, multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group studies in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), namely Programme evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in AS patients (PLANETAS) and Programme evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in RA patients (PLANETRA). Analyses of these randomised studies established the pharmacokinetic and efficacy equivalence of CT-P13 and infliximab RP. Immunogenicity and safety findings for the two drugs were also similar.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>Due to the lower cost of biosimilars versus RPs, there is considerable interest in determining if newly diagnosed patients can be effectively and safely treated with a particular biosimilar, and whether those already on RP treatment can be switched to its biosimilar without adverse consequences on efficacy or safety.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Collection of clinical data on this topic of &#x02018;switchability&#x02019; is necessary. Here, we report the results of an open-label extension study that recruited patients with AS who had completed 54&#x02005;weeks of the main PLANETAS study. This was a single-arm extension study in which all patients were pooled to be treated with CT-P13. The aims of the extension were twofold: (1) to investigate efficacy and safety during switched therapy to CT-P13 in patients previously treated with RP for 54&#x02005;weeks in the main study (hereafter named the &#x02018;switch group&#x02019;); and (2) to investigate the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 treatment over 2&#x02005;years in those patients treated with CT-P13 in the main study (the &#x02018;maintenance group&#x02019;). To aid interpretation, we describe the data for the maintenance and switch groups over two periods: the main study (week 0&#x02013;54) and the extension study (week 54&#x02013;102). A similar extension study that has recently been completed in patients with RA (PLANETRA) is also reported in this issue.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Methods of the main 54-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group PLANETAS study have been reported previously.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Briefly, the main study recruited patients aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years with active AS for &#x02265;3&#x02005;months according to the 1984 modified New York classification criteria. This Phase 1 PLANETAS extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01571206) was an open-label, single-arm extension study conducted in 40 centres in 8 countries. Patients who had completed 54&#x02005;weeks of the main PLANETAS study were offered the opportunity of entering the extension study for another 1&#x02005;year. Those who did not sign a new informed consent form for the extension were excluded. Additional eligibility criteria applied for the extension study were no major protocol violation in the main study and no new therapy for AS in the extension. Details of patient flow through the main and extension studies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition during the PLANETAS extension study.

After the ninth infusion of PLANETAS study treatment (given at week 54), eligible patients could choose to continue into the extension study during which patients and physicians were blinded to the treatment received in the main study. Patients in the extension study received an additional six infusions of CT-P13 given every 8&#x02005;weeks from week 62 to week 102. CT-P13 was administered via 2&#x02005;h intravenous infusion at a dose of 5&#x02005;mg/kg. At the discretion of the investigator, antihistamines could be provided 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min before CT-P13 infusion. The extension study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation good clinical practice guidelines. The relevant independent ethics committees approved the study protocol, consent forms and other written information for the extension study.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study end points</title><p>Efficacy assessments were made at baseline and weeks 14, 30, 54, 78 and 102. Efficacy end points included the proportion of patients achieving clinical response according to Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20 and ASAS40 criteria; the proportion of patients with ASAS partial remission (PR); the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, and the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-C reactive protein (CRP).</p><p>For assessment of immunogenicity, the proportion of patients with antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was assessed at baseline and weeks 14, 30, 54, 78 and 102 using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay method, as previously reported.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The neutralising activity of ADAs was also assessed by a flow-through immunoassay method using the Gyros Immunoassay platform (Gyros AB, Sweden). For safety, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed throughout the main and extension studies. The following TEAEs of special interest were also monitored: infusion-related reactions (including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction), tuberculosis (TB), latent TB (defined as a positive conversion on an interferon-&#x003b3; release assay&#x02014;which was negative at baseline&#x02014;together with a negative result on chest X-ray examination), serious infection, pneumonia, drug-induced liver injury, vascular disorders and malignancies.

Continuous data were summarised using descriptive statistics. Categorical data were summarised using counts and percentages. The populations were predefined in the study protocol and statistical analysis plan for participants in the extension study. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all enrolled patients. The efficacy population consisted of all patients who received at least one full dose of study treatment and had data for at least one efficacy assessment in the extension study. All efficacy analyses were performed using a &#x02018;missing equals excluded&#x02019; (MEX) approach. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the proportion of patients achieving clinical response (ASAS20/ASAS40/ASAS PR), with treatment group as a fixed effect and the stratification factors (baseline BASDAI score and region) as covariates. Treatment effect differences between maintenance and switch groups were estimated by calculating ORs and their 95% CI. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse other efficacy end points. The safety population (used to analyse all safety and immunogenicity events) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment in the extension study. Data from the main study period were analysed in participants of the extension study only, and not in all patients from the main study.

A total of 174 of 210 patients from the main study who consented to participate in the extension study were screened under the approval of the appropriate ethics committee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783F1">figure 1</xref>). All 174 screened patients were enrolled and were included in the ITT, efficacy and safety populations of the extension study. Of these, 88 had been randomised to CT-P13 in the main study and 86 to RP. Thus, the ITT population for the extension study included 88 and 86 patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were broadly comparable between these two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783TB1">table 1</xref>). In the ITT population, 81 (92.0%) and 77 (89.5%) patients in the maintenance and switch groups, respectively, completed all 48&#x02005;weeks of the extension study; 7 (8.0%) and 9 (10.5%) patients discontinued the extension study. Reasons for discontinuation are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783F1">figure 1</xref>. Two patients randomised to RP in the main study were incorrectly treated with CT-P13 during that study.

In the switch group, ASAS response rates were maintained from week 54 (ie, the time of the last RP infusion) to week 102 (ie, 48&#x02005;weeks after the last RP infusion). In the maintenance arm, responses to CT-P13 observed in the preceding 54-week study were maintained throughout the open-label extension study. As previously reported,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> efficacy findings at weeks 30 and 54 of PLANETAS were comparable to 24-week and 54-week data from the infliximab arm of ASSERT (Ankylosing Spondylitis Study for the Evaluation of Recombinant infliximab Therapy) and another pivotal placebo-controlled study of RP in AS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> Similarly, ASAS response rates in the maintenance group at the end of the PLANETAS extension (ie, week 102) were comparable to those observed at week 102 of ASSERT (ASAS20: 80.7% vs 73.9%, respectively; ASAS40: 63.9% vs 59.4%).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Data for all other efficacy end points were also similar between the maintenance and switch groups throughout the main and extension study periods, as well as within each group over both study periods. Sensitivity analyses supported the findings of sustained efficacy and comparability between groups. LOCF and MEX approaches reported highly similar results, both in the maintenance and switch groups. Analyses of the main study ITT and extension study ITT populations showed comparable and sustained outcomes throughout the 2-year study. Although analysis of the main study ITT population using the NRI approach showed lower response rates at week 78 and week 102 than when the LOCF approach was used, response rates were still comparable between groups. Differences in response rates by analysis method were likely due to the fact that some patients who responded during the main study were not included in the extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783F1">figure 1</xref>); therefore, the LOCF approach can be considered the most appropriate method.</p><p>In this extension study, CT-P13 was well tolerated, displaying a safety profile over the long term that was consistent with the profile of infliximab RP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> No notable differences were observed between the maintenance and switch groups in the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study (3/90 and 4/84, respectively), SAEs (4 patients in either group), serious infections including active TB, ADAs or infusion reactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783TB3">tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208783TB5">5</xref>)<italic>.</italic> A lower proportion of patients in the maintenance group than the switch group experienced one or more TEAE during the extension. To further evaluate the numerical imbalance in the proportions of patients reporting TEAEs during the extension study, a safety meta-analysis using data from historical studies conducted with infliximab RP was performed. For this purpose, a literature search was conducted to identify studies in patients with AS focusing on randomised studies or those with an observational design, with a duration of at least 54&#x02005;weeks and long-term cohorts, and observational studies capturing safety reporting up to 2&#x02005;years. Only studies which reported the methodology of collecting safety data and incidence of adverse events using reliable denominators were included in the meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis is presented in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> E-1. The proportion of patients reporting TEAEs in both the maintenance and switch groups was within the range reported in historical studies with infliximab RP.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;22</xref> Of note, the majority of TEAEs in the switch group were generally mild to moderate in severity. In addition, the incidence of infusion-related reactions did not increase in patients who switched from RP to CT-P13, while the proportion of patients with sustained or transient ADAs was comparable between groups throughout the study, although only qualitative analyses of these data were performed. In a similarly designed extension study of PLANETRA&#x02014;a Phase III study which compared CT-P13 and RP in patients with RA &#x02014;the incidence of TEAEs in the maintenance and switch groups was similar (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> F).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this regard, there was no indication of a change in the safety profile when patients transitioned from infliximab RP to CT-P13.</p><p>It is well known that development of ADAs against infliximab is associated with a decreased clinical response and is also linked to adverse effects such as infusion-related reactions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We observed lower ASAS20 response rates, higher levels of CRP and ESR, and a higher incidence of infusion-related reactions in ADA-positive compared with ADA-negative patients. These effects were comparable in both groups, suggesting that switching from RP to CT-P13 did not have a negative impact, regardless of ADA status.</p><p>The current data suggest that switching to CT-P13 in patients previously treated with the infliximab RP shows similar efficacy and safety profiles, compared with maintaining CT-P13. A number of randomised and non-randomised studies have investigated the issue of switchability for other biosimilar drugs, including those such as the epoetins, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors and human growth hormone that have been approved in Europe for several years.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;31</xref> In general, these studies suggest there are unlikely to be adverse consequences of switching between innovator biologics and those biosimilars that have undergone the rigorous level of scrutiny necessary for approval by the EMA. The similarly designed extension of the PLANETRA study in patients with RA also showed no adverse effects of switching to CT-P13 from RP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>It is important to note that this single-arm, open-label extension study was neither designed nor powered to formally evaluate the non-inferiority or equivalence of switching from RP to CT-P13 vs continued treatment with CT-P13. In this regard, a randomised, double-blind, Phase IV study has been initiated in Norway (&#x02018;NOR-SWITCH&#x02019;; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02148640). NOR-SWITCH is comparing the safety and efficacy of switching from the infliximab RP to CT-P13 vs continued treatment with RP in adults with RA, spondyloarthritis, chronic psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. In addition, a pharmacovigilance programme has been initiated by the manufacturers of CT-P13. This programme will monitor the safety of CT-P13 in patients with various inflammatory diseases, including AS, who have switched from RP, and who are receiving infliximab treatment for the first time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CT-P13 was well tolerated with comparable efficacy and safety as the historical infliximab RP treatment in patients with AS over 102&#x02005;weeks.
