There is a widespread use of dietary antioxidants, including vitamin E, resveratrol, beetroot, quercetin and cocoa flavanols (CF) in the athletic field. The main flavanols in cocoa are epicatechin, catechin (monomers) and procyanidins (oligomers). Their antioxidant (and in some situations perhaps pro-oxidant) effect is determined by the tricyclic structure of the flavanols. In vitro and in vivo studies clearly show that CF have a strong antioxidant capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the potential role of chronic or acute CF intake to counteract exercise-induced oxidative stress and its effect on exercise performance is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants, leading to a disruption of redox signaling and/or molecular damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. During exhaustive exercise, NADPH oxidase-derived formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in an altered redox state in the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast to the initial belief that nutritional antioxidant intake would be beneficial for exercise performance by protecting the body against oxidative stress, it is now hypothesized that exercise-induced oxidative stress promotes the expression of antioxidant defence and the adaptive responses to training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, when exercise-induced ROS formation exceeds the antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress occurs with detrimental effects on proteins, lipids and DNA, possibly leading to contractile muscle dysfunction, accelerated muscle-fatigue and reduced exercise performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, at moments when optimal exercise performance is key and training adaptations are of minor importance (e.g. competition), acute intake of antioxidants may help scavenge free radicals and therefore directly prevent a decline in exercise performance and optimize post-exercise recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In the recent years, CF have also been discovered as potent anti-inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Exhaustive exercise can cause inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], resulting in a potential role for CF as a nutritional intervention to prevent exercise-induced muscle damage. Nevertheless, Allgrove et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] did not find any beneficial effect of 2&#x000a0;week CF (108&#x000a0;mg) intake on exercise-induced inflammatory markers.</p><p id="Par23">Independent from its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, CF are also known to stimulate vasodilation through increased nitric oxide (NO) availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CF lead to the inhibition of arginase, resulting in a greater L-Arginine availability, the substrate of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] experiments showed that CF intake activates eNOS, which converts L-Arginine, in the presence of molecular oxygen, to NO and citrulline. Besides its role in vasodilation, NO can also react at a diffusion-controlled rate with superoxide to form the highly reactive oxidant peroxynitrite. Consequently, by elevating NO production, CF might hypothetically have a pro-oxidant effect. However, because of its antioxidant capacity, CF can reduce ROS formation (e.g. superoxide) and repress the formation of peroxynitrite, thus elevating NO availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on the fact that NO modulates blood flow and mitochondrial respiration during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], it has been suggested that increased NO production may enhance oxygen and nutrient delivery to active muscles, as well as improve mitochondrial efficiency, hence improving tolerance to physical exercise and recovery mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although many athletes use supplements of NO because of their potential ergogenic role, the scientific evidence is very scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. eNOS activity and thus NO production are stimulated by exercise-induced shear stress and thus strongly depend on training status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This suggests a minimal effect for CF and other nutritional supplements on eNOS activity and NO production in healthy trained athletes without vascular restrictions. Whether CF supplementation can alter NO production during exercise, and whether it may improve exercise performance and recovery in well-trained athletes, remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the effects of CF intake on: <italic>i)</italic> indirect markers of eNOS dependent NO synthesis, L-arginine and citrulline, during exhaustive exercise <italic>ii)</italic> exercise-induced changes in antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress and inflammation, and <italic>iii)</italic> exercise performance and recovery in well-trained athletes.

Training, food intake and lifestyle were kept constant during those 3&#x000a0;weeks. Subjects were asked to complete a 24&#x000a0;h&#x02013;food recall on 5 random days during the study period (to avoid a potential influence of regular polyphenol intake on the measurements) and training intensity and duration were registered in a training diary. Participants were asked to record their dietary in- take of the last 24&#x000a0;h before each lab visit and to replicate this diet in the 24&#x000a0;h preceding each test. On the first visit, subjects underwent a complete medical screening and performed a maximal incremental cycle test (initial workload of 80&#x000a0;W, increased every 3&#x000a0;min by 40&#x000a0;W until volitional exhaustion) on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, The Netherlands). Peak power output (PPO) was determined and maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) was measured using the Metalyzer Cortex (Germany).</p><p id="Par27">Subsequently, subjects underwent 2 interventional (exercise) trials where they consumed a CF or placebo (PL) drink (300&#x000a0;ml), in a randomised order with 1&#x000a0;week in between. Subjects reported to the lab in a 4&#x000a0;h&#x02013;fasted state at 12&#x000a0;pm. Subjects were asked not to perform heavy exercise in the last 48&#x000a0;h and to abstain from caffeine and foods with a high polyphenol content (green tea, grapes, olives, dark chocolate, hazel and pecan nuts, berries) for the last 24&#x000a0;h. Baseline blood samples were collected, subjects were weighed and blood pressure was taken. Subjects then consumed either a high CF-content chocolate milk (CF - 903.75&#x000a0;mg CF, Acticoa&#x000ae;) or the placebo low CF chocolate milk (PL &#x02013; 15&#x000a0;mg CF) which were matched in taste, color, calories, macronutrients, caffeine and theobromine. The exact composition of the CF and PL drink, including monomers (epicatechin, catechin) and oligomeric proanthocyanidins are depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. This drink was consumed together with a standardized lunch, carefully selected by a nutritionist to contain a high amount of carbohydrates to increase CF absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (80% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 5% fat, 10&#x000a0;kcal/kg bodyweight). As the peak blood concentration of CF is reached 2&#x000a0;h after consumption of the drink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], a 2nd blood sample was taken 100&#x000a0;min later. Subsequently, a 30-min TT was started. Immediately after the TT, a 3rd blood sample was taken. A 4th sample was taken after a 100-min passive recovery and consequently a 2<sup>nd</sup>30-min TT was started.

If the power output decreased, the duration of the time trial increased. No feedback regarding time lapse, power output, heartrate or pedal cadence was given, except for total workload that was completed. Time to complete the TT and physiological parameters as lactate, heartrate, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were used as primary outcome measures to determine the effect of CF on exercise performance (data from TT1) and recovery (data from TT2). Power output and heartrate were constantly registered during the TT. Relative power output (percent of peak power output), was calculated every 5&#x000a0;min of the TT.

In this study, NOS-dependent NO production was indirectly estimated by measuring its substrate L-arginine/ADMA and its by-product citrulline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], because of our inability to directly assess NOS activity in our experimental model. L-arginine, a rate limiting factor for NO production, is converted into NO and citrulline by eNOS and arginine supplementation has been shown to affect the release of NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As intracellular ADMA and arginine compete for NOS binding, ADMA and arginine levels regulate NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, extracellular ADMA and arginine also compete for cell transport (CAT-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Thus, the higher the arginine/ADMA-ratio, the more arginine may be expected to be available as a substrate for eNOS to produce NO.

Citrulline increased and L-arginine/ADMA decreased after both TTs, suggesting an exercise-induced increase in eNOS activity and NO production, but we did not observe an improved eNOS activation by CF as there were no differences in L-arginine/ADMA (eNOS substrate) and citrulline (byproduct) after CF intake, neither in rest, nor in response to exercise.

Further research measuring NO production (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, nitrosospecies, peroxynitrite, eNOS activity), tissue haemodynamics (e.g. Flow Mediated Dilation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Doppler) and mitochondrial efficiency is needed to elucidate the exact role of CF on eNOS activation and NO production in combination with exercise.</p><p id="Par48">In this study, time to complete TT1 was not influenced by CF intake, despite the small significant increase in relative power output at the end of TT1. Increases in RPE, lactate, HR and glucose during TT1 were not affected by CF intake. This suggests that acute CF intake has very limited ergogenic effects in well-trained cyclists.

Two hours after CF intake, subjects performed 2.5&#x000a0;h of steady state exercise at 45% of VO<sub>2</sub>max, followed by a 15-min TT. The authors did not find any improvements in the 15-min TT performance. This might be explained by the timing of CF intake and the consequent peak of epicatechin in relation to the exercise protocol: the sum of all epicatechin metabolites reached its maximal concentration (approximately 700&#x000a0;nM) during the steady state exercise (after 190&#x000a0;min) and was already decreased by 65% at the start of the subsequent TT.</p><p id="Par49">The second goal of this study was to examine the effects of acute CF intake on exercise-induced changes in antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress and inflammation and its possible implications for exercise recovery. Post-exercise recovery can be optimized by acute intake of antioxidants by scavenging free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Antioxidant capacity refers to the cumulative action of all antioxidants present in the plasma and is modulated by either radical overload or by exogenous antioxidant intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. UA, a strong scavenger of free radicals, contributes to more than 60% of the total plasma antioxidant capacity. However, UA is also upregulated by exercise as a result of an elevated energy-rich purine phosphate catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, next to assessing the total antioxidant capacity of plasma as TEAC values, UA plasma concentrations were determined and TEAC/UA was assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Consistent with previous research which showed that acute exercise induces oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], TT1 and TT2 increased both TEAC/UA and UA plasma concentrations. In line with our hypothesis that CF intake enhances the antioxidant capacity, TEAC/UA and UA were significantly increased by CF intake, before and after exercise. In the study of Davison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], resting antioxidant capacity was also slightly increased by acute dark chocolate intake. Their exercise protocol (2.5&#x000a0;h cycling at 60% VO<sub>2</sub>max) was longer and less intense than ours, but also increased TEAC values. However, in contrast to our results, they found that dark chocolate intake blunted the exercise-induced rise in antioxidant capacity. In the study of Allgrove [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a 2-week dark chocolate supplementation tended to increase TEAC at each time point, independently of exercise, which is consistent with our results. MDA, a by-product of lipid peroxidation, is the most frequently studied marker of oxidative stress during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Although TT1 increased MDA plasma concentrations, this temporal change was not affected by CF intake. Davison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Allgrove [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] used F2-isoprostanes as a marker of lipid peroxidation and found that acute and chronic chocolate intake lowered post-exercise plasma free F2-isoprostane levels. In the study of Wiswedel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations increased after acute CF (187&#x000a0;mg) intake in rest, whereas plasma TEAC and MDA remained unaffected by CF intake. Thus, we cannot rule out that other biomarkers (such as F2-isoprostane) of oxidative stress might have been affected by CF intake in the present study. Although acute CFs intake upregulated the exercise-induced antioxidant capacity, the resultant oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) was not decreased, suggesting that the small CF-induced increase in antioxidant capacity is not sufficient to counteract the increase in ROS formation during exhaustive exercise.</p><p id="Par50">The TTs induced an increase in inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6, but not in TNF-&#x003b1;. Although anti-inflammatory properties of CF are well documented by in vitro and ex vivo studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], acute intake of CF did not modify the exercise-induced inflammatory response. Similarly, Davison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and Allgrove [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] could not find any beneficial effects of acute and chronic dark chocolate intake on exercise-induced inflammatory markers. IL-6, next to its role as pro-inflammatory cytokine, also serves as a myokine produced by skeletal muscle in response to acute exercise to regulate muscle metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the inability of acute CF to blunt exercise-induced IL-6 elevations is not detrimental in this context. However, future research should focus on the effect of chronic CF intake on chronic diseases involving inflammation. Gastrointestinal, nervous, and cardiovascular diseases might benefit from chronic anti-inflammatory properties of CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], as evidenced by a lowered TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 in type 2 diabetes patients following 6&#x000a0;weeks of CF supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Given that CF intake did not reduce time to complete a second TT, exercise-induced inflammation and lipid peroxidation, a biomarker of oxidative stress, we failed to support the hypothesis that CF intake could enhance post-exercise recovery. However, the finding that acute CF intake increased total antioxidant capacity in response to exercise is promising. Future research should focus on its implications on a broader range of biomarkers of oxidative stress, metabolic and vascular parameters in healthy and diseased populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par52">In a population of well-trained cyclists, acute CF intake upregulated exercise-induced total antioxidant capacity, but did not affect lipid peroxidation and exercise-induced inflammation. Acute CF intake did not alter exercise-induced decreases in L-arginine and increases in citrulline (respect. Substrate and byproduct of eNOS-dependent NO production). Acute CF intake did not improve exercise performance and exercise recovery in a population of well-trained cyclists. Further research on the effects of CF on NO bioavailability, oxidative stress and its consequences in an exercise setting is needed to confirm these data.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CF</term><def><p id="Par6">Cocoa flavanol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eNOS</term><def><p id="Par7">Endothelial nitric oxide synthase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p id="Par8">Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDA</term><def><p id="Par9">Malondialdehyde</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO</term><def><p id="Par10">Nitric Oxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PL</term><def><p id="Par11">Placebo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPO</term><def><p id="Par12">Peak power output</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RM-ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par13">Repeated measures analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par14">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p id="Par15">Rate of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAC</term><def><p id="Par16">Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-a</term><def><p id="Par17">Tumor necrosis factor alpha</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TT</term><def><p id="Par18">Time trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UA</term><def><p id="Par19">Urid acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO<sub>2</sub> max</term><def><p id="Par20">Maximal oxygen uptake</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The results of the current study do not constitute endorsement of the product by the authors or the journal.
