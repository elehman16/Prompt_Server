One of the examiners placed a bacitracin tablet in the selective culture broth about 15&#x000a0;min before examination. Subjects chewed on a paraffin pellet for 1&#x000a0;min and were instructed to swallow any excess saliva. They then pressed the rough surface of the strip against the saliva remaining on the tongue. The strip that immersed with saliva was placed in the selective culture broth. We incubated the vial in an upright position at 37&#x000b0;C for 48&#x000a0;h with the cap one quarter of a turn open. After incubation, the presence of <italic>S. mutans</italic> was evidenced by dark blue to light blue, raised colonies on the rough surface of the strip. The density of <italic>S. mutans</italic> was obtained by comparing the colony density on the test strip with the model chart: score&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 for density less than or equal to 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02009;CFU/ml, score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1 for density between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;CFU/ml, score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2 for density between 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;CFU/ml, and score&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 for density greater than 10<sup>6</sup>&#x02009;CFU/ml.</p><p>Salivary counts of lactobacilli were determined by using the Dentocult LB Dip Slide&#x000ae; method (Orion Diagnostica, Finland).

There were several possible reasons suspected for the nonsignificant difference in <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts between the probiotic and control groups. First, there was the relatively small sample size in our study. Second, the subjects only took <italic>L. paracasei</italic> for 2&#x000a0;weeks in our study. In Nase&#x02019;s study, the intervention period of LGG was 7&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The 2-week intervention period might be too short to express differences between two groups. Further <italic>L. paracasei</italic> GMNL-33 studies with extended intervention time and increased subjects will be encouraged. In addition, the concentration and vehicle type of <italic>L. paracasei</italic> would not be efficient enough for reducing <italic>S. mutans</italic> rapidly.</p><p>Within the probiotic group, an interesting probiotic effect was noticed. Between T1 and T2, no inhibitory effect against <italic>S. mutans</italic> was observed. However, a significant count reduction in the salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> was detected between T2 and T3 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016). It seemed likely that once this probiotic had colonized into the oral cavity, it could exert a beneficial effect which did not occur during a short-term intervention. Thus, a 2-week period of medication via oral administration route may be needed for <italic>L. paracasei</italic> GMNL-33 to be effective in the probiotic action.</p><p>In this present study, salivary count of <italic>S. mutans</italic> within the probiotic group was significantly reduced only between T2 and T3 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016). The S. mutans lowering effect of probiotics was more pronounced in the posttreatment period (T2-T3) rather than the intervention period (T1-T2). The result was comparable to the studies of Ahola [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and Nikawa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Ahola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] examined whether the short-term consumption of cheese containing LGG and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> LC 705 would diminish caries-associated salivary microbial counts in young adults. The results showed <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts were significantly reduced in the probiotic group, yet only during the posttreatment period. Nikawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] examined the effect of short-term yogurt consumption with <italic>L. reuteri</italic> on the oral carriage of <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The results suggested that <italic>L. reuteri</italic> in yogurt reduced the <italic>S. mutans</italic> counts for up to 2&#x000a0;weeks after discontinuing the consumption. Both short-term probiotic interventions seemed to enhance the inhibitory effect against <italic>S. mutans</italic> after the intervention. Although we used different species of probiotic bacteria, the posttreatment effect was similar. But the mechanism of this posttreatment effect was not clear. Further studies for investigating the mechanism of the posttreatment effects of the probiotics would be needed.</p><p>Daily consumption of lactobacilli might lead to a transient (albeit permanent) colonization of these bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Busscher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Petti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] were unable to detect an oral colonization of lactobacilli after probiotic yogurt consumption. By contrast, Meurman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported that LGG was detected for up to 2&#x000a0;weeks after discontinued consumption of probiotic yogurt. Another bacteriocin producer <italic>S. salivarius</italic> K12 was used as a probiotic targeting the oral cavity. Horz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] monitored its dispersal and persistence in an oral environment by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. K12 could be detected at the mucosal membrane for 1 to 3&#x000a0;weeks yet with steadily decreasing tendency after 1&#x000a0;week. Thus probiotics may have the potential to control oral bacterial infections only when the uptake is repeated frequently.</p><p>We did not find statistically significant differences in the lactobacilli counts within and between probiotic versus control groups. However, there was a tendency for the probiotic intervention to increase the count levels of lactobacilli. Montalto investigated whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the salivary counts of these bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It was found that the oral administration of probiotics significantly increased salivary counts of lactobacilli. In another study, the salivary lactobacilli counts also increased after intake of the probiotic-containing cheese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>It should be noted that there were differences among various lactobacilli with regard to their abilities to cause dental caries. Some <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species were identified in deep caries dentin and were related to dental caries progression. For example, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> Shirota might be strong agents in dental caries progression for their adhesive ability to dental surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, it had been suggested that not all strains of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. had a caries-inducing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this study, the oral tablet contained <italic>L. paracasei</italic> extract that were not considered cariogenic. The elevation of count levels in lactobacilli could be reasonably considered as its well colonization in oral cavity under intervention instead of increasing caries risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Along with <italic>L. paracasei</italic>, the well-documented <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> GG was not considered cariogenic and had been shown to exert inhibitory activity against <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic> at pH values below 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The investigators also found that <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> GG did not ferment sucrose and thus did not promote caries. In addition, in vitro studies had shown that other lactobacilli, such as <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> and <italic>L. salivarius</italic>, had an inhibiting effect on the growth of <italic>S. mutans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All the lactobacilli except <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic> produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The ability of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Salivary buffer capacity was not changed in the current <italic>L. paracasei</italic> GMNL-33 study. It was not changed on other comparable probiotic studies either [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that a 2-week period of medication at least may be needed for <italic>L. paracasei</italic> GMNL-33 via oral administration route to become effective in the probiotic action. And short-term probiotic intervention seemed to enhance its inhibitory effect against <italic>S. mutans</italic> after the intervention. Further studies for investigating the mechanism of the posttreatment effects of the probiotics would be needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to residents, staff from the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Division of Dentistry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou and Ms. Yu-Ting Liu and Hui Ou-Yang for their support in this study.
