Inadvertent hypothermia is common in patients undergoing surgical procedures. This is thus a concern as TURP has been associated with perioperative hypothermia and subsequent shivering. In addition, the TURP procedure requires a large amount of irrigating fluids, which may further increase the incidence of shivering. Hypothermia-induced shivering increases total body oxygen consumption and may cause hypoxemia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] On the other hand, spinal anesthesia, the technique of choice in TURP, causes impairment of the thermoregulatory function of the autonomic system.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Because core temperature monitoring remains rare during regional anesthesia, substantial hypothermia commonly goes undetected.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Use of warm irrigation fluid has been shown to be efficacious in reducing heat loss and thus leading to decreased hemodynamic response.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In the absence of continuous fluid warmer, prewarmed fluid can be used to prevent hypothermia during TURP. Such measures in the knowledge of the authors were not used earlier in low resource settings. This study was planned to compare the effect of warm or room temperature irrigation fluid in terms of degree of hypothermia and hemodynamic variations in patients undergoing TURP surgery under spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomized prospective study of 40 patients undergoing TURP was conducted after taking approval from institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients over a period of 12 months. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II-III patients in the age group of 50-85 years scheduled for elective TURP under spinal anesthesia were selected. Patients with a history of preexisting severe cardiovascular, respiratory and endocrinal disease, severe anemia requiring blood transfusion, deranged serum electrolytes, and on anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. After thorough preoperative check-up all patients were kept fasting for 6 h. Preoperatively diazepam (tablet diazepam 10 mg) was administered a night before and on the morning of surgery with a sip of water.</p><p>In the operating room (OR) after establishing intravenous (IV) access, all patients were preloaded with 10 ml/kg of Ringer lactate. All IV fluid used during operation was stored at room temperature. Routine preoperative monitoring was established with electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>). Core temperature of the patient was noted with the use of nasopharyngeal temperature probe introduced after thoroughly lubricating the probe and connected to a multi-parameter (Larsen and Toubro, Lunar) L and T anaesthesia monitor, India The temperature of the OR was also noted (electronic operation theater temperature indicator electro expo system, industrial module no. 62, electronic city sector-18, Gurgoan, Haryana, India).</p><p>And, it was maintained at 21&#x000b0;C. The patients were then randomly divided into two groups. Randomization was carried out by sealed envelope technique.</p><p>

Est. M Caves Rd. Andheri (East), Mumbai, India was administered. The patients were then turned to supine position and level of the block was checked by pinprick method. They were covered with theater linen at room temperature during the procedure and were not actively heated. Room temperature was maintained at 21&#x000b0;C When the level of the block reached T10, monopolar resection was performed using cautery with cutting and coagulation setting of 100 and 60 W respectively.</p><p>A well-lubricated resectoscope (Olympus winter and Ibe GmbH, Kuchnstr 61, 22045 Hamburg, Germany) and the telescope was used for resection of the prostate. The height of the irrigation fluid was 60 cm in all cases. The temperature of the distilled water as irrigating fluid in Group 1 was similar to room temperature while in Group 2, irrigation fluid was warmed by using incubator (YARCO B.O.D) Yarco sales Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, India. Before use irrigation fluid was put into irrigation fluid reservoir (sew water bath, scientific equipment works, (India) New Delhi) which was also prewarmed up to 37&#x000b0;C. The temperature of the irrigation fluid was measured with a mercury thermometer put inside the reservoir. All the patients were covered from level of the neck to umbilicus to protect against the heat loss during the procedure. Nasopharyngeal temperature, NIBP, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub> and ECG were continuously monitored pre-, intra- and postoperatively in each case. The total duration of surgery, amount of irrigation fluid used, and patient's satisfaction was also noted both intra-operatively and postoperatively by the anesthetist who was blinded to the temperature of the fluids selected.</p><p>During surgery, shivering score was recorded at 5 min interval. Shivering was graded using a scale similar to that validated by Tsai and Chu.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In which Grade 0: No shivering, Grade 1: Piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction but no visible shivering, Grade 2: Muscular activity in only one muscle group, Grade 3: Muscular activity in more than one muscle group, but not generalized and Grade 4: Shivering involving the whole body.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Calculation of sample size was done on the basis of previous studies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Considering a statistical power (&#x003b2;) of 80%, and &#x003b1; error of 5% and clinically significant of temperature difference of 1&#x000b0;C, a total 16 samples was found in each group.

We observed core temperature fall in both groups, the changes been less in those patients where irrigation fluid was used at 37&#x000b0;C. The core temperature fall in the group irrigated with fluid at room temperature was found to be 2.38&#x000b0;C, while temperature fall in the group irrigated with warm fluid was approximately 0.8&#x000b0;C at the end of the surgery. In none of the patients, the core temperature fell below 34&#x000b0;C. Mild hypothermia was noted in patients given room temperature irrigant fluid, whereas no patients had hypothermia in other group.</p><p>Inadequate warmed irrigation fluid and use of regional anesthesia techniques serve as additional factors for development of hypothermia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Absorption of irrigating fluid at room temperature was postulated as the cause of hypothermia by various authors. Winter has reported a 63% incidence of hypothermia in patients who underwent TURP with room temperature irrigation fluid, compared with only 20% in patients who received warm irrigation fluid.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A study by Okeke[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Pit <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have demonstrated that patients who received isothermic irrigation fluids had significantly smaller changes in body temperature than those who received them at room temperature. Our findings closely agree with them.</p><p>There has been contrasting observations in the literature available regarding use of warm irrigating fluid, and a few studies provide contradictory evidences. Jaffe <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that, irrigation fluid temperature is not a factor responsible for altering the core body temperature in patients undergoing TURP.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The factors, which might influence differences in the incidence of hypothermia between our results and other studies could be a different age groups and the difference in the temperature of warm irrigating fluid (33.05&#x000b0;C vs. 37&#x000b0;C) along with no active patient warming and use of unwarm IV fluid.</p><p>A further difference between the reported studies and our study is that we did not use in line fluid warmer to maintain the temperature of the irrigation fluid. Similarly no such attempt was made by Kelly <italic>et al</italic>., who failed to find a positive association between body temperature and irrigation fluid, as the fluid delivered to the patients cooled as the procedure proceeded.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Specifically designed warming devices for irrigation fluid rates have been shown to effectively maintain warmed fluid temperature during arthroscopy[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and laparoscopy.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Utilization of such a device would have benefitted the current study by preserving the intended warmed fluid temperature throughout the administration period.</p><p>Studies in the literature have shown a figure of approximately a fall of 3&#x000b0;C with irrigation fluid at room temperature. The result of a study by Davoudi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported a less than 0.5&#x000b0;C decrease in body temperature during the 60-min study period, when used IV and irrigating fluids at room temperature. However, they did not compare the amount of IV or irrigating fluid between groups and did not suggest the relationship of these factors with the fall in temperature. Associated factors like choice of in local anesthetics, sensory block levels, and differences in the temperature of IV fluids between the Davoudi <italic>et al</italic>.,'s study and our study, which could have influenced body temperature.</p><p>Indeed, even when irrigating fluid is warmed up to body temperature, there are studies that show a greater decrease in temperature in TURP when compared to transurethral resection of bladder tumor, probably due to greater absorption of fluid occurring in TURP, indicating that absorption of fluid contributes to temperature change in TURP.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>It is common for patients to complain their worst memory from the recovery room is the intense cold sensation and uncontrollable shivering. The study showed that the use of warm irrigation fluid none of our patient had core temperature fall below 36&#x000b0;C. Decrease in number of patients feeling cold and having shivering thus increasing the overall satisfaction of the patient. Our results are in accordance with others.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Unintended hypothermia can result in adverse consequences to the cardiovascular system.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Most of the previous studies that had found a positive effect of warm irrigating fluid on core temperature did not consider hemodynamic status in their observations. Evan in their study, observed a reduction in the heart rate, it could be because they used a large amount of irrigating fluid &#x0003e;11 L/patient at room temperature of 20&#x000b0;C and not at body temperature, which could have resulted in a decrease in core temperature.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study, in patients of Group 1 and Group 2, changes in the hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure was present, but had not reached a significant level. Literature shows that in patients who absorb more fluid in TURP, 75% experienced perioperative hypertension, 25% experienced chest pain and 17% actually had ST-depression on ECG.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our patients in the both groups did not differ in the amount of irrigant fluid required. Decreases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were noted in patients of both study and that were probably due to the sympathetic block effect of spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] There was no major fall in blood pressure as patient in both groups were preloaded with 10 ml/kg of lactated Ringer, 10 min prior to shifting the patient to operation theater.</p><p>For the purposes of temperature monitoring during anesthesia and surgery, the best monitoring sites are those that are closest to blood temperature, which is considered the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; core temperature. Besides blood temperature in the pulmonary artery, nasopharyngeal, and esophageal temperatures are the most accurate estimates of core temperature.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In this study, nasopharyngeal temperature was measured.</p><p>Intra-operative hypothermia prevention costs are lower than the cost to treat negative outcomes, such as the need for blood transfusion, that patients are affected due to their hypothermic condition. A meta-analysis demonstrated that, on average, a body temperature drop of more than 1.5&#x000b0;C below normal entailed accumulated negative outcomes, adding between $2.500 and $7.000 of hospital costs per surgical patient.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Limitations of our study are: (1) The benefits to patients in employing continuous fluid warming devices and other external measures to limit heat loss. (2) We did not estimate the concentration of stress response hormones. They might have given us a better understanding of the changes in stress level with hypothermia. (3) When the irrigation fluid is warmed from 17&#x000b0;C-37&#x000b0;C there is a corresponding change in the density and dynamic fluidity of the fluid used for irrigation and this is accompanied by an increase in the mean absorption of the fluid by as much as 54% and this may lead to decrease in the safe period of time for surgery by as much as 65%.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In our study, we did not look into this aspect and this is likely to influence our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study suggests that using either room temperature or warmed irrigating fluid during TURP could decrease core body temperature. Warmed irrigation fluids are one measure that can be implemented to decrease the magnitude of hypothermia and shivering. Considering the potential of room temperature irrigation fluids to contribute toward significant hypothermia, we recommend warming of irrigation fluids in low resource setting by this simple and uncostly method to normal body temperature before use in an elderly patient.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
