The pathophysiological role of endogenous opioid signalling to the development of hyperalgesia is unclear. Recent animal studies, carried out after the resolution of inflammatory pain, have demonstrated reinstatement of tactile hypersensitivity following administration of &#x003bc;-opioid-receptor-antagonists. In the present study in humans, we analyzed the effect of naloxone when given after the resolution of secondary hyperalgesia following a first-degree burn injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-two healthy volunteers were included in this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Following baseline assessment of thermal and mechanical thresholds, a first-degree burn injury (BI; 47&#x000b0;C, 7 minutes, thermode area 12.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) was induced on the lower leg. Secondary hyperalgesia areas around the BI-area, and separately produced by brief thermal sensitization on the contralateral thigh (BTS; 45&#x000b0;C, 3 minutes, area 12.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), were assessed using a polyamide monofilament at pre-BI and 1, 2, and 3 hours post-BI. At 72 hrs, BI and BTS secondary hyperalgesia areas were assessed prior to start of a 30 minutes intravenous infusion of naloxone (total dose 21 microg/kg) or placebo. Fifteen minutes after start of the infusion, BI and BTS secondary hyperalgesia areas were reassessed, along with mechanical and thermal thresholds.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Secondary hyperalgesia areas were demonstrable in all volunteers 1&#x02013;3 hrs post-BI, but were not demonstrable at 72 hrs post-burn in 73&#x02013;86% of the subjects. Neither magnitude of secondary hyperalgesia areas nor the mechanical and thermal thresholds were associated with naloxone-treated compared to placebo-treated subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Naloxone (21 microg/kg) did not reinstate secondary hyperalgesia when administered 72 hours after a first-degree burn injury and did not increase BTS-generated hyperalgesia. The negative results may be due to the low dose of naloxone or insufficient tissue injury to generate latent sensitization.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Considerable research effort has been invested in examining the contribution of central sensitization <xref rid="pone.0064608-International1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> to development of chronic pain <xref rid="pone.0064608-Brennum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064608-Yarnitsky1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Intrathecal administration of pertussis toxin, destroying G-&#x003b1;-subunit (G&#x003b1;<sub>i/o</sub>)-proteins, also leads to a reinstatement of mechanical hypersensitivity, suggesting a tonic activity of inhibitory GPCRs (G Protein-Coupled Receptors) signalling <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

This dose regimen is identical to a study with intradermal, high current-density electrical stimulation, which demonstrated significant increases in established secondary hyperalgesia area following naloxone administration <xref rid="pone.0064608-Koppert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, the high current-density stimulation is administered over a longer time period and is both more painful than BI and BTS and persists as long as the electrical stimulation continues. The increased magnitude of established secondary hyperalgesia, during ongoing electrical stimulation, by administering naloxone, is evidence that the inhibitory endogenous opioid system is immediately activated and thus not analogous to the experimental paradigm used in the present study.</p><p>A number of human hyperalgesia studies <xref rid="pone.0064608-Brennum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Mikkelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Schoell1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> have used higher doses of naloxone, up to 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg, without demonstrating any hyperalgesic effects during other types of <underline>acute</underline> experimental pain. High doses of 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg of naloxone have been used in clinical and experimental psychiatric, endocrinological, neurological or nutritional studies in patients <xref rid="pone.0064608-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064608-Federico1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and in healthy volunteers <xref rid="pone.0064608-Cohen3" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064608-Cohen7" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>; however, this dose-range has not been used in human pain research.

It is tempting to speculate that higher doses of opioid antagonists might be needed to sufficiently block the endogenous opioid system and allow latent sensitization to become apparent.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Extent of Injury</title><p>The animal studies of latent sensitization with the plantar incision <xref rid="pone.0064608-Campillo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and CFA <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> model, induce deep tissue inflammation. These models are likely associated with an increased degree of nociception compared to the superficial BI-model, which may be inadequate for generating latent sensitization. There are no studies examining the severity of the primary injury and the latent sensitization. However, Maih&#x000f6;fner and co-workers showed activity in the pre-frontal cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus after repeated minor heat stimulation both at 46.7&#x000b1;0.4&#x000b0;C and 43.5&#x000b1;0.5_&#x000b0;C, (9 cm<sup>2</sup>, 15 s, left volar arm) <xref rid="pone.0064608-Seifert1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and in a different study at 46.7&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;2.0&#x000b0;C and 40.4&#x000b0;C&#x000b1;1.9&#x000b0;C (9 cm<sup>2</sup>, 24 s, left volar arm) <xref rid="pone.0064608-Peltz1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, observations suggesting that even mild heat stimuli are processed by rostral neural centers.

In the present study, due to the more superficial inflammatory injury, an interval of 3 days was used. Although no systematic research has been made in regard to the minimal necessary interval needed to show latent sensitization, it is possible that evaluating a different interval between the injury and testing could demonstrate latent sensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Methodological Issues</title><sec id="s4e1"><title>Assessment of secondary hyperalgesia areas</title><p>In the present study, areas of secondary hyperalgesia areas were assessed using a polyamide monofilament (nominal value 18, bending force of 890 mN). This is a relatively large monofilament, which may allow a more accurate assessment of hyperalgesia areas, when compared to smaller monofilaments of 200&#x02013;300 mN <xref rid="pone.0064608-Ravn2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. These smaller monofilaments probably delineate much larger areas of <underline>hyperesthesia</underline> and <underline>allodynia</underline>, but not hyperalgesia <xref rid="pone.0064608-Ravn2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>In the rodent studies <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed by thresholds to monofilament stimulation, while in the present study changes in mechanical hypersensitivity were evaluated by pin-prick assessments of secondary hyperalgesia areas. These grading methods of hypersensitivity are clearly different, i.e. one method measures thresholds while the other measures areas. However, in humans the methods are inversely interrelated: increased sensitivity in the secondary hyperalgesia area, following a burn injury, is associated with a proportional decrease in mechanical pain thresholds and an increase in secondary hyperalgesia areas <xref rid="pone.0064608-Werner1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064608-Werner3" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.</p><p>A methodological advantage of the present study was that 2 separate methods of secondary hyperalgesia area assessments, i.e. the BI- and BTS-methods, were used. Changes in hyperalgesia area after naloxone or placebo administration showed a high degree of agreement between the two methods; the same direction of change was observed in 16 out of 22 volunteers. However, it should be emphasized that the two methods differ in regard to induction of secondary hyperalgesia areas: in the BI-method re-instatement of secondary hyperalgesia following resolution of an injury was examined and with the BTS-method the response to an acute noxious stimulus was analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s4e2"><title>Habituation</title><p>Habituation effects between the first BI (Day 1) and the second BI (Day 3), was seen in regard to secondary hyperalgesia areas, but not in regard to other variables tested. This effect has been reported before and thus was expected <xref rid="pone.0064608-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Ravn1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, any confounding is minimized by the randomization and the cross-over design: results were similar regardless of whether the volunteers were first given naloxone or placebo. However, a longer interval between sessions might reduce any habituation effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Species Issue</title><p>Species differences may be such that the phenomenon has a different underlying mechanism or is expressed differently. No systematic research has directly compared latent sensitization between humans and rodents. The models of hyperalgesia and endpoints determined are quite different between the current study and previous rodent studies. For example, while we evaluated tactile hyperalgesia (response to pin) following a mild burn injury, previous animal studies evaluated tactile allodynia (response to von Frey hairs) following injection of an inflammogen (Corder et al) <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Corder2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or incision plus opioid (Campillo et al) <xref rid="pone.0064608-Campillo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064608-Campillo2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Additional studies in animal models of mild burn injury are required to determine whether the parameters used in the current study are sufficient to induce latent sensitization in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although recent animal studies, based on an inflammatory injury, have shown a late re-instatement of secondary hyperalgesia following administration of an opioid-antagonist, the present study could not reproduce these results in a human first-degree burn injury model. The negative results might be explained by use of a low dose of naloxone (leading to an insufficient blockade of endogenous opioid receptors); the limited tissue injury by the model; incorrect timing of assessments relative to drug administration; or to species differences. Further studies are needed to fully examine the possibility of latent sensitization after injury in humans.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Marian Petersen R.N., Ph.D. for help with randomization and packaging of the drugs and for Karin L.
