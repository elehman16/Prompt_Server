Intact bovine colostrum (BC) contains high amounts of protein, growth factors, and immuno-regulatory components that may benefit protein intake and gut maturation. We designed a pilot study to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of BC as the first nutrition for preterm infants. The study was designed into three phases (A, B, and C) and recruited infants with birth weights of 1,000&#x02013;1,800&#x02009;g (China) or gestational ages (GAs) of 27&#x02009;+&#x02009;0 to 32&#x02009;+&#x02009;6&#x02009;weeks (Denmark). In phase A, three infants were recruited consecutively to receive BC as a supplement to standard feeding. In phase B, seven infants were recruited in parallel. In phase C (not yet complete), 40 infants will be randomized to BC or standard feeding. Feeding intolerance, growth, time to full enteral feeding, serious infections/NEC, plasma amino acid profile, blood biochemistry, and intestinal functions are assessed. This paper presents the study protocol and results from phases A and B.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Results</title><p>Seven Danish and five Chinese infants received 22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11 and 22&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BC for a mean of 7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 and 7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;days which provided 1.81&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.89 and 1.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.52&#x02009;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> protein, respectively.

Preterm infants suffer from various organ immaturities that may predispose them to immediate or later diseases. Adequate nutrient uptake and growth rates are required for very preterm infants to adapt well to postnatal life, but rapid enteral feeding is often difficult because the gastrointestinal tract is immature. Consequently, a suboptimal milk diet may lead to feeding intolerance, serious gastrointestinal complications (e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis, NEC), and late-onset sepsis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Mother&#x02019;s own milk (MM) is considered the optimal nutrition for preterm infants, and it is superior to infant formula (IF) in stimulating intestinal maturation, minimizing feeding intolerance, reducing the risk of NEC and infections, and improving long-term neurodevelopment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, MM is sometimes not present in sufficient amounts or unavailable during the first days after preterm delivery. IF may be given as the first diet to supplement MM feeding, if donor milk (DM) is not available. Still, DM may remain less effective than MM to stimulate growth, secure adequate nutrient intake, and provide protection against NEC and infections (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). DM usually consists of pasteurized mature human milk (HM) obtained from mothers at a relatively late stage in lactation after giving birth at term. This means that DM contains a reduced amount of protein and bioactive components (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). DM is therefore not an ideal replacement for the first milk of the mother, the colostrum.</p><p>Bovine colostrum (BC) is the first milk from cows after birth, and we suggest that BC may be used to supplement MM during the first days of life, instead of IF or DM. BC is a rich source of protein and bioactive components, including lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, immunoglobulins (Igs), as well as various growth factors (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Still, a number of nutritional characteristics of BC and milk differ from those in human colostrum (HC) and milk (e.g., levels of casein, whey proteins, oligosaccharides, and lactose). A number of phase I studies in human volunteers and phase II/III studies in patients have demonstrated a therapeutic potential of BC in gastrointestinal disorders (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The safety and tolerability of BC has been tested in Danish pediatric patients subjected to intestinal resection (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and chemotherapy for leukemia (NCT01766804). In a well-established piglet model of preterm infants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), BC has repeatedly been shown to have beneficial effects in stimulating gut functions and resistance against NEC, relative to IF (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). When compared with DM and IF, BC promoted better postnatal growth, decreased diarrhea incidence, and increased brush border lactase activity in piglets (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is not yet clear, if the inferior quality of IF for preterm infants is due to its extensive industrial processing (e.g., heat treatment and fractionation) or suboptimal products (e.g., hydrolyzed whey proteins, vegetable carbohydrates, and vegetable oils). A general immunological hypersensitivity to bovine proteins in IF for preterm infants is unlikely, considering the overall low prevalence of cow&#x02019;s milk allergy in infants (2&#x02013;3%) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>On this background, we hypothesized that it may be feasible and justifiable to use intact BC as a supplement to MM during the first days of life, instead of DM or IF. Since BC has never been used as the first feed for preterm infants, we planned a three-phased pilot study to test the feasibility and tolerability in different clinical settings. The objectives of the pilot study were (1) to obtain the first information on whether BC used as the first nutrition is feasible and tolerable in preterm infants born between 1,000 and 1,800&#x02009;g or 27&#x02009;+&#x02009;0 and 32&#x02009;+&#x02009;6&#x02009;weeks&#x02019; gestational age (GA); (2) to help determine primary endpoints and sample size for a later, large randomized, controlled trial. Here, we report the entire study protocol and the results of the first two phases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>Since this was the first time BC was given as the initial nutrition to preterm infants, the pilot study was designed into three phases (A, B, and C) to proceed cautiously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Furthermore, the study was performed in two countries with very different clinical settings to test the feasibility of giving the intervention both in a clinical setting with access to DM and early enteral feeding, and in a setting with no access to DM with later introduction of enteral feeding, representing the normal spectrum of enteral feeding practices across the world (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In phases A and B, a stepwise, single-group design was used. Reconstituted BC was given as the first supplementary diet to MM for no longer than 10&#x02009;days postnatal age. In phase A, three infants were included. Out of safety considerations, one infant was recruited and followed until he/she reached full enteral feeding and a weight gain of 15&#x02009;g&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, before the next infant was recruited. Since no safety concern was raised in phase A, phase B was initiated, in which seven infants were recruited and studied in parallel. In phase C, a randomized, open labeled, and controlled trial design will be used. BC will be compared with the currently used supplementary diets to MM (IF and DM).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Design of the three-phased Precolos pilot study</bold>.

In phase B, BC was given to seven infants recruited in parallel. Phase C will be a randomized controlled trial (not yet completed).

If the infant fulfilled the recruitment criteria, the parent(s) would receive written and oral information about the study. Infants were included in the study after written parental consent was given.</p><p>Preterm infants were included in this study since we could not study the effect of BC as the first enteral nutrition for preterm infants by including other patient populations. Parents were informed with great care and given consideration time before inclusion. Because inclusion had to be done within a fixed period of time, this consideration time was not unlimited. If the parents found the consideration time to be too short, we accepted this and did not ask for consent.</p><p>No randomization was needed for phases A and B. For phase C, recruited infants are randomized into a control group and an intervention group in a 1:1 ratio. Random sequences of groups are generated by a computer program with randomly permuted blocks of sizes 2 and 4, written on slips, and put in opaque envelopes individually by an employee of the study sponsor. An envelope can only be opened to see the allocation after an infant has been enrolled. If multiple births are recruited together, all of them will be allocated to the same group, which will be accounted for during the data analysis. A set of 20 envelopes with random sequences will be generated for RH and HH together and coordinated by the primary investigator (PI) of RH <italic>via</italic> telephone call, and the recruitment will stop when 20 infants in total have been enrolled. The PI of HH will call the PI of RH when an infant is recruited and the PI of RH will open the corresponding envelope and tell which group the infant should be randomized to. For FWCH and SBMCH, two sets of 20 envelopes will be generated (one set for each) due to the difficulties related to coordination by telephone conversation. The study sponsor will coordinate and stop recruitment at the two Chinese sites when 20 infants in total have been enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>BC Intervention</title><p>The BC used in the study was prepared by mixing BC powder with cooled boiled water at room temperature (10&#x02009;g powder in 50&#x02009;ml water, 81kcal/100 mL).

Parenteral nutrition (PN) was provided from the first day of life to infants with a BW below 1,000&#x02009;g and/or GA less than 28&#x02009;weeks. Older infants did generally not get any PN. Full enteral feeding was defined as 160&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and PN was used until the infant received ~90% of this volume.

If the available amount of MM, and the maximal volume of BC supplementation (due to protein limitations), could not meet the expected enteral feeding volume, DM (at RH) or IF (at FWCH) was given to fulfill the needs.

All levels of bIgG were below the assay detection limit.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Precolos is a pilot feasibility study that will provide information on feasibility, tolerability, and potential effects of BC as the first feeding for very preterm infants. Since this is the first study to feed intact BC as the initial supplemental diet for preterm infants, we designed a three-phased, stepwise study to allow close monitoring of participants for possible adverse reactions to BC feeding. The BC product used for this study was produced by gentle pasteurization and spray drying of intact BC. Milk processing, especially pasteurization, usually reduces the concentration of bioactive proteins, but pasteurized and raw BC showed similar NEC-protective effects in preterm pigs, relative to IF (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). A recent randomized, controlled trial investigated BC for preterm infants (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), but the product used (Pedimune, Merck India, Mumbai, India), contained only 23% colostrum, and the major macronutrient was carbohydrate (73%, source not specified). The product was dissolved in HM (60&#x02013;67&#x02009;g in 100&#x02009;ml) and given to preterm infants at a dose of 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;ml four times a day. The study was underpowered for its endpoint but indicated that feeding this product was associated with more radiographic signs of NEC. Since a mixed product with carbohydrate as the main ingredient was used, it is difficult to compare the results with those in this trial. Previous experimental studies indicate that milk processing and addition of carbohydrate (typically vegetable-based maltodextrins) may induce NEC (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Potentially, high osmolality may also add inflammatory damage to the immature gut (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We suggest that mildly processed, intact BC may be a better diet for the early feeding of preterm infants. We also think that such an intervention deserves careful testing in larger clinical trials.</p><p>The first 12 preterm infants in the world have now received intact BC as a supplement to MM during the first days of life. The high level of protein in BC might be an advantage, as the same volume of BC can supply about eight times more protein than HM and three times more than IF. For safety reasons, the maximal total protein intake was set at 4.5&#x02009;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> according to the ESPGHAN guideline, and plasma amino acid and blood biochemistry values for liver and kidney functions were recorded to monitor the protein metabolism. As expected, BC provided about 50% of the protein during the first week in phases A and B, resulting in a mean intake of 3.1&#x02009;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, a level that is often difficult to reach at this early stage (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Despite this, we still observed the common drop in weight <italic>Z</italic>-score from day 1 until a postmenstrual age of 37&#x02009;weeks or discharge in these infants (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Plasma amino acid levels were measured to monitor potential toxicity related to high protein intake. In phases A and B, a transient hypertyrosinemia was observed in five infants on days 6&#x02013;8 when tyrosine levels normally reach a peak (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Tyrosine levels returned to normal in all infants a week later. Prolonged high levels of tyrosine may be associated with later learning disability, as indicated from studies in term infants (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). IFs with a relatively high content of casein (60&#x02013;80% of total protein) may also lead to increased phenylalanine and tyrosine levels (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The casein intake was 0.6&#x02009;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was much less than that in the study referred above (1.4&#x02013;1.9&#x02009;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Relative concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in BC were similar to those in HM, and we did not observe elevated levels of phenylalanine. Thus, the blood biochemistry results did not raise any concerns of toxicity related to excessive protein intake. After consulting with our DSMB, we decided to continue with phase C where it will be possible to compare tyrosine levels in the BC group with those in a control group.</p><p>Immunoglobulins, and especially IgGs, are abundant proteins in reconstituted BC and accounted for more than 30% of the total dietary protein in our study. For calves, colostrum provides most of the circulating IgG for passive immunity, while in human infants, this IgG is mainly transferred across the placenta before birth. We measured bIgG in plasma to check if intact bovine proteins (e.g., IgG, casein, and &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin) would cross the immature intestinal epithelium in preterm infants. This might sensitize the immune system and thereby predispose to NEC in preterm infants (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), although a direct (immunological) link between cow&#x02019;s milk protein and NEC has never been documented. The prevalence of cow&#x02019;s milk allergy is only 2&#x02013;3% in normal infants (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and may be even lower in preterm infants with an immature immune system. In phases A and B, we did not find any detectable levels of bIgG in plasma, probably reflecting a relatively high integrity of the intestinal epithelium in the studied preterm infants.</p><p>We decided to study BC supplementation in Denmark and in China to test its feasibility under very different conditions where access to DM was one of the differences in clinical care. The hospitals also had different conditions for determining GA, so to be cautious we used different age/weight inclusion criteria for the two sites, and we did not consider this compromising for the main aims of the study. In Denmark, mothers stayed in the wards with their infants and the infants therefore had a higher chance to receive considerable amounts of MM than those at the Chinese sites. When high amounts of MM were available, infants only received small amounts of BC, probably less than the amount required to demonstrate its potential benefits or harm. In China, fewer babies had access to MM, thereby providing better conditions to study effects/harms of BC feeding. Potentially, differences in intake of MM at the study sites need to be considered and adjusted for when analyzing the data from the later larger trials. On the other hand, it was judged important in this study to test supplementary BC feeding in different clinical settings to be able to predict the feasibility of performing a large multicenter randomized trial.</p><p>The Chinese sites and Danish sites also differed in the feeding regimens according to their use of nutritional guidelines. The Chinese sites started enteral feeding within 48&#x02009;h and increased the volume slowly by 10&#x02013;20 to 120&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as the target full enteral volume. The Danish site normally started enteral feeding within 2&#x02013;6&#x02009;h after birth and increased the volume as fast as the infants could tolerate to 160&#x02009;ml&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> as the full enteral volume. We did not consider it possible or appropriate to standardize the feeding regimens.</p><p>In conclusion, we suggest that BC may be a relevant alternative milk diet to DM or IF as a supplement to MM in the first days of life in preterm infants. The Precolos trial is the first step to document this novel method. If Precolos can demonstrate that early BC supplementation is well tolerated, feasible, and supports one or more of the multiple outcomes to be measured in phase C, then this paves the way for a larger randomized clinical trial. Clinically relevant outcomes of such a larger trial will be intestinal functions (e.g., feeding intolerance and intestinal permeability), time to full enteral feeding, growth, length of hospital stay, NEC, and sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YL was the main study coordinator.
