While the clinical efficacy of beta-blockers in reducing migraine attack frequency is certainly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], it is still poorly understood how they exert their therapeutic effect. So far, no imaging studies investigated the central effects of beta-blockers and our knowledge about the mechanisms derives from preclinical studies. Metoprolol belongs to the group of &#x003b2;-adrenergic blockers and selectively blocks &#x003b2;1 receptors. Beta-blockers attenuate the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and thereby downregulate the stimulating effect of the sympathetic nervous system. This downregulation was examined in several measures of cortical information processing that have been shown to be abnormal in migraineurs, such as visual evoked potentials, auditory evoked potentials and contingent negative variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Beta-blockers seem to have a regulatory effect upon all of these. In the visual system of migraineurs, metoprolol decreased the amplitude of visual evoked potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another study found a decrease of intensity dependence of auditory evoked cortical potentials in migraineurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and this decrease was related to clinical improvement. It has therefore been proposed that modulating the excitability of the cortex is how beta-blockers reduce the migraine attack frequency. Another neurophysiological approach to observe cortical information processing is the analysis of contingent negative variation (CNV), an event-related, slow cerebral potential following activation in the striato-thalamo-cortical loop. In untreated migraineurs the CNV is significantly increased and lacks habituation. Several studies found that beta-blockers normalize the CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and further that normalization of high CNV was positively correlated with treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These studies suggest that the effects refer to a general effect of beta-blockers on cortical excitability and abnormal cortical information processing in migraine. Accordingly it has been hypothesized that beta-blockers exert their preventive action in migraine by modulating cortical excitability and processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the aforementioned studies applied methods with a focus on specific network activity rather than a focus on the location where metoprolol potentially exerts its action in the brain. A plausible explanation for the described abnormalities in sensory processing in migraineurs is a dysfunction of processing in thalamocortical neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Evidence that preventive action of beta-blockers is effective through &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor inhibition in nociceptive neurons in the thalamus comes from electrophysiological animal studies. Shields and Goadsby (2005) reported that thalamocortical activity evoked by superior sagittal sinus stimulation was inhibited after locally applied propranolol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">To address this issue and to achieve a more integrated picture of central effects of metoprolol, we employed pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with a human model of headache attacks. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of metoprolol on brain activation patterns during trigeminal pain in migraine patients, as well as healthy human subjects, determined by fMRI. Based on earlier studies we hypothesize that metoprolol has an inhibiting effect on trigeminal pain processing, especially in the thalamus and/or thalamocortical networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par16">Twenty five migraineurs were recruited from the Headache Outpatient Department of the University Medical Center Eppendorf, Hamburg.

One could argue that the administered dose of 75&#x000a0;mg might have been too low to reach a neural level after a single dose, but this is unlikely given the above mentioned biological effect of the single dosage that we observed. We chose this dosage as this was ethically justifiable and 75&#x000a0;mg per day is the usual dose for migraine prevention. Nonetheless, metoprolol may indeed only exert its central effects leading to a reduction in attack frequency, if taken on a regular basis over several weeks. This was for ethical reasons not feasible in healthy volunteers, for which reason we have also investigated migraine patients who took metoprolol daily over several months before treatment and under treatment. But also in the group of migraineurs, no significant effect of metoprolol on central pain processing was observed. Another possible explanation for the missing effect of metoprolol is that the functional changes caused by metoprolol may be too subtle to be disclosed by functional MRI.Exploring the data further, we used a more lenient threshold of 0.005 (uncorrected) and interestingly found the hypothalamus being more activated following nociceptive input during metoprolol treatment in both groups, patients and healthy subjects. This suggests that beta-blockers may modulate hypothalamic action and that this modulation has an essential role in its preventive effect. Given the hypothalamus&#x02019; role in the pathophysiology of migraine pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and chronification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it would be a conceivable target for preventive migraine medication such as metoprolol. Following this line of investigation, we correlated hypothalamic activity in patients with drug effectiveness and found a negative correlation between hypothalamic activity and reduction of headache days, i.e. the stronger the reduction of headache days, the fewer hypothalamic activity. These speculations have to be seen with caution, as changes in hypothalamic activity were detected only at an exploratory threshold. Nevertheless it is an interesting finding and encourages further investigation of the hypothalamus as a possible target of metoprolol in preventive treatment. An interesting fact of this study is that the hypothalamus already increased after just a single treatment of metoprolol in healthy subjects. It would be interesting to see whether a longer treatment phase would affect physiological phenomenon or (stress) thresholds of healthy participants. However, given that it is still not clear whether central effects of metoprolol determine its therapeutic effect in migraine or if its therapeutic effect is caused by changes in the periphery, the issue merits further studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">For the first time, the preventive mechanism of metoprolol in migraine treatment is being investigated with the method of pharmacological imaging, which has successfully been applied to enlighten the pharmacodynamics mechanisms of other medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Taken together, our study did not find an effect of systemically administered metoprolol on central pain processing structures, including the thalamus, neither in the healthy system, nor in the pathological system of migraineurs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACC</term><def><p id="Par4">Anterior cingulate cortex</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BOLD</term><def><p id="Par5">Blood Oxygen Level Dependent;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>fMRI</term><def><p id="Par6">Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FWE</term><def><p id="Par7">Familywise Error</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>i.e.</term><def><p id="Par8">id est.</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITI</term><def><p id="Par9">Inter-trial interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCC</term><def><p id="Par10">Midcingulate cortex</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p id="Par11">Magnetic Resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVC</term><def><p id="Par12">Small volume correction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par13">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Inga Kr&#x000f6;ger and Ludovica Gramegna who completed parts of the data collection in the patients group.
