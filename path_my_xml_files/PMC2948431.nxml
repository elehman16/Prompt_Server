Persistent chronic pain is associated with depression and anxiety, interference with work and personal relationships and loss of independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p><p>As recommended by the World Health Organization, opioids have become the established treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic cancer pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and, in recent years, have also become a mainstay for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain. Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic, opioid analgesic that has demonstrated effectiveness in treating cancer and non-cancer related pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). However, the primary disadvantage associated with these agents is the development of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) in many patients, which commonly manifests as significant constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is a consequence of the action of opioids on receptors within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which reduce GI motility, inhibit secretion, increase absorption, affect blood flow and increase anal sphincter tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). As a result, patients can experience a range of symptoms such as straining, incomplete evacuation, bloating, abdominal distension and increased gastric reflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Constipation is the most frequently-reported adverse event in patients receiving opioid treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Unlike most adverse events associated with opioid use, which subside with chronic use, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) persists in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The pain and discomfort caused by OIC can cause patients to reduce or even discontinue their opioid therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), resulting in inadequate analgesia and further impairment of QoL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Current management strategies for OIC are non-specific and often ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Laxatives can improve symptoms in some patients; however, as this strategy fails to address the underlying opioid receptor-mediated mechanism of bowel dysfunction that leads to constipation in these patients, a substantial number do not achieve adequate relief of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). In addition, laxatives can be associated with several drawbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), and furthermore, long-term laxative use can be associated with damage to the muscular function of the bowel; nutritional deficits in terms of loss of water, vitamins and minerals; and kidney stones or renal failure, in addition to modifying the effects of other medicines.</p><p>Prevention of OIC, and bowel dysfunction in general, is considered to be a more effective therapeutic strategy than merely treating the symptoms as they occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). One approach to targeting the underlying cause of OIC is the oral co-administration of opioids and opioid antagonists with limited systemic bioavailability. By acting locally within the gut to block opioid action, the opioid antagonist would prevent or minimise OIBD, while the lack of systemic activity would mean no reduction in the central analgesic effects of the opioid.</p><p>Naloxone is an opioid-receptor antagonist that, when administered orally, has a very low systemic bioavailability of &#x0003c; 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) because of extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). As a result, naloxone acts almost exclusively on opioid receptors in the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Results from a pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects demonstrated that co-administration of oxycodone prolonged release (PR)/naloxone PR in a fixed dose combination does not significantly affect the bioavailability of either of its constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). As such, the oral co-administration of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR has been shown to provide an effective analgesia for patients with severe chronic pain, and to significantly reduce the impact of OIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy and tolerability of the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR has been shown in two Phase III, double-blind, randomised controlled clinical trials, one focusing on analgesic efficacy and the other focusing on bowel function. The first showed oxycodone PR/naloxone PR to be superior to placebo in terms of analgesic efficacy while also providing significant benefits in terms of bowel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of naloxone PR to oxycodone PR in a fixed combination formulation did not negatively impact on the analgesic efficacy of oxycodone PR. In the second Phase III trial, patients receiving the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR experienced significant improvements in OIC compared with those receiving oxycodone PR, with comparable analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In addition, clinically relevant improvements in bowel function have been observed in patients with chronic pain treated with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR, compared with oxycodone PR alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Naloxone PR/oxycodone PR has also been shown to improve patient assessment of analgesic opioid therapy for severe chronic pain, in terms of both efficacy and tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>).</p><p>This report presents the results of the open-label extensions of the aforementioned two Phase III studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), one examining the long-term analgesic efficacy of oxycodone PR/naloxone and the other investigating bowel function. The tolerability of the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain was also assessed in both open-label extension phases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>These were uncontrolled, open-label, extension phase studies in patients with non-cancer pain, who had completed one of two previous randomised, controlled, 12-week studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), performed to assess the efficacy and safety of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR for an additional 52 weeks. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and all of its accepted amendments to date and all relevant German laws, as well as complying with the International Conference for Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Written consent was obtained from all participants prior to study commencement.</p><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>All patients who completed one of the previous double-blind studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), who required daily opioid therapy and who were likely to benefit from treatment for the duration of the study were eligible to enter the respective extension phase. These patients were males and females who were at least 18 years old with a history of moderate-to-severe, non-malignant pain that had been effectively managed with daily opioid therapy for at least 2 weeks before entry into the double-blind phase of one of the studies. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to oxycodone, naloxone or any related product, a diagnosis of cancer (not including basal cell carcinoma), clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, GI or psychiatric disease that would have placed the patient at risk upon exposure to the study medication or that could confound the analysis and/or interpretation of the study results were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included active alcohol or substance abuse, and abnormal liver function tests. In the analgesia study, patients with a history of more than two lower back surgeries and those receiving the equivalent of &#x0003c; 10 mg or &#x0003e; 40 mg oxycodone per day were also excluded.</p><p>At the start of the double-blind phase of the bowel function study, patients had to be experiencing constipation caused or aggravated by opioids, be willing to discontinue their current laxative regimen and comply with the use of oral bisacodyl as a laxative rescue medication. Laxative rescue medication was permitted no sooner than 72 h after the patient&#x02019;s most recent bowel movement; however, if patients experienced discomfort during this period, they could take bisacodyl 5 mg as a laxative earlier than 72 h after their most recent bowel movement, as required, to treat constipation. The maximum total amount of oral bisacodyl permitted was five doses within seven consecutive days. Patients taking daily fibre supplementation or bulking agents were eligible for inclusion if they could be maintained on a stable dose and regimen throughout the study and were considered able to maintain adequate hydration.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>In the extension phase of both studies, patients&#x02019; pain was treated with open-label study medication (oxycodone PR/naloxone PR) for up to 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). In the analgesia extension study, all patients were initially switched to 20/10 mg oxycodone PR/naloxone PR per day to prevent patients who had received placebo in the double-blind study from being given an initial high dose of opioid. In the bowel function study, the initial starting dose of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR was the effective analgesic dose, based on the oxycodone dose that the patient was receiving at the end of the double-blind phase. Dose titration up to 80/40 mg oxycodone PR/naloxone PR per day was permitted in both studies at the discretion of the investigator. In both studies, immediate-release (IR) oxycodone was provided as study medication during the first 7 days of the extension phase for titration. After this period investigators could prescribe also other analgesic rescue medicine, if needed. In the bowel function study, bisacodyl was also provided as rescue medication only during the first 7 days of the extension phase. Any additional laxative treatment was by consultation with the investigator.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design of (A) the analgesia study and (B) the bowel function study.

No defined primary end-point was set; however, analgesic efficacy and bowel function were assessed.</p><sec><title>Analgesia study</title><p>The objective of the analgesia study was to assess pain and interference of pain with activities during treatment with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR, based on the modified Brief Pain Inventory&#x02013;Short Form (BPI-SF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The modified BPI-SF consists of 12 questions designed to assess the severity of patients&#x02019; pain and the impact of pain on daily functions. The pain subscale consists of the first four questions [numerical rating scale (NRS) 0&#x02013;10: 0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine]. The interference subscale consists of questions 6&#x02013;12 (NRS 0&#x02013;10: 0 = does not interfere; 10 = completely interferes) and question 5 reflects pain relief (NRS 0&#x02013;10: 0 = no relief; 10 = complete relief). The study also assessed changes in the dose of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR during the study period. Study medication intake (time and dose) was recorded by the investigators; change in dose from the randomised dose to the end of the extension phase, as well as after 2 weeks of the extension phase, was assessed as an efficacy parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Bowel function study</title><p>The objective of this study was to assess whether patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain taking oxycodone PR/naloxone PR had improvements in bowel function, as measured by the validated Bowel Function Index (BFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) at each study visit over 52 weeks. The BFI score of each patient was defined as the mean score of three distinct components: ease of defaecation [numerical analogue scale (NAS) 0&#x02013;100: 0 = easy/no difficulty; 100 = severe difficulty]; feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation (NAS 0&#x02013;100: 0 = not at all, 100 = very strong); and judgement of constipation (NAS 0&#x02013;100: 0 = not at all; 100 = very strong). Each question referred to the patient&#x02019;s experience during the past 7 days, with higher scores indicating poor bowel function. Average pain over the last 24 h was also assessed at each study visit using the Pain Intensity Scale (NRS 0&#x02013;10), and frequency of rescue medication and laxative use was measured.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring all adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs); monitoring haematology, blood chemistry and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); and physical examinations.

AEs led to study discontinuation in 3.5% of patients.</p><table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Incidence of adverse events reported by system organ class (&#x02265; 10%) and preferred term (&#x02265; 6%): bowel function study extension population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Oxycodone PR/Naloxone PR</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<italic>n</italic> = 258)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any adverse event</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">211</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>GI disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">94</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constipation</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diarrhoea</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>General disorders and administration site conditions</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Infections and infestations</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">104</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">104</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arthralgia</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Back pain</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Osteoarthritis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Nervous system disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Headache</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Psychiatric disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Gastrointestinal AEs occurred in 94 patients (36.4%), with 40 (15.5%) experiencing constipation and 18 (7.0%) experiencing diarrhoea. There was one serious GI AE, although this case of abdominal pain was considered as unlikely to be related to treatment with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR. For patients who experienced constipation or diarrhoea, only 29 (11.2%) and 7 (2.7%), respectively, were classed as possibly, probably or definitely being related to treatment. Only three patients (1.2%) experienced an episode of severe diarrhoea. Treatment for constipation was given to 28 (10.9%) subjects but in no case did constipation result in treatment discontinuation, dose interruption or dose reduction.</p><p>One patient died during the study, but this was because of necrotising faciitis and was not related to treatment. A further 26 patients (10.1%) experienced 35 SAEs. Overall, 11 events in eight patients were considered by the investigators to have a possible relationship to the study medication and included cardiovascular disorder, ECG and angina pectoris in one patient, haematuria and bladder disorder in one patient, and atrial fibrillation, amnesia, non-cardiac chest pain, myocardial infarction, abdominal pain and cerebrovascular accident (one patient each). Only one SAE (amnesia) was considered possibly related to the study drug, for which treatment was discontinued. Treatment was also discontinued in the patient with the cerebrovascular accident. All eight patients recovered from the AE, although the patient with bladder disorder recovered with sequelae.</p><p>Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale score remained stable in the extension study, with the mean (SD) score being 4.7 (5.68) after 1 week of treatment and 6.0 (6.36) at the end of the study (12 months). End-of-study results for haematology, blood chemistry and vital sign parameters were statistically equivalent to their respective start-of-study values, as shown <italic>post hoc</italic> by means of two-sided TOST analyses on difference in [&#x02212;1, +1] for basophils, eosinophils, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin, or ratio in [0.8, 1.25]. Abnormal blood pressure or liver enzyme levels were isolated. Changes in ECG were infrequent and isolated.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Efficacy discussion</title><p>In the study focusing on analgesic efficacy, the mean score for the item &#x02018;average pain over the last 24 h scores and BPI-SF pain subscores were low and stable over 6 and 12 months, indicating that oxycodone PR/naloxone PR provides effective long-term analgesic efficacy. These results were supported by the BPI-SF sleep quality item and interference subscores, which correlated with the low pain scores, indicating the positive effect of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR on sleep and activities &#x02013; an effect that was maintained throughout the extension phase.</p><p>Following titration to an effective analgesic dose during the first 2 weeks of the extension study, the majority of patients remained on an oxycodone PR/naloxone PR dose comparable with that which they received in the double-blind study. There was no indication that the treatment that patients had received in the double-blind study influenced the dose increase after the first 2 weeks. Some patients did require an increase in dose; however, it is important to note that this increase in mean daily dose of oxycodone may reflect the natural progression of the underlying pain-causing condition, which is supported by the slight increase in dose observed during the 12-month extension phase. In addition, rescue medication intake was low, which could also represent an additional factor affecting the increase in study medication dose. A similar analgesic effect to that observed in the total study population was seen in the subpopulation of patients who received doses &#x0003e; 40/20 mg oxycodone PR/naloxone PR per day on &#x0003e; 7 days consecutively &#x02013; mean pain scores were stable and comparable at all study visits throughout the extension phase. This also suggests that the long-term analgesic efficacy of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR was maintained at higher doses.</p><p>In this study focusing on bowel function as the main efficacy measure, the mean BFI scores continued to improve over 52 weeks of treatment with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR. Interestingly, patients who had previously received oxycodone PR in the double-blind phase experienced a rapid reduction in BFI score during the first week of treatment with the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR. Following this, BFI scores decreased at a similar rate to those in patients who had received oxycodone PR/naloxone PR in the double-blind study. The improvement in OIC was achieved without negatively affecting the analgesic efficacy of the oxycodone PR component, as mean pain scores remained low and stable, and use of rescue medication was low throughout the study. This supports the results from the extension study focusing on analgesic efficacy.</p><p>The results of these two extension studies show that the efficacy of the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR observed in the previous 12-week studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), in terms of both analgesia and improvements in bowel function, can be achieved and maintained during long-term therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety discussion</title><p>In the analgesia study, the incidence of AEs in the extension phase (68%) was comparable with that in the double-blind study (oxycodone PR/naloxone PR 55.8%, oxycodone PR 53.0%, placebo 52.5%) when the longer observation period was taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The most frequently-reported AEs were either common side effects associated with opioid therapy [constipation (9.2%) and nausea (7.7%)] or potentially related to the underlying medical condition [back pain (6.3%) and depression (6.3%)]. Although 88 SAEs occurred in this study, only 27 events in 12 patients were considered to have a causal relationship with the study medication and only six events in three patients were considered possibly related, but no action was deemed necessary in terms of study medication changes. Indeed, all three patients recovered.</p><p>The incidence of GI AEs and nervous system disorders was the highest in the first 3 months of the analgesia study. In this sensitive phase, all subjects restarted opioid treatment with 20 mg oxycodone/naloxone, were uptitrated to their effective analgesic dose and started new analgesic co-medication (oxycodone IR as rescue medication). Throughout the next 9 months, the incidence of constipation consistently decreased, dropping from six subjects at 3 to 6 months to one subject at greater than 12 months. The incidence of constipation increased again to 12 subjects within 7 days after the end of oxycodone/naloxone treatment and the switch to a marketed product. In 11 subjects, constipation was assessed by the investigator as not related to study medication (2.9%). Therefore, the incidence of constipation related to study medication is reduced to 6.3%.</p><p>While 81.8% of patients experienced AEs in the bowel function study, only 48.4% of these events had a positive causal relationship to study medication; only 26 patients experienced SAEs, the majority of whom (<italic>n</italic> = 18) experienced SAEs that were not related to study medication. Of the eight SAEs considered to have a possible relationship with the study medication, only one was considered possibly related to the study medication (amnesia), and for which the treatment was discontinued and the patient recovered. Importantly, the incidence of diarrhoea was low, and SOWS sum scores were not exacerbated with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR.</p><p>Based on the AEs, clinical laboratory reports, and vital sign and ECG data, the long-term use of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR has a favourable tolerability profile. Furthermore, there was no indication of an increased risk of AEs in patients taking doses &#x0003e; 40/20 mg/day oxycodone PR/naloxone PR for &#x0003e; 7 days consecutively, compared with the total extension phase population.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion of study design, including choice of treatment groups and appropriateness of measurements</title><p>The study design allowed patients to be up-titrated to 80/40 mg oxycodone PR/naloxone PR per day and to take rescue medication. This ensured that patients received adequate pain relief similar to the usual practice of prescribing a dose of IR oxycodone, as needed, for pain. The efficacy measurements were those commonly used to evaluate pain in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and were consistent with other studies in this development programme. Moreover, the BFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and the BPI-SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) with the interference subscore used as a QoL measure are validated instruments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Conclusion</title><p>Opioid-induced constipation is the most frequently reported AE experienced by patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, and can cause significant pain and discomfort. In many cases, this can be sufficiently severe to undermine the effectiveness of pain management and, therefore, negatively impact on patients&#x02019; QoL. The results from these studies provide evidence that the fixed combination of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR is a safe and efficacious agent for the long-term treatment of chronic pain. Mean scores for the item &#x02018;average pain over the last 24 h&#x02019; and BPI-SF pain subscores remained low and stable throughout the 52-week study and were comparable with those observed at the end of the double-blind study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), indicating good analgesic efficacy. In addition to delivering consistent analgesia throughout 52 weeks, oxycodone PR/naloxone PR continued to improve symptoms of OIC. This supports the long-term use of oxycodone PR/naloxone PR in the treatment of chronic pain. The AEs associated with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR are consistent with those generally observed with opioid therapy, and the combination of oxycodone PR with naloxone PR raises no additional safety concerns.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was designed by Mundipharma Research GmbH &#x00026; Co.
