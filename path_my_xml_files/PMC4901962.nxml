However, it has been shown that 10 to 25% of the patients are not satisfied with the result. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of depressive symptoms and somatization on the outcome after total knee replacement (TKR).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In 2012 and 2013 a total of 138 patients out of 150 were enrolled in this prospective study. Preoperatively depressive symptoms were assessed with the patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and somatization was assessed with the PHQ-15. Primary outcome measure was the self-assessed knee function evaluated with the "knee osteoarthritis outcome score" (KOOS) and pain measured with a numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcome measures were the KOOS subscales and the patient satisfaction. Group differences were tested by the independent t-test and the influence of other co-factors was checked with the univariate variance-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 6 and 12 months postoperatively patients with a PHQ-9 of more than 10 points had significant higher pain score at rest and daily living activities. Somatization assessed with the PHQ-15 had a significant effect on pain at rest and pain at daily living activities at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Both factors, PHQ-9 and PHQ-15 had also a significant effect on KOOS outcome and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Psychopathological factors such as depressive symptoms and somatization have an impact on outcome after TKR. Preoperative screening for psychopathological conditions could help to improve patient selection for TKR.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
