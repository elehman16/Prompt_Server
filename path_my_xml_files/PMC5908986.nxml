exercises&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;conventional physiotherapy&#x0201d; on pain, functional disability and active back
flexion and extension range of motion in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty four patients with chronic non-specific low back pain were
randomly assigned to McGill stabilization exercises group (n=17) and conventional
physiotherapy group (n=17). In both groups, patients performed the corresponding exercises
for six weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS), Quebec Low Back Pain Disability Scale
Questionnaire and inclinometer were used to measure pain, functional disability, and
active back flexion and extension range of motion, respectively. [Results] Statistically
significant improvements were observed in pain, functional disability, and active back
extension range of motion in McGill stabilization exercises group. However, active back
flexion range of motion was the only clinical symptom that statistically increased in
patients who performed conventional physiotherapy. There was no significant difference
between the clinical characteristics while compared these two groups of patients.
[Conclusion] The results of this study indicated that McGill stabilization exercises and
conventional physiotherapy provided approximately similar improvement in pain, functional
disability, and active back range of motion in patients with chronic non-specific low back
pain. However, it appears that McGill stabilization exercises provide an additional
benefit to patients with chronic non-specific low back, especially in pain and functional
disability improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>McGill stabilization exercises</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Chronic non-specific low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is one of the most common problems of public health systems in the world.
Approximately 84% of people are reported to have an experience of back pain in their life
time<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although there is no obvious
cause of low back pain, 90% of patients have been experiencing back pain without certain
pathology, referred to as non-specific low back pain (NSLBP)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The important
characteristics of chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP) consist of back pain for more
than 3 months, pain between the 12th rib and the top folds gluteal with or without leg pain,
and abnormal stability and coordination due to spinal muscles imbalance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise therapy is considered as one of the most effective treatments for CNSLBP<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Lumbar stabilization exercises have been shown to provide normal stability and coordination
in lumbar muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the Panjabi&#x02019;s
theory, spinal stability consists of three components: 1) active (muscles), 2) passive
(ligaments), and 3) neural components. These components are called as spinal stability model
that must be integrated together<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Active component of this spinal stability model is composed of the local and global
stabilizer muscles and mobilizer muscles. Accordingly, stabilization exercises are
classified into two training groups: 1) local or core stabilization exercises and 2) global
stabilization exercises<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Local stabilization exercises are designed to improve local
muscles function for the purpose of segmental stability enhancement<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, McGill has designed exercises in lumbo-pelvic
region, based on the global muscle stabilization, in order to increase stability and
coordination of the trunk muscles without any load on lumbar spine and to improve the
function of the anterior, posterior, and lateral lumbar muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Effects of stabilization exercises on pain, functional disability and lumbo-pelvic muscle
function have been investigated in some studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises are thought to increase
the lumbar muscles function and improve pain and disability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in some studies, a similar effect has been observed
performing a non-specific exercise training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, conventional physiotherapy exercises seem to increase
the flexibility and strength in anterior or posterior lumbar muscles and improve the muscles
function in patients with low back pain with a minimum load on the lumbar spine and more
often are used to alleviate muscle spasm and pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite this abundance of studies of different exercise training
on low back pain, a few of study is known about the effects of McGill stabilization
exercises compared with other exercises training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of
&#x0201c;McGill stabilization exercises&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;conventional physiotherapy&#x0201d; on pain, functional
disability and active back flexion and extension range of motion in patients with chronic
non-specific low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized clinical trial, registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical
Trials (IRCT) with the number 2015051022202N1. Thirty four patients with CSNLBP ranging from
20 to 40&#x02005;years-old recruited. All patients had an experience of low back pain without any
specific pathologies and causes, back pain for more than six months without radiating pain
to the leg, and not having physiotherapy treatment. The exclusion criteria were a history of
pelvic, spine, upper or lower extremities surgery, cardiovascular diseases, hamstring and
quadratus lumborum muscles shortening, pain or disability in upper and lower extremities,
frequent neurological deficits, and professional athletes. The patients were informed of the
study purpose and the treatment methods. Written informed consent was then obtained from all
of the subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences
Ethics Committee with a code of 93170.</p><p>The total number of 34 patients participated at the early stage of the current study. The
patients were assigned to two groups: 1) McGill stabilization exercises group (n=17) in
which the patients performed Curl up (for training the rectus and obliques abdominis muscles
and controlling pelvic motion), Side Bridge (for training the quadratus lumbarum muscles, as
a key muscle in spinal stability), Bird Dog with one hand or one foot and one hand and the
opposite leg (for training the anterior and posterior lumbar muscles, especially the
transverse abdominis)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and 2) conventional physiotherapy group (n=17) in which the
patients performed lumbar conventional physiotherapy exercises including single and double
knee to chest (for stretching and flexibility of the back extensor and strengthening of the
rectus-obliques muscles), prone lying with pillow with one leg sliding (for strengthening
the back extensor muscles), cycling in supine (for strengthening the abdominal muscles and
coordinating anterior and posterior lumbar muscles), and bridging exercises (for
strengthening back extensor muscles). The patients in both groups performed the
corresponding exercises 3 days a week and 10 repetitions of each exercise for a period of 6
weeks and a rest interval of 2 minutes between exercises. The exercises were taught to the
patients at the end of the first session in both groups. Furthermore, an exercise booklet
was prepared and handed to the patients in order to help them to perform exercises
correctly. Then, a physiotherapist contacted patients at the end of each week to ensure
about the correct performance of the exercises.</p><p>Randomized group allocation was determined by using a randomization software. Briefly, the
patients were coded and the codes were recorded in this software. Then, the random
allocation for sequential manner for the intervention and control groups was performed
running functioning the software. Pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) based on a
100&#x02005;mm line<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional disability was
evaluated by a reliable and validated Persian version of the Quebec Low Back Pain Disability
Scale Questionnaire<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. A Baseline Bubble
Inclinometer (Model 10602 built by Fabrication Enterprise Inc., USA) was used to measure the
active back flexion and extension range of motion without thoraco-lumbar pain. To evaluate
the active thoraco-lumbar flexion and extension range of motion, the inclinometer was used
at the T12&#x02013;L1 spinous process<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The clinical characteristics of the patients with CNSLBP
including pain, functional disability, and range of back motion were evaluated at the
beginning of the first week (Pre-test) and the end of the last sixth week (Post-test)
exercises.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences,
version16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Paired t-test and Independent t-test were performed
for within-group and between-group comparisons, respectively. Significance was accepted for

chronic non-specific low back pain including pain, functional disability, and active back

physiotherapy exercises. Improvements in the clinical characteristics of CNSLBP in McGill
stabilization exercises group were clinically and statistically greater (p&#x0003c;0.05).
Although improvements in the most symptoms of CNSLBP in conventional physiotherapy exercises
were not statistically significant, those are of great importance from the clinical point of
view. Although these improvements did not differ between the two groups, it appears that
McGill stabilization exercises provide an additional benefit to patients with CNSLBP,
especially in pain and functional disability. This can be explained by some evidences that
McGill stabilization exercises may increase stiffness and improve coordination between the
antero-posterior and lateral lumbar muscles. This might in turn, create a stable lumbar
spine during functional activities as well as help to reduce pain and improve function in
patients with low back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in

Cho et al. reported
that although the stabilization exercises and/or usual conservative treatments for 6 weeks
improved the function, the stabilization exercises are more effective than the usual
conservative treatments<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, possibly due
to an improvement in the coordination of muscle motor units which may occur during
stabilization exercises<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of
the current study was similar to the results of studies performed by Koumantakis et al., and
Cairns et al<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In these studies, there was no significant difference within and
between two groups.</p><p>The study of Ammer, is one of the few studies to examine the effects of the McGill
stabilization exercises on function compared with the conventional exercises. The author
reported an improvement in the function performing two types of the exercises. However,
McGill stabilization exercises significantly improved the function compared with that in the
conventional exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
conventional physiotherapy group, active back flexion range of motion was the only clinical
characteristic that significantly increased following six weeks exercises (p=0.026) which
was similar to those reported by Cho et al<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, back extension range of motion increased in McGill
stabilization exercises group, due to possible an improvement in coordination between
posterior lumbar muscles. However, an increase in back flexion range of motion in patients
who performed conventional exercises might be associated with a stretching exercise that was
a part of the treatment protocol.</p><p>In conclusion, McGill stabilization exercises and conventional physiotherapy provide
approximately similar improvement in pain, functional disability, and active back range of
motion in patients with CNSLBP. However, it appears that McGill stabilization exercises
provide an additional benefit to patients with CNSLBP, especially in pain and functional
disability improvement.</p><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the patients that participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Balagu&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannion</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name><name><surname>Pellis&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Non-specific low back pain</article-title>.
