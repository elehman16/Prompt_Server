In order to investigate which subpopulations MCGP-CS specifically benefits, this explorative study aims to analyze potential sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors that may moderate the effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Cancer survivors (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;114) were randomly assigned to MCGP-CS, or care as usual (CAU). Potential moderators included age, sex, relationship, education, employment, religion, cancer type, tumor stage, cancer treatment, time since treatment, anxiety, depression, other negative life events, and previous psychological treatment. Outcome measures were the Personal Meaning Profile (PMP), Scales of Psychological Well-Being (SPWB), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Assessment took place at baseline, post-intervention (short-term), and 3- and 6-month follow-ups (long-term). For each moderator, separate short-term and long-term linear mixed models were built.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Short-term effect of MCGP-CS was moderated by (male) sex (on HADS-D; <italic>F</italic>(1,98)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.015) and (a high level of) depressive symptoms at baseline (on SPWB; <italic>F</italic>(1,93)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.7, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.019).

However, MCGP-CS appears to reduce depressive symptoms, particularly in males, and to improve purpose in life of survivors with depressive symptoms. In the long-term, MCGP-CS appears to reduce psychological distress in survivors who had not received psychological treatment in the past year.</p><p id="Par5">Trial registration: NTR3571</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Oncology</kwd><kwd>Psychotherapy</kwd><kwd>Meaning</kwd><kwd>Well-being</kwd><kwd>Moderator</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verdonck-de Leeuw</surname><given-names>Irma M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Due to ongoing cancer treatment innovations, the number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Not only during but also after cancer, survivors may be confronted with challenges of experiencing a meaningful life, such as physical hindrances in achieving goals or existential concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. After the initial shock of the diagnosis, and the often overwhelming treatment phase, survivors begin to reflect on what has happened. A meaning-focused coping strategy may be helpful to adjustment in the aftermath of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Meaning-centered group psychotherapy (MCGP) has been developed to sustain or enhance a sense of meaning in cancer patients&#x02019; lives in order to cope with the consequences of cancer and improve their well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">MCGP was initially developed for advanced cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has recently been adapted for cancer survivors who have completed curative treatment (MCGP-CS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Adaptations include replacing topics about death with topics like carrying on in life despite limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is evidence to support that this intervention is effective in improving meaning and reducing distress in patients with advanced cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], as well as in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), MCGP-CS was compared to care as usual (CAU) and supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) among cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Compared to CAU, after MCGP-CS survivors improved more in terms of personal meaning (i.e., an individually constructed cognitive system, which endows life with significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), goal-orientedness, purpose in life, and positive relations, and compared to SGP, they improved more in terms of environmental mastery and personal growth. In the long-term, participants reported a decrease in depressive symptoms and distress following MCGP-CS. However, these overall effects do not contain information about which particular subgroups of survivors benefit most from MCGP-CS.</p><p id="Par8">Moderator analyses may be used to identify subpopulations of cancer survivors that are differentially responsive to MCGP-CS. In previous RCTs and meta-analyses, several potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators of the effects of other types of psychosocial group interventions on psychological well-being among cancer patients have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], yielding inconsistent results. In some studies, younger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and higher educated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] patients improved more, but in other studies this effect was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Some studies suggest that particularly patients with a more advanced tumor stage benefit from longer interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but this was not clearly supported in a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Because of this lack of clarity, potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators of the effects of MCGP-CS are assessed in the present study.</p><p id="Par9">A more consistent finding is that particularly patients with a higher level of distress and less psychological resources appear to benefit more from psychosocial group interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is therefore expected that survivors with higher levels of distress, such as survivors with depressive and anxiety symptoms, who have experienced other negative life events, and who have received psychological treatment, will benefit more from MCGP-CS.</p><p id="Par10">Since most studies on psychosocial group interventions were conducted either among cancer patients during medical treatment or in the palliative phase, the knowledge of group psychotherapy effects on cancer survivors is relatively limited. This is particularly the case for meaning-centered group psychotherapy, which has only recently been adapted and investigated for cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The current study is a secondary analysis of the study on the efficacy of MCGP-CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and aims to identify moderators of the effects of MCGP-CS on personal meaning, psychological well-being, and distress in cancer survivors who have completed curative treatment and who received their diagnosis in the last 5&#x000a0;years. Knowledge of which cancer survivor would benefit most from MCGP-CS is necessary in order to support survivors and their health care providers in selecting the optimal psychological treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="Par11">The current study is based on data from a multi-center RCT evaluating the efficacy of MCGP-CS. Detailed descriptions of the study procedures and primary results are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center. The RCT had three conditions: MCGP-CS as the experimental intervention, SGP as an active control group, and a CAU control group. Because only MCGP-CS had a significant intervention effect compared to CAU on the primary outcome (personal meaning) of this RCT, the current analyses only include the MCGP-CS and CAU conditions.</p><p id="Par12">Eligible participants were adult survivors of any type of cancer who had been diagnosed in the last 5&#x000a0;years, who had been treated with curative intent, and who had completed their main treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy). Cancer stage could range from 0 (in situ) to IV, and cancer could be recurrent, as long as it could be treated curatively. Participants had to have an expressed need for psychological care, and at least one psychosocial complaint (e.g., depressed mood, anxiety, coping issues, relationship problems, or meaning-making difficulties). Exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, current psychological treatment, and insufficient command of the Dutch language. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed by a trained psychologist by means of a telephone interview.</p><p id="Par13">Participants were recruited between August 2012 and September 2014 via four hospitals in the Netherlands and via advertisements in the public media. They received written information about the study and were asked to respond if they were interested in participating. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. After completing a baseline assessment, they were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Follow-up assessments were scheduled 1&#x000a0;week after the intervention, and 3 and 6&#x000a0;months thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par14">A computer-generated randomization table with random block sizes was prepared by an independent researcher and used to produce a list of sequentially numbered allocations. Participants were allocated to a group, and when a consecutive group had 7&#x02013;10 participants, the independent researcher used the randomization list to assign the group to a condition. Participants and psychotherapists were then informed about the allocated condition, while data managers were blinded to the allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors</title><p id="Par15">MCGP-CS is an eight-week, manualized intervention that makes use of didactics, a workbook, group discussions, experiential exercises, and homework. Based on the results of a focus group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], MCGP was adapted for cancer survivors. The adaptations involved changes in terminology, replacing topics about death with topics relevant for survivors, and the addition of brief mindfulness exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The following themes were addressed in MCGP-CS: sources of meaning, meaning before and after cancer, life story as a source of meaning (past), life story as a source of meaning (future), encountering life&#x02019;s limitations, creative sources of meaning, experiential sources of meaning, and representations of participants&#x02019; life lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Two psychotherapists with experience in treating patients with cancer each led about half of the intervention groups. Fidelity to the MCGP-CS protocol was ensured in several ways. Details are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Care as usual</title><p id="Par16">Cancer survivors assigned to the CAU condition did not participate in one of the group interventions.

All variables were dichotomized: sex (male vs. female), age (younger vs. older than the median of 56&#x000a0;years), marital status (married or in a relationship vs. single), level of education (elementary and lower vocational education vs. higher secondary, higher vocational education and university), employment (employed vs. unemployed), and religious background (religious vs. non-religious).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Clinical characteristics</title><p id="Par18">Clinical characteristics of survivors recruited in hospitals were retrieved from medical records. For survivors recruited via the public media (three persons), clinical characteristics were obtained via a self-report questionnaire. Cancer type was categorized as breast vs. colon. Because there was a small but diverse group of survivors from other cancer types, this category was not used in the analyses. Furthermore, tumor stage (0, I, II vs. III, IV), type of treatment (surgery vs. surgery combined with radiation and/or chemotherapy), and time since treatment (shorter vs. longer than 1&#x000a0;year) were collected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Psychosocial characteristics</title><p>Psychosocial characteristics included baseline anxiety and depression score, measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For both the anxiety and depression subscale, a cutoff of &#x02265;8 was used for dichotomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, psychosocial characteristics included the occurrence of negative life events other than cancer in the past 2&#x000a0;years (yes vs. no). This was assessed using the question: &#x0201c;Have you been through a major negative experience during the past 2&#x000a0;years, besides cancer? (E.g. job loss, loss of a loved one, burn-out, divorce)&#x0201d; Finally, other psychological treatments (any treatment from a psychiatrist or psychologist) in the past year (yes vs. no) were assessed. All psychosocial characteristics were collected via self-report.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par19">Participants completed questionnaires on personal meaning, psychological well-being, and psychological distress. Only the (sub)scales that showed significant change after MCGP-CS compared to CAU in the previous efficacy study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were analyzed for potential moderators.</p><p id="Par20">The Dutch version of the Personal Meaning Profile (PMP) was used to measure personal meaning. This 39-item measure comprises five subscales: relation with God, dedication to life, fairness of life, goal-orientedness, and relation with others. In the present study, the total scale (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.93) and the 6-item subscale goal-orientedness (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.89) were used. Items were scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (a great deal). The subscale scores were calculated as the mean item score, and the total score as the mean subscale score. A higher score indicated a stronger sense of personal meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Psychological well-being was measured with the Dutch version of Ryff&#x02019;s Scales of Psychological Well-Being (SPWB). In the present study, the 6-item subscale&#x02019;s positive relations with others (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.81) and purpose in life (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.78) were analyzed. Items were answered on a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). For the subscale scores, the mean item score was calculated, and a higher score indicated a greater sense of well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Psychological distress was measured using the continuous HADS-total score and depression using the HADS depression (HADS-D) subscale score. The HADS anxiety subscale was not used, since it showed no significant change in the previous efficacy study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To avoid confounding, HADS-total and HADS-D were omitted as outcome measures, in models in which baseline anxiety and baseline depression were tested as potential moderators. The HADS-total score (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.85) ranges from 0 to 42 and the HADS-D score (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.78) from 0 to 21. A higher score reflected a higher level of distress or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline characteristics are presented as numbers and percentages, as means, standard deviations, and range, or as median and range. Differences between MCGP-CS and CAU and all associations between the potential moderators were assessed using Chi-square and independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests. In order to examine treatment response moderators, linear mixed models (LMM; intention-to-treat) were used with a random intercept for participant effects. Fixed effects for condition (MCGP-CS or CAU), time, moderator, all two-way interactions, and three-way interaction were included in the models. Time was treated as a categorical variable. Short-term effect was defined as the course of outcome measures from baseline until post-intervention. Long-term effect was defined as the course of the outcome measures from baseline to post-intervention, to 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Separate LMM models were constructed for each potential moderator, the short- and long-term, and each outcome measure, and the <italic>p</italic> value of the three-way interaction was assessed. This interaction term represents the difference in the change over time in the MCGP-CS and CAU condition between the different categories of the moderator, regardless of baseline values.</p><p>Post-hoc analyses via independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests with Bonferroni correction (corrected <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.05/2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.025) were carried out to assess whether change scores differed significantly between the MCGP-CS and CAU condition within each category of the significant moderator variables. Short-term change scores were calculated by subtracting baseline scores from post-intervention scores, and long-term change scores by subtracting baseline scores from 6-month follow-up scores. Between-group difference in effect sizes (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>) within the categories of the significant moderator variables was calculated by dividing the difference in change between MCGP-CS and CAU by the pooled standard deviation.

In this study, moderator analyses were conducted to identify subpopulations that may be particularly responsive to MCGP-CS. Fourteen potential sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial moderators of MCGP-CS efficacy on personal meaning, goal-orientedness, positive relations with others, purpose in life, distress, and depression were assessed post-intervention and during the following 6&#x000a0;months. Most patient characteristics did not moderate any of the outcome variables. This may suggest that more statistical power is necessary in order to detect their moderating effects, or that MCGP-CS is equally effective for most sociodemographic and clinical cancer survivor subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, sex did moderate MCGP-CS efficacy. The short-term effect of MCGP-CS on depressive symptoms was greater for males than for females. As expected, baseline distress moderated the effect of MCGP-CS on purpose in life, but baseline anxiety and negative life events did not. Contrary to expectations, it was not survivors who had received previous psychological treatment, but those who had not received psychological treatment who benefitted more from MCGP-CS in terms of distress reduction.</p><p id="Par30">Although female survivors are more likely to express the need for psychosocial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], this study suggests that male survivors may be more responsive to MCGP-CS. It is possible that for male survivors, losing work, physical health, social status, and masculinity due to cancer may trigger depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. An intervention focusing on finding the sources of meaning that they still have may be particularly suitable to help males alleviate depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, this finding only occurred on depressive symptoms, suggesting that both sexes responded in a comparable manner in the other outcomes (i.e., personal meaning, goal-orientedness, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and distress). Also, the literature shows no indications that male and female cancer patients respond differentially to other types of psychosocial group interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The number of males in this study was low, which increased the possibility of a chance finding. Further research is needed into the potential differential effects of MCGP-CS for males and females.</p><p id="Par31">The fact that MCGP-CS appears to be more effective in cancer survivors with depressive symptoms is in line with previous studies of other types of psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and can possibly be explained by the fact that survivors with depressive symptoms have more room for improvement. However, following MCGP-CS, survivors with and without depressive symptoms responded equally well in terms of personal meaning, goal-orientedness, and positive relations with others. This suggests that the difference in improvement between depressed and non-depressed survivors should not be overestimated. Still, depressed people often find it hard to experience purpose in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This study indicates that MCGP-CS may be particularly helpful for survivors with depressive symptoms in order to regain a sense of purpose in life.</p><p id="Par32">While the moderating effects of sex and baseline depression faded in the long-term, during the long-term follow-up period, MCGP-CS became more effective in reducing psychological distress among cancer survivors who had not received psychological treatment in the past year than those who had. This is contrary to the expectations. Perhaps survivors who had received previous psychological treatment had already benefitted from their previous therapy and therefore had less room to improve due to MCGP-CS. However, this finding only occurred in one outcome measure, and the post hoc test did not show a significant difference in reduction of psychological distress between survivors with past psychological treatment following MCGP-CS and CAU. Further (qualitative) research is needed in order to obtain insight into previous psychological treatment as a moderator of the effect of MCGP-CS.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par33">The strengths of this study are the long follow-up period and the relatively low dropout rate. A limitation is that this study was not designed for investigating potential moderators and thus had limited power for this type of analyses. A larger sample size is needed to adequately detect moderator effects. Because of this limitation, we included only a small set of potential psychosocial moderators, even though psychosocial characteristics may be promising moderators of MCGP-CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the inclusion of 14 potential moderators and six outcome measures, both short- and long-term, led to many separate models. Consequently, the observed effects might have been statistically significant only by chance. One could correct this for multiple testing, but there is no clear consensus on how to address this issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the small sample size in this study led to some moderator categories with just a few observations, which increases the chance that individual participants with relatively high or low scores may have influenced the <italic>p</italic> value of the three-way interaction term. Unfortunately, large sample sizes are hard to obtain due to financial and logistical reasons. Individual patient data meta-analysis, in which data sets of several group psychotherapy efficacy studies in cancer patients are combined, should be undertaken to attain more power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Clinical implications</title><p id="Par34">For clinical practice, it is important to gain more knowledge of what type of psychotherapy is beneficial for which patient. The results of the present study show several subgroups of survivors that responded particularly well to MCGP-CS. More studies on potential moderators of meaning-focused interventions should be conducted and combined with results from studies on the moderators of different types of psychosocial group interventions for cancer survivors in order to develop a clinical decision rule. Such a clinical decision rule will help clinicians and survivors find the optimal intervention tailored to the survivors&#x02019; characteristics, capabilities, and preferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par35">Most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics do not appear to moderate the positive effect of MCGP-CS on personal meaning. However, MCGP-CS appears to reduce depressive symptoms, particularly in males, and to improve purpose in life particularly for survivors with depressive symptoms. In the long-term, MCGP-CS reduces psychological distress, possibly especially in cancer survivors who had not received psychological treatment in the past year.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
