Now-a-day, quality assurance of anesthesia is becoming increasingly important for improving postoperative outcome. Therefore, efforts are on to decrease the incidence and severity of other anesthesia-related complications such as postoperative nausea-vomiting and postoperative sore throat (POST), apart from the management of postoperative pain.</p><p>Postoperative sore throat is a well-recognized complication that remains unresolved in patients undergoing tracheal intubation for general anesthesia (GA) with a reported incidence of 6.6-90%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It also increases the duration of hospital stay, especially in day care surgeries.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Numerous nonpharmacological and pharmacological measures have been used for attenuating POST with variable success. Among the nonpharmacological methods, smaller sized tracheal tubes, careful airway instrumentation, minimizing the number of laryngoscopy attempts, intubation after the full relaxation of the larynx, gentle oropharyngeal suctioning, filling the cuff with an anesthetic gas mixture,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] minimizing intracuff pressures &#x0003c;20 mm Hg,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and extubation when the tracheal tube is fully deflated, have been reported to decrease the incidence of POST.</p><p>Pharmacological measures for attenuating POST are inhalation of beclomethasone and fluticasone, gargling with azulene sulfonate, aspirin, ketamine, benzydamine hydrochloride and licorice, local spray of benzydamine hydrochloride, and intracuff administration of alkalized lignocaine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>It is known that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) has a role in nociception and inflammation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] NMDA receptors are found in peripheral nerves and the central nervous system.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Magnesium is also an antagonist of the NMDA receptor ion channel.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We planned to study the efficacy of magnesium sulfate nebulization to reduce the incidence of POST. The drug is easily available and nebulization may be simple, cost-effective method to decrease POST symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Following institutional ethical committee approval and written informed consent, the prospective randomized double-blinded study was conducted in 100 cases. With the level of significance (alpha) = 0.05, and power of 80%, sample size required was 40 per group. To accommodate any exclusion, 50 patients from each group were selected.</p><p>Patients included in study were of either gender, aged between 18 and 60 years belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) 1 or 2 status undergoing elective surgery of approximately 2 h or more duration requiring tracheal intubation. Patients with neuromuscular disease, allergy or hypersensitivity of drugs, undergoing neck surgeries, and laparoscopic surgeries were excluded. Patients were allocated randomly to two groups, Group A and Group B. Simple randomization was done using SPSS software (IBM, SPSS Statistics 21).</p><p>All patients were kept fasting overnight and premedicated with oral alprazolam 0.5 mg and ranitidine 150 mg on night before surgery and on the morning of surgery.</p><p>Five minutes prior to the induction of anesthesia, patients in Group A were nebulized with 3 ml of normal saline and the patients in Group B were nebulized with 3 ml of 225 mg isotonic nebulized magnesium sulfate for 15 min. The solution for nebulization was administered by an anesthesiologist not associated with the management of the case. The anesthesiologist anesthetizing the case and those recording the scores were blinded to it.</p><p>In the operation theater, after connecting the patient to standard monitoring intravenous access was secured.</p><p>Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and thiopentone 5 mg/kg. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by atracurium 0.6 mg/kg, and the trachea intubated with soft seal cuffed sterile polyvinyl chloride tracheal tube (Portex Limited CT 21, 6JL, UK) of 7 mm inner diameter in female and 8 mm in male patients. The tracheal tube cuff was inflated with air.</p><p>The cuff pressure was checked just after intubation using handheld tracheal cuff pressure monitor (Portex Cuff Inflator/Pressure Gauge, SIMS Portex, Hythe, Kent, UK) and then every half hourly till end of surgery and maintained at 20 cm of H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Ventilation was controlled, and no nasogastric tube was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen with 1% of isoflurane and intermittent doses of atracurium and fentanyl as required. The last dose of atracurium was given 20 min prior to extubation. At the end of surgery, the muscle relaxation was reversed with a combination of neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg. The trachea was extubated after extubation criteria were met, and the patients were shifted to postanesthesia care unit.</p><p>Presence of sore throat was noted at rest and on swallowing immediately after extubation, and 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h postoperatively. In the postoperative ward, patients were also monitored for any drug-related side effects.</p><p>Data were expressed as mean, and 95% confidence interval of mean. Test of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk) was done for continuous variables (height, weight, age. Categorical data (gender) were expressed as frequency of occurrence. Comparison of continuous data between groups was done using ANOVA of means. Comparisons of categorical data between groups were done using Pearson Chi-square, continuity correction, likelihood ratio, Fisher's exact test; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Not much literature is available about the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate for attenuation of POST.</p><p>Our results in the control group were consistent with previous findings. We avoided using lignocaine jelly, reducing the confounding factors, thereby reducing POST incidence. Kori <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Maruyama <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found a higher incidence and severity of POST, where lignocaine 2% jelly has been used as a lubricant on the tracheal tube.</p><p>In our study, magnesium sulfate lessened the pain during swallowing at 4 h postsurgery compared to normal saline. The effectiveness of magnesium lozenges 30 min preoperatively was studied by Borazan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who found it effective reducing both incidence and severity of POST in the immediate postoperative period. His results are also comparable to ours Borazan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also showed the effectiveness of preoperative magnesium sulfate lozenge in reducing the incidence and severity of POST.</p><p>Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also assessed the efficiency of preoperative nebulization of magnesium sulfate and found that the incidence and severity of POST were reduced at rest and on swallowing at all-time points (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Sore throat related to orotracheal tube might be a consequence of localized trauma, leading to aseptic inflammation of the pharyngeal mucosa. Magnesium being an NMDA receptor antagonist, has a role in preventing NMDA receptor-mediated nociception and inflammation[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and thereby POST. In a recently published study by Ahuja <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] a similar mechanism of action was proposed for preoperative nebulization of ketamine. Similar to Blitz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who used nebulized magnesium sulfate for treatment of acute asthma, we too did not find any either local or systemic adverse outcomes. The drawback of our study was the absence of the measurements of serum magnesium levels making it difficult to rule out the contribution of systemic effects of magnesium. Moreover, comparing the doses used in the treatment of preeclampsia and eclampsia, the dose used in our study is very low and has been used in the form of nebulization, absorption for which has been shown to be variable and low (10%).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>POST is common in the patients undergoing GA with an tracheal tube for routine surgical cases for up to 24 h.
