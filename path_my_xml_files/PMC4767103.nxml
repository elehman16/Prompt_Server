Bupivacaine, the most commonly used local anesthetic agent for spinal anesthesia, is a racemic mixture with higher lipid solubility. Ropivacaine is structurally similar to bupivacaine but is a single S-enantiomer with a propyl side chain replacing the butyl group. The smaller side chain of ropivacaine contributes to less lipid solubility, less toxicity and better safety profile with an increased separation of sensory and motor blockade compared to bupivacaine[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (a phenomenon described as differential blockade). However, the time of onset of rest pain at the surgical site and the duration of motor block is significantly shorter with ropivacaine spinal anesthesia. The duration of sensory block with ropivacaine is two-thirds and the duration of motor block is half when compared with bupivacaine. Most of the studies conducted previously have used ropivacaine as an isobaric solution, which could result in unpredictable block characteristics as compared to a hyperbaric solution.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] By making the ropivacaine hyperbaric, the block characteristics might become more predictable similar to hyperbaric bupivacaine. Clonidine, when added as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine as part of spinal anesthetic, has been shown to decrease the time to onset of block, increase its depth and duration, decrease the amount of bleeding from the surgical field, and provide prolonged postoperative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine added to isobaric ropivacaine in epidural anesthesia has been shown to increase the intensity of blockage and provide longer duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Literature search did not reveal any studies of hyperbaric ropivacaine with clonidine as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia. This study evaluates the characteristics of sensory and motor blockade and duration of analgesia with the addition of two different doses of clonidine (15 mcg and 30 mcg) to hyperbaric ropivacaine (0.5%) spinal anesthetic and their side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study is a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled study on ninety patients who were undergoing lower limb or lower abdominal surgery, conducted after obtaining approval by the Institutional Research and Ethics Committee (JIP/IEC/SC/1/2012/9).</p><p>Patients aged between 20 and 60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grade 1 were included in the study after obtaining valid informed written consent from them; those with contraindications for spinal anesthesia, known allergy to the study drugs, pregnancy, and short stature (&#x0003c;140 cm), were excluded [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT statement for the present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-38-g001"/></fig><p>Patients were allocated into one of the following groups by computer generated random numbers to receive a total volume of 3.2 ml of intrathecal drugs: Group R (hyperbaric ropivacaine 12 mg), Group C15 (hyperbaric ropivacaine 12 mg + 15 mcg clonidine) and group C30 (hyperbaric ropivacaine 12 mg + 30 mcg clonidine). Hyperbaric ropivacaine 0.5% was prepared by adding 1 ml of 25% dextrose to 2 ml of 0.75% isobaric ropivacaine.</p><p>Sample size was calculated using OpenEpi software (opensource.org, version 3.03a), with power of 80% and confidence interval of 95%, based on findings in the study by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in which times to two-segment regression were 96.60 &#x000b1; 14.20 min with 1% ropivacaine 12 mg and 111.00 &#x000b1; 19.84 min with 1% ropivacaine 12 mg + clonidine 15 &#x003bc;g and 119.20 &#x000b1; 18.47 min with 1% ropivacaine 12 mg + clonidine 30 &#x003bc;g.</p><p>In the operating room, continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, and oxygen saturation was established; IV cannula secured and the patient preloaded with 15 ml/kg body weight of Ringer's lactate solution. The patient was positioned in left lateral position and under aseptic precautions lumbar puncture was done using 25-gauge Quincke needle in the midline at the L3-L4/L2-L3 space. The drug was injected at a rate of 0.2 ml/s After turning the patient supine, the following parameters were noted by independent anesthesiologists who were not involved in the study; sensory blockade characteristics noted were: Maximum level of sensory block, time to achieve maximum height of sensory block, time to two-segment regression of the sensory block, time for the height of sensory block to reduce to T10 and L1 levels, time to first sensation of pain, and time to first analgesic requirement. Motor blockade characteristics noted were: Maximum motor block level, time to achieve maximum motor block, and duration of the motor block. Intra-operative side effects noted were: Hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, and shivering. Postoperative side effects noted were: Headache, backache and transient neurological symptoms (TNS). Motor block was assessed using modified Bromage score; sedation scoring was done every 15 min throughout the study using Ramsay sedation scale.</p><p>A decrease of more than 30% from the baseline value of mean arterial pressure (MAP) or below 90 mm of Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP) was considered as hypotension and was treated with mephentermine 3 mg IV. A decrease in heart rate (HR) below 50 beats/min was considered as bradycardia and atropine 0.4 mg IV was administered. Total doses of mephentermine and atropine used were recorded. Any additional analgesia or induction of general anesthesia required were noted, along with the time at which it was required. The independent investigator at the end of surgery judged the overall quality of intra-operative analgesia as excellent (no discomfort or pain), good (mild pain or discomfort, no need of additional analgesic), or poor (moderate or severe pain that require more than 100 mcg of fentanyl or general anesthesia). Time to eliciting first pain sensation (complete analgesia) and time to first request of analgesics (effective analgesia) were noted. During postoperative visits over the next 3 days, patients were evaluated for possible side effects including headache, back pain, and TNS.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The Statistical software namely SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.

It has been shown to prolong the duration and improve the quality of analgesia provided by intrathecal-local anesthetics when administered orally,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] intramuscularly,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] intravenously[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and when added as adjuvant to neuraxial[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and peripheral nerve blocks.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] By making the ropivacaine hyperbaric, the block characteristics become more predictable, and the addition of clonidine is expected to prolong the duration of clinically useful block for surgeries. The present study demonstrates that clonidine when added in low doses (15 &#x000b5;g and 30 &#x000b5;g) to intrathecal-hyperbaric ropivacaine decreases the time taken to reach T10 sensory level, decreases the time taken to achieve maximum block height and increases the duration of spinal anesthesia.</p><p>In this study, there was no significant difference in the maximum block height achieved among the three groups (maximum block height - T4, minimum block height - T8, and median block height - T6); this is in keeping with the previous study by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (T8.12 &#x000b1; 2.51 in control group, T7.16 &#x000b1; 2.43 in 15 mcg clonidine group and T7.28 &#x000b1; 2.54 in 30 mcg clonidine group). De Kock <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] achieved a median level of T10 (T4-T12) with isobaric ropivacaine 8 mg, T8 (T4-L3) in isobaric ropivacaine 8 mg with 15 mcg clonidine, and T4 (T3-L2) in isobaric ropivacaine 8 mg with 45 mcg clonidine. Isobaric ropivacaine used in their study would explain this finding compared to our study in which hyperbaric ropivacaine was used.</p><p>In our study, there was no significant difference in time to achieve maximum block between both clonidine groups when compared with control group (11.53 &#x000b1; 3.34 min) separately. Time to maximum block was significantly shorter with 30 mcg clonidine (10.07 &#x000b1; 2.82 min) compared to 15 mcg clonidine (12.03 &#x000b1; 2.68 min) when added to hyperbaric ropivacaine; though statistically significant, the values are clinically insignificant. Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and De Kock <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that there were no differences between the groups with or without clonidine in terms of time to onset of maximum sensory and motor blocks.</p><p>Motor block was achieved faster in 30 mcg clonidine (6.80 &#x000b1; 1.94 min) group than 15 mcg (9.40 &#x000b1; 2.66 min) group, and both groups with clonidine achieved motor block faster compared to control group (11.83 &#x000b1; 3.23 min).

This difference may be due to the use of isobaric ropivacaine instead of hyperbaric ropiovacaine.</p><p>The time to regression by two-segment was significantly longer in 30 mcg (157.00 &#x000b1; 13.49 min) group compared to 15 mcg (124.00 &#x000b1; 14.17 min) and control group (111.83 &#x000b1; 14.35 min). Patients who received 15 mcg of clonidine had longer two segment regression time as compared to control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] also had similar results with two-segment regression time of 119.20 &#x000b1; 18.47 min in 30 mcg clonidine group, 111.00 &#x000b1; 19.84 min in 15 mcg clonidine group, and 96.60 &#x000b1; 14.20 min in control group.

Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported that the duration of motor block is significantly longer in group with 15 mcg clonidine and group with 30 mcg clonidine compared to control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between groups with 15 mcg and 30 mcg clonidine in their study. Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also recorded a longer duration for two-segment regression of sensory level and recovery from motor blockade with the addition of 1 mcg/kg clonidine. Similar findings were recorded in studies using bupivacaine with clonidine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>De Kock <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that analgesic use was necessary in 1 patient in the clonidine-free group and two patients in the 15 &#x003bc;g group while there was no need for extra doses of analgesics in the 45 mcg and 75 &#x003bc;g clonidine groups. In our study, only two patients in R Group and none of the patients in the clonidine groups required additional analgesics. The use of hyperbaric ropivacaine instead of isobaric preparation may have led to better blockade in the 15 mcg group in our study. Also in study by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] the need for additional analgesics was diminished in the 30 mcg clonidine group compared to the other groups (16%, 16%, and 8%, respectively). In this study, isobaric ropivacaine was used, which is probably the reason for additional analgesic requirement intra-operatively in all the groups.</p><p>Time for first sensation of pain in our study was significantly longer in both groups with clonidine compared to control group (165.17 &#x000b1; 35.80 min) and also there was significant difference between 30C Group (216.50 &#x000b1; 28.86 min) and 15C Group (190.00 &#x000b1; 33.73 min) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). In our study, the time for request for analgesic was longer with addition of clonidine compared to control group, (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), but 30 mcg clonidine and 15 mcg clonidine groups had similar time for request for analgesic. (mean &#x000b1; SD, 234.83 &#x000b1; 36.45 min and 217.00 &#x000b1; 37.73 min, respectively with <italic>P</italic> = 0.158). This is similar to the study by Dobrydnjov <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which concluded that increasing the dose of clonidine from 15 to 30 mcg did not increase the duration of analgesia (mean &#x000b1; SD 274 &#x000b1; 94 min and 253 &#x000b1; 71 min). The difference in the actual duration of analgesia between the two studies can be attributed to the different local anesthetic preparation used. The data obtained from the study by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] indicate that addition of 1 mcg/kg of clonidine (much higher dose of clonidine, mean dose of 57.93 mcg) to 0.5% bupivacaine significantly prolongs the analgesia (223 min and 614 min respectively) and thus reduced the postoperative analgesic requirement.</p><p>SBP and MAP were significantly lower in both 15 and 30 mcg clonidine groups. Our study findings in this regard are similar to previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The maximum dose of clonidine used in the study by Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was 70 mcg along with bupivacaine 12.5 mg 0.5%. Although a statistically significant decrease in MAP and HR was noted in the clonidine group compared to the control group, none of the patients required any therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Incidence of hypotension and use of mephentermine were significantly more with addition of clonidine, and it was dose dependent as hypotension was more with 30 mcg clonidine (83.3%) compared to 15 mcg clonidine (46.7%). The previous studies also reported higher requirement of vasopressor drugs in intrathecal-clonidine, which is in agreement with our study results.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The maximum sensory level achieved was higher in our study (T6) compared to the study by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (T8), which probably explains the higher requirement of vasopressor in our study.</p><p>Bradycardia and use of atropine were associated more often with the use of clonidine intrathecally, and such use was greater with addition of 30 mcg (23.3%) compared to 15 mcg (6.7%) of the drug. This finding is in agreement with the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] did not report increased requirement of mephentermine or atropine even though 70 mcg clonidine was used with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. This may have been due to lower volumes of drug used in them (2.5 ml) as compared to our study (3.2 ml).</p><p>In our study, the addition of low-dose clonidine did not cause any significant sedation as measured using Ramsay sedation scale. Previous studies reported sedation in 20&#x02013;53.33% of cases.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The different types of sedation scale and cut-off values used could be the reasons for the differences in the number of patients classified as sedated. No significant respiratory depression was seen in their study, which is similar to our finding. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and shivering during surgery did not differ between the different groups in our study. None of our patients had complaints of headache, backache, or TNS. There is wide variation with respect to the occurrence of postoperative complications in previous studies, and none of the studies could actually reproduce any kind of pattern that is similar to other studies in this regard.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The addition of low-dose clonidine to intrathecal hyperbaric ropivacaine causes a significant prolongation of the duration of sensory and motor blockade as well as postoperative analgesia compared with saline placebo. This increased duration could potentially be helpful when a certain surgery gets prolonged beyond its anticipated duration. Further, such effect could extend into the postoperative period and result in better analgesia with reduced need for additional polypharmacy directed at pain relief. Even though 30 mcg clonidine significantly prolonged the duration of sensory and motor blockade compared to 15 mcg clonidine group, the duration of postoperative analgesia was similar between these two groups. However, the addition of clonidine significantly increases the incidence of intra-operative hypotension and bradycardia, which can be easily managed with routine clinical measures.</p><sec
