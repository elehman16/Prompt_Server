Recent reviews of web-based interventions in adults show that they have positive but small effects on physical activity but identify a number of limitations including a reliance on self-report measures of outcome. This trial used an objective measure of physical activity to assess the effectiveness of three minimal contact interventions: 1) A multi-component web-based intervention incorporating objective monitoring and graphical feedback of physical activity; 2) A version of the first intervention that consisted only of objective monitoring plus web-based graphical feedback; and 3) Self-monitoring of physical activity using a paper diary.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p><italic>Get Moving</italic> is an individually randomised controlled trial with allocation of 488 participants to one of three interventions or to a no-intervention control group. Participants are physically inactive working adults aged 18&#x02013;65 years. They attended a baseline assessment session at which anthropometric, biological and questionnaire measures were taken and they completed a treadmill exercise test. They then wore a combined movement and heart rate monitor for six days and nights before being randomised to one of the four trial arms. The baseline measures were repeated at the follow-up assessment which took place approximately 12&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation, conducted by staff blind to group allocation. Participants wore the movement and heart rate monitor for six days and nights before this. The co-primary outcomes are: physical activity energy expenditure measured using individually calibrated combined heart-rate and movement data; and cardiorespiratory fitness measured using a sub-maximal treadmill exercise test.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Strengths of the trial include the use of an objective measure of physical activity, a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, relatively large sample size and the use of robust methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding to outcome assessment. <italic>Get Moving</italic> will contribute to the evidence base on minimal contact interventions for increasing physical activity.

Physical inactivity is now recognised as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], accounting for 6% of all deaths. As such, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults should do at least 150&#x000a0;minutes (2.5&#x000a0;hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, studies examining the dose&#x02013;response relationship of physical activity have shown that higher intensity activity (i.e. vigorous-intensity physical activity) improves cardiorespiratory fitness and provides health benefits which are comparable with, and in some cases even greater than, those observed for moderate-intensity activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite the health benefits of physical activity however, insufficient physical activity remains highly prevalent. In the UK more than half of all adults report not meeting recommended levels of physical activity &#x02013; which is likely to be an optimistic figure given that 95% are not meeting recommended levels when activity is measured objectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The cost of inactivity to the UK National Health Service (NHS) was estimated at &#x000a3;1.06 billion in 2002, not accounting for the indirect costs resulting from days lost due to sickness absence, premature mortality, private healthcare costs and home care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. International reviews conclude that reversal of this physical inactivity pandemic requires public health programmes to encourage increasing activity at societal level, but also interventions to help high risk individuals to increase their levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Previous randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of physical activity promotion among high-risk individuals for reducing the risk of several major non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, these trials have typically been face-to-face interventions &#x02013; that is, interventions delivered in person &#x02013; and have been overseen by primary care doctors, physiotherapists, health visitors, health educators, specialist nurses and physical trainers, thereby making them expensive and difficult to implement in real-world settings. Furthermore, greater population health gain will be achieved through shifts in the overall distribution of physical activity as opposed to targeting high-risk groups. The major challenge at this point therefore lies in creating and delivering physical activity interventions which are effective, scalable and affordable to the general adult population. Programmes that deliver an intervention without face-to-face contact may be one way of overcoming these challenges.</p><p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing and evaluating web-based interventions for physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These offer several advantages over face-to-face interventions and those based on printed materials and telephone contact, including the potential to reach a large number of people at a relatively low cost, the ability to provide 24-hour access to intervention materials, and the capacity to provide immediate and tailored feedback. Recent reviews of web-based interventions in adults have shown that they have positive but small effects on physical activity. However, they identify a number of methodological limitations of published trials including a reliance on self-report measures of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the Get Moving trial (<italic>Get Moving</italic>), we are evaluating the effectiveness of a multicomponent web-based intervention developed by Imperative Health (part of AXA ICAS) and designed to support behaviour change in the domains of physical activity and diet. A key feature of the intervention is objective self-monitoring of physical activity. Participants are issued with a tri-axial wrist-worn accelerometer (activity band) from which physical activity data can be wirelessly uploaded to the website where they can view graphs of their progress. Objective monitoring and feedback may facilitate behaviour change in two ways. First, many physically inactive people are not aware of being inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], so feedback may help to motivate them to change. Second, continuous monitoring and feedback enables people to track their progress towards a goal, which is consistent with self-regulation theories of behaviour change such as control theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Pedometers are commonly used in monitoring and feedback interventions, and there is evidence for the effectiveness of pedometer-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, few studies to date have evaluated interventions that combine objective monitoring of physical activity with web-based feedback. Richardson and colleagues found a significant increase in physical activity from before to after a six-week intervention in which participants (people with type 2 diabetes) used pedometers with USB ports, uploaded step-count data to a website and received automated feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, this intervention has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Slootmaker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] conducted a trial of the PAM (personal activity monitor) system in 102 young office workers. The PAM is a uni-axial accelerometer typically worn on the waist and continuously displays a score showing the cumulative amount of physical activity performed in that day. The information could be uploaded to a website which provided tailored advice and graphically displayed the participant&#x02019;s progress. The intervention had no significant effect on physical activity or aerobic fitness at three- and eight-month follow-up compared with an information leaflet containing general physical activity recommendations. However, a similar trial in secondary school children found significant effects of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Physical activity was measured by self-report in both trials.</p><p>In the <italic>Get Moving</italic> Trial, in addition to the full multi-component web-based intervention incorporating objective monitoring and graphical feedback of wrist-based physical activity monitoring with an online coaching engine (individualised in response to objective activity data), we include a version of the intervention which consists only of objective monitoring plus web-based graphical feedback. This enables us to test whether objective monitoring and feedback on its own is an effective intervention for physical activity and whether the additional components in the full intervention including the coaching element have any added benefit. The third and final intervention will be self-monitoring of physical activity using a paper-based diary. This technique has been used in numerous physical activity interventions but few studies have attempted to test it in isolation. The review by Fair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] identified three such trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which yielded a non-significant average effect. Self-monitoring using a diary might be expected to facilitate behaviour change through some of the same mechanisms as the objective device-based monitoring with web-based feedback. However, there are potentially important differences between the two approaches that may influence their relative efficacy. For example, the diary method will provide less complete and less quantitative information and therefore cruder feedback about physical activity compared with objective monitoring; the feedback differs in format (diary entries versus activity graph displayed on a webpage); and the monitoring task (writing in the diary versus uploading data from a wearable device) is carried out daily, which may affect engagement with and adherence to the intervention.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main objective of <italic>Get Moving</italic> is to assess the effectiveness of three minimal contact interventions on objectively measured physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE; a measure of total physical activity) and cardiorespiratory fitness in a general adult population. The interventions will be compared with each other and with a no-intervention control group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p><italic>Get Moving</italic> is a parallel group, open label, randomised controlled trial with allocation of 488 participants to either no intervention (control group) or to one of three intervention groups: self-monitoring using paper-based diaries (diary group), activity band with web-based feedback (activity band group), or activity band with web-based feedback plus online coaching engine (activity band plus group). The co-primary outcomes are: (1) PAEE measured using individually calibrated combined heart-rate and movement sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and (2) cardiorespiratory fitness measured using heart rate response to a sub-maximal treadmill exercise test. The secondary outcomes are: anthropometric measures (body mass index (BMI), body fat %, weight and waist circumference), blood pressure, plasma vitamin C levels, biochemical measures (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fructosamine, cholesterol and triglycerides), Short Form 8 (SF-8) health survey questionnaire, theory of planned behaviour (TPB) measures, perceived stress, self-monitoring behaviour and self-reported recent physical activity (RPAQ).

Contact was made with each institution on the Biomedical Campus to establish an appropriate contact, who was asked to circulate a generic advert to staff and students, via newsletter, email, posters and/or via their institution&#x02019;s intranet, with the aim of reaching all staff and students on the Campus. Recruitment stands were run in areas frequented by staff and students, e.g. staff canteen and lobby areas. Individuals who registered an interest in taking part in the study were sent an information sheet about the study and a brief questionnaire to complete and return to assess the first of a three stage eligibility assessment process (excluded if physically active (scoring &#x02265;30 on the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) for moderate-to-vigorous activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]); were instructed by their GP not to engage in regular physical activity; were unable to walk briskly on the flat for 15 minutes without help). If an individual met this stage of eligibility criteria, they were contacted by telephone to go through the second stage of eligibility screening (excluded if they were participating in another clinical randomised trial; taking &#x02265;100&#x000a0;mg/day of Atenolol or an equivalent amount of another beta-blocker; were pregnant; planning on leaving their position on the Biomedical Campus within 4&#x000a0;months of recruitment; did not have access to or were unable to operate an internet-connected home PC running the minimum specification requirements set by Imperative; or could not use an English-language website). Potential participants who remained eligible discussed participation in the trial in more detail with the study team by telephone and were given the opportunity to ask questions prior to booking an appointment to attend for baseline measures.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>On arriving at the measurement centre, having fasted for the preceding one hour (including abstaining from nicotine, caffeine and vigorous exercise), individuals provided fully informed written consent following a discussion about the study with the measurement team. Height, weight and blood pressure were measured first to check the third stage exclusion criteria (individuals whose BMI was &#x02264;18&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or who had a mean blood pressure &#x02265;160/100&#x000a0;mmHg &#x02013; those routinely excluded by the Imperative Health system as a safety precaution). This was explained to potential participants prior to their attendance at the measurement visit in the information sheet and also during the telephone call. Individuals who met all inclusion criteria continued with the visit. All baseline information was collected prior to randomisation. Participants had anthropometric and biological measurements taken (see <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Measures</xref> section and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for further details). Participants then completed a treadmill exercise test which was terminated when 80% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate (i.e. 208 minus 0.7*age) was reached. Predicted maximal cardio-respiratory fitness (VO<sub>2max.pred</sub>) was estimated using extrapolation of the heart-rate to VO<sub>2</sub> relationship to age-predicted maximal heart rate. Participants were asked to provide demographic information and to complete a number of questionnaire measures (see <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Measures</xref> section and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Anthropometric and clinical measurement values were concealed from participants unless they specifically asked to see the results, thereby minimising the possibility of behaviour change associated with clinical feedback and to maximise participant retention at follow-up. Before leaving the measurement centre, participants were fitted with a combined movement and heart rate monitor (Actiheart, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) and were instructed to wear the monitor for six days and nights continuously. They were instructed on how to change ECG electrodes (supplied), both verbally and in writing with depiction of correct placement. In the event that an insufficient amount of valid data was collected from the combined monitor following two separate wear periods, the participant was not able to continue in the study.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The Activity Band is a wrist-worn device containing a tri-axial accelerometer similar to the one described by Esliger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It is able to store movement data for up to two weeks until it is uploaded via Bluetooth to the Imperative Health website, which displays the physical activity data in graphical format. Participants were instructed to activate their account within one week of receiving the intervention and to log on to their account to upload their movement data and view their activity graphs at least once per week. The activity graphs numerically and graphically show the number of minutes of physical activity undertaken each day, each week and each month, separated into three different activity intensities (moderate, high and very high intensity activity). If no account activity was detected for a continuous period of 15&#x000a0;days, Imperative Health liaised with the study team who contacted the participant to find out if they were experiencing any technical problems with the programme or were no longer interested in receiving the intervention.

In brief, <italic>Phase 1</italic> (level walking) involves level walking with increasing speed (3&#x000a0;min at 3.2&#x000a0;km/h and then accelerating at 0.33&#x000a0;km/h/min for the next 6&#x000a0;min), <italic>Phase 2</italic> (graded walking) consists of brisk walking (5.2&#x02013;5.8&#x000a0;km/h) with increasing gradient (at a rate of 1.7% increased gradient/min for 6&#x000a0;min), and <italic>Phase 3</italic> (level running) involves level running with the treadmill speed increasing from 9 to 12.6&#x000a0;km/h for 4.5&#x000a0;min (average acceleration of 0.78&#x000a0;km/h/min). Transition between <italic>Phase 2</italic> and <italic>3</italic> entails a change in gradient of &#x02212;10.2% over 30&#x000a0;seconds (to a level gradient), followed by a change in speed of +3.2&#x000a0;km/h over 30&#x000a0;seconds. The protocol finishes with a two minute standing recovery. The treadmill protocol is terminated early in the event that the participant wishes to stop or if 80% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate of the participant is exceeded. Energy cost (oxygen consumption) of this protocol is predicted from time (speed and incline) as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated by extrapolation of the heart rate/oxygen consumption relationship to age-predicted maximal heart-rate. We only used data up to the time point which denotes the lowest common denominator between the baseline and follow-up visit for each participant.</p><p>Free-living physical activity was assessed at baseline and again at 12&#x000a0;weeks using combined sensing, following the pre-processing of the heart rate trace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Data from the fitness test (see above) was used to individually calibrate heart-rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and combined with acceleration in a branched equation framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to estimate activity intensity (J/min/kg). Resulting time-series data are summarised as PAEE (kJ/kg/day) and time spent in sedentary (SED, in hours/day) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA, in min/day), whilst minimising diurnal information bias caused by non-wear periods (segments of non-physiological data). Participants without individual calibration data have their free-living data processed using an age, sex, beta-blocker and sleeping heart rate adjusted group calibration equation for the translation of heart rate into activity intensity.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Anthropometric measures</title><p>Height was measured without shoes using a wall-mounted fixed rigid stadiometer.

A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) was taken using a 12-lead ECG (Seca CT6i/CT6Pi).</p><p>Dietary intake of fruits and vegetables was assessed by plasma vitamin C levels. As humans are unable to synthesise vitamin C, and because the main source of vitamin C in the Westernised diet is fruits and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], vitamin C levels provide an objective measure of dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The cardiorespiratory fitness test used was submaximal, and only undertaken following extensive screening procedures. If a participant had a positive Rose angina questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] or an abnormal ECG then they were referred to a clinical member of the measurement team for a more detailed medical review. If there were clinical concerns then the treadmill test was terminated early and/or the participant referred to their GP.

Participants&#x02019; mean (SD) PAEE at baseline in the ProActive trial was 0.116 (0.076) kJ/kg/min. 100 participants per group completing follow-up would allow detection of a difference of 0.03&#x000a0;kJ/kg/min in PAEE (which is equivalent to approximately 225&#x02013;300 Kcals or 20&#x000a0;minutes of brisk walking per day) with 80% power at a 5% significance level. Since the analysis will adjust for baseline values in an ANCOVA model, and assuming a correlation between baseline and follow-up PAEE of 0.58 (as estimated in ProActive), 100 participants per group at follow-up would enable detection of a difference between groups in mean PAEE of 0.025&#x000a0;kJ/kg/min.</p><p>Participants&#x02019; mean (SD) for cardiovascular fitness at baseline in the ProActive trial was 3.2 (1.0) L/min with a correlation between baseline and follow-up of 0.88.

Random checks of entered data against the source document are performed, and the data are then assessed for outlying values together with appropriate range and consistency checks.</p><p>Trained personnel conduct the <italic>Get Moving</italic> trial according to standard operating procedures and the principles of Good Clinical Practice.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>Get Moving</italic> will contribute to the evidence base on minimal contact interventions for physical activity by providing estimates of the effectiveness of three interventions: 1) A multi-component web-based intervention incorporating objective monitoring and graphical feedback of physical activity; 2) A version of the first intervention that consists only of objective monitoring plus web-based graphical feedback; and 3) Self-monitoring of physical activity using a paper diary. Comparisons between trial arms will enable us to address both pragmatic questions (how effective is each intervention compared with a no-intervention control condition?) and explanatory ones (do the additional components of the web-based intervention increase effectiveness over and above monitoring and feedback alone?; is objective monitoring and web-based feedback more effective than self-monitoring using a paper diary?). <italic>Get Moving</italic> will also provide information about potential mediation pathways.</p><p>Previous studies of minimal contact interventions have relied on self-report measures of physical activity. A major strength of <italic>Get Moving</italic> is the use of an objective measure of physical activity (PAEE measured using individually calibrated combined heart-rate and movement monitor data) and of cardiorespiratory fitness. Other strengths include the relatively large sample size and the use of robust methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment.</p><p>The participants in <italic>Get Moving</italic> are physically inactive working adults recruited from a single large campus housing a teaching hospital, university departments and research institutes. However, the interventions are scalable and could be implemented in other occupational health settings and also in primary care.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>Electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLTEQ</term><def><p>Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAEE</term><def><p>Physical activity energy expenditure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM</term><def><p>Personal activity monitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPAQ</term><def><p>Recent physical activity questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SED</term><def><p>Sedentary time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-8</term><def><p>Short Form 8 health survey questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRHI</term><def><p>Self-Report Habit Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TPB</term><def><p>Theory of planned behaviour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO<sub>2max.pred</sub></term><def><p>Predicted maximal cardio-respiratory fitness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SSu and SG defined the research question.
