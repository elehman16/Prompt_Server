A prospective clinical trial was performed in 23 primary care pediatric doctors&#x02019; offices on children with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection with fever for at least 48 hours. The children were randomized into 2 groups: one using a point-of-care white blood cell (WBC) count as guidance and the other prescribing antibiotics to all children, according to delayed antibiotics prescription strategy. A total of 792 patients participated. In the WBC group (n = 437), 56 patients had WBC &#x0003e;15&#x02009;000/mm<sup>3</sup> and received antibiotics. At follow-up, an additional 44 children received antibiotics. In the control group (n = 355), antibiotics were prescribed to all children. The reduction of antibiotic usage was 77% between the groups. The decrease in antibiotic usage gave no influence on recovery, complications, or other medical outcome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general pediatrics</kwd><kwd>infectious diseases</kwd><kwd>allergy/immunology</kwd><kwd>medical education</kwd><kwd>critical care</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333794X15615771"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the United States, each year at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23&#x02009;000 people die as a direct result of those infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Using antibiotics correctly is literally a matter of life and death.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Italy has one of the highest antibiotic prescription rates in Europe.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, comparing statistics from 2010 showed similar prescription rate in the United States as in Italy.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Recent data from 2013 in the Italian pediatric population confirmed the overuse of antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Common indications were acute infections of the respiratory tracts and acute infections of the lower urinary tracts.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are one of the most common reasons for consultation in pediatric primary care.

The inclusion criteria were patients with nonspecific URTIs, observed for the first time having fever for at least 48 hours together with symptoms of coughing, sneezing, muscle pain, runny mucus, or purulent mucous (lasting less than 10 days), a finding of hyperemia of the pharynx and/or eardrums, and normal breath sounds.</p><p>Excluded in the enrollment were children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, chronic lung diseases (cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia, bronchodisplasie, chronic bronchiectasis, congenital or acquired), and leukemia, as well as children with a clear diagnose of acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, group A &#x003b2;-hemolytic streptococcus (positive rapid Strep A test), and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Otitis media was based on fever and/or otalgia, bulging, and hyperemia of the tympanum. For acute sinusitis the considered symptoms were fever, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, cough lasting more than 10 days or worsening after the clinical symptoms improving period. LRTIs were diagnosed in children with cough, abnormal breath sounds, wheezes, and crackles.</p><p>The enrolled children were randomized into 2 groups: the experimental group using the point-of-care WBC count as part of the clinical investigation (Leukocyte group) and the control group getting antibiotic treatment according to delayed antibiotics prescription strategy (Control group).<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The enrollment was carried out after obtaining parental consent.</p><p>During the 6 months of observation, each pediatrician performed clinical evaluations of 60 patients, all reported in real time.

Usage of a point-of-care WBC count as a complement to the clinical investigation substantially reduces antibiotic prescription. The most important finding was no adverse consequences on recovery and outcome for the patient compared to the Control group where all children received antibiotics.</p><p>Many attempts have been made to reduce antibiotic prescription. Guidelines and campaigns have been established in order to obtain a shift in clinical practice and the antibiotic prescription pattern. A decline of 36% in antibiotic use for young children with acute respiratory tract infections over a decade has been reached.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, despite guidelines, information, and campaigns there is still an overuse of antibiotics.</p><p>As a complement to the clinical investigation the use of diagnostic markers such as WBC, C-reactive protein, and other inflammation markers could serve as an aid to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A European study showed that physicians with access to C-reactive protein tests significantly reduced antibiotic prescription in patients with rhinosinusitis.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We decided to use the WBC count because of ease of use and cost. Earlier, Casey et al<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> showed that with a leukocyte count there is a significant reduction of prescription of antibiotics for children with infections of the upper respiratory tract. The present study not only confirmed the mentioned results but also introduced a standardized method to be used at doctors&#x02019; offices.</p><p>On children with URTIs, usage of a point-of-care WBC count can help identifying the high bacterial infection risk patients. The reduction of the prescription rate was 77% compared to existing practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A reduction of incongruous antibiotic prescription would lead to a potential decrease of antimicrobial resistance and also lead to a reduction of pharmaceutical spending.</p><p>It can always be discussed if it was appropriate to prescribe antibiotics to all patients in our Control group. The main reason was that we wanted to show that the reductions of prescription were safe and effective for the patients giving no adverse differences in clinical outcome. Prescribing antibiotics after fever &#x0003e;48 to 72 hours in children with persistent URTIs is a common practice in Italy, but it is also an event reported in other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X15615771" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>We could have used other inflammation markers but decided to use the HemoCue WBC System because it is easy to handle, cheap, and gives a result within 3 minutes, and in addition, a WBC count is a well-known marker to all clinicians. The study showed the efficacy of using the WBC POCT method directly at the pediatricians&#x02019; offices to additionally reduce the antibiotic prescription in delayed antibiotic therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section5-2333794X15615771"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Reduction of inappropriate use of antibiotics is important in avoiding antibiotic resistance. This study in pediatric primary care has highlighted the inappropriateness of antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent URTIs. By adding a point-of-care WBC count as a part of the clinical investigation on children having fever and symptoms for at least 48 hours, the prescription of antibiotics in a pediatric setting could be significantly reduced. The decrease in antibiotic usage gave no influence on recovery, complications, or other medical outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the participating practitioners: Giuliana Apuzzo, Elvira Boccia, Francesco Carlomagno, Vincenzo Caruso, Claudio D&#x02019;Atti, Antonio D&#x02019;Avino, Maria De Giovanni, Antonio de Prosperis, Antonio Fasolino, Fattore Stanislao, Patrizia Gallo, Maria Giuliano, Eugenio Iaccarino, Emilio Iannotta, Paul Lazzarini, Antonio Limongelli, Biancamaria Maione, Natale Maresca, Lorenzo Marinello, Luigi Morcaldi, Antonio Opallo, Fausto Pandolfi, Biagio Fausto Pittari, Renato Sansone, Antonio Scialdone, Claudio Simeone, Maura Sticco, Giannamaria Vallefuoco, Enrico Vecchio.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> LC: contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>RL: contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>RS: contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>AB: contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy.</p><p>DG: contributed to conception and design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; drafted manuscript; critically revised manuscript; gave final approval; agrees to be accountable for all aspects of work ensuring integrity and accuracy</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2333794X15615771"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
