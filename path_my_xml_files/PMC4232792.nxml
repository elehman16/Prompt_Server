The main complaint of patients after open-heart surgery is chest pain. Due to the side effects of opioids, it is important to use a non-invasive way to effectively relieve pain including aromatherapy with analgesics. This study was a clinical single-blind trial and was conducted on 40 patients who had open-heart surgery in the cardiac ICU of 2 Hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 2012. Criteria included: full consciousness, spontaneous breathing ability and not using synthetic opioids within 2 hours before extubation. After extubation, the patients were asked to mark the intensity of their pain using the visual analogue scale. Then, a cotton swab which was impregnated with 2 drops of lavender essential oil 2% was placed in their oxygen mask, and they got breath for 10 minutes. 30 minutes after aromatherapy, they were asked to re-mark their pain intensity. The level of patient&#x02019;s pain before and after aroma therapy were compared. The pain mean level before and after inhaling lavender essential oil was 5.60 (SD = 2.262) and 4.98 (SD = 2.293), respectively (p-value&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore, there is no significant difference and the result of study proves that lavender essential oil inhalation has no effect on reducing the pain of open-heart surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Aromatherapy</kwd><kwd>Lavender</kwd><kwd>Control of pain</kwd><kwd>Open-heart surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nowadays, heart surgery is one of the most common surgeries and has its own side effects (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A problem in this surgery is that all heart surgeries make variable levels of pain and postoperative pain for patients which are not negligible at all (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Researches have shown that patients that their postoperative pain is poorly controlled may experience heart failure and infection three and five times more than others, respectively (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Moreover, open-heart surgery pain occurs during 24-72 hours after surgery (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and it usually increases by coughing, movement, and changing position (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Meanwhile, open-heart surgery pain causes ineffective respiration that will make a delay in leaving the bed, immobility and stagnation of blood flow. </p><p>Developing the blood clot will increase the risk of pulmonary embolism (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Also, acute pain effects on the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and endocrine systems. In addition, the postoperative pain actuates the sympathetic system that will cause to increase blood pressure, pulse, heart rate and breathing increases and becomes superficial as well. In fact, each of them increases oxygen demand required by the body, which will cause pressure on the heart muscle and subsequently, the pressure on the heart will increase. All these situations are very dangerous, especially in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidences indicated that the pain of more than 75% of open-heart surgery patients were not given appropriate and adequate care and patients had painful experiences of the time in hospital (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Wang <italic>et al</italic>. also wrote that although the pain of incision was inevitable, it was controllable and in the absence of rapid and appropriate controls, it could become severe and lead to chronic pain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Besides, it could cause immobility, reduction of pulmonary ventilation and consequently delayed recovery, prolonged hospital admission and increasing the costs (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Postoperative pain control is one of the major challenges for nurses. They can use pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Morphine is the most common used pain relievers after heart surgery (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) .The opioids have some unwanted side effects that may include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, hypotension, constipation and respiratory depression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It also can increase patient's tolerance to the drugs (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Drugs are not the only way to control pain, although they are the most effective available means for nurses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Due to the side effects of opioids, some procedures with low complications will be used to relieve the pain as a nursing skill (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Conceivably, not only the use of non-invasive methods can be effective in relieving pain but also the side effects of taking too many analgesics which in many cases are threatening the health and lives of patients, can decrease. However, the patient suffering from pain can benefit from various methods of complementary medicine. Among these, aromatherapy is a technique of using volatile oils, for psychological and physical health (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Previously, the effects of some other herb extracts were exanimate clinically (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Lavender (<italic>Lavandula officinalis</italic>) from labiatae family with some therapeutic properties is vastly used in the variety of aromatherapy methods (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The primary components of lavender oil are <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linalool">linalool</ext-link> (51%) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linalyl_acetate">linalyl acetate</ext-link> (35%).

Applying a few drops of lavender essential oil to handkerchief and inhaling it is useful for treating insomnia, fatigue, stress and fear. Warm compress is used in menstrual cramps, stomachache, arthritis, migraine and muscle cramps (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p> In 2006, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. studied on &#x0201c;the evaluation of aromatherapy in treating postoperative pain in New York&#x0201d;. They studied on the aromatherapy by lavender essential oil on 50 patients undergoing breast biopsy. The results showed postoperative lavender oil did not significantly affect pain scores. However, patients in the lavender group reported a higher satisfaction rate regarding pain control than patients in the control group (P = 0.0001) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

<italic>Methods</italic>
</p><p>This study is a single-blind clinical trial, which has the ethical approval from Ethics Committee of Islamic Azad University of Tehran Medical Branch, and was conducted on 40 patients who had undergone open-heart surgery, cardiac ICU departments in Moheb Hospital and Tehran Heart Center. The lavender oil was prepared by hydrodistillation from <italic>Lavandula officinalis</italic> (<italic>L. vera</italic>) collected from botanical garden of School of Pharmacy in Jan. 2013, and was identified (by Mr. Kamali-nejad) in Pharmacognosy Lab. in School of Pharmacy, 2% solution was prepared by sesame oil (Saman Co. Iran). Patients&#x02019; age was in the range of 18-65. Characteristic subjects of patients under investigation included: full consciousness and being aware of time and place, extubated and having spontaneous breathing, no addiction to opioids or strong analgesics, not receiving analgesics within 2 hours before intervention, not having asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary and other lung diseases, contact dermatitis to aromatic substances. Also, some exclusion criteria were set in this research. The patients that needed medical intervention during the inhalation, or in case of allergies, respiratory problems and emergencies, were excluded from this research.</p><p>Gradual sampling was used in this study. A two-part questionnaire was used in this study for the data collection. The first part included demographic characteristics subjects under investigation (age, gender, income, education, marital status, place of residence, <italic>etc</italic>.) and the second part was a visual analogue scale to determine the pain intensity on a 10 cm ruler including 10 numbers begin form 0 indicates "no pain" and ends in 10 that indicates "most severe pain".</p><p> All patients who consented to the study received a lavender oil patch test, preoperatively. One drop of lavender oil was dropped to their ankle. In order to reduce inhalation and skin absorption of the lavender, the test patch was immediately covered with an occlusive dressing and removed after a two-minute exposure. Then, the researcher was present in the cardiac ICU in the day of surgery. After extubation, the patients were asked to intensity of their pain using the visual analogue scale. Then a cotton swab which was impregnated with 2 drops of lavender 2% was placed in their face oxygen mask, and they breathed that for 10 minutes. 30 minutes after, the researcher asked their pain intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Il, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The level of patient&#x02019;s pain before and after aromatherapy were analyzed by paired t-tests and Chi-square and Fishers&#x02019; exact is used to investigate the relationship between demographic characteristics and pain. Statistical significance was accepted for P &#x0003c; 0.05. </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Follow-up of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijpr-13-1257-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic data from participants showed that 57.5% of samples were males, majority of samples (47.5%) were 50 to 59 years and average age was 50 years old (SD=15.16). 37.5% of patients had hypertension, 30% had hyperlipidemia disease and 20% had diabetes. 57.5% had an experience of previous surgery and only 10 % had an experience of aromatherapy.
