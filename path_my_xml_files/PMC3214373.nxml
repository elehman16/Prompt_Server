By spinal anesthesia, LBP and RLP diminish up to 2 to 3 hours postoperatively. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of impregnated epidural adipose tissue (EAT) with bupivacaine or methylprednisolone acetate on reduction of late postoperative pain after spinal anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>This study was performed on lumbar disc herniation surgery under spinal anesthesia. Sixty six patients entered our study who were divided into three groups, EAT impregnated with bupivacaine (group 1), methylprednisolone acetate (group2) and normal saline (control group). The LBP and RLP were evaluated during the first 24 hours postoperatively and 14 days later by visual analogue scale (VAS).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Of 66 patients, 53% were female and 47% male. The average (SE) LBP in the first 6 hours after surgery based on VAS were 1.59 &#x000b1; 0.90 in group one, 2.36 &#x000b1; 2.38 in group 2 and 3.09 &#x000b1; 1.41 in control group but the VAS for RLP in this period were 1.95 &#x000b1; 1.13, 1.31 &#x000b1; 1.39 and 2.40 &#x000b1; 1.09, respectively.

All 66 patients were randomly divided into three groups according to their sequences of operating room adminestration.

After the full appearance of analgesic effects of drugs and when the patients did not have any pain below the level of surgical intervention, they were transferred to prone position on operating table. While the patients were entirely conscious, a laminectomy was performed. All of the patients were operated by one neurosurgeon with the same technique that was completely aware of the content of harvest adipose tissue but the assistant of neurosurgery who was responsible of follow up and analysis of the data was completely blind to the contents of fat graft. At the end of surgery, one of the assistants who was completely blind to the content of adipose tissue, placed a small autologous fat (1 &#x000d7; 1 &#x000d7; 1 cm) harvested from subcutaneous tissue and impregnated with either bupivacaine (1 cc, 0.5%), steroid (40 mg methylprednisolone acetate) or normal saline (1 cc) at the interested site of operation. The grafts were implanted at the epidural space in contact with thecal sac.</p><p>At the end of surgery the patients were transferred to the ward and were evaluated in terms of pain intensity based on VAS by assistant of neurosurgery who had no information about which drug has been used for each patient. VAS scores were evaluated 3 times every 6 hours at the first day before discharge and 14 days later when the patients came back for follow-up.</p><p>All of the patients with thecal sac injury at the time of surgery were excluded from the study because this may increase the risk of pain, CSF leakages, infection, and washout phenomenon of intrathecal injection of anesthetic drug. Also, those patients that were not cooperative and/or willing to take part in our study were excluded.</p><p>The data were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA (SPSS version 18) to compare relative frequency of VAS.

Although surgical treatment is technically simple and professionally gratifying for the neurosurgeons, still many patients who need surgical intervention have intense irrational fear from post-operation pain. As a consequence, LDH can generate distrust of neurosurgeons on the part of patients and vice versa.</p><p>To overcome postoperation pain, different techniques have been presented.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Local corticosteroids and analgesic drugs have been used to ameliorate the severity of pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> with different results and complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> When these drugs are used with fat, it seems that the duration of their efficacy could be longer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> although some data have shown that EAT may induce some complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></p><p>Most of the neurosurgeons prefer general anesthesia instead of spinal anesthesia for LDH surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Others have their excellent experiences on lumbar anesthesia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Meanwhile, the duration of painless interval is approximately 2 to 3 hours, then most of the patients suffer from severe LBP and RLP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>After spinal anesthesia, LBP and RLP begin in about 2 to 3 hours post-operatively when anesthetic effect of Marcaine fate away.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> During general anesthesia, the use of impregnated fat with bupivacaine and steroid could diminish pain as a consequence of manipulation of sensitive structures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> In our study, we decided to apply bupivacaine and steroid to decrease postoperative pain after spinal anesthesia. According to our experiences at 6 and 12 hours postoperatively, the average VAS for LBP was 1.59 (&#x000b1; 0.90) and 1.50 (&#x000b1; 91), respectively for bupivacaine and 2.36 &#x000b1; 2.38 to 2.04 &#x000b1; 2.01, respectively for methylprednisolone. The 6 and 12 hours postoperative average VAS for RLP were 1.95 &#x000b1; 1.13 and 1.63 &#x000b1; 1.21, respectively for bupivacaine and 1.31 &#x000b1; 1.39 and 1.13 &#x000b1; 1.39, respectively for methylprednisolone; so EAT with bupivacaine was effective on LBP and methylprednisolone was more effective on RLP, but after 24 hours of operation, none of them were effective on pain relief.</p><p>Two weeks after operation the statistic results were not different among three groups; the average VAS for LBP was 0.22 &#x000b1; 0.52 for bupivacaine and 0.45 &#x000b1; 0.67 for methylprednisolone. On the other hand, these findings for RLP were 0.27 (&#x000b1; 0.63) for bupivacaine and 0.22 &#x000b1; 0.52 for methylprednisolone. Fortunately, after this period the average VAS of all three groups was between 0.22 to 0.54 for LBP and 0.22 to 0.27 for RLP, so that most of the patients even didn&#x02019;t need any more pain killer medication. The main point that was absolutely different in our study in relation to other studies was that we tried to control the pain post-operatively by spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia, so the whole painless period could be increased up to a few hours which is not possible in general anesthesia.</p><p>On the other hand, the mean period that most patients suffer from severe pain after operation is during the first 24 hours of intervention, therefore the application of the combination of methylprednisolone and bupivacaine could diminish the severity of pain.</p><p>Consequently, by combination of spinal anesthesia and EAT impregnated with either bupivacaine and/or methylprednisolone, it is possible to diminish the post-operation pain free interval.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>After spinal anesthesia, the painless period is approximately 2 to 3 hours and then LBP and RLP appear. The use of EAT may have a protective effect on late adhesive irritating scar tissue and when impregnated with bupivacaine or methylprednisolone acetate could increase the duration of painless interval. According to our data bupivacaine, was effective on LBP relief and steroid was effective on RLP relief during the first 12 hours after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>SA and ARR participated in the design and conduct of the study, drafted and edited the manuscript; MS, SM, NE, GB, PR, and HT participated in the design and conduct of the study; AH, and MT helped to draft and edit the manuscript.
