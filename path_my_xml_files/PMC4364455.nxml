Symptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) may be managed with drainage procedures and/or pleurodesis, but currently available treatment strategies do not target the underlying problem of excessive pleural fluid production. Additionally, patients may be too frail to undergo tumour specific chemotherapy and hence treatment is often supportive.</p><p>Zoledronic Acid (ZA) is an intravenous aminobisphosphonate, which is currently licensed for prevention of skeletal related events in adults with advanced cancer involving bone and treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia. It has well documented anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These properties are appealing in malignant pleural disease as they would target both the underlying tumour and the uncontrolled production of pleural fluid. Exploratory in vivo and in vitro animal studies evaluating ZA in malignant pleural disease have also shown encouraging results [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Along with its favourable safety profile, allowing ZA to be used in patients otherwise unfit for chemotherapy, this makes it an attractive potential treatment for patients with malignant pleural disease.</p><p>The aim of this study was to generate pilot clinical data regarding the efficacy of ZA in malignant pleural disease in order to inform a future, suitably powered randomised controlled trial should the results show promise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0118569.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Trial Design</title><p>The Bristol Randomised Trial of Zoledronic Acid in Malignant Pleural Disease (Pilot Study) was a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial. Ethical and regulatory approval for the study was obtained from the South West Research Ethics Committee (REC 09/H0206/12) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA EudraCT 2009-009134-32) before recruitment commenced. After written informed consent, patients were randomised to receive 2 doses of intravenous ZA or placebo 3 weeks apart.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants Enrolled</title><p>Adults with malignant pleural thickening (with or without pleural effusion) were enrolled into the study. The diagnosis of malignant pleural disease required positive pleural fluid cytology and/or pleural biopsy, or a clinically confident diagnosis of MPE in the context of proven cancer elsewhere.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: Pleurodesis in the preceding 30 days; iv bisphosphonates administered within the past 3 months; ongoing dental disease; significant renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &#x0003c;40ml/min); hypocalcaemia; inability to give informed consent; pregnancy or lactation; known allergy to bisphosphonates or its excipients; life expectancy &#x0003c;4 months; current or planned chemotherapy; hormone manipulation therapy initiated in the month prior to trial entry; age &#x0003c;18 years; haematological malignancy; severe visual impairment.</p><p>Minor alterations made to the eligibility criteria during the recruitment period are detailed in the online <xref rid="pone.0118569.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><p>Patients were identified from the pleural and oncology clinics and the lung cancer multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting at North Bristol NHS Trust. Eligible patients were provided with a patient information sheet (see online <xref rid="pone.0118569.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>: Patient information sheet) and written consent was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients were randomised 1:1 to either ZA or placebo using minimisation. A random element was used, so that patients were assigned to the treatment arm which minimised the imbalance with a 95% probability. The minimisation factors were: the presence or absence of trapped lung; tumour type (mesothelioma/ other); and the presence or absence of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). Randomisation was performed using a centralised online randomisation service (Sealed Envelope, London, UK).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Blinding</title><p>Patients, clinicians and trial investigators were blind to treatment allocation.

After written consent (see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>: Consent form), patients had a 2 week run-in period to confirm study eligibility and undergo baseline assessments. All patients underwent a dental check and any necessary dental treatment during the run-in period to minimise the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (as per the guidance in the summary of product characteristics for Zoledronic Acid).</p><p>The dose of ZA was calculated according to their estimated CrCl (CrCl &#x02265;60ml/min: 4mg ZA; CrCl &#x02265;50-&#x0003c;60ml/min: 3.5mg ZA; CrCl &#x02265;40-&#x0003c;50ml/min: 3.3mg ZA) and provided by the pharmacy in 100ml 0.9% sodium chloride. The placebo was 100ml 0.9% sodium chloride. A second dose of Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) was administered 3 weeks later.</p><p>All participants received other treatments during trial follow up in accordance with standard care guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Trial Assessments</title><p>Patients were followed for 6 weeks after randomisation. Patients completed a daily Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score assessing breathlessness for a week prior to randomisation until the end of trial follow-up. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) QOL questionnaire, Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score and thoracic ultrasound (USS) were completed at randomisation, week 3 and week 6. A CT and MRI thorax were performed in the week prior to randomisation and during week 5 (see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0118569.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>: SOP for DCE MRI analysis for scan protocols). Patients with an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) underwent twice weekly drainages and fluid was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for future analysis (see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>). Blood tests were performed on a weekly basis for monitoring purposes and samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for future analysis (see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Trial Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoints were: (1) Change from baseline to week 5 in the &#x02018;initial area under the curve measurement for the first 90 seconds&#x02019; (iAUC) of the DCE-MRI scan and (2) The summary score for the dyspnoea VAS score from randomisation to week 6 post-randomisation.</p><p>The main objective of this pilot trial was to assess potential efficacy of ZA in this patient group to inform a future, suitably powered RCT. Therefore numerous secondary clinical and feasibility outcomes were evaluated over the 6 week trial follow up (see <xref rid="pone.0118569.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 file</xref>: Statistical analysis plan for full details). This included changes from baseline to week 5 in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI-MRI) parameters; modified response evaluation in solid tumours (RECIST) scores; CT measured pleural thickening and effusion volumes. Also, changes in USS effusion depths; quality of life and symptom control (using the EORTC QLQ-C30, ESAS score and Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale) and blood parameters (serum mesothelin, plasma VEGF-A, plasma IL-6, MCP-1, serum neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)) recorded at baseline, week 3 and week 6 were assessed. For patients with an IPC, weekly pleural fluid VEGF-A and MCP-1 levels and pleural fluid production were also evaluated. Pharmacokinetic analysis of ZA levels in the pleural fluid and pharmacokinetic analysis of the DCE-MRI scans was planned but was unable to be performed due to resource issues.</p><p>The CT and MRI scans were reported independently by 2 respiratory radiologists and discrepancies resolved by consensus. Further details on the reporting methods can be found in <xref rid="pone.0118569.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0118569.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 File</xref>: SOP for DCE MRI analysis.</p><p>Safety outcomes were also evaluated up to 6 weeks post-randomisation. This included the number of patients: (1) experiencing at least one known side effect of Zoledronic Acid; (2) experiencing at least one serious adverse event; and (3) requiring an increase in calcium, magnesium or phosphate replacement [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The side effects were categorized based on the participants&#x02019; case report forms and blood results prior to un-blinding of the patients&#x02019; treatment allocations.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Data was analysed on intention-to-treat principles. All randomised patients in whom an outcome was available were included in the analysis. Data collected up to the point of patient withdrawal were included. All analyses were pre-determined prior to data analysis and un-blinding. All analyses adjusted for outcome value measured at baseline (if recorded) and the minimisation factors (the presence or absence of trapped lung; tumour type (mesothelioma/ other); the presence or absence of an IPC) [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mean imputation was used to account for baseline variables with missing data [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All outcomes were analysed using a linear regression model except for the main adverse event outcomes, which were analysed using logistic regression. The linear regression models provided an adjusted mean difference (AMD) to quantify the treatment effect. The linear regression models reported treatment effect as Odds Ratios.</p><p>Outcomes which were collected at multiple time points during trial follow up (VAS scores, QOL measures, blood and pleural fluid biomarkers, pleural fluid production and USS depths) were analysed using a &#x02018;summary score&#x02019;, which was calculated by dividing the area under the curve (AUC) by the number of days that the patient remained in the study (to account for different durations of follow-up). The AUC was calculated using the trapezium rule [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Stata software version 13 (Texas, USA) was used for analyses.

We did not identify any differences in our primary outcome measures, breathlessness and DCE-MRI. However, two patients who received ZA demonstrated a &#x0003e;10% reduction in tumour bulk as assessed by modified RECIST compared to none in the placebo arm. In addition the number and type of side effects were comparable between the two study arms.</p><p>There is a paucity of effective treatments for patients with malignant pleural disease. Effusion management and chemotherapy may be the only options depending on the underlying cell type [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, as a significant proportion of patients are unsuitable for chemotherapy due to poor baseline performance score or other comorbidities, there is a requirement for less toxic treatments, which could be used in these frailer patient groups.</p><p>Aminobisophosphonates have anti-cancer activity in a number of tumour types through inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (a key element of the mevalonate pathway), resulting in impaired adhesion, migration and proliferation of cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, they have direct effects on immune cell activation and inhibit angiogenesis, both of which contribute to their anti-tumour effects. This has led to their widespread use in the treatment and prevention of skeletal related events in cancer and increasing interest in their use as an adjuvant treatment in other cancer types, particularly breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There is compelling in-vivo and in-vitro evidence to suggest ZA may have beneficial effects in malignant pleural disease. In a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma affecting the pleural cavity, ZA reduced pleural fluid accumulation and pleural tumour bulk, as well as prolonging survival and limiting cachexia. These effects were associated with reduced new vessel formation and vascular permeability, a reduction in mononuclear cells in the pleural space and a reduction in pro-inflammatory and angiogenic mediators [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>There is also in vitro evidence that ZA induces apoptosis in mesothelioma cells [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and favourably affects the host&#x02019;s immune response to the tumour [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mouse models of mesothelioma also suggest that ZA inhibits tumour growth and prolongs survival [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This has led to interest in using ZA in the treatment of malignant pleural disease. There are reports of it being used off licence in mesothelioma [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however a phase 2 study evaluating its use as an adjuvant treatment for MPE due to non-small cell lung cancer closed prematurely after 3 patients were enrolled due to poor accrual [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>CT is the current gold standard imaging modality for evaluation of the pleura and the modified RECIST criteria have been developed to stage and monitor treatment response in mesothelioma [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Unidimensional measurements from 6 areas of pleural thickening (2 sites at 3 levels) and any enlarged nodes are summed to give the modified RECIST score. The standard definition of a partial response is at least a 30% reduction in this score on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart, for all tumour types [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 2 patients in the ZA arm of this study showed a reduction in tumour volume by modified RECIST of &#x0003e;10%, although this does not meet the above criteria for a partial response.</p><p>However, these CT results should be interpreted carefully. A number of patients in the trial had small volume disease which may make consistent measurement of pleural tumour thickness more difficult [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recently published data supports our decision to measure disease &#x0003e;5mm and reporting by consensus in this trial aimed to standardise measurements and minimise bias [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Additionally, the trial scans were performed only 5 weeks apart, which is a short time interval to detect a treatment response.</p><p>DCE-MRI is a novel imaging method, which has recently shown some promise in the evaluation of malignant pleural disease [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It monitors the transit of contrast through the tissues and hence characterises the tumour&#x02019;s vascularity and vascular permeability. This makes it an attractive imaging technique in pleural malignancy, where neovascularisation is felt to be pathogenic and confers a worse prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the best technique for reporting DCE-MRI is yet to be established and given the lack of robust, validated methodology, it does not have an established role in routine clinical practice. We did not demonstrate a change in DCE-MRI in response to treatment, which may reflect the analysis methods used and/or the small number of patients with evaluable data.</p><p>In animal models, ZA reduces the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory and angiogenic mediators, including VEGF, IL-6 and MCP-1 [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an observational study in mesothelioma found falling levels of circulating VEGF to be a good prognostic factor after 8 weeks of chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, despite this and data from other cancer types also suggesting Zoledronic Acid supresses circulating VEGF levels, we failed to show any treatment effect of ZA on the blood biomarkers tested [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0118569.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We may have missed a local effect of the ZA on these inflammatory mediators given the small numbers of patients with indwelling catheters in the trial.</p><p>We did not demonstrate any benefit of ZA in terms of symptom control or quality of life compared to placebo in this study. Given the advanced nature of the malignant disease in many of the study patients and the resultant complex, multi-factorial nature of many of their symptoms, this is not entirely surprising in this small cohort. The different tools used to evaluate both overall quality of life and breathlessness all showed consistent results, suggesting that measuring these symptoms with multiple different tools may not add value.</p><p>ZA did not appear to be associated with a marked increase in side effects compared to placebo. The side effect profile of ZA is well established due to its extensive use for other indications, but it is reassuring that the treatment appeared to be well tolerated in this patient group [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>This study was designed as a proof-of-principle pilot study and hence has a number of limitations. We excluded patients receiving other cancer treatments and given the frail nature of this population, recruitment was challenging and the number of included patients is small. In view of this, we were unable to recruit as many patients with indwelling pleural catheters as initially envisaged, limiting our ability to detect a potential signal regarding pleural fluid output and pleural fluid biomarkers. The recruited patients were heterogeneous and the groups poorly balanced for a number of variables at baseline, which may have contributed to the difficulties in identifying a signal for a number of the outcome measures.</p><p>There is data from a number of cell types to suggest that the aminobisphosphonates may act synergistically with chemotherapy. A recent study evaluating the potential synergistic effect of intrapleural ZA with systemic Cisplatin chemotherapy in a mouse model of mesothelioma showed combination therapy had greater anti-tumour effects than either agent used alone [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We did not evaluate this synergy in the current study, but may be interesting to explore in future trials. We also await with interest the results of an open label trial of ZA in mesothelioma, which is currently recruiting in Birmingham, Alabama [<xref rid="pone.0118569.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the results of this small pilot study have not shown conclusive evidence of a treatment effect of Zoledronic Acid in this population. However, given the small number of patients randomised and substantial baseline imbalances between the groups, we cannot exclude a potential beneficial effect. We feel that a further pilot study in a more specific subgroup of patients is warranted to evaluate its effect further. We have learnt important lessons about the feasibility of future studies and this data will help inform trial design and power calculations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s003"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Patient Information Sheet.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s004"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Consent Form.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s005"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary material.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s006"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>SOP for DCE MRI analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118569.s007"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Statistical analysis plan.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118569.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Karen Elvers, Paul Virgo and Charmaine Donald for help with the biomarker testing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0118569.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
