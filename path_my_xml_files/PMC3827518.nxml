terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream and sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream has been done in localized tinea corporis and tinea cruris.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>This clinical trial was carried out to study and compare the efficacy of topical terbinafine hydrochloride 1% cream and sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream in localized tinea corporis and tinea cruris and to know the adverse effects of these antifungal creams.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Settings and Design:</title><p>In this prospective, single blind, randomized control trial with two arms, patient were randomized into two groups Group A (treatment with terbinafine cream) and Group B (treatment with sertaconazole cream). A total of 38 patients were enrolled for the study, 20 patients in group A and 18 patients in group B. But five patients of group A and three patients of group B were lost for follow-ups. Therefore sample size was of 30 patients with 15 patients in group A and group B each.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Patients in group A and B were treated with twice daily topical 1% terbinafine hydrochloride and 2% sertaconazole nitrate cream respectively for a total duration of three weeks. Clinical improvement in signs and symptoms of each clinical parameter, namely itching, erythema, papules, pustules, vesicles, and scaling were graded weekly and clinical cure was assessed. KOH mount and culture was done weekly up to 3 weeks to access mycological cure. Fungal culture was done on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Statistical Analysis Used:</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using students paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests from the data obtained.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Results:</title><p>Comparison between Group A and Group B for complete cure (clinical and mycological) showed that at the end of 3 weeks both terbinafine and sertaconazole groups had 100% complete cure. When the two groups were compared for complete cure, at the end of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> week, statistically non-significant results were observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.461 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.679 respectively). However, at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> week, complete cure rate for terbinafine was 80% as compared to 73.35% for sertaconazole with no statistical significance. In both Group A and Group B, clinically significant local side effects like erythema, swelling, stinging sensation, or increased itching were not noticed. A majority of our patients in both the group showed <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> followed by <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> growth on culture.

But comparative studies between these two drugs in localized tinea corporis and cruris were lacking.</p></boxed-text><p>Dermatophytoses is a superficial fungal infection of keratinized tissue, caused by keratinophilic fungi called dermatophytes. Dermatophytoses is commonly called as tinea.</p><p>Tinea corporis and tinea cruris is the dermatophytoses of glabrous skin and groin, respectively.</p><p>Many topical antifungals of different groups are available for the treatment of dermatophytoses such as azole derivatives, allylamines, benzylamines, morpholine, etc., Systemic drugs, such as terbinafine and itraconazole, are currently used for the treatment of severe and chronic dermatophytosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Topical antifungal drugs are effective in localized infections. Topical antifungal therapy based on the use of imidazoles, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole, is most commonly used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Sertaconazole is a newer topical antifungal agent which belongs to the imidazole class of antifungals. Like other azoles, sertaconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell walls resulting in disruption of mycelial growth and replication. However, at higher concentrations, sertaconazole binds directly to non-sterol lipids in the fungal cell wall, which leads to increased permeability and subsequent lysis of the mycelium. Thus, depending on concentration, sertaconazole may exhibit both fungistatic and fungicidal activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Terbinafine hydrochloride is one of the fungicidal allylamine groups of drugs with broad spectrum of antifungal activity. It interferes with fungal sterol biosynthesis at an early stage. It also inhibits squalene epoxidation, leading to intracellular accumulation of toxic squalene responsible for fungal cell death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>There is paucity of clinical studies regarding the clinical efficacy of newer antifungal like sertaconazole in treatment of tinea corporis and tinea cruris.</p><p>As per our knowledge, there is not a single study available at present comparing the clinical efficacy of topical terbinafine and sertaconazole cream in treatment of tinea corporis and tinea cruris.</p><p>With this background the present trial was carried out to study and compare the efficacy of topical terbinafine hydrochloride 1%, a fungicidal agent and sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream, a fungistatic agent in localized tinea corporis and tinea cruris and to study the adverse effects of these antifungal creams.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized control trial with two arms, to compare the clinical efficacy and side effects of topical terbinafine hydrochloride 1% and sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream in the treatment of localized (&#x0003c;20% involvement) tinea corporis and tinea cruris, was conducted in the department of Dermatology, Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, Wardha during the period from Nov 2010 to Oct 2011. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group A (treatment with terbinafine cream) and Group B (treatment with sertaconazole cream). A total of 38 patients were enrolled for the study, 20 patients in group A and 18 patients in group B. But five patients of group A and three patients of group B were lost for follow-ups. Therefore, the sample size was of 30 patients with 15 patients in group A and group B each. Patients in group A and B were treated with topical 1% terbinafine hydrochloride and 2% sertaconazole nitrate cream, respectively. The inclusion criteria included untreated patients of dermatophytosis of all age groups, involvement of less than 20% of body surface area, and patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by KOH mount. Exclusion criteria's were the patients of resolving dermatophytoses, patients already on topical and systemic antifungal treatment, involvement of more than 20% body surface area, pregnant and lactating females, and patients with immunosuppressive disease or on immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>Diagnosis was made on clinical and mycological (KOH and culture) grounds. All the patients had similar demographic features with regards to age (ranged in age between 16 and 35 years in both the groups), sex (Group A: male = 11 and female = 4, Group B: male = 12 and female = 3) and duration of disease (6 months to one year in both the groups). To ensure regular follow up of patients, they were provided with topical medications weekly by us for 3 weeks. Patients were advised to apply the cream twice daily on affected sites. They were recalled at the end of every week to note the efficacy and any adverse effects like local erythema, swelling, stinging sensation, or increased itching, for a total duration of 3 weeks. The patients were graded for improvement in signs and symptoms of each clinical parameter, namely itching, erythema, papules, pustules, vesicles and scaling, and overall improvement was graded as Grade I (25% improvement), Grade II (50% improvement), Grade III (75% improvement), and Grade IV (100% improvement). KOH mount and culture was done weekly up to 3 weeks to access mycological cure. Fungal culture was done on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with chloramphenicol and cycloheximide.</p><p>It was possible to get sufficient scales at baseline and at the end of 1 week of treatment for mycological assessment but due to good treatment response there were hardly any scales to perform the mycological assessment at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> weeks. We performed the mycological assessment with whatever scales available at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> week.</p><p>Mycological cure was defined as negative KOH and culture.
