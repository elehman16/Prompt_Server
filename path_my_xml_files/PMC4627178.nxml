NASH is most commonly associated with underlying insulin resistance and thus is frequently present in patients who are overweight or obese, or who have type 2 diabetes mellitus.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] At present there is a worldwide epidemic of diabetes and obesity. Obesity is the most common risk factor for NASH and in the obese population, the median prevalence of NASH is 33%, ranging from 10% to 56%.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Increasing in the numbers of NASH, indicated that, in both rich and poor countries, it will become an increasingly common liver problem, affecting public health and health-care costs globally and raising the global burden of liver disease.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Demand for medical therapy is rising after the increasing prevalence of NASH.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Reduce the histologic features and improve insulin resistance and liver enzyme levels are the goals of treatment for NASH. And no pharmacological therapy has been proven effective in long-term use.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thiazolidinediones and metformin are the most widely studied pharmacological therapy but the results are inconsistent and in practice, weight gain and bone loss are the most challenging side-effect of thiazolidinediones therapy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Therefore, the management of NASH focuses on associated conditions in the absence of a treatment that would represent a standard of care. Currently, both exercise and healthy weight loss, either separately or in combination therapy are recommended by the American Gastroenterology Association as interventions for NASH.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This current standard of care is difficult for many patients to achieve. Bariatric surgery as another option for weight loss, offers durable weight loss and histological improvement, but is associated with significant morbidity. In general, all drugs that induce weight loss might be beneficial against NASH.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Herbal medicines are gaining increasing popularity and recognition in the management of hyperlipidemia and obesity because of their multiple modes of action and their minimal side-effects. There are some reports on of the utility of herbal medicines in NASH.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Cumin (cuminum cyminum) is one of the most commonly used spice condiment in food preparations in Asia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Iran is one of the major lands in the world known for the production of cumin. All the cumin varieties are used in traditional and veterinary medicine. In Iranian traditional medicine, cumin is considered stimulant, carminative and astringent and its therapeutic effects have been described on gastrointestinal, gynecological and respiratory disorders. For centuries, cumin has been used to reduce appetite.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Also, cumin was reported to reduce raised blood sugar, improve glucose utilization, and promote digestion by stimulating gastrointestinal mucosa and pancreatic digestive enzymes.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>As highlighted above, there is no approved therapy for NASH, and data on treatment options for NASH are limited with different findings. Also, to the best of our knowledge, the cumin powder has not yet been undertaken in patients with NASH. So, the present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cumin powder in the treatment of NASH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double blind, randomised, controlled trial was conducted between October 2013 and March 2014, on 100 patients with NASH who referred to Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, after that the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the study. The diagnosis of NASH was based on both clinical and pathological findings in the liver and appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary obstruction and metabolic liver diseases. Other eligible criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, morbid obesity (represented by a body mass index [BMI] 30&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and HbA1c level &#x02264;7 in presence of diabetes. Exclusion criteria were use of drugs known to produce fatty liver disease, weight loss more than 10% from baseline in the previous 6 months (based on self-reported by studied patients), evidence of viral or autoimmune hepatitis, increase in the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 3 times from baseline, the level of total bilirubin more than 3 mg/dL, primary biliary cirrhosis, biliary obstruction, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis and decompensated cirrhosis, and allergy to cumin.</p><p>Eligible patients after given written informed consent were randomly divided into two 50-member groups using random-maker software &#x0201c;random allocation.&#x0201d; Case group included 50 patients who received oral cumin capsule (Barij Esance Co., Iran, contain 25 mg saponin) thrice before main meals daily for 6 months. Control group included 50 patients who received placebo (formally, manufactured as the same as cumin capsule, in Isfahan University, Faculty of Pharmacy) thrice daily for 3 months. Patients in both groups were suggested to have same diet and exercise regimen.</p><p>Clinical and laboratory data were collected after randomization and 6 months treatment period. Collected data included age, BMI, serum triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, ALT, AST, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), fasting blood sugar (FBS), steatosis grade, and side-effects. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms/(height in meters<sup>2</sup>). Laboratory evaluations were measured using standard clinical chemistry techniques. Serum AST and ALT level and lipid parameters were determined via an automatic biochemistry analyzer (Aerosets, Wiesbaden, Germany) using commercially available assay kits. The grade of steatosis was assessed by liver sonography based on the following scale of 1&#x02013;3: (1) Mild (affecting 10&#x02013;29% of hepatocytes); (2) moderate (affecting 30&#x02013;69% of hepatocytes); and (3) severe (affecting &#x0003e;70% of hepatocytes).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>To maintain blinding, patients, personnel, and outcome assessors were unaware of the treatment allocation. The sealed white envelope containing patient allocation and treatment capsule were given to a previously trained nurse who was not involved in the study.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using the comparison of means formula with two-sided log-rank test, &#x003b1; =0.05, and 80% power. All statistical analyses were done using SPSS software for windows, version 20 (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive data are reported as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) or number (%) as appropriate. To comparing all studied variables between groups Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test for quantitative data and Chi-square test for qualitative data were used.

Therefore, effective drug therapy for NASH would be very useful.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>In the present study cumin as a therapeutic plant in traditional medicine was used in the treatment of NASH in compare to placebo, and our results showed that 6 months treatment with cumin capsule was not significantly different from placebo effect. BMI and liver enzymes were decreased in patients after use of cumin capsule more than placebo group but were not statistically significant. In our study only the mean of decreased value in AST and HDL in case group were significantly higher than decreased value in control group. Also, during study period no serious side-effects were noted in all patients in both case and control groups. In addition to the anti-overweight effects of cumin our results did not show significant effect of cumin on BMI compare to placebo. This can be explain by duration and doses of treatment regimen and probable differences in diet regimen and lifestyle however all patients suggested to have same diet and exercise regimen. To the best of our knowledge, the cumin has not yet been undertaken in patients with NASH, so further prospective studies with a longer treatment period and follow-up duration and larger cohort of patients are warranted to determine the effects of cumin in patients with NASH.</p><p>There is no strong evidence supporting any effective therapeutic agents for reducing inflammation and fibrosis or preventing the progression of NASH.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Thiazolidinediones are the most widely studied pharmacological therapy, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, randomized trials of people with NASH receiving thiazolidinediones, compared with placebo or other treatments were reviewed and showed improvement in fibrosis and steatosis with some controversy in trials results. Authors in this study suggested that thiazolidinediones may confer modest histological improvement in people with NASH but at the cost of significant weight gain and other adverse events. And also, they offered future randomized trials to more comprehensively inform clinical care.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine for NASH using Yinchenhao Decoction (a Chinese herbal compound preparation) in animal model is evaluated by Shao-dong <italic>et al</italic>. In this study the effects of Yinchenhao Decoction on 18 male SD rats was assessed and results show a good therapeutic effects of Yinchenhao Decoction, protecting the liver function and reducing the fatty deposition in liver.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Other animal model studies show the effect of some traditional medicines such as coffee, curcumin, and green tea in the management an experimental model of NASH.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Also, some limited studies reported effect of some traditional medicines on patients with NASH.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Another finding of this study was that treatment with cumin in patients with NAFLD was safe and well tolerated and patient compliance with medication was good in all patients completed the study. Cumin has a variety of health-promoting actions and low toxicity, warranting their consideration as potential therapeutic agents. Given the associations between obesity and metabolic syndrome, black cumin should be considered as a complementary treatment.</p><p>One of the limitations of our study was that diet regimen and lifestyle in studied patients did not assesse and we were not able to compare and evaluate the effect of these variables. Other limitation was the number of excluded patients in studied groups whereas 19 were losing during follow-up and data of these patients did not collected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The findings of this study show that there were no significant differences between cumin and placebo in the treatment of NASH but suggest that cumin may confer modest histological improvement in people with NASH with tolerable side-effects. But NASH, as this silent fast developing debilitating disorder needs serious and immediate attention, especially in the context of modern life style.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and
