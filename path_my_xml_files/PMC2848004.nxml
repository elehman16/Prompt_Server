This 12-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>(mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) and after Day 1, and the percentage of COPD days with poor control (i.e., worsening symptoms). Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), mean serum potassium and blood glucose, QTc (Fridericia), and vital signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were randomised (n = 416, mean age 63 years) to receive either indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g o.d. (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205) via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler; 87.5% completed the study. Trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>(LSM &#x000b1; SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 &#x000b1; 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 &#x000b1; 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 &#x000b1; 24 mL (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV<sub>1 </sub>than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM &#x000b1; SEM) of 190 &#x000b1; 28 (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and 160 &#x000b1; 28 mL (p &#x0003c; 0.001), respectively. Standardised AUC measurements for FEV<sub>1 </sub>(between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.001), with LSM (&#x000b1; SEM) differences of 170 &#x000b1; 24, 180 &#x000b1; 24, and 170 &#x000b1; 24 mL, respectively. Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%), with the most common AEs being COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). One patient died in the placebo group. Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no patient had QTc &#x0003e;500 ms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g o.d. provided clinically significant and sustained bronchodilation, reduced rescue medication use, and had a safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NCT00624286</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Current international clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as those from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], recommend inhaled bronchodilators, including <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonists and anticholinergics, for the symptomatic management of COPD, with regular use of long-acting bronchodilators having been shown to be more effective and convenient than treatment with short-acting bronchodilators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Currently available inhaled long-acting <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs), such as salmeterol and formoterol, provide bronchodilation for approximately 12 h at recommended doses and hence are administered twice daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In chronic diseases such as COPD, compliance to treatment could be improved if the treatment regimens were simplified by reducing dosing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Indacaterol is a novel, once-daily (o.d.), inhaled LABA for the treatment of COPD.

The study comprised a pre-screening period, a 2-week screening/run-in period, and a 12-week double-blind treatment period. During the pre-screening visit, patients' ongoing COPD medications were reviewed, and if required, patients were switched from medications prohibited in this study to an allowed COPD therapy (see the Study treatment section). This pre-screening period was followed by a 14-day run-in period (Visits 1 and 2; Day - 14 to Day 1), during which the eligibility of patients for the study was assessed and baseline patient diary data were collected.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and local applicable laws and regulations. Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee of each participating study centre. All patients provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Male and female adults (aged &#x02265;40 years) with a clinical diagnosis of COPD (GOLD 2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a smoking history of at least 20 pack years were recruited. At Visit 1, patients had to demonstrate a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of &#x0003c;80% but &#x02265;30% of the predicted normal value and FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) of &#x0003c;70% within 30 min of inhalation of 400 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g of salbutamol.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had any recent respiratory tract infection, were hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation (6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the run-in period), had a history of asthma (indicated by, but not limited to, blood eosinophil count &#x0003e;400/mm<sup>3 </sup>or onset of respiratory symptoms prior to age 40 years) or any significant pulmonary disease or cardiovascular abnormality. The following medications were prohibited prior to Visit 1 for at least the minimum washout period (duration is specified within parenthesis) or at any time during the study: long-acting anticholinergic agents (7 days), short-acting anticholinergics (8 h), fixed-dose combination (FDC) of a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (48 h), FDC of a short-acting <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonist and a short-acting anticholinergic (8 h), other LABAs (48 h), short-acting <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonists (other than those prescribed in the study) (6 h), xanthine derivatives (1 week), and parenteral or oral corticosteroids (1 month). Patients were also excluded if they were taking nonselective beta-blocking agents, non-potassium sparing diuretics, or certain cardiac antiarrhythmics. Patients on FDCs of a <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonist and an ICS were to be switched to the equivalent ICS prior to the run-in period, with the dose and dosage regimen to remain unchanged for the duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatment</title><sec><title>Randomisation to treatment groups</title><p>Following the screening/run-in period, eligible patients were randomised using validated systems (Visit 3) to receive double-blind indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g o.d. or matching placebo through a single-dose dry-powder inhaler (SDDPI) for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by smoking status so that the balance was the same in the two treatment groups. Patients were instructed to inhale study medication in the morning (between 08.00 and 11.00 a.m.).</p></sec><sec><title>Permitted medications</title><p>Salbutamol was permitted as a rescue medication throughout the study; however, patients were to refrain from using it within 6 h prior to the study visits.

All the study drugs were identical in appearance, packaging, labelling, and administration schedule.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><p>Spirometry measurements were obtained at screening/run-in visits to assess patient eligibility (Day - 14). During the double-blind treatment period, patients' visits to the clinics were scheduled on Days 1, 2, 29, 57, 84, and 85. On Days 1, 29, 57, and 84, FEV<sub>1 </sub>was assessed at 50 and 15 min pre-dose and 5 and 30 min after dose administration in the clinics. On Days 1 and 84, besides the above-mentioned time points, FEV<sub>1 </sub>was also assessed at 1, 2, and 4 h post-dose. Trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>(at 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min after the previous day's dose) was measured on Days 2 and 85. Spirometry equipment calibration and spirometric testing were performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Patients were given a diary to record morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF; highest of three consecutive efforts), daily clinical symptoms, rescue salbutamol use, any change in concomitant medications, and adverse events (AEs). Diaries were to be completed at the same time in the morning (before taking study drug) and in the evening (approximately 12 h later). Safety assessments included recording of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) and monitoring of haematology and blood chemistry (including serum potassium and blood glucose), vital signs, and electrocardiograms including QTc interval (Fridericia's correction). A COPD exacerbation was defined as a new onset or worsening of more than one respiratory symptom (i.e., dyspnoea, cough, sputum purulence or volume, or wheeze) present for more than 3 consecutive days plus either a documented change or increase in COPD-related treatment due to worsening symptoms (e.g., steroids/antibiotics/oxygen), or documented COPD-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits.</p><sec><title>Variables assessed</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>after 12 weeks of treatment (average of the 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose values assessed on the morning of Day 85). The secondary efficacy variables included trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>after one dose (assessed pre-dose on Day 2) and after 29 days, individual time point FEV<sub>1 </sub>on Day 1 and at Week 12 (change from baseline), peak FEV<sub>1 </sub>on Day 1 and at Week 12 (assessed between 5 min and 4 h post-dose), and standardised area under the curve (AUC) for FEV<sub>1 </sub>between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 h and 4 h at Week 12.</p><p>Other efficacy outcomes were based on data recorded on patients' diaries. These included use of rescue medication, PEF, and the number of 'days of poor control', defined as any day in the patient diary in which a score &#x02265;2 (i.e., moderate or severe symptoms) was recorded for at least two out of five symptoms (cough, wheeze, production of sputum, colour of sputum, and breathlessness). This instrument has not been validated, although it was used previously in the Foradil registration programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size and statistical analyses</title><p>A difference of 120 mL in trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>between indacaterol and placebo was pre-specified as the minimal clinically important difference for this population. A standard deviation of 270 mL was assumed for trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, based on the results from previous formoterol studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It was calculated that, allowing for a potential imbalance between treatment groups, a sample size of 232 evaluable patients would be needed to test for the minimal clinically important difference of 120 mL between indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g and placebo at the (two-sided) 5% significance level with 90% power. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 20%, it was estimated that a minimum of 290 patients were needed to provide 90% power for the primary endpoint.</p><p>All efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all patients who were randomised to receive treatment. All safety analyses were performed on the safety population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication.</p><p>A mixed model was used to analyse the primary variable (imputed with last observation carried forward) with treatment as a fixed effect and the baseline FEV<sub>1 </sub>and FEV<sub>1 </sub>reversibility components as covariates. The model also included smoking status (current/ex-smoker) and country as fixed effects, with centre nested within country as a random effect. The least squares means (LSM), i.e., means adjusted for the covariates in the model, of the treatment contrast for indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g versus placebo was estimated along with the associated 95% confidence interval and two-sided p-value, and superiority of indacaterol over placebo was demonstrated only if the p-value was less than the pre-specified 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This study was conducted at 103 centres in 3 countries (US, New Zealand and Belgium). A total of 788 patients were screened, with 416 randomised to either indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205). Overall, 364 patients (87.5%) completed the study, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Significant bronchodilation was observed following administration of the first dose of indacaterol, with efficacy sustained over the full 12-week treatment period. Trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>after 12 weeks of treatment (the primary endpoint) exceeded the placebo value by more than 120 mL (the pre-specified minimum clinically important difference). This value of 120 mL is higher than the 100 mL described by Donohue as a difference that patients can perceive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and is the midpoint of the 100-140 mL range proposed recently as a minimal clinically important difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A statistically superior improvement in FEV<sub>1 </sub>for indacaterol versus placebo was also observed at all individual post-baseline time points on Day 1 and Week 12, with improvements versus placebo for FEV<sub>1 </sub>AUCs between 5 min and 1 h, 5 min and 4 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose. These results demonstrate a sustained 24-h duration of action of indacaterol on o.d. dosing. This persistence of treatment effect has also been observed in other published indacaterol studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], including a double-blind crossover study in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, in which a single dose of indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g provided comparable 24-h trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>to twice-daily formoterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although a sustained 24-h effect is advantageous in the treatment of COPD patients, it is important that this is not accompanied by a loss in efficacy on chronic dosing (or tolerance). <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor downregulation following chronic dosing with LABAs may result in the development of tolerance to the bronchodilatory effects of LABAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and previous studies have shown the diminution in efficacy over time in other bronchodilators, including salmeterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The results of our study demonstrate that there was no loss in efficacy over the 12 weeks of treatment, with indacaterol-placebo differences maintained from Day 29 (the first trough assessment after indacaterol is known to have reached steady-state) to Week 12 in terms of trough FEV<sub>1</sub>. These data are consistent with other previously published studies with indacaterol, in which there was no loss in efficacy on daily dosing for up to a year. For example, in a 1-year study, the trough FEV<sub>1 </sub>for indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g was 160 mL higher than placebo after 12 weeks of dosing, compared with 170 mL after a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, serial measurements of FEV<sub>1 </sub>on Day 1 also showed that indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g o.d. provided statistically significant (compared to placebo) and clinically relevant bronchodilation at 5 min post-dose, the earliest post-dose assessment time point in this study, and is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The o.d. dosing regimen of indacaterol, combined with clinically relevant bronchodilation at 5 min post-dose may contribute to improved adherence to the prescribed dose regimen in the 'real world' setting&#x02014;an important consideration, because adherence to COPD medication in clinical practice are reported to be between 10 and 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Alongside the improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub>, indacaterol also provided improvements compared with placebo in terms of a range of data captured by patients in their daily diaries, including significant improvements from baseline in morning and evening PEF, and reductions in the requirement for rescue medication. The frequency of use of rescue medication for symptomatic relief provides an indication of the degree of patient impairment. It is, therefore, of note that the use of indacaterol was associated with an overall reduction in rescue medication use, with improvements observed both in daytime and night-time over a 24-h dosing interval.</p><p>Indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g o.d. was well tolerated, with a high level of treatment compliance and a low drop-out rate. The overall incidence of AEs was comparable between indacaterol and placebo, and AEs were mostly mild and transient, with the majority being typical of this patient population. The most frequently reported AEs were COPD worsening and cough, the incidences of which were lower in the indacaterol group than placebo. The presence of cough following soon after inhalation was not associated with any increase in study discontinuation rates, and there was no suggestion of a relationship between these cough events and cough reported as an AE. The class-related side effects of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub>2</sub>-agonists (e.g., hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, or prolonged QTc interval) were low in overall incidence in this study. No patient had a clinically notable low potassium value (i.e. &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L), while clinically notable hyperglycaemia (&#x0003e;9.99 mmol/L) occurred in fewer patients in the indacaterol group than in the placebo group. No patient in either group had an absolute QTc interval (Fridericia's) of greater than 500 ms, and none had an increase in QTc from baseline of more than 60 ms. Cardiac safety is of particular concern in COPD patients considering the fact that cardiovascular comorbidity is common in these patients; therefore, the absence of detrimental cardiovascular incidents in this study, together with results from earlier shorter-duration studies, suggest that the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects with indacaterol 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].
