The wide range of drugs currently available for its treatment could be associated, in the long term, with organ toxicity and adverse events, thus, clinical monitoring throughout treatment is required. This investigator-initiated trial (IIT) evaluated the efficacy and the safety of a vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-containing ointment in comparison with glycerol-petrolatum-based emollient cream used twice a day to treat mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis for a period over 12&#x02009;weeks followed by a wash-out observation period of 4&#x02009;weeks. This study was conducted as a randomized, controlled, single-blind, intra-patient left- to right-side trial comparing the efficacy and safety of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-containing ointment (M-treatment) with a glycerol-petrolatum-based emollient cream (C-treatment). The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) was determined at baseline (T0), at time points T2 (14&#x02009;days), T4 (4&#x02009;weeks), T8 (8&#x02009;weeks), T12 (12&#x02009;weeks) and 4&#x02009;weeks after the end of the wash-out period (F1). In total, 24 patients with plaque psoriasis were randomized to receive left- or right-side treatment with B<sub>12</sub> ointment. From time point T2 to time point F1, there was a statistically significant difference in PASI reduction between M-treatment side and C-treatment side. At time point T 12, the difference between the mean reductions from baseline PASI scores by 5.92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.49 (87, 6%) in the M-treatment side versus 1.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.02 (23, 1%) C-treatment side was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic><sub>Wex</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). On the contemporary panorama in the treatment of psoriasis, we conclude that vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ointment will represent a new concrete therapy option and should be considered in the update of therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of psoriasis</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hydration</kwd><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>vitamin B<sub>12</sub></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-0394632017736674"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proinflammatory cytokines involved in psoriasis stimulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in keratinocytes and other cell types.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0394632017736674" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> High levels of iNOS have been detected in psoriatic lesions and in skin affected by atopic dermatitis,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0394632017736674" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0394632017736674" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and are shown to be associated with a greatly increased release of nitric oxide (NO).

The comparison of M- and C-treatments over the time course of the study shows that there were statistically significant differences in PASI between the M-treatment and the C-treatment sides at all time-points from T2 to F1 (each with <italic>P</italic><sub>Wex</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The mean score of PASI on the M-treated body side decreased by 15% (mean) and 8% (median), while no score value was below 50% on the C-treatment.</p><p>Reduction of itching and high level of tolerability were achieved in the M- and C-treated body sides and a great benefit was shown in erythema, pruritus and tolerability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0394632017736674">Figure 2</xref>). No differentiation on itching as symptom and general tolerability was done within the intra-patient left- to right-side treatment area. Itching and general tolerability were measured for all patients together. Previous studies with topical emollients solely showed a slight improvement of some symptoms as pruritus and improvement on the skin barrier in psoriasis. B<sub>12</sub>-based ointment seems to reduce rapidly the PASI score having also an anti-inflammatory effect on psoriatic patients.</p><p>In this study, the PASI score to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a B<sub>12</sub>-based ointment was used. A significant improvement was observed after already 2&#x02009;weeks of treatment using vitamin B<sub>12</sub> topical applications two times a day, while only a maintenance of PASI levels was achieved in the patient treated body side with a glycerol-petrolatum-based emollient cream. All patients referred an improvement in clinical symptoms and decrease in itching; these data have been measured through pVAS. Our results confirm the already demonstrated positive effect of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0394632017736674" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0394632017736674" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> demonstrating furthermore the reduction in extension and severity of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis with the B<sub>12</sub> topical treatment. In addition to the immunomodulatory effect, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ointment reestablish the needed level on psoriatic skin, thus, patients affected from psoriatic are frequently affected by vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. In conclusion, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ointment can be considered as a valid therapeutic option to anti-inflammatory topical agents available for psoriasis treatments and can be used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. The application of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ointment can be especially considered for sensitive and problematic skin areas (i.e. popliteal area, cubital flexures and armpits). On the contemporary panorama in the treatment of psoriasis, we conclude that vitamin B<sub>12</sub> ointment will represent a new concrete therapy option and should be considered in the update of therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of psoriasis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0394632017736674"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
