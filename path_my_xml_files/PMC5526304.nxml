This paper describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (MIR) to investigate the extent to which the addition of the antidepressant mirtazapine is effective in reducing the symptoms of depression compared with placebo in patients who are still depressed after they have been treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for at least 6&#x000a0;weeks in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">MIR is a two-parallel group, multi-centre, pragmatic, placebo controlled, randomised trial with allocation at the level of the individual.

People with depression are usually managed in primary care and antidepressants are usually the first-line treatment. The number of prescriptions for antidepressants has risen dramatically in recent years; increasing by 7.2&#x000a0;% (3.8 million items) between 2013 and 2014. Indeed, antidepressants have shown a greater increase in the volume of prescribing in 2014 than drugs for any other therapeutic area, with over 57 million prescriptions being issued in England in 2014, at a cost of &#x000a3;265 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">However, the STAR*D study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) found that half of those treated did not experience at least a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in depressive symptoms following 12&#x02013;14 weeks of treatment with a single antidepressant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The reasons for this non-response are complex but include what can be termed treatment-resistant depression (TRD), where an adequate dose and duration of treatment has been taken.</p><p id="Par48">When first-line antidepressant treatments do not work, general practitioners (GPs) can be unsure what to offer next. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) now advises GPs to reconsider the treatment option if there has been no response after 4&#x02014;6&#x000a0;weeks of antidepressant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, there is currently limited evidence to guide management.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Existing evidence on the pharmacological management of treatment-resistant depression</title><p id="Par49">The current NICE guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] describes the following pharmacological strategies for sequencing treatments after inadequate response to initial treatments: switching antidepressants; augmenting medication by adding a drug which is not an antidepressant; and combining antidepressants. The guidelines comment in general on the lack of evidence and particularly that &#x02018;the evidence for the relative advantage of switching either within or between classes is weak&#x02019;. Connolly et al. comment that switching antidepressants after inadequate response is not &#x02018;unequivocally supported by the data, although switching from a selective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI) to venlafaxine or mirtazapine may &#x02026; offer greater benefits&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Similarly, there is very little evidence on combining two antidepressants.</p><p id="Par50">The evidence for the effectiveness of augmentation with a non-antidepressant is likewise of variable quality. There is some evidence for augmentation with lithium or thyroid hormone, but mainly in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, which are prescribed much less often today. The use of the atypical antipsychotic drugs to augment the newer antidepressants is better supported by research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], with quetiapine and aripiprazole the most promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, this combination has not to date been adopted with any enthusiasm in UK primary care. This may be because of a lack of experience in prescribing them for this indication since they are usually initiated in secondary care, as well as concerns about their adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (e.g. sedation, metabolic syndrome and central obesity, extrapyramidal side effects.) Indeed, the current NICE guidance is that antidepressants should not be combined or augmented without the advice of a consultant psychiatrist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">It is possible that GPs would consider adding a second antidepressant, rather than an atypical antipsychotic drug or lithium, as part of the management of TRD. They are more familiar with these drugs and their starting routines and there is less concern about their adverse effects, and less need for monitoring. In general, stepwise combination of drug treatments is a standard part of the management of chronic diseases in primary care such as asthma and hypertension and has led to improved clinical outcomes. GPs are comfortable with this model of care and would probably readily adopt this strategy if it were found to be effective. We think there may be an opportunity to substantially improve the treatment of depression in primary care by using antidepressants in combination. However, one of the reasons that this strategy has not been adopted is the lack of convincing evidence for its effectiveness, especially in the primary care setting.</p><p id="Par52">There is a pharmacological rationale for adding a second antidepressant to SSRIs or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) with a different and complementary mode of action. Mirtazapine, an alpha<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor antagonist, increases central noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission by inhibiting negative feedback from synaptic noradrenaline (NA) acting on presyaptic alpha<sub>2</sub>-autoreceptors on NAergic neurones and alpha<sub>2</sub>-heteroreceptors on 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (5-HTergic) neurones. Its mechanism of action is, therefore, different to that of both SSRIs and SNRIs which inhibit synaptic neurotransmitter reuptake after release. Thus, treatment with mirtazapine in combination with either an SSRI or SNRI may produce a sustained increase in both 5-HT and NA synaptic availability in terminal fields. A further property of mirtazapine not shared by SSRIs and SNRIs is an affinity for the 5HT-2C receptor where it acts as an inverse agonist. This mechanism has been linked to specific therapeutic effects. Overall, there is the potential for a synergistic action that could enhance clinical response compared to those patients receiving only monotherapy. Mirtazapine is now off patent and relatively inexpensive.</p><p id="Par53">Because of its different mechanism of action there is an argument that switching to mirtazapine alone after SSRI treatment failure might be an effective strategy, rather than subjecting patients to the potential adverse effect burden of a second medication. The STAR*D study compared mirtazapine to nortriptyline in a group of patients who had not responded to two consecutive antidepressant monotherapy regimes. The rates of remission were low for both drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], suggesting that switching to mirtazapine monotherapy is not the most useful strategy.</p><p id="Par54">In spite of the potential benefit of combining mirtazapine with an SSRI there is relatively little trial evidence supporting this strategy. Carpenter et al. compared the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI with placebo in a group of 26 patients who had not responded to at least 4&#x000a0;weeks of monotherapy. Although the sample size was very small, the results in terms of effectiveness and tolerability are encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but more definitive evidence is required before widespread adoption. In patients who have not failed previous treatment, Blier et al. reported that mirtazapine in combination with an SSRI gave a greater improvement than monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and that it was well-tolerated with either an SSRI or an SNRI (venlafaxine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with both combinations providing significantly higher remission rates than an SSRI alone. In contrast a larger study found no benefit from combining antidepressants, including mirtazapine and venlafaxine, over SSRI monotherapy with escitalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], though combined treatment had a higher side-effect burden.</p><p id="Par55">Mirtazapine treatment is, however, associated with more weight gain than SSRIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and, therefore, as well as assessing the efficacy of its combination with SSRIs it is important to determine its adverse effect burden, especially in long-term treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Defining treatment-resistant depression (TRD)</title><p id="Par56">Many definitions of treatment resistance have been proposed. These definitions cover a broad spectrum ranging from failure to respond to at least 4&#x000a0;weeks of antidepressant medication given at an adequate dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to more stringent criteria based on non-response to multiple courses of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">We have used a more inclusive definition of TRD; that is patients who still meet the <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> (ICD-10) criteria for depression after taking an SSRI or SNRI antidepressant at an adequate dose (based on the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> (BNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and advice from psychopharmacology experts), for a minimum of 6&#x000a0;weeks. This definition is directly relevant to UK primary care, given the uncertainty about what course of action to recommend to this group of patients.</p><p id="Par58">Although this 6-week criterion seems a relatively short period to define treatment resistance, many of the patients who satisfy this criterion of &#x02018;non-response&#x02019; are suffering from moderate to severe chronic depression. The baseline measures for a recent study of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for treatment-resistant depression in primary care, the CoBalT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], found that 59&#x000a0;% of those recruited had been depressed for more than 2&#x000a0;years; that 70&#x000a0;% had been prescribed their current antidepressant for more than 12&#x000a0;months; and that 28&#x000a0;% satisfied the ICD-10 criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for severe depression. These data on chronicity and severity illustrate the extent of the unmet need in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">At present, there is no good evidence that switching antidepressants improves outcomes. For this reason the latest NICE guideline update [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] emphasises considering alternative strategies, such as augmentation, after a single failure of antidepressants.</p><p id="Par60">It is, therefore, important to undertake a study to investigate the effectiveness of the addition of mirtazapine to SSRIs or SNRIs in primary care. In the UK, most depression is diagnosed and treated in primary care, and this is where most antidepressants are prescribed, and most treatment resistance encountered. The rise in antidepressant prescribing has continued at a steady rate in the UK despite the introduction of the government&#x02019;s initiative to Improve Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). Failure to adequately respond to treatment is a substantial problem and there is a need to develop the evidence base for the rational prescribing of antidepressants in primary care. An effective intervention has the potential to have a substantial impact on the health and economic burden associated with this patient group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par61">The trial will investigate whether combining mirtazapine with SNRI or SSRI antidepressants results in better patient outcomes and more efficient NHS care than SNRI or SSRI therapy alone in TRD.

This is plausible as we would expect intolerance of the side effects to be more important for the mirtazapine group and non-response to be more of an issue for the placebo group. If there is differential adherence in the two arms we will also investigate structural mean approaches to take account of this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] though extensions of CACE to take account of adherence to placebo have also been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par123">At 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;months, the ITT analysis will compare the randomised groups. By these stages, we would still expect many of those who had responded to mirtazapine to remain on the combination treatment. The ITT analysis will, therefore, provide an estimate of any longer-term benefit attributed to the early response to mirtazapine with an SSRI/SNRI. The interpretation of this will depend upon whether other potentially active interventions are balanced between the groups. We do not expect to see many marked imbalances in other treatments, as our previous trials (IPCRESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], CoBalT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) have not found this to be a problem. If we do find that the groups differ markedly in the two arms we will investigate any possible impact of this by adjustment for the other interventions in the regression model.</p><p id="Par124">A further sensitivity analysis using CACE methods will be used at 24&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;months. If we define &#x02018;compliers&#x02019; as those who had continued taking their trial medication up until 12&#x000a0;weeks, we could then estimate the effect of completing a 12&#x000a0;week course of mirtazapine on depression outcomes at the later follow-up points (24&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Justification of sample size</title><p id="Par125">The primary outcome is BDI-II score as a continuous variable. It is difficult to estimate a clinically important difference in BDI-II score, although the NICE guideline panel for the first depression guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggested that this corresponds to about 3 points (0.35 standard deviations) on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] for non-treatment-resistant patients, and 2 points for those who are treatment-resistant. The equivalent difference to 3 HDRS points on the BDI-II total score would be 3&#x02014;4 points (standard deviation 10&#x02014;12 in the CoBalT trial). With 200 participants in each group, we would have 91&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of 0.33 standard deviations at the 5&#x000a0;% level. Allowing for 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up at 12&#x000a0;weeks, we will need to recruit 472 patients.</p><p id="Par126">For our secondary outcome, response rate, defined as a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in symptoms using the BDI-II score, 200 patients in each group would yield 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference between 30 and 46&#x000a0;% response, or an odds ratio of 2, at a two-sided 5&#x000a0;% significance level.</p><p id="Par127">We therefore aim to recruit 120 patients from 24 general practices at each of the four recruiting centres (Bristol, Exeter, Keele and Hull).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Blinding and other forms of bias</title><p id="Par128">Participants, GPs and investigators will be blinded to treatment. The effectiveness of blinding will be assessed by a brief questionnaire asking participants to which arm they believed they had been allocated at the 12-week follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par129">The economic evaluation will assess the efficiency of mirtazapine plus SSRI or SNRI compared with SSRI or SNRI alone, for primary care patients with TRD. Resource use data will be collected from general practice records review (e.g. number of consultations, prescribed medications and referrals) and a resource use questionnaire (e.g. other community based care, outpatient and inpatient care), completed by participants at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;months. The questionnaire also collects information on employment, time off work, disability payments, informal help, and patient expenditure on healthcare. Publicly available national unit costs will be used to value prescribed medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], primary and community care consultations, social services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Patients&#x02019; time off work and informal help from family and friends will be valued using the human capital approach; we will explore the robustness of our conclusions to other methods for valuing lost productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par130">In the primary economic analysis we will estimate the incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] of combined therapy with mirtazapine at 12&#x000a0;weeks from the perspective of the NHS and social services.</p><p id="Par131">The 12-week time point is selected as clinicians and patients will be blind to treatment allocation. The iNMB estimates whether any additional costs of mirtazapine are justified by improved outcomes (Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs)) for patients at conventional thresholds used by NICE (i.e. &#x000a3;20,000 and &#x000a3;30,000 per QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. QALYs will be estimated from responses to the EQ-5D-5L controlling for baseline responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In secondary analyses we will report the iNMB over the 52-week follow-up period and the incremental cost per responder, based on BDI-II, at 12 and 52&#x000a0;weeks. For each analysis, stochastic uncertainty in results will be estimated using confidence intervals and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Other uncertainty will be addressed in deterministic sensitivity analyses; specifically, we will explore whether our conclusions are sensitive to the inclusion of patient and wider societal (i.e. lost productivity) costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Qualitative study</title><p id="Par132">A nested qualitative study will: (1) explore patients&#x02019; views and experiences of taking either two antidepressant medications or an antidepressant and a placebo; (2) identify patients&#x02019; reasons for completing or not completing the study, including withdrawal from study medication; and (3) explore the views of GPs on prescribing a second antidepressant in this patient group.</p><p id="Par133">At the baseline assessment for the main study, individuals will be informed about the qualitative study and be asked to consent to the possibility of being contacted by the qualitative research team to take part in an interview. A purposeful sampling strategy will be used to identify potential interviewees to ensure interviews are held with participants in both arms of the trial, and with individuals in both arms who vary in their levels of adherence. Maximum variation sampling techniques will be used so that patients of different socio-economic background, gender and age are invited for interview. Patients will be sampled across the four centres.</p><p id="Par134">A purposive sample of trial participants will be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview, and perspectives on taking two tablets for depression will be explored. Patients who took the trial medication for at least 12&#x000a0;weeks, and those who stopped, will be sampled. Interviews will be conducted either face to face or by telephone. The interviews will be taped with consent, transcribed, and the transcripts will form the data for analysis. It is anticipated that at least 24 interviews will be needed to achieve category saturation. Interviews will be held with patients after the primary outcome measure has been obtained (at 12&#x000a0;weeks post randomisation) to avoid the possibility of bias that might be introduced by the qualitative interview having a supportive role. Individuals will be interviewed within 8&#x000a0;weeks of their primary outcome measures being taken.</p><p id="Par135">In addition, patients who decline to participate in the trial will be asked if they would be willing to be contacted by a researcher to discuss their reasons for not taking part. Using short semi-structured telephone interviews, their views on the trial, and perspectives on taking two tablets for depression will be explored. The interviews will last 10&#x02014;30&#x000a0;minutes and will be taped with consent, transcribed, and transcripts analysed. It is anticipated that at least 15 interviews will be needed.</p><p id="Par136">Finally, a purposive sample of GPs (sampled on the basis of practice demographics and size, experience and status (partner, salaried, locum) participating in the trial will be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview which will be taped (with consent). The interviews will be conducted either face to face or by telephone. Interviews will explore perspectives and views of GPs about managing people with depression, use of antidepressants and talking treatments, alternative approaches, switching antidepressants and referral options. The role of national guidelines (particularly about prescribing) in guiding individual management of a patient with depression will be explored. The interviews with be transcribed and the transcripts forming the data for analysis. It is anticipated that between 16 and 20 interviews will be needed to achieve category saturation of the data.</p><p id="Par137">Trial participants and GPs will be interviewed at a time and place that is convenient for them (such as their home, GP surgery or by telephone). Written consent to take part in an interview will be obtained from participants and GPs at the time of face-to-face interviews, or prior to telephone interviews. These interviews will last about an hour. With participant consent, they will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p><p id="Par138">Data will be coded by two researchers independently. Thematic analysis will identify and categorise relevant and recurrent concepts within the data set, guided by the research questions of the study. Thematic analysis is guided by a priori concepts but also allows for qualitative data sets to be interrogated in an inductive manner. Themes are produced which unify the conceptual categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Both data sets will be interrogated and re-analysed against the Normalisation Process Theory framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] in order to consider how prescribing two antidepressants may, or may not, be normalised into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Quality assurance</title><p id="Par139">The trial sponsor takes primary responsibility for ensuring that the design of the study meets appropriate standards and that arrangements are in place to ensure appropriate conduct and reporting.

The University of Bristol has arranged public liability insurance to cover the legal liability of the University as Research Sponsor in the eventuality of harm to a research participant arising from overall management of the research by the University of Bristol. The other three recruiting sites (Keele, Exeter, Hull) have their own public liability insurance in place for their individual responsibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par147">At this stage of the trial, we anticipate there may be methodological weaknesses in the design, such as inadvertent unblinding due to the common adverse effects of mirtazapine. However, we will address this by asking participants which treatment arm they thought they were allocated, and including this data in the analysis.</p><p id="Par148">The trial has a number of strengths. MIR is a pragmatic primary care study, which will recruit participants from a wide range of primary care practices across the UK. It will also be the largest UK study of two combined antidepressants. We have also included a longer (12-month) follow-up period to reflect the chronicity of the condition. In addition, the qualitative study will tell us more about the acceptability of the intervention to both doctors and patients.</p><p id="Par149">It is important that large pragmatic trials of pharmacological interventions for depression have a placebo arm, since the mean placebo response in treatment trials of major depression has been found to be close to 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We have also used self-report instruments to assess outcomes in order to eliminate the potential for observer bias. Selection bias will be minimised by recruiting participants from a variety of practices based in rural, urban, affluent and deprived areas across the four centres. Exclusion criteria are minimal. These strengths will make the findings more generalisable.</p><p id="Par150">There is substantial unmet clinical need in this population. The intervention is simple, and is likely to be taken-up in primary care if found to be effective and not associated with an unacceptable level of adverse effects such as weight gain in longer-term use. The evidence from the trial will make a contribution to rational and cost-effective prescribing in this important area of patient need, where it is known that current treatments are only partly effective. We think there may be a real opportunity to substantially improve the treatment of depression by combining antidepressants with complementary modes of action. This strategy is only rarely used in primary care at present.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par151">The study began recruiting participants in August 2013 and will be ongoing until the end of September 2015. At the time of writing (August 2015), 106 GP practices have agreed to collaborate with MIR, and 431 participants have been recruited. It is anticipated that data collection will be completed in October 2016 and results will be available in May 2017.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par8">Adverse Event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASEC</term><def><p id="Par9">Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5HT</term><def><p id="Par10">5-hydroxytryptamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI</term><def><p id="Par11">Beck Depression Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BNF</term><def><p id="Par12">
