chest expansion exercises for improving respiratory function and trunk control ability in
patients with stroke. [Subjects] Forty patients with stroke were randomly allocated into a
chest resistance exercise group (CREG, n = 20) and a chest expansion exercise group (CEEG,
n = 20). [Methods] CREG patients underwent chest resistance exercises, and diaphragmatic
resistance exercises by way of the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation. CEEG
patients underwent respiratory exercises with chest expansion in various positions. Both
groups received 30 minutes of training per day, five times per week, for eight weeks.
[Results] Both the CERG and CEEG groups showed significant changes in FVC, FEV1, and TIS
after the intervention. TIS was significantly increased in the CREG compared to the CEEG
after the intervention. [Conclusion] Both chest resistance and chest expansion exercises
were effective for improving respiratory function and trunk control ability in stroke
patients; however, chest resistance exercise is more efficient for increasing trunk
control ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd><kwd>Chest exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is often accompanied by secondary complications such as nutritional and metabolic
disorders, endocrine dysfunction, mental problems, and cardiopulmonary disorders owing to
neurological system and musculoskeletal system deficits associated with brain damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these complications, pulmonary
disorders are more closely related to life and cause problems with the ability to adjust
respiration, swallowing, as well as, language<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Non-use of the paretic side muscles, and difficulty with movement,
accompanied by direct restrictive pulmonary impairments, trigger a secondary reduction in
cardiopulmonary function, and the asymmetric trunk induces inefficient energy use related to
gait, resulting in a decrease in exercise endurance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with hemiplegia caused by stroke undergo abnormal movement
of the trunk and, in particular, abnormal movement in posture and motor control. In
addition, damage to the abdominal area and chest wall, directly and indirectly decrease
mobility of the respiratory muscles, and weakens their strength and endurance, affecting the
respiratory cycle<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. During aerobic exercise, which demands endurance, hemiplegic
patients may become easily tired<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. When
such patients return to their local community, they may have difficulty with activities of
daily living, as well as, gait<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. General
rehabilitation programs for stroke patients, that only aim towards functional recovery of
the body, are not sufficient to enhance cardiopulmonary system function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As such, rehabilitation programs that integrate
interventions related to respiration could be more effective in stroke patients for
improving functional activities such as gait<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chest resistance exercises promote the alignment of respiratory muscles with respiratory
rhythms by providing resistance to the sternal and costal areas to resolve the respiratory
problem itself<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conversely, a chest
expansion exercise is a full-body exercise technique that combines deep breathing with
active movements of the trunk and limbs. This exercise is an intervention method more
specific to the musculoskeletal system as it moderates inspiration and expiration rates,
improves mobility of the intercostal space, relaxes the stiff connective tissue, and relaxes
soft tissues such as the pectoralis major, intercostal, and quadratus lumborum muscles<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study in stroke patients<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
noted that chest resistance exercises and diaphragmatic resistance exercises, by way of the
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) method, improved the subjects&#x02019; pulmonary
function, leading to expansion of the pulmonary tissue, improvements in thorax movement,
strengthening of the respiratory muscles, and an enhancement in endurance. Britto et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> applied inspiratory muscle training
to chronic stroke patients and reported strengthening of the inspiratory muscles, as well
as, an improvement in endurance within a short time period. In another study by
Leelarungrayub et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease patients conducted chest expansion exercises, there was
significant improvement in pulmonary function, dyspnea, and the degree of chest expansion.
Moreover, when stroke patients performed chest resistance exercises based on the PNF method,
there was significant improvement in their gait ability, degree of chest expansion, and
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Indeed, various previous studies in healthy individuals, as well as patients with
obstructive pulmonary disease, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, and neuromuscular
disease have been performed; however, studies evaluating respiratory function in stroke
patients following chest resistance and chest expansion exercises, and examining the
relation of trunk control ability with respiratory function, are lacking. Accordingly, this
study aims to examine the efficiency of chest resistance and chest expansion exercises for
improving respiratory function and trunk control ability in patients with hemiplegia caused
by a stroke, and to compare the effects of these interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Study subjects was stroke patients who had suffered a stroke and were hospitalized and
treated at the N hospital located in Daegu City, Korea. All subject was randomly allocated
to a chest resistance exercise group (CREG, n = 20) or chest expansion exercise group (CEEG,
n = 20). The criteria for study subject selection included those who were chronic stroke
patients whereby the onset of stroke occurred at least six months prior; those whose Korea
mini mental state examination score was 24 points or higher; those who had no special
pulmonary disease before the onset of stroke; those who had no innate deformation of the
thorax or rib fracture; and those who were able to sit independently. This study was
approved by the Daegu University institutional review board and all study-related procedures
were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
subjects understood the purpose of the study and written informed consent was received from
all subjects prior to their participation.</p><p>There are intervention chest resistance exercise group.</p><p>The patients assumed a supine and side-lying position while undergoing chest resistance
exercise patterns and the diaphragmatic palpation technique of the PNF on the costal area.
Briefly, the therapist places both hands on the costa of the patient, with the fingers
placed diagonally along the costal line. Pressure is then applied from the costal area, in a
caudal and medial direction, in line with the patient&#x02019;s respiratory rhythm so that the
patient can sufficiently breathe out during expiration, while in supine position. And the
therapist places the hands on the chest area to reinforce. The therapist diagonally applies
pressure in a caudal and medial direction along the costal line, drawing an arc in line with
the patient&#x02019;s respiratory rhythm on side-lying position.</p><p>The diaphragm is then palpated by pushing it superiorly and laterally with the thumb or
other finger from below the thorax. The therapist gives resistance to the inferior movement
of the contracting diaphragm. In order to provide indirect palpation, the therapist places
both hands on the abdominal area and has the patient inhale while pushing diaphragm
superiorly with smooth pressure on supine position.</p><sec><title>Chest expiration exercise group</title><p>In this interventional method, the therapist pushes the patient&#x02019;s shoulder area in an
anterior-inferior direction and pulls the pelvic area in a posterior-superior direction,
in line with the patient&#x02019;s respiratory cycle. During inspiration, the therapist pulls the
shoulder area in a posterior-superior direction and pushes the pelvic area in an
anterior-inferior direction so that the thorax can be sufficiently expanded during
inspiration while in the side-lying position. The patient&#x02019;s also underwent trunk rotation
exercises. During expiration, the patient&#x02019;s trunk is rotated and flexed in the direction
of the non-paretic side and the paretic side elbow is pushed in an anterior-inferior
direction toward the non-paretic side knee. During inspiration, the trunk is maximally
rotated in the paretic side direction such that the elbow is in a posterior-superior
direction to sufficiently expand the paretic side thorax while the patients is in a seated
position. The chest stretching exercise was also conducted with the patient in a seated
position. During expiration, the therapist pushes together the bilateral elbows anteriorly
and flexes the upper part of the patient&#x02019;s trunk. During inspiration, the patient spreads
the bilateral elbows externally and extends the trunk to expand the thorax. All subjects
who participated in the study conducted an ex-ante evaluation before initiating the
exercise program, and were re-evaluated eight weeks later. The subjects&#x02019; respiratory
function was assessed based on forced volume vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1, and their
trunk control ability was measured using the trunk impairment scale (TIS).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical processing of the data was conducted using SPSS ver. 12.0, and descriptive
statistics was used to analyze the subjects&#x02019; general characteristics. A paired t-test was
carried out to examine group differences, before and after the experiment, and an
independent t-test was conducted to evaluate differences between the two groups.
Statistical significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics (mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CREG</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CEEG</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (Male/Female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 / 8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 / 9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (Right/Left)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 / 11</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 / 11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diagnosis (infarction/hemorrhage)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 / 9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 / 11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.50 &#x000b1; 11.43</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.30 &#x000b1; 11.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time since stroke</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.70 &#x000b1; 1.69</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.95 &#x000b1; 1.63</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE-K</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.25 &#x000b1; 1.83</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.35 &#x000b1; 1.81</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*CREG: Chest Resistance Exercise Group, CEEG: Chest Expansion Exercise Group, MMSE-K:

patients with stroke-related hemiplegia by closely examining the efficiency of the
interventions in improving respiratory function and trunk control ability. To examine
respiratory function of the subjects, this study measured FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC. According
to the results of this study, both the CREG and the CEEG groups showed significant
improvements in respiratory function and trunk control ability.</p><p>In a previous study, Sutbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
classified stroke patients in a sub-acute state into an inspiratory muscle training group, a
respiratory retraining group, and a control group, and applied interventions six times per
week for six weeks to compare pulmonary function between groups. The results showed that FVC
and FEV1 of the inspiratory muscle training group significantly increased. Similarly, Kim
Jae-hyeon<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> applied chest mobility
exercises, chest resistance exercises using the PNF method, and respiration exercises using
diaphragmatic respiration exercise in stroke patients for four weeks, and their vital
capacity, FVC, FEV1, and maximal voluntary ventilation significantly changed. In another
study by Mueller et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, respiration
exercises in spinal cord injury patients resulted in a significant increase in FEV1/FVC and
FEV1. Jeong Ju-hyeon and Kim Nan-su<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that following breathing exercises for six weeks using resistive inspiratory muscle
training, the subjects&#x02019; FEV1 and maximal expiratory pressure significantly improved but FVC
and FEV1/FVC did not significantly increase. Britto et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> applied respiration exercises, using a respiratory resistance
instrument in stroke patients, and reported that there were significant changes in the
maximal inspiratory pressure and inspiratory muscle endurance.</p><p>In line with the results of the previous studies mentioned above, the subjects&#x02019; FVC and
FEV1, in the present study, significantly improved after undergoing chest resistance
exercises for eight weeks. This finding is not surprising given that the provision of
resistance would be expected to ameliorate the strength and endurance of the respiratory
muscles, with effective improvements in the subjects&#x02019; respiratory functions. Kim
Sang-hoe<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a combination
of lumbar stabilization exercises and trunk stretching significantly improved FVC. Lima et
al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> applied a neck and trunk muscle
mobilization technique in healthy subjects and found that the FEV1 and peak expiratory flow
rate were significantly improved. Seo Gyo-cheol et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> applied chest expansion exercises and resistance exercises to
subjects for four weeks and reported that there were significant changes in FVC, FEV1, and
maximal expiratory flow, but not in FEV1/FVC. Similarly, in the present study, the subjects&#x02019;
FVC and FEV1 significantly improved after the chest expansion exercises. This result
supports Burianova&#x02019;s opinion<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> that chest
expansion exercises achieve appropriate contraction of the respiratory muscles and enhance
ventilation by promoting muscle activity.</p><p>The present study also applied the TIS to examine changes in trunk control ability. Jandt
et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the association between
trunk control, respiratory muscle strength, and pulmonary function in stroke patients and
noted that a consistent and statistically significant correlation was found between TIS and
Peak expiratory flow and between TIS and Maximum expiratory pressure.</p><p>In a study by Kim Min-hwan<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> where
stroke patients received expiratory muscle training five times per week for six weeks, the
experimental group showed significant improvements in trunk control ability compared to the
control group. Gu Tae-wu<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that
a combination of thoracic mobilization and respiration exercises resulted in significant
enhancements in the subjects&#x02019; trunk control ability.</p><p>In the present study, which examined the subjects&#x02019; trunk control ability after the
application of chest resistance and chest expansion exercises, the TIS significantly
improved in both groups with more significant improvements in the CREG than in the CEEG.
This is likely due to improvements in respiratory muscle function following the application
of each exercise program which could affect trunk control ability. More significant
improvements observed in the CREG group could be attributed to enhancements in respiratory
muscle strength and endurance with chest resistance exercises, which more greatly affect
trunk stability in comparison to chest expansion exercises.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is that it is difficult to generalize the current
observations, as the number of subjects is small. As such, further long-term studies on a
larger subset of stroke patients, and with regular follow-up intervals to ascertain how long
the effect of training endures, are still needed. Nevertheless, the results of the present
study show that both chest resistance exercises and chest expansion exercises were effective
in improving respiratory function and trunk control ability in hemiplegic stroke patients,
however chest resistance exercises were more effective than chest expansion exercises. Thus,
chest resistance exercises and chest expansion exercises may be suitable and effective
therapeutic intervention methods to improve respiratory function and trunk control ability
in stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>GL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis
