These impose a huge burden on the employers and the country at large. Yoga, with origins in ancient India, has several subtypes and incorporates physical postures (asanas), controlled breathing (pranayama), deep relaxation, and meditation.

In the present study, significant reduction in body fat was noted after 12 weeks of yoga training. The reduction in body fat might be due to the fact that the volunteers underwent a high level of yogic exercise over a period, which resulted in lowering of body fat percentage. Yoga involves verity of physical activity, change of postures, repeated contractions, and relaxations of the abdominal muscles might be the cause of reduction of body fat. Similar observations were noted by many authors where reduction in body fat was noted after yoga training.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Another study conducted by Zorofi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] has reported significant reduction of body fat after yoga training. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in body mass and LBM among the participants after the training program. This might be due to improper optimization of the training load and/or short duration of the yoga training. Increase in body fat can elevate the risk factors for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and many other complications.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Regular yoga practice may reduce body fat, which is essential to maintain disease-free lifestyle.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the etiology of a most of degenerative diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders and aging.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] ROS induced oxidative stress, damages the membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids resulting in elevation in MDA level.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A decrease in the activity of antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, GSH, and vitamins C may also contribute to oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, and GSH act as a primary line of defense against the toxic effects of ROS. Superoxide radicals are detoxified by SOD to produce hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) which is further converted to water by CAT and glutathione peroxidase. GSH peroxidase requires GSH as a coenzyme to convert H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In the present investigation, significant reduction in serum MDA level was noted among the participants after 12 weeks of yoga training. In addition, significant increase in SOD, CAT, GSH, and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) concentrations among the participants after 12 weeks of yoga training. Similar findings were reported by many researchers. Findings of Hegde <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported significant reduction in MDA level in type 2 diabetic patients. They reported reduction in MDA level and increase in GSH and ascorbic acid levels after yoga training. A recent study showed that Yoga practice for 3 months has significantly reduced serum MDA level, and enhanced antioxidants level such as SOD activity, serum GSH, and Vitamin C in elderly hypertensive individuals.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Yoga has been found to be beneficial in reducing oxidative stress. It may be noted in the yoga training incorporated to the volunteers by slow-breathing practices, relaxation techniques, meditation, and asanas (maintaining postures). It is widely accepted that increased oxygen consumption during exercise results in the excess generation of ROS.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Whereas, yoga-based relaxation technique and meditation were found to be associated with decreased oxygen consumption and breath holding.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Hence, it is presumed that low consumption of oxygen during yoga practice alter the metabolic state of the participants, and this probably reduced serum MDA level in the yoga practitioners of the present study.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Yoga-induced enhancement in endogenous antioxidants such as SOD, CAT, and GSH might be due to increase in their upregulation [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and decreased rate of utilization due to lowering of oxidative stress. Similarly, an increased level of serum Vitamin C, an exogenous antioxidant, in yoga practitioners might also be due to lowering rate of utilization. This yoga-induced achievement in antioxidant capacity may help to cope with deleterious effects of oxidative stress and prevents further damage to body tissues. Superoxide radicals combine with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite leading to nitrosative stress. Yoga-induced elevated SOD level may also prevent formation of peroxynitrite, and thus reduces the possibility of nitrosative stress. Yoga-based relaxation technique and meditation were found to be associated with decreased oxygen consumption.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Hence, it can be presumed that low consumption of oxygen during yoga practice probably reduced serum MDA level in the yoga practitioners of the present study. This study indicates that even a brief practice of yogic lifestyle can significantly reduce oxidative stress and help in promoting healthy life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Regular yoga practice helps to maintain normal healthy lifestyle and physical fitness which is indicated by decreasing body fat. The findings of the study demonstrate the efficacy of yoga exercise on body composition, oxidative stress markers, and antioxidant status in healthy participants. The findings of the present study suggest that yoga can be used as an effective lifestyle modality to reduce oxidative stress and to enhance antioxidant defense. Thus, regular practice of yoga may be helpful to reduce stress and maintain disease-free lifestyle.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are sincerely and wholeheartedly acknowledge the contribution of the individuals participated in this study.
