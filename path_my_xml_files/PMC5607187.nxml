We conducted an evaluation of an integrated nutrition and health program that aimed to improve nutritional status of young children by improving breast and complementary feeding practices over that offered by the Government of India&#x02019;s standard nutrition and health care program.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>In Uttar Pradesh state, through multi-stage cluster random sampling, 81 villages in an intervention district and 84 villages in a comparison district were selected. A cohort of 957 third trimester pregnant women identified during house-to-house surveys was enrolled and, following childbirth, mother-child dyads were followed every three months from birth to 18 months of age. The primary outcomes were improvements in weight-for-age and length-for-age z scores, with improved breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices as intermediate outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>Optimal breastfeeding practices were higher among women in intervention than comparison areas, including initiating breastfeeding within one hour of delivery (17.4% vs. 2.7%, p&#x0003c;0.001), feeding colostrum (34.7% vs. 8.4%, p&#x0003c;0.001), avoiding pre-lacteals (19.6% vs. 2.1%, p&#x0003c;0.001) and exclusively breastfeeding up to 6 months (24.1% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.001). However, differences were few and mixed between study arms with respect to complementary feeding practices. The mean weight-for-age z-score was higher at 9 months (-2.1 vs. -2.4, p = 0.0026) and the prevalence of underweight status was lower at 12 months (58.5% vs. 69.3%, p = 0.047) among intervention children. The prevalence of stunting was similar between study arms at all ages. Coefficients to show the differences between the intervention and comparison districts (0.13 cm/mo) suggested significant faster linear growth among intervention district infants at earlier ages (0&#x02013;5 months).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Mothers participating in the intervention district were more likely to follow optimal breast, although not complementary feeding practices. The program modestly improved linear growth in earlier age and weight gain in late infancy. Comprehensive nutrition and health interventions are complex; the implementation strategies need careful examination to improve feeding practices and thus impact growth.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00198835">NCT00198835</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000200</institution-id><institution>United States Agency for International Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRN-A-00-96-90006-00</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by USAID, India Mission, through Global Research Activity Award # HRN-A-00-96-90006-00 to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Most recent estimates based on WHO Child Growth Standards suggest that 41% of the under-five children in the United Nations&#x02019; South-Central Asian Region are stunted and 33% are underweight [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. India alone, with prevalence rates of 48% and 43%, has an estimated 54.3 million stunted and 48.2 million underweight preschool aged children [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], representing 31% and 43% of all the developing world's burden, respectively. Undernutrition has also been associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, as well as fatality due to measles, malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Small-scale, nutrition education interventions have registered successes in increasing total caloric intake, energy density and intake from complementary foods [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], yet effects on growth during the first two years of life have been mixed [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185030.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent efficacy trial, after twelve-month intervention significantly increased complementary food intake and reduced stunting in complementary feeding group but not in the complementary feeding + play group [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given a need to move beyond small scale or efficacy trials have been realized, in India, there have been only a few evaluations of large-scale community-based nutrition interventions in the last decade, which have also been limited in scope. Few evaluations have employed prospective, comparison group designs, leaving this area of implementation science lacking in high quality impact data [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In India, nutrition and health services are delivered by the Government of India&#x02019;s (GOI) Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program under the Department of Child Development, Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Department of the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Family Welfare (MOHFW). Anganwadi workers (AWW), community-based health workers appointed under the ICDS program, are responsible for providing nutrition education, supplementary foods and micronutrient supplements in coordination with more highly trained, but fewer-in-number auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM). AWWs also assist the ANMs in identifying children and families in need of program participation. The ANM is responsible for delivering ante- and post-natal care that includes iron and folic acid supplementation, attending child birth, providing immunizations and periodically distributing vitamin A to pre-school children.</p><p>We prospectively evaluated an enhanced version of the ICDS and RCH service package delivered by the GOI in the State of Uttar Pradesh, called the Integrated Nutrition and Health Program (INHP II). The INHP II aims to improve growth under two years of age by targeting mothers during pregnancy through post-natal lactation periods with nutrition services facilitated by an international NGO, CARE-India. Changes in feeding practices, nutritional status and growth were compared to outcomes achieved within an ICDS &#x0201c;basic&#x0201d; services area, which received usual governmental services, within the same state.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Evaluation design</title><p>A prospective, cohort assessment was designed and implemented, whereby in each of the intervention and comparison district sites pregnant women were identified, enrolled, provided program inputs and followed with their infants through 18 months after child birth. Within each district, a multi-stage, pseudo-random sampling design was employed to identify AWCs, by first purposively selecting three rural blocks based on physical proximity to other selected blocks and the state capital (project office). Additional criteria were the absence of other major maternal and child health projects and comparability with respect to population size and number of AWCs. Further, in the intervention district, only blocks where CARE-India's INHP-II program was active (10 of 15 blocks) were eligible. By these joint criteria, Blocks Nindura, Banki and Fatehpur in the intervention and Nawabganj, Hasanganj and Asoha in the comparison district were selected.

Data records were checked for completion, range, skip-pattern matching, evidence of heaping and consistency. Discrepancies were cross-checked with paper questionnaires for immediate resolution, when possible. Frequency distributions of the sample characteristics were examined for outliers, and derived variables evaluated (e.g., socioeconomic index quintile with principal component analysis, z-score distributions for reasonableness).</p><p>The economic status of the households were assessed with a wealth index, which was calculated using principal component analysis based on 16 household durable assets and housing characteristics including type of house, source of light, source of fuel, source of drinking water, type of toilet facility and number of rooms in the household. The wealth index was divided into five quintiles from level 1 (poorest) to level 5 (wealthiest). Cross-sectional differences between intervention and comparison districts were evaluated using Student&#x02019;s t-test for continuous and Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square for categorical variables. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for dichotomized outcome variables were calculated to assess differences in risk.</p><p>The growth trajectory curves for length and weight by age were used to finalize cubic spline models with the knots at 6 and 18 months of age. To model growth, a random coefficient mixed model was used, allowing random intercept as well as slope for respective ages. The variables age and anganwadi centers were included as random effects to account for the clusterization of responses. Maximum likelihood estimates were used with unstructured option as random effects are correlated due to repeated measures to model variance that differs by age.</p><p>The analysis of the effects of intervention on physical growth was based on a latent growth model (Diggle et al., 1994) in which the outcome examined was the change in nutritional status (length and/or weight) over a one month period in interaction with the district of residence. Similar analyses were performed for the effects of gender, program and socio-demographic factors on physical growth. Mixed-effect multiple linear regression modeling allowed to adjust for the confounding factors among the socio-demographic characteristics of the sample. Age modeled with cubic spline terms allowed for three different coefficients for the ages 0&#x02013;5 months, 6&#x02013;17 months and &#x0003e; = 18 months of age. To obtain annual growth we summed the interaction terms after multiplying for respective number of months contributed.

Exclusive breastfeeding at &#x0003c;1 months, 3 months and 6 months of age was more prevalent in the intervention than the comparison district. The intervention appeared to increase protein intake (i.e., legume consumption) among children from 9 to 18 months. However, cereal intake increased equally in both districts while intake of fruit and vegetable, milk and milk products increased more rapidly among children in the comparison than in the intervention district, for unexplainable reasons. Among children from 9 to 18 months of age, the intervention did not improve overall quantity and variety of complementary food given, and showed modest impovement in frequency only at 15 and 18 months of age.</p><p>Care India&#x02019;s INHP II has been successful in improving linear growth among younger (0&#x02013;5 mo) male infants. There was no significant increase in length or weight gain between the intervention and the comparison districts at later age ranges. The gender effect showed that younger male infants (0-5months) in both the intervention and the comparison districts reported better length and weight gain, however, no significant differences at the later age ranges were observed. Overall, though the intervention district children increased 0.45cm more and gained 0.06 Kg more weight per year, difference was not significant.</p><p>Though significant, but limited impact of intervention on child growth at earlier age ranges could be due to significant differences in breastfeeding initiation practices between the intervention and the comparison districts that may affect immunologic profile as there were more symptomatic infections namely, fever, diarrhea and cough/cold (data not presented). This may explain the small but significant improvement in the linear growth from 0&#x02013;5 months. The consistent better growth of male infants in both the intervention and comparison districts need further explorations as we did not find any differences in infant feeding practices. There was limited evidence of a positive effect of the intervention on infant. The mean WAZ was higher at 9 months and underweight prevalence was lower among intervention children at 12 months only. The limited impact on ponderal growth only at earlier ages may not be surprising given that few, consistent differences in complementary feeding practices were observed between the two study areas. Consumption of a predominantly cereal-based diet, in small quantities, combined with a near absence of foods of animal origin in the diet, with no differences in oil added to the diet (recommended to increase the energy density) may have minimized any potential impact on child growth. Consumption of fruits and vegetable as well as milk and milk products was also higher among the comparison district children. These factors may have contributed to the overall lack of intervention impact on nutritional status in this setting. An earlier small-scale effectiveness study in a similar setting demonstrated somewhat similar results, where, despite some improvements in infant feeding practices at almost all age ranges, only a small reduction in stunting prevalence at month 18 was observed with no overall improvement in the prevalence of infant undernutrition [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Evaluation of INHP II faced several challenges. The phase one of the INHP was also implemented in the same district. Therefore, some residual impact of earlier program could not be ruled out. Further, since the program was already covered one district, randomization could not be done for the selection of implementation and comparison district. While the design was quasi-experimental, inability to randomize multiple program areas to either intervention or comparison status may have led to confounding that could distort findings. To this end, we attempted to achieve comparability across districts with respect to socio-demographic indicators and access to services, such as may be reflected by distance to the nearest state capital.</p><p>Analysis was based on intention to treat that does not account for heterogeneity in program implementation [<xref rid="pone.0185030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], since this analysis is the most relevant for policymakers. However, in order to understand the potential efficacy of the intervention, it will be important to look at the population that was actually exposed to the intervention and is likely to show better results. This will be reported separately and will help to understand effective components of the intervention and may help in strengthening the existing program.</p><p>The &#x02018;CARE-enhanced&#x02019; package delivered through the system demonstrated improvement in breastfeeding practices. However, the limited and somewhat mixed effects of the intervention program on complementary feeding indicators may not be adequate to demonstrate a sustained reduction in undernutrition, especially given that increases in stunting prevalence tend to emerge during weaning. More rigorous and coordinated efforts may be required to bring about changes in complementary feeding behaviors, including repeated reinforcement for longer periods, resulting in reductions in child undernutrition scenario. Finally, given the size and complexity of the program's operations and multiplicity of outcomes across sequential age time points, it is improtant to study program exposure as it evolved over time, and components that have been successful in improving feeding practices indicators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185030.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185030.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185030.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Cohort research protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185030.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185030.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><p><bold>Complementary feeding practices at different ages in Uttar Pradesh, India (2004&#x02013;06)</bold> * Statistical test result comparing intervention and comparison districts, significant at p&#x0003c;0.05 <bold>(Table A).
