All 14 adult ShangRing sizes (40&#x02013;26 mm inner diameter, each varying by 1 mm) were available in the Standard Sizing arm; the Modified Sizing arm used every other size (40, 38, 36, 34, 32, 30, 28 mm inner diameter).

Male circumcision (MC) devices have the potential to increase the number of clients reached with VMMC<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and create additional demand. Two MC devices have been prequalified by the WHO for use and surveillance under conditions of routine service delivery,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> including the ShangRing device from China.</p><p>ShangRing is a collar clamp circumcision device, consisting of 2 concentric plastic rings and a silicone-ringed pad that sandwiches the foreskin of the penis.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The rapid, tight compression of the foreskin between the rings achieves hemostasis and prevents tissue slippage.

The large number of adult ShangRing sizes poses an obvious procurement, distribution, and stocking challenge for VMMC programs. If use of fewer sizes was found to be equally safe and effective, supply logistics would be simplified. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of having available every other ShangRing device size for adult VMMC. We aimed to provide an evidence base for policy decisions by officials considering integration of devices into national programs while seeking efficiencies that might be gained through simplified supply chains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Sites and Providers</title><p>The trial was conducted at 3 sites in Lusaka: the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) MC unit, Chilenje Clinic, and Chawama First Level District Hospital, all of which provide routine adult VMMC services.

Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 study arms in a 1:1 ratio, using permuted blocks with randomly selected block sizes: the Standard Sizing arm, using the full array of 14 adult sizes (diameter of 26&#x02013;40 mm varying by 1 mm each; the 27 mm device was unavailable); and the Modified Sizing arm, using only 7 adult sizes (diameter of 28&#x02013;40 mm varying by 2 mm each). Sealed, numbered, opaque, tamper-evident envelopes were prepared and shipped to the study sites. FHI 360 study staff were blinded to the randomization sequence until the data set was frozen.</p><p>Providers were trained to measure penis circumference at the coronal sulcus using the measuring strip shipped with the devices. The exact millimeter measure was used for men in the Standard Sizing arm. In the Modified Sizing arm, we used the exact measurement if possible; if the measurement fell between 2 device sizes, the provider chose the smaller size.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Each participant was scheduled for 2 follow-up study visits: the removal visit (day 7 after placement with an allowable window of day 5&#x02013;9) and the healing check visit (day 42 after placement with an allowable window of day 40&#x02013;44) although they were encouraged to return at any time with a complication or concern. Participants who were not completely healed at the day 42 visit were scheduled for additional visits at weekly intervals until complete healing was confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study Objectives and Endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety of ShangRing MC procedures when providers chose among 7 adult sizes (Modified Sizing arm) versus the full range of 14 adult sizes (Standard Sizing arm) during routine service delivery. The primary endpoint was the percentage [and 95% confidence interval (CI)] of men with at least 1 moderate or severe adverse event (AE) in each study arm. Although mild AEs were recorded, they were not included in the analysis endpoint nor reported here. AEs were classified according to a widely used consensus guide<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> modified for MC devices and recorded at each visit on a dedicated case report form.

The study had power to detect only large between-group differences in overall AE percentages. The study had approximately 80% power to detect any rare individual AE with a true rate of 0.008 (0.8%) or greater in each arm.</p><p>The full &#x0201c;Analysis Population&#x0201d; included all participants who underwent study screening and formed the population for baseline characteristics and study disposition. The &#x0201c;RCT Population&#x0201d; included the subset of eligible participants randomized to the 2 study arms and is the primary population for comparisons between arms. We conducted as-treated analyses in the RCT Population (ie, defining analysis groups according to the device size actually received, regardless of assignment errors). Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and ignored.</p><p>We tabulated the frequency and percentage of men with moderate or severe AEs in each study arm and overall, both pooled across sites and separately within sites. We computed the percentage of men with at least 1 moderate or severe AE and the 95% CI around the percentage in each arm as well as overall.

Upon physical examination to confirm eligibility, no one was screened out because his penis was too big or too small for the available sizes. Two men (0.4%) were excluded because of anatomical abnormalities (1 hypospadias; 1 small foreskin), one man withdrew after consent and enrollment, and one man was excluded from the analysis because of a consent error, leaving N = 496 men. Five men were randomly assigned to the Modified Sizing arm but erroneously received a size only available in the Standard Sizing arm; they were included in the Standard Sizing arm during analyses. A total of 255 men comprised the Standard Sizing study arm, and 241 men were included in the Modified Sizing arm.</p><p>The median age was 23.5 years [interquartile range (IQR) 20&#x02013;29], was similar in the 2 study arms, and varied only slightly among the 3 clinics. The most prevalent ethnic group was Bemba, constituting 26.3% of the cohort overall (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Demographic Features of Enrolled Participants, RCT Population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="qai-72-s30-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Features of the Circumcision Procedures</title><p>The majority of the ShangRing procedures in both study arms was performed by nurses (92% in the Standard Sizing arm and 88% in the Modified Sizing arm). The median duration of placement was 8 minutes (IQR 6&#x02013;10) in both study arms. One problem during placement was reported in each study arm, but neither event led to an AE. In the Standard Sizing arm, 5 of the 14 device sizes were each used for more than 10% of procedures (32&#x02013;36 mm inner diameter). Median postoperative pain queried approximately 30 minutes after placement was 1 on a scale of 0-to-10 in both study arms.</p><p>The median duration of removal was 5 minutes in both study arms.

The first had severe bleeding at day 12, 5 days after device removal. That event was designated a Serious AE (SAE) because it required suturing on 2 occasions before the bleeding could be stopped. Further tests of the man revealed a clotting disorder. The second participant had a moderate infection and moderate swelling at day 9 when the device was removed. At the day 42 healing check visit, he was also deemed to have moderate insufficient skin removal. The one participant in the Modified Sizing arm with a reportable AE had moderate insufficient skin removal diagnosed at the healing check visit. Neither participant with insufficient skin removal had decided on surgical completion of circumcision by the time of study exit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Study Status and Time to Healing</title><p>All participants who had a ShangRing placed returned for removal. Four hundred and eighty four participants (97.6%) were deemed completely healed at healing check visits although about a quarter of all healing check visits were after the scheduled day 40&#x02013;44 visit window. Overall, 73.2% of all participants were completely healed at the day 42 healing check visit as scheduled (75.7% in the Standard Sizing arm and 70.5% in the Modified Sizing arm); 24.4% of all participants completed the study and were confirmed fully healed at a visit later than the scheduled day 42 visit (45 days or more after circumcision: 22.0% in the Standard Sizing arm and 27.0% in the Modified Sizing arm). Twelve men (2.4%) discontinued the study or were lost during follow-up before healing could be confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Acceptability Parameters</title><p>Virtually all (99.6%) of the men stated that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the appearance of their circumcised penis, and 98.6% stated they would recommend ShangRing circumcision to a friend or family member. Of the many possible reasons for liking the procedure listed on our interview form, 5 reasons were each cited by more than 40% of participants in both study arms: quick procedure time; no stitches; less pain than expected; satisfactory cosmetic result; and improved personal hygiene. The form had the same number of possible reasons to dislike the procedure, and one reason was cited by 25% of participants in both study arms: pain or discomfort with erection during the 7-day device wear period. However, half of participants overall (52.5%) did not report a single reason to dislike the procedure. Frequencies of these acceptability factors differed little between the study arms.</p><p>Participants were queried about how much the pain interfered with walking, sleep, and work. Such interference was deemed mild on average by men in both study arms and tended to diminish during the 7 days of device wear. More than 80% of men in each study arm returned to normal activities within 2 days of the circumcision procedure. Maximum pain during erection at any time during device wearing was moderate in both study arms: median 4 on the scale of 0-to-10.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our trial conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, observed few moderate/severe AEs. The AE rate was low and equivalent in the 2 study arms, and healing times were comparable, indicating that provision of one-half the number of adult device sizes is sufficient for safe service delivery of the ShangRing.</p><p>The benefit of proper ShangRing device sizing for circumcision safety and comfort seems obvious. But in practice, the penile measurement process is imprecise and somewhat subjective. On the one hand, the measuring tape can be squeezed slightly, thereby diminishing the reading; on the other hand, slight tumescence during measurement can increase circumference. And men can measure in between the available device sizes. A small RCT (N = 74) in China enrolled men with penile measurements between the available device sizes and assigned half to receive the next smaller device size and half to receive the next larger size.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Selection of the smaller size resulted in less mean blood loss and edema, quicker removal times, and faster healing. Smaller rings made eversion of the foreskin easier, and dorsal slits were necessary to allow foreskin eversion in more men in the larger ring size study arm. The size of the trial resulted in low power to detect differences in these study outcomes, however. The current larger trial showed that availability of half the adult device sizes did not reduce safety, effectiveness, or acceptability.</p><p>Our results agree with other ShangRing data from African settings. Three other large ShangRing clinical studies have been conducted in Zambia, Kenya and Uganda,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in which moderate/severe AE rates were 7.6%, 1.0%, and 1.6%. The concerning 7.6% figure emerged in the initial RCT of the device compared with conventional surgical circumcision in Kenya and Zambia; the AE rate in the surgery study arm was also unusually high in that trial (5.0%).<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A subsequent larger field study in the same 2 countries observed a much lower AE rate of 1.6%.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Short-term outcomes of ShangRing circumcision compare favorably with conventional surgical procedures,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and 2 studies with longer-term follow-up of men circumcised with the ShangRing device found few complications 2&#x02013;3 years after the procedures.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Only 2 of 500 men enrolled in this trial were found to be unsuitable for the ShangRing, an effectiveness rate of 99.6% (screen-out rate 0.4%). The ShangRing procedure could not be completed for 1 of 200 men in the earlier RCT (0.5%); 4 of 508 men in the Uganda study (0.8%); and 5 of 1211 men in the field study in Kenya and Zambia (0.4%).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Thus far, it seems that only a small percentage of men will be anatomically unsuitable for the ShangRing procedure.</p><p>When queried about various aspects of circumcision procedure acceptability, trial participants revealed very favorable opinions about the ShangRing. In these dimensions, our study participants resembled those in previous ShangRing studies in Africa.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> One might expect differences between the study arms in self-reported pain and discomfort during device wear, but the pain score distributions were quite similar across arms immediately postplacement, during device wear, and at removal.</p><p>One strength of clinical research on the ShangRing is that under current guidelines, men are required to return for device removal at 7 days after circumcision. All participants in this study complied, so that it is unlikely that we failed to ascertain early AEs (within 7 days) and doubtful that our observed AE rate, the primary study endpoint, was biased downward.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>A weakness of this study is that almost one quarter of our study participants completed their healing check visits after the scheduled visit window of 40&#x02013;44 days, biasing the measurement of healing times. We know that the percentage completely healed was at least 75% in the Standard Sizing arm and 70% in the Modified Sizing arm, both of which are lower than what is typically observed following surgical circumcision.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The trial reaffirms healing times 1&#x02013;2 weeks longer after device circumcisions than surgical procedures.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The clinical profile of the ShangRing device for adult VMMC in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be favorable and is not affected by an approach that uses fewer device sizes. In addition to this study, other operational research on ShangRing is underway. A modification of the ShangRing circumcision procedure, termed the &#x0201c;no-flip&#x0201d; technique because it omits the foreskin eversion step, makes it even simpler to learn and apply in programs.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A study of the safety of this technique and the acceptability of topical anesthesia for it is underway in Kenya (Barone M, personal communication). If VMMC demand can be increased by means of community-based interventions,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> the ease with which different cadres of providers can learn to safely and effectively apply the ShangRing technique, its relative speed, and the high acceptability consistently reported across studies could facilitate achievement of program goals for male circumcision.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the study participants for their willingness to engage in this research activity.
