<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[1]</sup></xref> unlike patients with skeletal muscular injuries whose pain for the treatment duration gradually subsides as they recover from morbidity, although it can progress to chronic pain. The absence of sufficient pain modulation during the treatment period for the burn injury can lead to poor compliance with physical or occupational therapy, an increased frequency of progression to chronic pain, paresthesia that persists for over a year,
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[2]</sup></xref> and the persistence of depressive symptoms because of post-traumatic stress disorder (the prevalence rates vary between 8% and 45%).
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[3]</sup></xref> Approximately 70% to 80% of burn patients complain of paresthetic sensation and &#x0223c;35% complain of pain in the scar tissue that lasts for more than a year.[
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>]
Therefore, pain modulation during the rehabilitation therapy period should be just as dynamic as it was in the initial wound treatment stage following burn injury.
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[6]</sup></xref>
</p><p>Pain in burn patients during rehabilitation therapy is caused by a combination of direct stimulation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that were subjected to thermal and mechanical injuries from the burn. Burn injuries over joint areas, especially in the extremities, are complicated by joint contracture as a result of long periods of immobilization for wound treatment; thus, pain modulation is very important in enabling physical therapy or occupational therapy to prevent joint contracture, and medications such as opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anti-psychotic drugs are presently widely used for pain modulation.
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[2]</sup></xref> However, because pharmacological treatments can cause side effects and complications such as drug addiction, nonpharmacological treatments such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[7]</sup></xref> burn rehabilitation massage therapy,
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[8]</sup></xref> and virtual reality rehabilitation system
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[9]</sup></xref> are being combined in a useful manner.
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[7]</sup></xref> Although various treatments such as medication
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[2]</sup></xref> and the aforementioned adjuvant therapies are effective in pain modulation for burn scars during rehabilitation therapy, many burn patients still complain of pain that is not being modulated.
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[9]</sup></xref> Therefore, the need for new and more effective treatments for pain modulation of burn scars has emerged.</p><p>In the early 1980s, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was used to destroy kidney stones. In the mid-1980s, it was used to treat musculoskeletal diseases, and in the 1990s, it was used in orthopedic procedures; presently, it has been widely used for noninvasive pain management and regenerative treatment of musculoskeletal diseases.

<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>] ESWT facilitates the regeneration of damaged tendons and bones, and it relieves pain when used for diseases such as proximal plantar fasciitis, lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, patellar tendinopathy, nonunion and delayed union of long bone fractures, and avascular necrosis of the femoral head; additionally, it facilitates blood supply in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers or ischemic heart disease.
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[11]</sup></xref> Although many clinical trials have been conducted, most studies on ESWT in burn patients have investigated its effects on wound re-epithelization in the early stage of burn injury
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[14]</sup></xref> or on hypertrophic and contracture scars.
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[15]</sup></xref> Therefore, on the basis of the aforementioned study results, we hypothesized that ESWT can be helpful for reducing pain by facilitating normal regeneration of injured tissues below the burnt skin in patients with pain that persists or is exacerbated after complete epithelization of the scar.</p><p>In the present study, ESWT was performed on burn patients admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation therapy following treatments for burn skin wounds at burn surgery or plastic surgery departments to evaluate the effectiveness of ESWT on residual scar pain after burn injury, and determine the clinical usefulness of ESWT as a new, noninvasive, and feasible treatment modality for scar pain.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>The present study was a prospective, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study that was conducted between February 2014 and 2015 at the Burn Center of Hallym University Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital, and all patients who volunteered to participate in the study provided their informed consent.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Participants</title><p>The participants in the study included patients with complete epithelization of open skin wounds who were admitted to our Department of Rehabilitation Medicine for the first time after undergoing aseptic treatment or skin grafting at the department of burn surgery or plastic surgery at Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital. Among these patients, those who complained of burn scar pain of &#x02265;5 points on a numerical rating scale (NRS) despite undergoing standard therapy (medication, physical therapy, and burn rehabilitation massage therapy) for &#x02265;1 week, had tenderness on physical examination, and had pain stemming from skin and tissues damaged by burn injuries were selected. Exclusion criteria were those with scar pain caused by psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and somatoform disorder; those with symptoms suggestive of fractures around the burn scar, blood clotting disorders, anti-coagulant use, or scar area infection; those with an unstable burn scar skin condition that may lead to blistering when the skin surface is stimulated during ESWT; those with a history of hyperventilation; or pregnant patients.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization</title><p>Numbers were assigned according to the order of admission of 43 burn patients with scar pain who satisfied all of the aforementioned criteria. Then a computer program was used to divide them into the ESWT group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22) and the placebo control group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21). One and 2 patients in the control and ESWT groups, respectively, dropped out of the study because of transfer to another hospital; thus, 20 patients each were included in the ESWT and control groups for the final analysis (Flow Diagram).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Methods</title><p>Among the burn scar areas with pain, the area in which the most severe tenderness was palpated was designated as the primary treatment site, and the pain threshold (Ib/cm<sup>2</sup>) was measured using Algometer BASELINE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Hoggan Health Industries, Inc., West Jordan, UT). The pain threshold was defined as the mean of the pressure values at which pain is first felt when the measurements were taken twice from the area with the most severe tenderness. The measurements were taken after the patients were made aware of the fact the measuring point was the pressure at which pain is first felt and not at the point when the pain is no longer tolerable.
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[16]</sup></xref>
</p><p>ESWT was conducted using the Duolith SD-1<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device (Storz Medical, T&#x000e4;gerwilen, Switzerland) with an electromagnetic cylindrical coil source of focused shock wave (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Depending on the area where tenderness was palpated, shock wave therapy was performed around the primary treatment site at 100&#x0200a;impulses/1&#x0200a;cm<sup>2</sup> in accordance with a previous study,
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[11]</sup></xref> and depending on the patient's pain tolerance, an energy flux density (EFD) of 0.05 to 0.15&#x0200a;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, frequency of 4&#x0200a;Hz, and 1000 to 2000 impulses were administered at 1-week intervals for 3 sessions.
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[12]</sup></xref> The depth of the treatment site was controlled by dividing the focal depth into 3 levels: 15, 30, and 50&#x0200a;mm. The shock wave focus was defined as the point within the pressure distribution model in which the pressure is &#x02265;50% of the peak pressure, and it had a diameter of &#x0223c;20&#x0200a;mm.
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[17]</sup></xref> Accordingly, we continued by moving the probe to tender areas in a sequential manner at a distance of 20 to 30&#x0200a;mm after ESWT at 100&#x0200a;impulses/1&#x0200a;cm<sup>2</sup> on the primary treatment site that showed the most severe tenderness. To ensure that the shock waves were being delivered well to the target tissue, ultrasound jelly was applied between the skin and probe surfaces, after which the treatment was performed with enough pressure to enable the probe and skin to come in close contact to prevent the formation of a layer of air.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The extracorporeal shock wave therapy was administered to burn patients.

From 1 week before the treatment to the final assessment, all patients received medication, physical therapy, and burn rehabilitation massage therapy for pain relief.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Assessment of the treatment effects</title><p>A nurse who did not know which group the patient belonged to assessed the treatment effects; the nurse performed the assessments before the first treatment and on 7th day after the 3rd treatment. An NRS was used for self-measured pain severity. This assessment method used a grading scale of 0 to 10 for pain severity, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing unimaginably severe pain.
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[18]</sup></xref>
</p><p>The tenderness area and pain threshold were measured using BASELINE (Hoggan Health Industries, Inc.); this is a valid and reliable method that has been extensively used for quantifying post-treatment effects in patients with soft tissue pain accompanied by tenderness.
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[16]</sup></xref> The Nirschl pain phase system was used as the functional assessment of pain; it increases from phase 1 to 7 as the pain becomes more severe, with phase 1 representing cases of mild pain with exercise or pain resolved within 24 hours, and phase 7 representing cases of constant pain at rest or pain that disrupts sleep (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Previous studies have investigated the effects of ESWT on burn patients to accelerate re-epithelization
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[14]</sup></xref> or treat hypertrophic and contracture scars.
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[15]</sup></xref> The present study's results showed that ESWT causes a significantly greater reduction in scar pain and significantly higher patient satisfaction with regard to pain relief.</p><p>The shock wave used for ESWT has the characteristic of being a sound wave with a high positive pressure amplitude that increases very rapidly in comparison to ambient pressure. The mechanism of ESWT involves mechanotransduction, in which mechanical energy is transformed into biochemical or molecular energy in living tissues to induce a variety of specific intracellular changes, and thereby induces pain relief and tissue regeneration. It has been reported that hematological, microscopic, molecular, and immunological responses in various cells and plasma induce pain relief and tissue regeneration.
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[10]</sup></xref> Increased cell membrane permeability and the destruction of damaged tissue through radical induction following ESWT have been shown to promote new tissue formation;
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[21]</sup></xref> regulate secretion and synthesis of substance P;
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[22]</sup></xref> decrease the number of unmyelinated nerve fibers that trigger pain;
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[23]</sup></xref> increase the release of growth factors for blood vessels, epithelium, bone, and collagen; and stimulate stem cells for wound healing.
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[24]</sup></xref> A study involving ESWT on patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis reported immediate pain relief following ESWT, which was attributed to the inhibition of nociceptors from repeated stimulation.
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[25]</sup></xref> In the present study, 5 patients in the ESWT group showed immediate pain relief, which was statistically significant (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>The fact that the ESWT group showed significantly greater pain reduction than the control group could be attributed to the ESWT-induced vascularization, which increased blood flow to facilitate tissue regeneration and inhibit nociceptors in the peripheral skin scar to block central sensitization to pain and decrease the synthesis of substance P in the dorsal root ganglion to inhibit neuronal hyperexcitability. Both the control and ESWT groups showed significant pain reduction after 3 weeks compared with the pretreatment values, which is believed to be the result of the standard, identical regimen involving medication, physical therapy, and burn rehabilitation massage therapy that the 2 groups had received; a previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that when rehabilitation massage therapy was conducted on burn patients, the epidermal moisture evaporation rate and pain in NRS were significantly reduced.
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[8]</sup></xref> The therapeutic effects of ESWT on wound regeneration are closely associated with an increase in blood flow. In a necrotic tissue transplantation model study involving artificially caused local tissue ischemia in laboratory settings, an increase in local tissue blood flow from ESWT was proven by a significant decrease in laser Doppler image signals.
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[26]</sup></xref> Recent studies have indicated that nitric oxide plays the most important role in increasing local blood flow in the wound area after ESWT. Diabetic mice with diminished capacity for neovascularization and wound healing were divided into mice with an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genetic defect and the defect-free control group. Wounds were created artificially on the back of the mice, and the 2 groups were further divided into groups that did and did not receive ESWT. When the levels of wound recovery were assessed in all 4 groups on days 0, 3, and 10 of ESWT, the level of wound recovery and neovascular density were significantly high in the diabetic mice group without an eNOS genetic defect that received ESWT. ESWT caused endothelial shear stress, a frictional force generated on the surface of the vascular epithelium from blood flow, which acted as a powerful stimulus for the production of endothelial nitric oxide, and this increased the expression of eNOS to induce the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which facilitated neovascularization and enhanced wound healing.

</p><p>Adverse effects based on the shock wave dose have been reported in animal experiments. When 100 impulses at an EFD of 0.28&#x0200a;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> were administered to rat Achilles tendons, transient edema and inflammation were observed,
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[27]</sup></xref> and in another study when ESWT was administered to mice Achilles tendons with 2000 impulses at 0.2&#x0200a;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, fragmentation of collagen fibers was observed in 7 of 8 mice.
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[28]</sup></xref> The histological response after ESWT is dose dependent on the applied energy (mJ); hence, when the EFD applied in the shock wave is increased, the focal range remains the same but the therapeutic range increases.
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[16]</sup></xref> In the present study, ESWT was performed at 0.05 to 0.15&#x0200a;mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> EFD at 100&#x0200a;impulses/cm<sup>2</sup>, with a total of 1000 to 2000 impulses, according to pain tolerance by the patients and the range of treatment without adverse effects.</p><p>The present study had some limitations. The sample size was small, and although the patients and evaluators were blinded to the study design, the therapist could not be blinded while conducting the treatments. Moreover, standardized treatment was not administered because no clear guidelines were available on the shock wave dose, effective time point for starting the treatment, and intervals and iterations. Furthermore, to exclude scar pain caused by psychiatric disorders, the patients were limited to those who had tenderness in the scar area; thus, we were not able to investigate the therapeutic effects of ESWT on scar pain from a variety of causes. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to determine standardized treatment guidelines by performing ESWT on more patients who have sustained burn injuries with a greater variety of scar pain at different time points.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Among the patients who require rehabilitation therapy after complete healing of burn wounds caused by burn surgery or plastic surgery, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was performed on those who, despite conventional treatments, had persistent pain considered to have stemmed from soft tissue below the scar. Overall, the ESWT group demonstrated significantly greater pain reduction than the control group.</p><p>Therefore, we think that ESWT can be an effective alternative treatment for decreasing scar pain in burn patients, and future studies should evaluate the shock wave dose, treatment time, and interval and frequency with a greater number of patients and at various time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate Dong Hyun Kim, PhD, Professor in the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Hallym University, for teaching Dr. Cho how to use theoretical and practical statistics for the purpose of this research study.
