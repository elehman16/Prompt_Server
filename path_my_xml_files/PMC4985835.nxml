However, this internet-based approach to service delivery has two limitations. First, there have been few evaluations assessing whether web-based information and support improves maternal and child outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Second, achieving high levels of participant engagement with web-based programmes has proved difficult, with many studies reporting low rates of adherence and high rates of attrition.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;6</xref> This is an important issue because a high level of engagement by participants is a key prerequisite for effective universal and targeted web-based programmes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Several different terms have been used to describe level of engagement with web-based interventions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> &#x02018;Actual usage&#x02019; refers to the amount of exposure that individuals have to a web-based intervention.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is typically assessed using number of logins, modules completed and messages posted.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> &#x02018;Intended usage&#x02019; is assessed using similar behaviours but reflects the level of usage that individuals need to achieve to obtain maximum benefit.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The term &#x02018;adherence&#x02019; has been defined as the extent to which individuals experience the content of a web-based intervention<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the percentage of participants who achieve the level of usage required to achieve maximum benefits.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this article, we use the latter definition when employing the term adherence.</p><p>Currently, very little is known about factors that influence mothers' level of engagement with web-based interventions as most investigations focus on general issues such as user satisfaction and improved user knowledge.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In other areas of health, it has been reported that personally tailored advice focused on current health concerns,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> level of contact with clinicians<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and level of peer support<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> may influence engagement with web-based health and lifestyle programmes. It has also been suggested that greater use should be made of information describing participants' use of web-based programmes immediately after enrolment to better predict subsequent levels of adherence and attrition.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The results of the trial will be reported in a subsequent publication. The aim of the present study was to identify factors influencing mothers' level of usage, adherence and attrition with a novel 6-month nurse-moderated web-based group intervention that provided support for mothers after the birth of their infant.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The format and content of the intervention was based on traditional face-to-face mothers' groups in Australia that provide a combination of professional and peer support for new mothers during the postnatal period. The groups are led by a nurse and include 10&#x02013;12 new mothers who meet on a weekly basis for &#x0223c;6&#x02005;weeks. The web-based format of the present intervention made it possible for mothers to participate in a nurse-led peer support group without leaving their home and for support to be provided over a longer period of time than is possible with face-to-face groups.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In this article, we initially describe mothers' level of use of the intervention during the first week (phase I), during weeks 2&#x02013;7 (phase II) and during the remainder of the intervention through to group closure at 26&#x02005;weeks (phase III). Second, we describe mothers' level of adherence during phase II of the intervention based on an expectation of weekly logins during this time, comparable to that expected with traditional face-to-face parenting groups. Third, we describe the extent to which maternal demographic and psychosocial characteristics, and mothers' website activity during phase I predicted mothers': (1) actual usage and (2) level of attrition during phases II and III. Level of attrition was measured as time elapsed before mothers ceased to login and post messages.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

During recruitment (March&#x02013;December 2013), consecutive mothers attending the clinics were approached to participate in a pragmatic preference non-inferiority randomised trial.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Full details about the trial's design are provided elsewhere.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In brief, the trial is testing the non-inferiority of outcomes for mothers and infants across two study groups. Mothers in the intervention group received a clinic-based postnatal health check plus web-based support when infants were aged 0&#x02013;6&#x02005;months. Mothers in the standard care group received usual care, comprised a standard home-based health check plus advice about the availability of community-based resources. For the purpose of the preference trial, mothers' service preferences were elicited from them at the time that they were recruited to the trial.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Mothers who expressed a &#x02018;strong preference&#x02019; for a web-based intervention or for standard care were allocated to their preferred group. Mothers without strong preferences were randomised to intervention or standard care. All mothers in the trial were assessed at preintervention when infants were &#x0003c;2&#x02005;months, and again when infants were aged 9, 15 and 21&#x02005;months. Following data collection for each assessment, mothers in the intervention and comparison groups were mailed a children's book (value approximately $15). Provided that they completed the assessment, mothers in the intervention group received the book regardless of whether or not they were continuing their involvement with the intervention.</p><p>A total of 1827 eligible mothers were identified and 819 of these agreed to participate in the trial (response rate=44.8%). This response rate is consistent with that commonly reported for randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In this article, we report observational data from mothers randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n=240) as there is less risk that unknown selection factors or biases may have influenced adherence and attrition than applied with mothers in the preference group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009967F1">figure 1</xref>).

In the first week (phase I), mothers were visited in their home by a trained research assistant and shown how to login to the intervention website. In weeks 2&#x02013;7 (phase II), the intervention followed a similar course to traditional 6-week face-to-face mothers' groups that meet weekly with a nurse during the postnatal period. During week 8 to group closure at 26&#x02005;weeks (phase III), mothers could continue to participate in the extended web-based programme at a level of their own choosing.</p><p>The web-based intervention could be accessed by study participants only, via mobile phone, tablet or computer. Groups were moderated by one of seven experienced maternal and child health nurses who had completed a purpose-designed 3-day training programme for the web-based intervention.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The same nurse moderated a group for the duration of the intervention except when on leave, in which case one of the other trained nurses would moderate the group during this time. Mothers used text-based messaging through the website to exchange information and mutual support, and to seek help from their nurse moderator when necessary. Nurses used the group format to (1) provide information directly to mothers, guided by a curriculum that mirrored information normally provided by the child health service and widely used in face-to-face parenting groups; (2) respond to questions asked by mothers; (3) correct misinformation arising during mothers' discussions&#x000a0;and (4) direct mothers to additional information within the website and via hyperlinks to other service-approved websites. On average, each group contained 12 mothers (range=9&#x02013;12).</p><p>The &#x02018;mothers&#x02019; view of the website was comprised of four components accessed by browser tabs: (1) <italic>Home group</italic>&#x02014;contained the chat room and displayed profile pictures of group members.

Nurses could direct mothers to relevant resources as required or mothers could find information themselves&#x000a0;and (4) <italic>Contacts and assistance</italic>&#x02014;contained useful contact numbers and a portal through which mothers could privately message their group's nurse.</p><p>The &#x02018;nurses&#x02019; view&#x02019; of the website was comprised three main elements: (1) <italic>Group dashboard</italic> that displayed information about individual groups such as group activities, nursing notes maintained by nurses and responses to quizzes posted by nurses to check maternal knowledge and to stimulate discussion between mothers; (2) <italic>Parent dashboard</italic> that displayed information about individual mothers, including parent case notes, individual website login activities (eg, where mothers view material but do not post a message) and notifications that mothers have added information about children's milestones and (3) <italic>Nurse dashboard</italic> that provided nurses with access to their group's chat room and also contained resources that nurses used to support their group (eg, information inserted into the group chat room such as messages, reminders and short quizzes).</p><p>The intervention website was managed by system administrators.

If a mother was logged-in but was inactive for &#x0003e;2&#x02005;hours, she was automatically logged-out to protect confidentiality. Number of logins and number of posted messages were used to assess actual usage. We also identified the number of days on which logins and messages occurred. We did this because it was possible that some mothers were automatically logged-out rather than intentionally using multiple logins on a single day. As well, this approach avoided the possibility that some mothers sent several messages on a single day and then none for several weeks. As there was little difference in the results from analyses using the total number of logins/messages and those obtained using login/message-days, only the former are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Adherence</title><p>As noted, the format and content of the intervention was based on traditional face-to-face mothers' groups. Typically such groups are held weekly for 6&#x02013;10&#x02005;weeks during the immediate postnatal period. For the purpose of analyses, in this article, we assessed the level of adherence during phase II (weeks 2&#x02013;7) of the intervention, based on an expectation that during this time mothers would login to the website once per week. It should be noted that we had no specific expectations about the frequency with which mothers should login during phase III (weeks 7&#x02013;26). As such, we do not report adherence during this period of time.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Attrition</title><p>Rate of attrition was based on the number of days from the end of the first week to the day when no login or messaging activity had been recorded for the mother for &#x0003e;30 consecutive days.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

To reduce potential bias from missing data, we used multiple imputation by chained equations in Stata V.13 (Stata Statistical Software SE. Release 13.1. College Station, Texas: Stata Corp; 2014).

This is an important issue because internet-based interventions have the potential to allow community nurses to support larger numbers of mothers during the postnatal period than is possible with face-to-face interventions. For mothers, internet-based interventions offer the added advantages that they do not have to attend meetings at fixed times at a location that may be some distance from where they live. This was noted in written comments by mothers in the present study who reported that they greatly valued the convenience of being able to access the website 24&#x02005;hours per day from their home rather than having to attend clinic-based appointments at a specific time.</p><p>In the present study, during weeks 2&#x02013;7 of the intervention, when key information and support was being provided in the early postnatal period, 44.2% of mothers logged-in weekly for at least 5 of the 6&#x02005;weeks. In the later stage of the intervention (weeks 8&#x02013;26), the median number of days during which mothers logged-in was 10&#x02005;days (ie, approximately once every 13&#x02005;days) with the median time to last login being 4.9&#x02005;months. Judging the relative success of the present intervention to engage mothers is difficult due to lack of information about engagement levels with comparable interventions delivered at a population level. In the area of mental health, engagement with online interventions has been highly variable with attrition ranging from 1 to 50% depending on the type of intervention.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In South Australia, &#x0223c;2000 mothers (10% of births per year) attend a face-to-face postnatal group.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This is substantially lower than the uptake in the current trial where 45% of mothers approached agreed to participate in the trial. Of these, the majority (60.0%) were happy to be randomised to either the internet-based intervention or standard care, while 17.2% expressed a strong preference for the internet-based intervention. There are no data on attrition levels for postnatal face-to-face groups in South Australia, but informal advice from experienced nurses suggested that of the 12 mothers who are typically enrolled in each group, &#x0223c;10 mothers (84%) attend initial meetings and 8 mothers (67%) complete the 6-week programme. If these estimates are correct, it would suggest that the attrition rates in the present intervention may have been somewhat higher than traditional face-to-face groups.</p><p>An important finding from the study was that frequency of logins and messages during the first week were stronger predictors of mothers' level of engagement with the intervention than their demographic and psychosocial characteristics, with the possible exception of satisfaction with parental role. As noted by Van Gemert-Pijnen <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> web-based interventions are readily able to monitor participants' usage patterns. Results from the present study suggest that information about mothers' early use of a web-based intervention could be employed to customise engagement protocols so that they are better tailored to the circumstances of individual mothers. In the context of a web-based parent-support programme, for example, nurses could use the information to identify mothers who do not login during their first week. They could then directly contact these mothers to identify current problems and encourage the mothers to engage with the web-based programme. This approach has the potential to enable nurses to better target this additional support to those most likely to benefit from it, rather than using a &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; approach.</p><p>It has also been noted that the vast majority of participants enrolled in web-based interventions login but do not contribute to group discussions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In this area, the level of participation of mothers with the present intervention was substantially better than that reported for web-based interventions focused on smoking cessation, problem drinking and mental health problems.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In such interventions, it has been found that &#x0223c;1% of participants contribute the vast majority of content to the interventions, 9% of participants contribute sparingly and 90% of participants read content but do not contribute to the interventions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In contrast, in the present study, of those mothers who logged-in after phase I (n=187), the top 10.2% of mothers (comprised 19 mothers, each of whom sent 54 or more messages after phase I) generated &#x0223c;42.6% of the discussion content. Fifty-two per cent (n=98) of mothers who logged-in after phase I posted messages on at least 6&#x02005;days (ie, on average, they posted one message per month) and only 8.6% of mothers read content but did not contribute to it. This is an important finding because although they may gain benefit themselves, individuals who read website content but contribute little to it add less value to a web-based intervention than those who participate actively in ongoing discussions.</p><p>There are three possible explanations for the higher level of contribution by mothers in the present intervention. First, nurses actively encouraged interaction between mothers in their groups and this may have led to greater participation by mothers. This is consistent with findings from previous studies demonstrating that increased opportunity for interaction with counsellors and more extensive dialogue support can improve engagement with web-based interventions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Second, the intervention was offered to women at a time when they experience a major role transition and it focused specifically on problems commonly experienced at this time. There is evidence from other studies that the latter is associated with level of engagement with web-based interventions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Third, the intervention provided easy access to &#x02018;just-in-time&#x02019; information for new mothers and to professional and peer support during the postnatal period. To date, social support has been used infrequently by web-based interventions, despite substantial evidence of the value attached to it by individuals with health problems and its importance for achieving behaviour change.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Finally, it is notable that 89.6% of mothers completed the 9-month follow-up assessment. This is higher than the percentage who were continuing to login to the website in the later stages of the intervention. A possible explanation is that at this stage of the intervention, mothers were using the support available at a level that fitted their needs, with most not requiring a large amount of support after the initial postnatal period. It is also possible that mothers using this approach did not consider that they had &#x02018;dropped out&#x02019; of the trial, rather they simply did not have a need for additional information at the time. Some support is available for this suggestion in qualitative comments made by mothers such as &#x02018;only logged on when I needed advice&#x02019;, &#x02018;wish I had more time for eMums&#x02019; and &#x02018;it was a quick and easy way to get information and/or reassurance [when required]&#x02019;. Alternatively, mothers may have preferred to obtain support from other sources because the intervention was no longer addressing their needs. However, this latter explanation seems less plausible and is also not consistent with the high follow-up response rate and the many positive written comments provided by mothers at the 9-month follow-up assessment.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of the study are its use of objective data on adherence and attrition obtained during the course of an online intervention that was delivered as part of routine community-based service delivery in the health system. Furthermore, the pattern of results was similar for mothers randomly assigned to the intervention and those assigned to the intervention on the basis of their expressed preference. This similarity increases the likelihood that results would apply generally to mothers using a similar nurse-moderated web-based group intervention during the postnatal period. Potential limitations include evidence that participating mothers were from a somewhat more socially advantaged group. However, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data show that 44% of Australians aged 25&#x02013;34 have tertiary qualifications compared with 50.7% of participants in this study, suggesting that participating mothers may not be greatly more advantaged than the general population.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Nurse-moderated web-based group interventions have the potential to provide information and support to new mothers during the postnatal period.
