Provision for those with dementia and hip fracture has specific and growing importance. Older people who break their hip are recognised as exceptionally vulnerable to experiencing confusion (including but not exclusively, dementia and/or delirium and/or cognitive impairment(s)) before, during or after acute admissions. Older people experiencing hip fracture and confusion risk serious complications, linked to delayed recovery and higher mortality post-operatively. Specific care pathways acknowledging the differences in patient presentation and care needs are proposed to improve clinical and process outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This protocol describes a multi-centre, feasibility, cluster-randomised, controlled trial (CRCT) to be undertaken across ten National Health Service hospital trusts in the UK. The trial will explore the feasibility of undertaking a CRCT comparing the multicomponent PERFECTED enhanced recovery intervention (PERFECT-ER), which acknowledges the differences in care needs of confused older patients experiencing hip fracture, with standard care. The trial will also have an integrated process evaluation to explore how PERFECT-ER is implemented and interacts with the local context. The study will recruit 400 hip fracture patients identified as experiencing confusion and will also recruit &#x0201c;suitable informants&#x0201d; (individuals in regular contact with participants who will complete proxy measures). We will also recruit NHS professionals for the process evaluation. This mixed methods design will produce data to inform a definitive evaluation of the intervention via a large-scale pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The trial will provide a preliminary estimate of potential efficacy of PERFECT-ER versus standard care; assess service delivery variation, inform primary and secondary outcome selection, generate estimates of recruitment and retention rates, data collection difficulties, and completeness of outcome data and provide an indication of potential economic benefits.

It is estimated that more than 1.2 million individuals worldwide suffer hip fracture annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a total expected to surpass 6 million by the year 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hip fracture has a substantial impact on the health, wellbeing and independence of patients and their families. It also generates high costs for health and social care systems; for example the impact on the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is estimated at &#x000a3;2 billion per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the first 12&#x000a0;months post-fracture, patients are at increased risk of functional decline, admission to long-term care institutions and higher mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Over 40% of people with hip fracture have dementia or cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This can impact on rehabilitation and recovery following hip surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Pre-existing &#x0201c;confusion&#x0201d; (including, but not exclusively, dementia and/or delirium) has been associated with greater risk of postoperative complications such as pressure ulcers and chest infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. People who are confused may also find it more difficult to express pain and discomfort, making the assessment of these conditions more challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The risk of confusion is of particular concern for people admitted to acute setting with prior memory difficulties and can have a more serious impact on their daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Confusion can compromise a patient&#x02019;s ability to engage and progress with postoperative hip fracture rehabilitation. There is currently little evidence to guide practitioners to choose the care and rehabilitation interventions that will achieve the best outcomes for confused older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This has led to calls for patients with hip fracture experiencing confusion to have a specific treatment pathway, to acknowledge the differences in presentation and care needs.</p><p id="Par32">A specified process of &#x0201c;enhanced recovery&#x0201d; has been used in UK health services since the early 2000s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Enhanced recovery pathways (ERP) are becoming standard practice for many elective surgical operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Enhanced recovery practices rely upon integrated, multi-modal, evidence-based approaches that aim to enable patients to recover and leave hospital sooner after surgery. Whilst embedded in many elective practices, it has not been standard to take an enhanced recovery approach in treating acute hip fracture.</p><p id="Par33">The National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) was developed and launched by the Royal College of Physicians as part of their &#x0201c;Falls and Fragility Fracture programme&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The NHFD is web-based and requires data to be entered on auditable aspects of the care delivered to every patient with hip fracture across Northern Ireland, Wales and England. It integrates nationally agreed standards for the management of patients aged 60&#x000a0;years or older as set by the British Orthopaedic Association, British Geriatrics Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline. NHFD data support a system of &#x0201c;payment by results&#x0201d; in England and Wales known as the Best Practice Tariff (BPT). Findings on the impact of the NHFD and BPT have demonstrated improved outcomes via the co-management of patients by consultant geriatrician and orthopaedic surgeon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a reduction in mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and decreased time to surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although not delineated in relation to how care could/should be delivered to patients with hip fracture experiencing confusion, these studies do suggest that multicomponent care interventions can improve a range of patient and clinical outcomes. Internationally, the picture is similar. Interventions show potential but do not provide guidance on the best methods of delivering care to older confused patients with hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, answers to core questions remain relating to the best types of preoperative, postoperative and rehabilitation approaches for hip fracture care for patients experiencing confusion, and how such pathways can be delivered.</p><p id="Par34">To address this global priority, a multicomponent intervention was developed as part of the &#x0201c;Peri-operative enhanced recovery hip fracture care of patients with dementia&#x0201d; (PERFECTED) research programme. PERFECTED encompassed several iterative and sequential sub-studies (&#x0201c;Care delivery in acute hospital settings: an observational study&#x0201d; UKCRN ID 16998, REC: 14/EM/1020, &#x0201c;Caring for patients with hip fracture and memory difficulties&#x0201d; (UKCRN ID 18281, REC: 15/EE/0007) and &#x0201c;Implementing the optimisation of hospital care delivery to older adults by NHS staff via action research methodology&#x0201d; (UKCRN ID 179797, REC: 15/SC/0294)). The PERFECTED enhanced recovery intervention (henceforth PERFECT-ER) was developed in accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and aims to enhance recovery of patients with hip fracture experiencing confusion (including presumed dementia and/or other cognitive impairments such as delirium). The objective of the current study is to explore potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PERFECT-ER versus standard care in older patients with hip fracture who are experiencing confusion. The study&#x02019;s ultimate objective is to inform a definitive evaluation of PERFECT-ER via a large-scale pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT). The protocol format is guided by the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension to cluster-randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par35">The aim of this study is to test trial and intervention feasibility to inform a definitive trial.

In line with MRC guidance for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], an integrated multimethod multi-perspective (patients, suitable informants (defined as individuals with regular contact who are prepared to complete proxy measures) and NHS professionals) process evaluation will be conducted. This will explore variations in implementation fidelity, dose and reach. Trial hospitals will be randomised to active or control arm within geographical region using a simple randomisation process. An ad hoc programme will be written in SAS to carry out this procedure (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> Randomization overview). The nature of PERFECT-ER means that patients, suitable informants and staff delivering treatments cannot be masked to the trial arm. Accordingly, this is an open unblinded trial. Statistical analysis will be undertaken by a subgroup-blind approach, blinded to trial arm and cluster.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Randomisation overview; we will recruit ten hospitals across five separate geographical UK regions.

It comprises of the PERFECT-ER checklist, which synthesizes best practice evidence of hospital-based dementia care delivery with current best practice evidence of the admission, preoperative, postoperative, rehabilitation and discharge management of hip fractures, agents of change (described below) and a model for change (plan-do-study-act). The checklist, consisting of patient-level and organizational-level care elements, is designed to overlay existing hip fracture pathways highlighting areas to improve care delivery to patients experiencing confusion. PERFECT-ER has been developed, piloted and refined in earlier PERFECTED work packages in partnership with a range of stakeholders in diverse development sites. As the current paper is reporting the protocol for a feasibility study the intervention is understandably not yet in the public domain.</p><p id="Par66">Sites allocated to the active arm will be given PERFECT-ER 3&#x000a0;months before recruitment begins and resourced to support the implementation of PERFECT-ER using the NHS Service Improvement (plan-do-study-act) methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

This will allow comparison of hospital-service use data from both sources. Findings from this collection and from the process evaluation workstream will also be used to explore the feasibility of collecting hospital service-use and cost data from routine sources. For patients cared for in English trusts, we will also collect data made available via the NHFD. Findings will also be used to explore the feasibility of economic data collection. We will interrogate these data to test for differences between participating hospitals to inform later generalisability.

The process evaluation will aim to determine how, and under what circumstances, PERFECT-ER is implemented in each site and to examine how, and under what circumstances, implementing PERFECT-ER impacts on staff practices and perceptions, resource use, and patient and suitable informant outcomes. Learning from initial piloting of PERFECT-ER and its implementation mechanisms (PERFECTED WP2: Implementing the optimisation of hospital care delivery to older adults by NHS staff via action research methodology) will be used to inform procedures for collecting quantitative and qualitative data to inform the process evaluation. This data set will comprise PERFECT-ER checklist scores and SIL-generated reports and action plans. We will also undertake semi-structured interviews with patients (where appropriate) and suitable informants with experience of PERFECT-ER care delivery (25 patients and 25 suitable informants, 5 per population per active site). Interviews with patients will take place at their place of residence at the time (hospital, rehabilitation unit, care home or patient&#x02019;s home). Locations and mode (face-to-face or telephone) of semi-structured interviews with suitable informants will be organised on a case-by-case basis sensitive to individual preference. Public patient involvement (PPI) is a central part of the PERFECTED programme. PPI colleagues are experts by experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. They will receive training and assist in co-interviewing of suitable informants alongside academic researchers on a case-by-case basis.</p><p id="Par79">Additionally, interviews and focus groups will be held with NHS professionals involved in ward-level and strategic implementation of PERFECT-ER. This research will also explore the economic aspects of caring for people who are confused and have hip fracture (for instance, to understand how time is used to provide appropriate care to this patient group). In addition, we will look at the feasibility of collecting detailed patient-level costing information (e.g. patient-specific nursing time, laboratory tests) from administrative systems in each site, mapping the availability of information based on correspondence with hospital administrators/finance officers and a documentary analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par80">The target sample size is 400 patient participants (200 per arm).

Their data will be used to estimate the intra-class correlation coefficient for each outcome measure. Assuming a coefficient of no more than 0.1, 400 participants from 10 centres should provide a standard error no greater than 0.041, providing a basis for a definitive trial sample size.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Quantitative analysis</title><p id="Par81">Data from the trial will be analysed and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Between-treatment-arm effects will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. There are no plans for imputing missing data and thus analyses will be on a complete-case basis only. No subgroup analyses are planned. In the light of new information, should it be decided during the course of the trial that a subgroup analysis is appropriate, this will be recorded in the statistical analysis plan prior to any data analyses. There will be no formal interim analysis. Deaths, falls, pressure ulcers, admissions to long-term residential care and safeguarding incidents are expected in this patient population. These rates will be collected at ward level throughout the study period. Analysis of recruitment rates, patient participant (including mortality) and suitable informant withdrawal rates will also be reviewed. Based on the data collected from this study, a formal sample size calculation will be carried out to inform a future, definitive trial.</p><p id="Par82">Health and social care costs will be calculated drawing on the trial data, attaching unit costs from published sources to quantities of service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The additional resource use associated with the intervention will be examined over the period of the trial by tracking potential indicators of impact, such as patient time spent in the anaesthetic room (i.e. this could change because relatives are encouraged to stay with the patient as part of the enhanced recovery checklist). SIL salary costs, on-costs and overheads will be estimated in order calculate their contribution to the costs of participants&#x02019; index hospital stays. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be from two perspectives - health and social care and societal. We will analyse outcomes including Bristol Activities for Daily Living Scale (BADLS) (patients) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain (for patients and carers). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be computed and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves generated to examine the probability of cost-effectiveness over a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds for each outcome. Multivariate analyses of costs and outcomes appropriate for the clustered-randomised trial design will control for centre, baseline outcome measures or costs, and other confounders. We will compare results of analyses using societal, patient and carer weights for QALYs generated from DEMQOL-proxy, and different approaches to valuing unpaid care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

This study will examine the feasibility, acceptability and economic consequences of a complex intervention aiming to optimise care delivery to older patients with hip fracture experiencing confusion. The study&#x02019;s findings will be used to build evidence to propose a definitive evaluation of the intervention through a large-scale pragmatic RCT.</p><p id="Par85">We have used the term &#x0201c;confusion&#x0201d; in order to reflect the real-world complexity of the acute hospital environment into which PERFECT-ER will be introduced. Informed by clinical knowledge and learning from the previous stages of our research, we note that PERFECT-ER may improve care delivery to patients with presumed dementia and other cognitive impairments such as delirium. For PERFECT-ER to make a positive impact on the care of older confused adults, it needs a broad approach. The majority of patients admitted with hip fracture who are experiencing confusion do not arrive with a confirmed dementia diagnosis. We will include confused patients (with known or presumed dementia and/or delirium and/or cognitive impairment(s)) of any severity, who incur a fractured hip, admitted from any setting. Presence of dementia and sub-type of dementia will be defined from medical notes at time-1 follow up.</p><p id="Par86">The target patient group does present practical and operational challenges, particularly for gaining consent and accessing patients during follow up at their place of residence. Given the cognitive impairment of the patient participants, some outcome measures must be completed by proxy using suitable informants. We can anticipate a number of challenges. It may be difficult to locate suitable informants in a timely manner and to maintain contact with them over the follow-up period. An informant might be providing substantial support to a confused older person with hip fracture and could feel disinclined to participate in the research. Significant challenges to both evaluation and implementation may arise. The nature of the intervention is complex and the acute hospital ward environment into which PERFECT-ER will be introduced is high-pressured and ever-changing. Such challenges provide additional justification for the current feasibility study and multimethod, multi-perspective process evaluation. The findings will inform the development of a future large-scale pragmatic definitive RCT and help to guide the worldwide delivery of care to older patients experiencing hip fracture and confusion. Findings will be published in high-quality academic journals and at high-impact academic conferences. Dissemination to clinical and service user stakeholders will take many forms; these include via the programme&#x02019;s social media channels and website and the investigators&#x02019; networks including those with local and national user groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par87">This trial is currently ongoing and open to recruitment.
