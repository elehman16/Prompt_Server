The 3-year interim results of a randomised study comparing both the efficacy and safety of LARS and esomeprazole (ESO) are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>LOTUS is an open, parallel-group multicentre, randomised and controlled trial conducted in dedicated centres in 11 European countries. LARS was completed according to a standardised protocol, comprising a total fundoplication and a crural repair. Medical treatment comprised ESO 20 mg once daily, which could be increased stepwise to 40 mg once daily and then 20 mg twice daily in the case of incomplete GORD control. The primary outcome variable was time to treatment failure (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis). Treatment failure was defined on the basis of symptomatic relapse requiring treatment beyond that stated in the protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>554 patients were randomised, of whom 288 were allocated to LARS and 266 to ESO. The two study arms were well matched. The proportions of patients who remained in remission after 3 years were similar for the two therapies: 90% of surgical patients compared with 93% medically treated for the intention to treat population, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25 (90% vs 95% per protocol). No major unexpected postoperative complications were experienced and ESO was well tolerated. However, postfundoplication complaints remain a problem after LARS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Over the first 3 years of this long-term study, both laparoscopic total fundoplication and continuous ESO treatment were similarly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic strategies for providing effective control of GORD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>During recent years, there has been some debate as to the relative value of long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment compared with antireflux surgery for the management of chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The suboptimal level of health-related quality of life in patients with GORD illustrates the importance of prompt and aggressive treatment when the disease manifestations are not fully under control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref></p><p>With the introduction by Nissen of the fundoplication procedure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> this operation has been found to be effective and widely used throughout different parts of the world, although there are concerns relating to the safety of the procedure per se, and the mechanical side effects and durability of the antireflux repair in particular.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Although the perioperative and postoperative courses have been facilitated by the introduction of the laparoscopic technology,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> the results in community practice remain far from optimal, and data on the long-term efficacy of standardised laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) are lacking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> The poor therapeutic results in community practice may be due to variability in procedures or lack of experience of the surgeons, so there is a need to standardise and monitor the surgical procedures.</p><p>In a recently published study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> open antireflux surgery and medical treatment in the form of daily omeprazole treatment were compared in patients with reflux oesophagitis. After 7 years of follow-up, more patients could be kept in clinical remission after an operation. However, it is noteworthy that over time, a continuously increasing number of patients allocated to antireflux surgery, carried out at the discretion of the individual surgeon, were scored as treatment failures. A high proportion of surgical patients needed additional PPI treatment, and only 60% in those were kept in remission at 7 years. In the omeprazole arm, fewer than 50% remained in remission despite escalation of the drug dose over time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></p><p>With the improved pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the stereoisomer of omeprazole (esomeprazole), medical treatment today for GORD incorporates a more predictable and sustained level of acid inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> The clinical implication of this is that larger proportions of patients can have symptoms controlled and the oesophagitis healed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></p><p>In expert centres the laparoscopic approach to antireflux surgery predominates. The question therefore arises as to how laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, carried out according to a standardised protocol in dedicated surgical centres, compares with updated medical treatment for GORD. We hereby present the 3-year efficacy results of a randomised and standardised long-term comparison of LARS with esomeprazole treatment in patients with chronic GORD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this randomised open, parallel group, multicentre study was to compare the efficacy of long-term medical treatment with that of LARS in patients with chronic GORD, assessed through endoscopy, 24 h pH-metry and symptom response to esomeprazole. The participating centres had to be either academic units or affiliated to a University, and each operation had to be carried out or supervised in a standardised way<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> by a consultant surgeon who specialised in this type of laparoscopic upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Patients with a history of oesophageal, gastric or duodenal surgery, current or historical evidence of Zollinger&#x02013;Ellison syndrome, primary oesophageal disorders (achalasia, schleroderma and primary oesophageal spasm), inflammatory bowel disease, dysplastic changes in a columnar-lined oesophagus or any condition associated with abnormal absorption from the GI tract were excluded from the study, as were patients with any other significant concomitant disease. Patients with potential for poor compliance were also excluded at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>We applied a 3-month run-in period, which allowed baseline recordings and medical treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily, to verify symptom response and healing of oesophagitis. After that, patients were randomised in blocks of four to either surgery or maintenance medical treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg once daily. The randomised design was selected to avoid bias in the selection of patients for medical or surgical treatment. All patients were eligible for either LARS or medical treatment, and their oesophagitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> had to be no more than Los Angeles (LA) grade B at the time of randomisation, and GORD symptoms no more than mild. The local ethics committees approved the trial protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study schedule and measurements</title><p>The study schedule and principal measurements are summarised in detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="GUT-57-09-1207-t01">table 1</xref>. After Visit 1, when all patients had their baseline recording completed, they attended an &#x0201c;Investigational week&#x0201d;. If the patients had not taken PPIs during 7 days prior to Visit 1, they could start the investigational week immediately, which included endoscopy, biopsy sampling (oesophagus, Z-line, gastric antrum and corpus), laboratory screening and 24 h pH-metry with manometry and symptom association probability (SAP). <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> status was assessed in biopsy material from the antral and corpus parts of the stomach and, if clinically feasible, was to remain unchanged (ie, no eradication treatment) during the study period. This decision was taken because additional controlled data on the safety of profound and long-term acid inhibition on the morphology of the gastric mucosa seemed warranted, well aware of the current recommendations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> In addition this design allowed us to evaluate further the eventual effect of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection on the subsequent clinical course.</p><table-wrap id="GUT-57-09-1207-t01" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Study schedule and procedures</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup

the investigational endoscopy. If LA grade C/D oesophagitis was present at the investigational endoscopy, patients had a further endoscopic examination at Visit 4 following PPI treatment. If randomised to medical treatment, it started with esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, but the dose could be adjusted to 40 mg once daily after 8 weeks if symptoms were not controlled, and then to 20 mg twice a day for a further 8 weeks. If the patient was not controlled on this dose, this constituted treatment failure. If the dose was sufficient, one attempt was made to titrate the dose downwards but otherwise the patient remained on the higher dose.</p><p>Surgery had to be performed within 3 months of randomisation, using a laparoscopic approach, and consisted of a crural repair and the creation of a short floppy total fundoplication. Full details of the operative procedure and the perioperative/postoperative outcomes of this standardised procedure have been described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> Only surgical patients were required to attend Visits 5 (for surgery) and 6 (1 month postoperatively). Visit 7 took place 6 months after randomisation and, thereafter, clinic visits took place 6 monthly.</p><p>Follow-up endoscopy was planned at 1 and 3 years. At endoscopy, the oesophagus, cardiac region, stomach and duodenum were examined and biopsies were repeated. If there was any suspicion of Barrett&#x02019;s oesophagus or malignancy, additional biopsies were taken.</p><p>Symptoms related to GORD were assessed at every visit (except after surgery). The investigator (in the case of LARS if possible a gastroenterologist and, after esomeprazole, a surgeon) asked standardised questions about heartburn, acid regurgitation and dysphagia severity. In addition, patients were asked about other GI symptoms including epigastric pain, flatulence, bloating, diarrhoea, ability to vomit and ability to belch. Quality of life (QoL) and patient-reported symptoms were assessed by administering the validated QOLRAD (quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia) and GSRS (gastrointestinal symptom rating scale) questionnaires<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> to patients at randomisation and annually thereafter. The translations of the questionnaires into different languages were done according to proposed guidelines and involved several independent translators.</p><p>During the follow-up period, patients in both treatment arms with moderate to severe recurrent GORD symptoms during at least three consecutive days were instructed to contact the clinic. They were then questioned about their treatment failure and offered an endoscopy (see following section).</p><p>Safety of treatments was assessed by comparing laboratory screening and histological parameters prerandomisation and after 1 and 3 years, and by recording serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study and those adverse events causing premature discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment end points and statistical analyses</title><p>The main analyses were conducted using the intention to treat (ITT) population that included all randomised patients. A per protocol (PP) analysis was also performed on the primary efficacy data, and this included all randomised patients except those with major protocol violations. The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and from whom postdose data were available.</p><p>The primary end point in this study was time to treatment failure, defined as follows for the two study treatments.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>In the medical arm</title><p>The need for escalation in treatment for control of reflux disease was assessed at clinic visits by asking the question &#x0201c;Do you have sufficient control of your heartburn and acid regurgitation?&#x0201d; If the answer was no, and the patient stated a need for other regular medical treatment, the dose of esomeprazole was increased to 40 mg once daily for 8 weeks and could be adjusted to 20 mg twice a day for a further 8 weeks if symptoms had not resolved (24 h pH-metry and SAP were mandatory prior to a dose increase in esomeprazole-treated patients). If this proved insufficient to control symptoms, the patient was classified as a &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>In the surgical arm</title><p>The same questions were asked at clinic visits about symptom control in the surgical arm and if the answer was no and again backed up by the need for regular drug treatment (regular antisecretory drugs to control GORD symptoms, ie, &#x02a7e;4 weeks), the patient was classified as a &#x0201c;treatment failure&#x0201d;. The patient was also classified as a treatment failure if there were postoperative complaints requiring medical action, perioperative death, postoperative death within 30 days after surgery, dysphagia requiring further treatment, or any other requirement to reoperate for symptom control. In the case of functional oesophageal stenosis, one dilatation was allowed.</p><p>The outcome of the primary end point, time to treatment failure, is illustrated graphically by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier remission curves in fig 2. These were compared statistically using the log rank test. In a post hoc analysis, mean scores of GI symptoms (none&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, mild&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1, moderate&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2 and severe symptoms&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) from 6 months to 3 years were compared using a two-sided, two sample t test.

The demographic details and GORD disease history for patients in each treatment group are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="GUT-57-09-1207-t02">table 2</xref>. The two groups were well matched with regard to both their demographics and their history of GORD and current symptoms. The mean age was 45 years in both groups and the majority were male (69% and 75% for surgery and medical, respectively). Although around 30% in each group had a rather short history of verified reflux disease (&#x0003c;1 year), only 3% had a history of symptoms of less than 1 year and fewer than 4% of the patients presented with severe (LA grade C/D) oesophagitis. Around 40% in each group complained of moderate to severe heartburn, and around 30% of moderate to severe regurgitation at entry. Endoscopically suspected oesophageal metaplasia (defined as columnar metaplasia, whatever type, above the gastro-oesophageal junction) was diagnosed in 10.4% of surgical patients and in 9.4% of medical patients at entry.

There were differences between the groups in relation to the outcome of other GI symptoms, severity of persistent reflux symptoms and overall vitality. In the surgical arm, the level of reflux symptom control, as also reflected in some QOLRAD dimensions, was somewhat better than on long-term medical treatment. This was, however, counterbalanced in the surgical group by those patients who suffered slightly more GI symptoms of a postfundoplication nature, such as abdominal pain and other functional symptoms. Postfundoplication problems are often regarded as a major stumbling block in the surgical approach to treating GORD but, within this trial, their frequency and degree were minimal, despite well-structured follow-up specifically designed to detect such problems. The success of both surgical and medical treatment arms, with 90% and 93% complete remission of symptoms, respectively (based on a strict definition of treatment failure), indicates that both treatments were highly effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref></p><p>Our outcome data show dysphagia rates that differ only slightly after surgery compared with medical treatment.

A similar trial comparing open ARS with the first generation of PPIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> showed a lower degree of improvement in &#x0201c;like for like&#x0201d; symptom analyses. However, despite the similarities in design and outcome assessments, corresponding comparisons should be interpreted with caution. The current surgical outcomes when compared with previous studies could be due to a number of factors. First, we believe that the standardisation of the surgical technique within this trial is unique and not only contributes to the improved outcomes, but also shows that the actual operative techniques and details can be disseminated widely. As a consequence of this standardisation, all hiatal hernias were fully reduced and a crural repair was achieved to retain this anatomical correction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> A second factor that may have contributed to the quality of the surgical results is the selection of centres with high volume and surgeons with established experience. Within each country such teams should be able to provide this quality in routine clinical practice. Thirdly, the laparoscopic technique may not only be superior to previous open techniques,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> but may also lend itself to critical review by the whole team, who can view (and record) the operation in all of its detail.</p><p>When considering medical treatment for GORD, there is a rationale for reliable and regular acid control for greater consistency in therapeutic response across the GORD population. The improved levels of acid inhibition and minimal side effects associated with the use of esomeprazole, irrespective of the severity of the GORD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> most probably contributed to the outcome in the present study.</p><p>Both treatments were well tolerated and there were no safety concerns after 3 years of follow-up. Surgery has become safer with the introduction of laparoscopy, minimising complication risks (3% in this trial)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and reducing the need for<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> repair of subsequent incisional hernia (1% seen in this study so far).
