The phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast has been shown to provide small but significant improvements in dyspnea, as measured by the transition dyspnea index (TDI), in two 1-year studies in patients with severe to very severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>To provide a more comprehensive assessment of the impact of roflumilast on dyspnea, post hoc analyses of four 1-year roflumilast studies (M2-111, M2-112, M2-124, and M2-125) in patients with moderate to very severe COPD were conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this pooled analysis (N=5,595), roflumilast significantly improved TDI focal scores versus placebo at week 52 (treatment difference, 0.327; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Roflumilast was associated with significantly greater TDI responders and significantly fewer TDI deteriorators (&#x02265;1-unit increase or decrease from baseline, respectively) versus placebo at week 52 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, both); these significant differences were apparent by week 8 and maintained until study end (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, all). At study end, the postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second improvement in TDI responders was significantly greater with roflumilast versus placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Similar to the overall population, improvements in TDI focal scores at week 52 were small but consistently significant over placebo in patients with chronic bronchitis, regardless of exacerbation history, concomitant treatment with short-acting muscarinic antagonists or long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, or pretreatment with inhaled corticosteroids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis shows that patients treated with roflumilast to reduce exacerbation risk may also experience small but significant improvements in dyspnea, with accompanying improvements in lung function.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>breathlessness</kwd><kwd>lung function</kwd><kwd>subgroup analyses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current recommended treatment goals for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include reduction of breathlessness, improvement of exercise capacity and health status, and prevention of exacerbations.<xref rid="b1-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As dyspnea is a predominant symptom of COPD, an appreciation of impaired lung function and breathlessness severity may better reflect the impact of treatment.<xref rid="b1-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While treatment guidelines recommend a relatively simple approach to evaluating dyspnea (ie, modified Medical Research Council Scale<xref rid="b1-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), more sophisticated tools exist to assess breathlessness in more detail.<xref rid="b2-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> One example is the transition dyspnea index (TDI),<xref rid="b4-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> a validated tool that assesses the impact of a patient&#x02019;s daily activities on breathlessness.<xref rid="b5-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It has been shown to reliably denote distinct changes in breathing difficulty due to therapeutic intervention.<xref rid="b6-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The phosphosdiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast, approved to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations, has been shown to reduce markers of inflammation in COPD patient airways.<xref rid="b11-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As breathlessness is thought to arise primarily from mechanical limitation of inspiratory effort,<xref rid="b12-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we wondered whether an agent with potential anti-inflammatory activities like roflumilast would impact dyspnea.

Thus, to more comprehensively evaluate the impact of roflumilast on breathlessness, including any potential relationship with lung function improvement, individual and pooled analyses of four 1-year clinical studies with roflumilast are presented here.

Similarly, in M2-111 and M2-112, the proportions of patients who received concomitant ICS or LABA were comparable in both roflumilast (61% and 8%, respectively) and placebo (60% and 9%, respectively) groups. For the overall pooled population, patient demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-9-657">Table 1</xref>). Of randomized patients who took &#x02265;1 dose of study medication, 1,921/2,864 (67.1%) and 2,083/2,913 (71.5%) patients completed the trials in the roflumilast and placebo groups, respectively.</p><p>At week 52, roflumilast significantly improved mean TDI focal score versus placebo (roflumilast, 0.368; placebo, 0.041; difference [95% confidence interval {CI}], 0.327 [0.166&#x02013;0.488]; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). Between-group differences in TDI focal score for the pooled population were similar to those in the individual studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-9-657">Figure 1A</xref>) and generally favored roflumilast.

At week 52, roflumilast-treated patients were more likely to demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in TDI than placebo-treated patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-9-657">Figure 1B</xref>); generally similar results were observed in the individual trials.

In the overall population, the proportion of patients who achieved the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 100 mL in FEV<sub>1</sub> (ie, FEV<sub>1</sub> responders) was significantly greater with roflumilast versus placebo by week 4, which was maintained until study end (all, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-copd-9-657">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Among TDI responders, roflumilast led to significantly higher percentages of patients who achieved MCID in FEV<sub>1</sub> (36%) versus placebo (29%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) at study end. Furthermore, the magnitude of FEV<sub>1</sub> improvement was significantly greater with roflumilast versus placebo in both TDI responders (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and nonresponders (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-9-657">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with this observed treatment effect in the magnitude of FEV<sub>1</sub> improvement with roflumilast in both TDI responders and nonresponders, a greater proportion of patients treated with roflumilast versus placebo demonstrated improvements from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub>, a treatment effect (ie, shift to the right in favor of roflumilast) also observed in both TDI responders and nonresponders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-copd-9-657">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, as the roflumilast curve is generally above that of placebo across the positive x-axis in both TDI responders and nonresponders, there were also a greater percentage of roflumilast-treated patients than placebo-treated patients for most levels of positive FEV<sub>1</sub> change from baseline.</p><p>Further analysis of the pooled ITT population revealed that particular baseline characteristics were associated with a significantly greater percentage of TDI responders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-9-657">Table 2</xref>). These characteristics included being a former smoker (versus current), no concomitant use of LABAs or SAMAs (versus with), and no concomitant or pre-ICS use (versus with). To further analyze whether patient characteristics such as chronic bronchitis, history of exacerbations, or concomitant medications had an effect on TDI response, six subpopulations were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-copd-9-657">Figure 6</xref>). In COPD patients with chronic bronchitis, roflumilast significantly improved TDI focal scores versus placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) regardless of exacerbation history, concomitant treatment with SAMA or LABA, or pretreatment with ICS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-9-657">Table 3</xref>). In the patient subpopulation treated with concomitant ICS, roflumilast was associated with significantly less deterioration in TDI focal score versus placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.0114).

In comparison, more roflumilast-treated patients achieved the TDI focal score MCID at week 4 compared with placebo; however, this difference did not reach significance until week 8, at which point it was maintained until study end. Together, these time courses suggest that significant lung function improvements may be observed earlier than significant dyspnea improvements. The mechanisms by which roflumilast may lead to improved airflow are not fully defined, but an anti-inflammatory effect has been suggested.<xref rid="b11-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b28-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Similar to results in the overall population, improvements in TDI focal scores at study end were small but consistently significant over placebo in patients with chronic bronchitis, regardless of exacerbation history, concomitant SAMA or LABA treatment, or ICS pretreatment. Although greater proportions of TDI responders were observed with roflumilast versus placebo in the subgroups of patients receiving concomitant ICS, LABA, or SAMA treatment throughout the treatment period, these differences were not significant at every study visit. In contrast, significantly greater percentages of TDI responders were consistently observed with roflumilast versus placebo from treatment weeks 8 through 52 in patients with chronic bronchitis, a history of exacerbations, and ICS pretreatment.</p><p>Consistent with the results presented here, a 6-month placebo-controlled study examining the effects of roflumilast in patients with moderate to severe COPD and chronic bronchitis who were already being treated with tiotropium demonstrated that significantly more roflumilast+tiotropium patients achieved clinically meaningful improvements in TDI focal score compared with placebo+tiotropium patients,<xref rid="b29-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> with a between-group difference (0.4 units) that was generally similar to that reported in the current analysis. In addition, compared with placebo, significantly more patients receiving roflumilast+tiotropium in the 6-month study<xref rid="b29-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> achieved clinically meaningful differences in an instrument that assessed dyspnea associated with specific activities of daily living, the University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (SOBQ),<xref rid="b30-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> further demonstrating the positive impact of roflumilast treatment on breathlessness. Numerical improvements in TDI focal scores were also observed with the addition of roflumilast to salmeterol in a separate 6-month study in patients with moderate to severe COPD; however, these differences were not significantly different from patients treated with salmeterol and placebo (treatment difference of 0.1 unit).<xref rid="b31-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It is of note that the inclusion criteria for the roflumilast+tiotropium trial (ie, chronic cough and sputum production and frequent use of short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists during the run-in period while being treated with tiotropium &#x02265;3 months prior to study enrollment) led to the recruitment of more symptomatic patients compared with patients recruited in the roflumilast+salmeterol trial. As such, the variation in the magnitude of treatment effect of roflumilast on dyspnea in tiotropium-treated patients versus salmeterol-treated patients may have been due to these differences in patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics between the two studies. Inclusion of both of these 6-month roflumilast trials in a recent meta-analysis by Pan et al<xref rid="b32-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> demonstrated a moderate but significant increase in TDI focal scores with roflumilast (weighted mean difference of 0.30 units; 95% CI, 0.14&#x02013;0.46), similar to what was reported in the current analysis that focused on 1-year studies alone.</p><p>Increased dyspnea is strongly associated with reduced quality of life in COPD patients.<xref rid="b33-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In M2-111, the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ),<xref rid="b35-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> a disease-specific quality of life instrument that assesses causes and impacts of dyspnea, was used to evaluate health status. Compared with placebo at week 52, roflumilast provided moderate but significant improvements in SGRQ total score, and a significantly greater percentage of patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in SGRQ with roflumilast (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 for both).<xref rid="b36-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Furthermore, pooled data in patients with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema (M2-111 and M2-112) demonstrated a significant difference in SGRQ total score improvement versus placebo after 52 weeks of treatment.<xref rid="b15-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This suggests that roflumilast may similarly provide clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life in some COPD patients, possibly due to a reduction of breathlessness.</p><p>Several limitations of the present analysis should be noted. As all analyses were performed post hoc, and the included component studies were not designed to detect clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution and used primarily to generate hypotheses for future studies. Findings may not be generalizable to all patients with COPD, as inclusion criteria for each individual study contributing to this pooled analysis may have excluded patients typically seen in clinical practice. The use of LOCF in the current analysis may not have taken into account missing data that were nonrandom (ie, treatment-related discontinuations). The average placebo-adjusted improvements in dyspnea observed in the analyses presented here were small in magnitude; however, patients who improved their TDI focal score by &#x02265;1 unit were observed with roflumilast treatment throughout the studies, suggesting that some patients treated with roflumilast may experience clinically meaningful improvements in breathlessness. Furthermore, the studies included in this analysis were only 1 year in duration. Since worsened breathlessness has been associated with an increased risk for COPD exacerbations,<xref rid="b37-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and the effects of roflumilast on dyspnea may be related to a reduction in exacerbation rates, it is possible that longer studies in which more exacerbations would be prevented with roflumilast may enable observation of greater magnitudes of dyspnea improvement. As two of the four studies included in this pooled analysis had a population enriched with patients with a history of exacerbations, it is unclear whether COPD patients with chronic bronchitis who are frequent exacerbators would experience greater improvements in breathlessness compared with non-exacerbators.</p><p>Finally, this analysis was based on monotherapy trials that limited concomitant use of medications commonly used to treat COPD, such as fixed-dose ICS/LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, or theophylline. While data derived from subgroups of patients who were pretreated with ICS or who received concomitant SAMA, LABA, or ICS treatment during the studies can be suggestive of potential treatment combinations, this may not be directly applicable to patients who are simultaneously prescribed multiple medications to manage their COPD.<xref rid="b38-copd-9-657" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, these results further explore the effects of roflumilast on breathlessness, demonstrating small but generally consistent improvements in dyspnea with roflumilast treatment over placebo. Furthermore, patients that had reduced breathlessness also experienced accompanying improvements in lung function. Patients being treated with roflumilast to reduce their risk of exacerbations may also experience reduced dyspnea, regardless of patient characteristics such as chronic bronchitis, history of exacerbations, or previous (ICS) or concomitant (SAMA, LABA, or ICS) treatment. The added benefit of reducing breathlessness with roflumilast treatment, although small in magnitude, may provide an added value to consider in the use of this phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in the management of COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-copd-9-657"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>TDI responders (<bold>A</bold>) and deteriorators (<bold>B</bold>) over time for the subpopulation of patients with chronic bronchitis.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> *<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05;
