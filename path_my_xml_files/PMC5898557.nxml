Strong biological rationale or early clinical evidence commonly suggest that the effect of the combination treatment is importantly greater than the maximum effect of any of the individual treatments. While these relationships are commonly well-accepted, RCTs do not incorporate them into the design or analysis plans. We therefore propose a simple Bayesian framework for incorporating the known relationships that the effectiveness of a combination treatment exceeds that of any individual treatment, but does not necessarily exceed the sum of individual effects. We term the collation of these two relationships &#x02018;fractional additivity&#x02019;. We performed a binary outcome simulation study of a response adaptive randomized three-arm clinical trial with treatment arms A, B, and A&#x00026;B that allowed for dropping an inferior treatment arm and terminating the trial early for superiority during any of 4 interim analyses. We compared the Bayesian fractional additivity model to a conventional analysis by measuring the expected proportion of failures, sample size at trial termination, time to termination, and root mean squared error of final estimates. We also compared the fractional additivity model to a &#x02018;full additivity&#x02019; model where the effect of A&#x00026;B was assumed to be the sum of the effect of A and B. In simulation scenarios where important fractional additivity or full additivity existed, the Bayesian fractional additivity model yielded a 3&#x02013;4% relative reduction in expected number of failures, and a 30%&#x02013;50% relative reduction in sample size at trial termination compared to a conventional analysis. These results held true even when the Bayesian fractional additivity model employed a biased prior. The full additivity model had slightly higher gains, but too frequently terminated the trial at the first interim look. In scenarios where no or weak fractional additivity exists, the expected sample size and time to termination were similar for the Bayesian fractional additivity model with a moderately optimistic bias about fractional additivity and the conventional model. Lastly, the fractional additivity model generally yielded similar or lower root mean squared error compared to the other models. In conclusion, our proposed Bayesian <italic>fractional additivity</italic> model provides an efficient approach for estimating effects of combination treatments in clinical trials. The approach is not only highly applicable in adaptive clinical trials, but also provides added power in a conventional RCT.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptive trials</kwd><kwd>Additivity</kwd><kwd>Bayesian</kwd><kwd>Combination treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0010">Several clinical trials investigate combinations of interventions that have already been demonstrated to be individually effective. Historically, the superiority of combination therapies (vs single agent therapies) have been demonstrated medical areas such as in cardiovascular diseases (e.g., the poly-pill) and respiratory diseases <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Recently, superiority of combination therapies have been definitely demonstrated in phase III randomized clinical trials (RCT) in areas such as immuno-oncology and type II diabetes (see example Box 1 for detailed description) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In these combination therapy RCTs, the effectiveness of the individual interventions is typically well known, and there are typically substantial biological rationale, early clinical evidence, or evidence from related disease areas to suggest that the combination of interventions will work markedly better than any of the interventions alone <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, RCTs of combination treatments commonly analyse a combination therapy arm as if it is a separate individual intervention. For example, this is generally the case in 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 factorial trials across all areas of medicine. Thus, no advantage is taken of prior knowledge and assumptions about the combination therapy in the conduct and analysis of the clinical trial.</p><p id="p0015">While true additivity (i.e. the property that the effect of the combination of two intervention equals the sum of the two individual treatment effects) is rare, in many cases it is plausible to assume that treatment combinations investigated in clinical trials will exhibit markedly better effects than each of the individual treatments alone. In other words, it is plausible to assume clinically meaningful <italic>fractionally additive</italic> effect of the combination treatment investigated (also previously referred to as <italic>antagonistic additivity</italic>
<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). Thus, structurally incorporating <italic>fractional additivity</italic> into the statistical analysis of a clinical trial should theoretically suffice to optimize the trial design in terms of mitigating sample size requirements and trial duration. Yet to our knowledge, no clinical trial has previously capitalized on prior knowledge about additivity or fractional additivity.</p><p id="p0020">We therefore propose a Bayesian framework for incorporating <italic>fractional additivity</italic> in the statistical model and analysis of clinical trial of combination treatments. The proposed model expresses the effect of a combination treatment, A&#x00026;B, as the maximum of A and B, plus a <italic>fractional additivity parameter</italic> times the minimum of A and B. A weakly informative prior distribution is assigned to the <italic>fractional additivity</italic> parameter to reflect plausible ranges of <italic>fractional additivity</italic>, yet does not rule out equipoise nor full additivity (also previously referred to as <italic>synergistic additivity</italic>). Due to the hypothesized efficiency gain we apply the proposed Bayesian <italic>fractional additivity</italic> model within an adaptive clinical trial setting.

For completeness, however, we confirmed the superior power of the model in a conventional parallel design framework (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S.1</xref> in supplementary material). We consider a three-arm response adaptive randomized (RAR) clinical trial design that allows for 1) continually adapting the allocation ratios by the updated probabilities of superiority for any treatment; 2) dropping of an inferior treatment arm; and 3) early stopping for superiority. At the beginning of the trial patients are assigned to each of the three intervention arms with equal probabilities (1:1:1). Adaptations can in principle be applied anytime new outcome data becomes available. However, for simplicity and computational feasibility we consider 4 interim analyses at which adaptations can be made. The four interim looks are spaced equally between the first patient enrollment and reaching a fixed parallel design sample size requirement between A&#x00026;B and the maximum of A and B (e.g., 80% power and 5% type I error to detect a 20% difference). Thus, the first interim analysis occurs when outcome data on 20% of this required sample size has been accrued, the second at 40%, and so forth. Trial adaptations are based on the interim posterior probabilities that A, B, and A&#x00026;B, respectively are better than the two other interventions. Let <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>A best</italic></sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>B best</italic></sub>, and <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>A&#x00026;B best</italic></sub> denote these three probabilities. At each interim look, the allocation proportions are updated to the ratio between the square roots of these three probabilities (i.e., &#x0221a;<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>A best</italic></sub>: &#x0221a;<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>B best</italic></sub>: &#x0221a;<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>A&#x00026;B best</italic></sub>). The use of square roots rather than crude probabilities avoids too rapid adaptation and has become common place in adaptive trials <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We also allow for dropping an inferior treatment arm if the square root probability of superiority falls below 0.01, as well as early termination of the trial for superiority if the probability of superiority exceeds 0.95&#x000a0;at any interim look. If the termination criterion is not met during interim looks, the trial continues until the total sample size is reached.</p><p id="p0070">Note, the above adaptation and termination rules were established via preliminary simulations monitoring evolution of posterior probabilities at a fixed 1:1:1 allocation (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">supplementary material Figs.

At the second interim look, the biases of &#x003b8;<sub>A</sub> and &#x003b8;<sub>B</sub> are more negligible. From the first interim overestimate of &#x003b8;<sub>A&#x00026;B</sub> the RAR has ensured a relatively large number of patients enrolled to A&#x00026;B, thus substantially increasing the precision of A&#x00026;B, which appears to support a high probability of superiority for A&#x00026;B thus leading to termination at the second interim look.

First, we consider the expected proportion of failures (EPF) and the expected sample size (ESS) at time of termination. In addition to ESS, we also consider the cumulative probabilities of trial termination for all models at each interim look. The rationale for estimating EPF is that when a therapy is less effective than the others, one would hope that the trial is adapted more quickly to assign fewer patients to the inferior arms, thereby decreasing the number of negative outcomes. Note, however, for scenarios with weak or no additivity we do not consider EPF as there is no meaningful ethical gain from allocating more patients to an experimental treatment arm.

Both had higher RSME than all three fractional additivity models for A and B across all scenarios and were similar for full additivity.

As for the full additivity model the RMSEs for the individual effect estimates are systematically larger except for, f&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1, in which case full additivity is the correct assumption. We emphasize the increase in RMSE under the full additivity model is mainly due to the bias in estimating the effect sizes.

We have demonstrated, via simulation, that the proposed model is highly applicable and efficient under adaptive clinical trial designs. In particular, the proposed model increases power, reduces mean squared error results and results in notable reduction in expected sample size and expected proportion of failures. The model also performs as well as a full additivity when full additivity exists, whereas a full additivity model performs poorly in scenarios where full additivity is not met. Lastly, we have demonstrated via simulation that the proposed fractional additivity model has acceptable statistical properties when no or weak fractional additivity exists. While the proposed model is only presented for binary outcomes, both the model and the simulation results are easily generalizable to other types of outcomes.</p><p id="p0165">To our knowledge, our proposed model is the first model to allow for efficient modelling of <italic>fractional additivity</italic>. The superior performance of the Bayesian <italic>fractional additivity</italic> model over conventional model, both within an adaptive design framework and a conventional RCT framework, was expected as the model is distinctly designed to capitalize on the link between the individual agents and the combination of these. Further, the added information via prior on the fractional additivity parameter <italic>f</italic> is expected to decrease sample size requirements. It is also comforting that under a substantially biased prior (both optimistic and pessimistic) for <italic>f</italic> the model still performs similarly to that of an unbiased prior. Likewise, the superior performance of the <italic>fractional additivity</italic> model over the <italic>full additivity</italic> model was also expected as the underlying assumption of the latter is, of course, violated when full additivity does not exist. The performance of the fractional additivity model (with optimistic priors) under scenarios where no or weak fractional additivity exist suggest a reasonable trade-off between a relatively small risk of stopping early for superiority versus the substantial improvement in efficiency one stands to gain if fractional additivity holds. Of course, it should be recognized that since this paper is the first to propose a Bayesian fractional additivity model, only a limited number of scenarios have been covered. Scenarios with lower population event rates or multi-center clinical trials where large between-center variation exists could prove challenging for the fractional additivity model to adapt to. While we hope to pursue this further is later methods papers, clinical trial investigators employing the proposed model should of course make sure to run a comprehensive set of simulations during the planning of their adaptive trial. Even with this precaution, there are still many examples where pre-trial simulations have concluded one thing, but the opposite finding was observed upon trial termination. Thus, as with any novel method for adaptive clinical trials we can only recommend caution and diligence.</p><p id="p0170">Since the number of clinical trials investigating combination therapies are increasing, our proposed model will have incremental relevance and utility over the next years. Of course, we would recommend scrutiny around applying our model to the specific context. In our simulations, we have applied somewhat arbitrary but general weakly informative priors to the fractional additivity parameter. In practice, prior knowledge (or lack thereof) about the likely degree of fractional additivity may call for use of different priors than the ones applied in this paper. Further, as several clinical trials of combinations will surely also be evaluating efficacy and safety with time-to-event outcomes or continuous outcomes, the proposed model framework should be expanded accordingly. In this vein, equation <xref rid="fd1" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref> is easily generalizable as long as a suitable link function can be chosen, but the choice of priors may require further testing in preliminary simulation studies.</p><p id="p0175">In conclusion, the proposed Bayesian <italic>fractional additivity</italic> model provides an efficient approach for estimating effects of combination treatments in clinical trials.
