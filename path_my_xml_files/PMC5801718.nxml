In order to increase the participation in physical activity, it is important to intrigue interest and enjoyment with the activity. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been done to compare both the physiological and psychological benefits of exercise equipment. The purpose of this study was to assess the physiological responses and the perception of enjoyment between the Trikke (a nontraditional exercise equipment) and the bicycle ergometer (a traditional exercise equipment). Specifically, the following physiological variables of the participants were measured: exercise heart rate, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), VO<sub>2,</sub> and energy expenditure. Meanwhile, we also compared the outcomes of the males with those females. The purpose to establish those sex differences would be useful for personal trainers and personnel in the health-fitness industry when planning physical activity programs and exercise descriptions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Participants</title><p id="p0025">Thirty young college students (15 males and 15 females) aged 18&#x02013;45 years old voluntarily participated in the study.

Comparisons were made for exercise heart rate, RPE, VO<sub>2</sub>, and Kcal/min. In general, all the physiological responses of the bicycle ergometer were higher than that of the Trikke. The following section compares each of those physiological responses between the two exercise protocols, and then is followed by a comparison of sex differences.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Exercise heart rate</title><p id="p0080">The overall exercise heart rates of all the participants were slightly higher when they worked on the bicycle ergometer (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;145 bpm) than on the Trikke (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;143 bpm), though such difference was not significant. This would be expected because under both protocols, the participants had to maintain 75&#x02013;80% of their maximal predicted heart rate (220&#x02013;age). The exercise heart rate was slightly higher in female than male participants in both the Trikke and bicycle ergometer conditions, though such difference was not significant. The results of this study are inconsistent with the study by Kravitz et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> who found females had significantly higher exercise heart rates than males across all four modes of self-selected submaximal exercise: treadmill running, simulated cross-country skiing, cycling, and aerobic riding. This can be explained by the lower stroke volume of females, who require a higher heart rate for a given cardiac output, compared with that of males<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and by the greater percentage of body fat in women than in men.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>RPE</title><p id="p0085">All the participants showed a significant higher RPE when they worked on the bicycle ergometer (13.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2) than on the Trikke (11.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.7). This indicated all the participants felt that it was harder, or required a higher intensity of effort, when they were working on the bicycle ergometer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, RPE between 12 and 14 on the Borg Scale implies that physical activity is being performed at a moderate level of intensity. This is valid in our case because the participants were working on 75&#x02013;80% of their maximal predicted heart rate and their Borg Scale ratings were somewhere between 12 and 13. However, when comparisons were made between sexes, neither female nor male participants demonstrated that they had significant different RPE when working on the Trikke or the bicycle ergometer. The findings of the present study are consistent with that of some other studies (e.g., Eynde and Ostyn,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Green et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>). In their study involving a sample size of over 2000 participants, Eynde and Ostyn<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> found that at a given percentage of heart rate, RPE did not differ between female and male participants during either treadmill or cycle ergometer exercise. Furthermore, Winborn et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> found that female and male participants of low and high athletic experiences did not significantly differ in their RPE during submaximal exercise intensities equivalent to 30%, 50%, and 70% of estimated cycle ergometer VO<sub>2peak</sub>. In a more recent study, Green et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> concluded that the overall and differentiated RPE at the respiratory compensation threshold were not significantly different between sexes during cycling or treadmill exercise. When combining all these analyses together, it could be concluded that both sexes were consistent with their perceptions on each of the two exercise protocols; and they both considered that it was easier to work on the Trikke than on the bicycle ergometer.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>VO<sub>2</sub></title><p id="p0090">The results of this study indicated that the participants overall consumed significantly more oxygen when they worked on the bicycle ergometer (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24.9&#x000a0;mL/kg/min) as compared with the Trikke (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22.4&#x000a0;mL/kg/min). As there is a linear relationship between VO<sub>2</sub> and exercise intensity, it is concluded that the participants had to put more effort when they were working on the bicycle ergometer than the Trikke. It is also well-documented that there is a strong linear relationship between exercise heart rate and oxygen uptake (e.g., Arngr&#x000ed;msson et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>, Reis et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>). This leads to one interesting question: Why did the participants have to consume more energy on the bicycle ergometer than the Trikke when they were both controlled for 75&#x02013;80% of their maximal predicted heart rate in both exercise protocols? A possible explanation for this may be because of the nature of the exercise protocols: the bicycle ergometer involves mainly the lower body (in a sitting position) whereas the Trikke involves both the arms and legs (in a standing position). Previous studies indicated that oxygen consumption might be influenced by the proportion of arm work to total rate of work.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> For example, Bergh et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> suggested that the relatively low muscular endurance of the arms compared with the legs can limit the increase in oxygen consumption during upper and lower body exercise.</p><p id="p0095">The VO<sub>2</sub> of the male participants was higher than the female participants on both the bicycle ergometer and Trikke exercise protocols. The results were concurred with those of Bhambhani and Maikala,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> who found that men had significant higher absolute VO<sub>2</sub> than women during the 15- and 20-kg load-carriage walks. Statistically, significant sex difference in VO<sub>2</sub> was found only when they were exercised with the Trikke (25.1&#x000a0;mL/kg/min for males vs. 19.6&#x000a0;mL/kg/min for females). Generally, females have 15&#x02013;30% less VO<sub>2</sub> than males of similar fitness.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The reasons for such differences include: (1) lower blood volume, fewer red blood cells, and lower levels of hemoglobin, resulting a lower oxygen transport capacity of the blood; (2) smaller heart size, resulting in smaller stroke volumes and higher heart rates for a given cardiac output; and (3) body composition differences, particularly a higher percentage of adipose tissue and lower percentage of working muscle.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> However, such sex differences in VO<sub>2</sub> will cancel out when control for their fat-free mass.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Therefore, the explanation for the sex differences in this study was that the female participants were more efficient in using the Trikke than the male participants under the same conditions, and this assertion can be enforced by the females' lower RPE (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11.3) than their male counterparts (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12.1).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Energy expenditure</title><p id="p0100">The energy expenditure of this study is expressed in Kcal/min. The overall Kcal/min of all the participants were significantly higher when they worked on the bicycle ergometer (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.0&#x000a0;kcal/min) than on the Trikke (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8.0&#x000a0;kcal/min). The result was consistent with the previous session where the participants consumed significantly more oxygen when working on the bicycle ergometer than on the Trikke. This is no surprise because VO<sub>2</sub> and energy expenditure go hand in hand: as the exercise intensity increases, oxygen uptake increases, and thus more calories are consumed. The Kcal/min was significantly higher for the male participants when compared with the female participants in both the Trikke (9.9 Kcal/min in males vs. 6.2 Kcal/min in females) and the bicycle ergometer (10.5 Kcal/min in males vs. 7.4 Kcal/min in females) conditions. In other words, female participants used approximately two-thirds of the energy cost when compared with their male counterparts under the same conditions. The body weight of male participants (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;81.7&#x000a0;kg) in this study were significantly higher than the female participants (mean&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65.1&#x000a0;kg), and it is also taken into consideration that the male participants have more muscle mass and less fat than their counterparts. For these reasons, the male participants should have expected to have a higher energy expenditure than the female participants when control for exercise intensity and exercise mode.</p><p id="p0105">However, muscle mass should not be used to explain the VO<sub>2</sub> and Kcal/min differences between the two exercise protocols because submaximal energy expenditure is not simply a reflection of the amount of muscle mass used during exercise.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> If muscle mass were the determining factor, then the Trikke, which employ more muscle mass than the bicycle ergometer, would have produced higher energy expenditures. Although the Trikke is weight bearing and engages more muscle mass than that of the bicycle ergometer, it is the bicycle ergometer that resulted in the higher submaximal oxygen consumption for both the female and male participants. The movement pattern of the Trikke, which involves both the upper and lower body muscle groups, may actually decrease metabolic demand, presumably owing to a reduced exercise intensity of the larger, lower body musculature.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Furthermore, the additional arm work to leg work may decrease the contribution of the larger leg musculature to the exercise, thereby lowering exercise intensity.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>EPQ</title><p id="p0110">Cronbach &#x003b1; coefficients of the positive (i.e., &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.84) and negative items (i.e., &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.93) of the EPQ were higher than 0.70, indicating the nine-item scale had high internal consistency. This means that the extent to which all the items in the EPQ measure the same concept or construct. Nevertheless, the psychometric properties of the EPQ have not been examined by other statistics (e.g., test&#x02013;retest reliability and sensitivity analysis) and as such, some degree of caution is warranted when interpreting the findings of the EPQ. The purpose of adding two negatively worded items to the EPQ is to reduce response bias. Response bias refers to answer patterns on the questionnaire that do not reflect the participants' actual opinion,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> and that thus can pose a serious threat to the validity of the self-report questionnaire.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> An examination of all the questionnaires indicated that there was no acquiescent bias from the participants, who all disagreed that &#x0201c;The Trikke is boring.&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;The Trikke is not for me.&#x0201d; However, all the participants agreed that the Trikke was easy to use and would try the Trikke again. They also preferred the Trikke over other exercise equipment such as the stationary bike or scooter.

The second purpose was to investigate whether there was any sex difference among those physiological and psychological responses between the two exercise machines. When control for the exercise intensity (at 75&#x02013;80% of maximal predicted heart rate), all the participants felt that it was easier to work on the Trikke than the bicycle ergometer. It is concluded that both the psychological (RPE) and physiological (e.g., oxygen uptake) mechanisms play a role in the perceptual differences observed between the Trikke and the bicycle ergometer in the current study. The present study also showed that the general concept of exercising large muscle groups produces greater energy expenditure may be true for all exercise protocols. As all the participants prefer the Trikke over other exercise equipment, it is concluded that the Trikke is fun to work on.
