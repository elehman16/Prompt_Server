A study of 114 multicentre trials in the UK showed that 45% failed to reach 80% of their recruitment goal. Less than one third of the trials recruited their original target number of participants within the time originally specified, and around one third had to be extended in terms of time and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and it has been identified as the highest priority to find methods to enhance recruitment to the RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are a few trials that have sought to evaluate different strategies for recruiting patients. However, these studies are small, and some are hypothetical, making the interpretation unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Qualitative interventions within trials to improve recruitment have been developed in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and in addition, online resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] are available. In spite of that, we need to know more about the barrier and success factors for trials in recruiting patients and especially in RCTs. Given these facts, trialists are advised to include study recruitment strategies within their trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">One alternative is to embed trials of recruitment interventions within host trials. An embedded recruitment trial is defined as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]:<disp-quote><p id="Par16">&#x02018;&#x02026;a RCT in which an intervention (or several interventions) to enhance recruitment outcomes are tested in the context of another RCT (or several RCTs) known as the host RCT(s)&#x02019;.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par17">The EFFECTS (Efficacy oF Fluoxetine &#x02013; a randomisEd Controlled Trial in Stroke, Clinical Trials number NCT02683213) study seeks to investigate whether 20 mg fluoxetine daily compared with placebo for 6 months after acute stroke improves patients&#x02019; functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The EFFECTS study is a multicentre trial aiming to recruit 1500 patients in Sweden. The study collaborates with two other investigator-led studies, FOCUS (UK) and AFFINITY (Australia/New Zealand/Vietnam). Each trial is funded independently and intends to report its own results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The first patient in EFFECTS was included on 20 October 2014. Our primary recruitment goal was that each centre should randomise at least two patients per month. In reality, there are huge differences between centres regarding recruitment. Looking back between June 2016 and May 2017, for instance, only three centres have achieved the recruitment goal: Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Sundsvall Hospital, while another three (Mora General Hospital, Alings&#x000e5;s General Hospital and Skaraborg Hospital Sk&#x000f6;vde) came close. In fact, these six centres have so far included half of the individuals. This pattern &#x02013; that a few centres have included the majority of individuals &#x02013; has been consistent since the start, irrespective of different strategies. The recruitment rate per month and centre is updated in real time and is available in the public domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Rationales for the study</title><p id="Par19">Currently, the EFFECTS trial includes 30 patients per month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and recruitment projections would take the trial beyond its current funding. Thus, a new strategy is needed.</p><p id="Par20">After talking to the principal investigators (PIs) at the centres, and to trialists in the UK with similar studies, we are confident that five of the top recruiters (Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Sundsvall Hospital, Mora General Hospital and Skaraborg Hospital Sk&#x000f6;vde) have reached their full potential, and little would be gained from the planned intervention.</p><p id="Par21">We have asked the centres via a survey, and have also discussed this in person at investigator meetings, what they consider to be the most important barrier to recruitment for trials. They have said that the most important barrier is the lack of time for the physician responsible to identify the right patients and to carry out the study-specific procedures at baseline. The second most important factor is the lack of time for all other study personnel. They have a high clinical workload at their clinic and do not have any time specifically dedicated to working with clinical trials. It is the head of department (verksamhetschef) who is responsible for finances and personnel. Without the support of the head of department there will hardly be any change in recruitment. We will, therefore, invite the head of department (verksamhetschef) at the local centre to the teleconference in addition to the PI and the research nurse. Hopefully, we can work together to identify what could be done to provide more opportunities at the clinic to do research for both physicians and nurses within working hours. We have chosen a teleconference because it is time effective and less expensive than a face-to-face meeting. In addition, we hypothesised that a commitment contract would make it more personal for the local centre.</p><p id="Par22">We have followed the 2013 SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in conjugation with the 2013 SPIRIT explanation and elaboration guidance for protocols of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives of the study</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Primary objective</title><p id="Par23">The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a structured teleconference re-visit with the study personnel at the centres, accompanied by a commitment contract, can enhance recruitment by 20% during 60 days post intervention, compared with 60 days pre-intervention, in an ongoing RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par24">

First, it is not possible for us to carry out the intervention at 14&#x02013;15 centres at the same time. Second, we believe that all medium and low recruiting centres could gain from the intervention, and in a stepped-wedge cluster design all centres are exposed. Every step provides before and after observations, and every step switches from control to become exposed to the intervention. Third, we have noticed a seasonal variation in recruitment. During the Christmas and Easter holidays, and especially during the summer, recruitment is falling. This intervention gives a realistic view of recruitment throughout the whole year. To the best of our knowledge, only one randomised stepped-wedge study in the field of stroke has been done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study settings</title><p id="Par30">EFFECTS has been running for almost 3 years, and we know the recruitment rate per centre and month. Initially we had 35 centres. Three centres &#x02013; Karolinska Hospital Huddinge, Visby General Hospital and H&#x000f6;gsbo Rehabilitation Hospital &#x02013; have been closed due to low recruitment mainly because of a lack of PI. Of the 32 centres, we have identified five centres that have achieved our goal, that is recruiting two or more patients per month. They are the top recruiters: Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Skaraborg Hospital Sk&#x000f6;vde, Mora General Hospital and Sundsvall Hospital. We will not intervene at these centres because we believe that they have reached their full potential and the intervention is too weak for them. Not including the top recruiters, this leaves us with 27 centres in this study.</p><p id="Par31">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of the study.

Each centre has a 60-day running-in period (yellow), followed by a 60-day post-intervention period (blue).

The centres will not be informed that we are measuring numbers of randomised patients before and after the teleconference, but they are fully aware that we want to enhance recruitment.
