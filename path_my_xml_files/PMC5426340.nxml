supplementation on children&#x02019;s physical activity in food-insecure areas remains little
studied. We examined the effects of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) on children&#x02019;s
objectively measured physical activity in a randomised, controlled,
outcome-assessor-blinded trial. Mothers of the children received one capsule daily of
Fe-folic acid (IFA), one capsule containing eighteen micronutrients (MMN) or one 20 g
sachet of LNS (containing twenty-two MMN, protein, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids
and 494 kJ (118 kcal)) during pregnancy and for 6 months thereafter. Children in the IFA
and MMN groups received no supplementation, and these groups were collapsed into a single
control group; children in the LNS group received 20 g LNS from 6 to 18 months. We
measured physical activity with accelerometers over 1 week at 18 months. The main outcome
was mean vector magnitude counts/15 s. Of the 728 children at the beginning of child
intervention at 6 months, 570 (78 %) provided sufficient data for analysis. The mean
accelerometer counts for the 190 children in the LNS group and for the 380 children in the
control group were 303 (<sc>sd</sc> 59) and 301 (<sc>sd</sc> 56), respectively (<italic>P</italic>

limited growth response to supplementation exist. First, supplementation starting at 6 months
of age might come too late as children in resource-poor settings are commonly affected by
intra-uterine growth restriction and thus are born stunted<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">

nutrient supplements, suggesting that interventions combining nutrition interventions with
prevention and management of infections might increase the effect<sup>(</sup>

<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">

children, such as physical activity<sup>(</sup>

improves<sup>(</sup>

and behavioural changes, including reduction of physical activity, as a response to lowered
energy intake<sup>(</sup>

the mediators leading to poor child development. This theory is known as the functional
isolation hypothesis: behaviour of undernourished children &#x02013; that is, reduced activity and
exploration and increased apathy &#x02013; results in children having less interaction with their
environment, and this in turn may restrict optimal development<sup>(</sup>

offer them less stimulation, which again hinders their development<sup>(</sup>

controlled trial testing the health effects of supplementing maternal diet during
pregnancy and lactation and infant diet from 6 to 18 months of age with LNS. This study
was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and
all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the College of Medicine Research
and Ethics Committee, University of Malawi, and by the Ethics Committee of Pirkanmaa
Hospital District, Finland. We performed the trial according to Good Clinical Practice

randomisation slips in blocks of nine and sealed the slips in opaque, numbered envelopes.
Eligible pregnant women were requested to choose one of the top six envelopes in a stack.
The contents of the envelope indicated her participant number and group allocation.</p><p>We used single-masked procedures for the LNS intervention; that is, field workers who
delivered the supplements knew which mothers were receiving LNS. The research assistants
measuring activity and anthropometric outcomes were kept blinded to the group allocation

(20 g LNS-P&#x00026;L), daily during pregnancy and for 6 months thereafter. Both the 20 g
milk containing LNS and 20 g LNS-P&#x00026;L included twenty-two vitamins and minerals, 10

micronutrients for a healthy, breast-feeding infant<sup>(</sup>

delivery during the trial implementation. Because of this episode, 121 children missed
receiving LNS for a period that ranged from 1 to 41 d between 1 August and 11 September

physical activity data to be missing if the actual onset of measurement was over 30 d from

receiving intervention at this stage and improved motor skills at older age could result
in accelerometer readings different from those of children at 18 months of age. The data

the effect of dietary supplementation with LNS, given to mothers during pregnancy and 6
months postpartum and to their infants from 6 to 18 months of age, on children&#x02019;s physical
activity in semi-rural Malawi. The mean accelerometer counts were slightly higher among the
supplemented than among the non-supplemented participants in our sample, but the differences
were small and statistically insignificant.</p><p>The results of this study are very similar to our previous findings where LNS did not

not seem to offer additional benefits in terms of physical activity of the children. We are
not aware of any other studies measuring the effects of LNS supplementation on physical
activity; however, there are previous studies examining physical activity after

positive effects on physical activity from supplementation with either Zn<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> of a milk-based intervention. All of the studies used observation as the method
for measuring activity.</p><p>There are several theoretically plausible explanations for why the LNS intervention had no
significant effect on children&#x02019;s physical activity. One limiting factor could be relatively
low (77 %) adherence to consuming LNS. The energy provided by LNS might replace rather than
be additive to energy from breast milk or complementary foods. However, our previous studies
suggest that provision of LNS does not reduce breast milk or complementary food intake at
the age of 9&#x02013;10 months<sup>(</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">

group) were at least as active as has been reported for toddlers in high-income
countries<sup>(</sup>

<sup>28</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>51</sup>

despite residing in a food-insecure area. There is considerable heterogeneity in the results
of studies testing LNS for improving growth or treating moderate malnutrition<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, implying that there could be underlying, context-specific mechanisms affecting
children&#x02019;s health and well-being and limiting response to nutrition interventions.
Therefore, it is possible that nutrition interventions alone are not sufficient, but
interventions that aim to improve children&#x02019;s well-being also need to target other risk
factors, such as infections<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The main strengths of this study include the following: randomisation, which controls for
confounders and decreases selection bias, objective measurement of physical activity, which
eliminates reporting bias inherent to subjective physical activity measurement methods; and
broad inclusion criteria, which increase the generalisability of results. The sample size
was large enough to detect an effect size of 0&#x000b7;25 <sc>sd</sc> with about 80 % power.</p><p>The main weakness of the study was that the guardians could not be blinded to the treatment
allocation of their children. However, because we used objective measurement of the outcome,
this is unlikely to have affected the physical activity measurement. The weaknesses of
accelerometers in measuring physical activity include the fact that they do not provide
information on activity type or context, nor do they distinguish between the causes of
movement, which may lead to overestimation of activity in infants who are frequently being
carried by their caregivers<sup>(</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. However, overestimation of activity while the child is being carried appears
to be more common among young infants who cannot walk<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, whereas only 17 % of the 18-month-old children in both the control and
intervention groups in our study were reportedly being carried &#x02265;1 h daily or almost daily.
Furthermore, we did not perform per-protocol analysis &#x02013; that is, including only the most
adherent children &#x02013; because we did not have a placebo control and were thus unable to
identify and exclude non-adherent children in the control group. Although loss to follow up
was about 22 %, differences in background characteristics between participants who were
enrolled or not enrolled into this sub-study were small, suggesting that attrition bias was
not likely. Taking into account these shortcomings, we believe that the main results are
valid and sufficiently representative of the target population, suggesting that LNS
supplementation does not markedly increase the mean physical activity of young children in
the defined target group.</p><p>In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that LNS, given to mothers during
pregnancy and 6 months postpartum and to their infants from 6 to 18 months of age, increases
physical activity among 18-month-old children in semi-rural Malawi. Further research is
needed to identify interventions that could improve the health and well-being of children
who are living in food-insecure areas. Given the bidirectional relationship between
nutrition and infections, whereby poor nutrition increases the risk for infections and
infections can worsen nutritional status, these interventions might need to target both
nutrition and infections. Furthermore, current recommendations for children&#x02019;s physical
activity are mainly based on parental-reported physical activity, a measure that is known to
be biased. It would thus be important to establish recommendations for sufficient physical
activity to support the health and development of children based on research using objective
physical activity measures, such as accelerometers.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the participating families and the data collection teams for their
