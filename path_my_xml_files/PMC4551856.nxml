Re-Engage involved giving providers a list of patients with serious mental illness who had not been seen at their facility for at least a year, requesting that providers contact these patients, assess their clinical status, and where appropriate, expedite VA healthcare appointments. At month 6, facilities considered non-responsive(N = 88, total of 3,200 patients), defined as &#x0003c;80% of patients on providers' lists with updated assessment of clinical status, were randomized to receive either Enhanced REP (REP+Facilitation; N = 39 practices) for 6 months followed by standard REP for 6 months; or continued standard REP (N = 49 practices) for 6 months followed by 6 months of Enhanced REP for facilities still not responding. Enhanced REP consisted of monthly phone-based coaching by national experts in Re-Engage on overcoming adoption barriers. Quantitative outcomes included attempted contacts and subsequent receipt of outpatient care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patients from facilities randomized to receive Enhanced compared to standard REP were more likely to have an attempted contact (30% vs. 13%, p &#x0003c; .001). Sites that received Enhanced REP six months after randomization (delayed implementation of Facilitation) were no more likely to have increased contacts. There were no differences in patient-level utilization between Enhanced and standard REP sites 12 months post-randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>Adaptive implementation intervention strategies like Enhanced REP when applied immediately to address implementation non-response, offer a means to augment implementation efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding Source</title><p>VA HSR&#x00026;D (SDR 11-232).</p></sec></body></article>
