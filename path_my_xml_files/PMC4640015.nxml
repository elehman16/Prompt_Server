The challenge in anesthesia is to maintain a balance between the stress of the laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, and surgical procedure with the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of deeper levels of anesthesia. The anesthesiologist uses both the skill in clinical examination and a host of technical monitors to provide ongoing feedback on the patient's physiological status and anesthetic requirements.</p><p>Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (L and I) is a strong stimulus for cardiovascular system under light anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The magnitude of response is great with increasing force and duration of laryngoscopy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The elevation in arterial pressure typically starts within 5 s of laryngoscopy, peaks in 1-2 min and returns to control level within 5 min.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Such hemodynamic changes can result in myocardial ischemia, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>To attenuate the hemodynamic response, many techniques have been tried but none is ideal. It can be prevented by increasing the depth of anaesthesia but concentration changes of anesthetic agents in blood and effector sites occur slowly in relation to the onset and offset of airway stimuli and hemodynamic response. Volatile anesthetic agents with N<sub>2</sub>O may be beneficial. Large doses of fentanyl, (5-10 &#x000b5;g/kg) may attenuate the hemodynamic response but cause prolonged respiratory depression. Aerosol or other application of topical anesthetics may be beneficial.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Combination of topical anesthetics and parenteral opioids may be useful.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Labetalol and esmolol may be used in combination with narcotics.</p><p>Gabapentin, 1&#x02013;(aminomethyl) cyclohexane acetic acid, is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter, &#x003b3;&#x02013;amino butyric acid (GABA) was introduced in 1993 as an adjuvant antiepileptic drug for the treatment of refractory partial seizure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It was shown to be effective in treating postherpetic neuralgia,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] other neuropathic pain,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] postpoliomyelitis neuropathy[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reflex sympathetic dystrophy.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Diabetic neuropathy[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and it has antinociceptive, antihyperalgesic, and antiallodynic properties.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] More recently, it has been used to attenuate the stress response to direct L and I. The mechanism by which gabapentin attenuates the pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation is unknown. The drug inhibits membrane bound voltage gated calcium channels, thus acting in a manner similar to calcium channel blockers.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Memis <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] concluded that gabapentin 800 mg before induction of anaesthesia is a simple and practical method for attenuating pressor response to L and I.</p><p>Clonidine, the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist has shown properties that are potentially beneficial for premedication to reduce sympathetic activity, to diminish incidence of shivering and oxygen consumption during recovery from anaesthesia, to decrease anesthetic and analgesic requirement and to minimize post operative pain, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Carabine <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] concluded that 200 &#x000b5;g oral clonidine-reduced anxiety and laryngoscopy associated hemodynamic surge well in eighty female patients.</p><p>In view of these observations, the present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of oral gabapentin (800 mg) versus oral clonidine (200 &#x000b5;g) premedication for sedation status, blunting the heart rate variability as well as pressor response to direct L and I.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining Institutional Ethical committee permission, written consent was obtained from all the patients. Total 100 adult patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 50 in each group) using computer-generated random number list. Group C of patients received single dose oral 200 &#x000b5;g clonidine and group G patients received single dose oral 800 mg gabapentin 2 h before induction of general anesthesia. As clonidine is available in tablet form and gabapentin is available in capsule form we had to take help of DBcaps&#x000ae; Capsules to ensure blinding. DBcaps&#x000ae; are two-piece gelatin or HPMC capsules with a tamper evident design to specifically address the clinical trial challenges of testing without bias. Drugs were swallowed with sips of water in presence of resident doctor not taking part in study. Thus, double blinding was ensured.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patient refusal, any known allergy or contraindication to clonidine or gabapentin, pregnancy, lactating mothers and children, subjects who were sleepy or hypotensive within 24 h before surgery, hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholism, diabetes, significant gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease) were excluded.</p><p>In preoperative assessment, patients were enquired about history of (h/o) fluid electrolyte disbalance, fainting attack, any antiarrhythmic treatment received, h/o previous exposure to anesthesia, h/o seizure, chronic pain syndrome, psychiatric disorder, patient receiving b blocker. The patients were enquired about any history of drug allergy, previous operations, or prolonged drug treatment. General examination, systemic examinations, and assessment of the airway were done. Preoperative fasting of minimum 8 h was ensured before operation in all cases. All patients received premedication of tablet diazepam 10 mg orally the night before surgery as per preanesthetic check up direction to allay anxiety, apprehension, and for sound sleep. The patients also received tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the previous night and in the morning of operation with sips of water.</p><p>After 8 h fasting, on the day of surgery the patients were brought to the observation room, baseline parameters such as heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), distolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were measured. Premedication was administered. After 2 h of premedication patient was shifted to the operation table and multichannel monitor was attached. HR, SBP, DBP, MBP, respiratory rate, electrocardiography, temperature were recorded before insertion of a 18G intravenous (IV) cannula.</p><p>I.V. infusion was started with ringer lactate. After 5 min preoxygenation with 100% O<sub>2</sub>, premedication was given with inj. glycopyrrolate 4 &#x000b5;g/kg, Inj. fentanyl citrate 2 &#x000b5;g/kg. Induction was done with Inj. thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg and intubation was done with Inj. succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg and cuffed endotracheal tube of appropriate size. Anesthesia was maintained with 70% N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub>, isoflurane up to 1&#x02013;2 MAC, inj. atracurium besylate (0.5 mg/kg) bolus and then as and when (0.2 mg/kg) indicated. After completion of surgery neuromuscular block was reversed with inj. glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg and Inj. neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and extubated when adequate spontaneous ventilation was established. All patients were shifted to postanesthesia care unit.</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) (lead-II) and heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, SBP, DBP, MBP, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, temperature were recorded during L and I, 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, and 10 min after L and I and throughout procedure.</p><p>Visual analogue scale for postoperative pain score [(0-10 cm), 0 = no pain, 10 cm = worst pain imaginable].

It has been observed that L and I lead to reflex cardiovascular response, producing tachycardia and systemic arterial hypertension. These circulatory changes may produce detrimental effect in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and various operations. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of these deleterious effects on hemodynamics, numerous techniques have been used with varying degrees of success. These techniques include deepening[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] of the plane of anaesthesia (King <italic>et al</italic>.; 1951). A variety of drugs[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been used to control this hemodynamic response (Kovac; 1996).</p><p>The present study was carried out with oral premedication with clonidine (200 &#x000b5;g) and gabapentin (800 mg) 2 h before surgery to compare the attenuated hemodynamic response, following L and I and sedation status.</p><p>Clonidine, an imidazoline derivative, is a selective &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist. It is a potent antihypertensive drug. It produces a fall in heart rate and blood pressure associated with decreased cardiac output but unchanged peripheral resistance.

The mechanism of gabapentin in controlling this haemodynamic response remains unknown. Since, gabapentin inhibits membrane voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs), it is possible that it may have a similar action to calcium channel blockers. There is, as yet, no data, on the possible role of gabapentin in the attenuation of other aspects of the stress response to surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Some studies demonstrated that the descending noradrenergic system, spinal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors and an intact spino-bulbo-spinal circuit are crucial elements influencing the analgesic effects of gabapentin in addition to &#x003b1;<sub>2A</sub> interaction of VGCCs.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The demographic profile (age, sex, body weight, ASA status) between two groups which was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) of our patients was quite similar with other research investigations and provided us the uniform platform to evenly compare the results obtained.
