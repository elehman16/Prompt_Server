COPD is a major public health problem worldwide and is expanding throughout with a higher prevalence, morbidity and mortality rate. The World Health Report-2002 listed COPD as the fifth leading cause of death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] It currently ranks number 6 in global disease impact scale and is predicted to rise to number 3 by 2020.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] The prevalence of COPD in India is 5% in males and 2.7% in females, with the male to female ratio of 1.6:1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] It translates into approximately 12 million cases in India alone. The incidence and prevalence of COPD is increasing as a result of urban ambient air pollution and indoor exposure concentrations of particulate air pollution.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>]</p><p>The World Health Organization and Government of India (WHO-GOI) Guidelines-2003 for management of COPD provide management recommendations for optimum practice that include hospital follow-up for those admitted with acute exacerbations and for stable COPD cases involving a number of potential therapeutic interventions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>]</p><p>These guidelines were formulated based on consensus view of experts from all over India during 2002-2003 at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, under the auspices of WHO and GOI. Health-related quality of life (QOL) has been defined as the functional effect of an illness and its consequent therapy on a patient, as perceived by the patient. QOL is an important domain for measuring the impact of guidelines on management of COPD. However, the outcome of its implementation and their impact on quality of life in COPD patients have not been studied in actual medical practice so far to the best of our knowledge. The disease-specific instruments, such as St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), have been used to measure health- related QOL in patients with COPD. We had undertaken the study comparing hospital outpatient follow-up according to &#x0201c;WHO-Government of India COPD Guidelines-2003,&#x0201d; with the conventional practice of follow-up care in patients with stable COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We included 90 patients with diagnosis of COPD over a 1-year period from April 2006 through 2007 in our study. COPD was diagnosed as per diagnostic criteria of &#x0201c;WHO-Government of India Guidelines-2003 for management of COPD.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>]</p><p>Lung function data were obtained with use of the Spirometer. Lung function was measured before and 15 minutes after administration of 200-&#x003bc;g salbutamol by nebulizations. All spirograms were reviewed by the chest physicians. Data for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were deemed usable and included in this analysis if they fully met the American Thoracic Society (ATS) acceptability criteria and were reproducible to within 200 mL. We included the patients with a prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of &#x0003c;80% of the predicted value, an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> with the use of 200 &#x003bc;g of salbutamol of &#x0003c;12% of the predicted value for that patient, and a ratio of prebronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> to FVC &#x02264;0.70.</p><p>COPD was diagnosed if patients had progressive symptoms and a FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;80% of that predicted with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio &#x0003c;0.7. The response to inhaled bronchodilator of more than 12% was taken to discriminate asthma from COPD. The patients with comorbid illness for example &#x02013; associated or suspected malignancy, tuberculosis, significant cardiac morbidity, any dominant medical condition requiring hospital follow-up, already under outpatient follow-up, already under pulmonary rehabilitation care, mild COPD and those who refused for participation were excluded from study. Patients were randomized to intervention group and control group by simple randomization technique.</p><p>After initial recording of demographic data, spirometry including bronchodilator reversibility response and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire was measured at baseline and three and six months. Numbers of admissions to the hospital, oxygen supplementation, nebulizer prescriptions over six-month periods of follow-up were recorded in all patients. For the SGRQ, a change in four units or more was accepted as significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>The SGRQ is a standardized self-administered airways disease-specific questionnaire that provides an overall measure for quality of life with subscale scores in three areas: Symptom, activity, and impact of disease on daily life. It contains 50 items (covering 76 levels) divided into three subscales: &#x0201c;Symptoms&#x0201d; (8 items), including several respiratory symptoms, their frequency and severity; &#x0201c;Activity&#x0201d; (16 items), concerned with activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness; and &#x0201c;Impacts&#x0201d; (26 items), which covers a range of aspects concerned with social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease. Each item in the questionnaire has a weight attached, which provides an estimate of the distress associated with the symptom or state described. A score was calculated for each subscale of the SGRQ and also an overall score was calculated on Microsoft Excel sheet (calculator obtained from P.W. Jones). SGRQ scores range from 0-100, with score 0 indicating no impairment of life quality and 100 indicating maximum disability. The questionnaire has been shown to be reproducible and valid. We adapted the English language of the SGRQ as received and doctors' local language was used while interpreting the questionnaires and aimed to reflect the usual language of the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intervention group treatment protocol</title><p>A chest physician reviewed the intervention group at least three times in the six month period, that is, at baseline, during the third and sixth month.

Inhaler techniques and compliance were assessed at every visit.</p><p>Patients came for regular follow-ups in our outpatient department (OPD) and were given regular treatment strictly according to WHO-GOI COPD Guidelines-2003,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] as below.</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Mild COPD - Short acting bronchodilators, when needed</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moderate COPD - Regular treatment with one or more bronchodilators</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe COPD - As in moderate COPD plus inhaled corticosteroids, treatment of complications</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Control group treatment protocol</title><p>Patients visited our OPD on a &#x0201c;need to&#x0201d; basis and they were not given treatment strictly as per the guidelines in question by the doctors not aware exactly of the guidelines.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Drugs used in this group were from among various combinations of oral/inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled/oral corticosteroids depending on the degree of symptom control.

The present study suggests that regular follow-up in the outpatient department accompanied by aggressive implementation of &#x0201c;WHO-Government of India Guidelines-2003 for management of COPD&#x0201d; produces disease-specific improvements in quality of life indicators. The observed change in the SGRQ could be attributed to the effect of giving treatment strictly according to the WHO-GOI guidelines. There were some patients who could not be enrolled mainly due to the disease severity and they could not ethically be randomized to the control group.</p><p>This study is worth mentioning for two reasons. Firstly, it objectively justifies the consensus derived recommendations of &#x0201c;WHO-Government of India Guidelines-2003 for management of COPD.&#x0201d; Second, it highlights the surprising paucity of literature on this important area. Larger multicentric studies are needed to confirm our findings and to identify the individual interventions that may account for a change in quality of life indices and the mechanisms by which this is achieved.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. As this study is purely based on quality of life, emphasis on pulmonary rehabilitation could not be given. Also, pulmonary rehabilitation, which comprises physical training program, education about disease, and nutritional, psychological, social and behavioral intervention including smoking cessation, can become a confounding factor for drug management under &#x0201c;WHO-GOI Guidelines-2003.&#x0201d; Although smoking cessation advice was given to the patients, its effect could not be evaluated due to short duration of follow-up. The study is further weakened by the relatively small number of patients and also the duration of follow-up is shorter as compared to the duration of the disease.</p><p>Despite the limitations discussed we can certainly conclude that the recommendations of WHO-GOI Guidelines for COPD-2003 are significantly favorable for management of COPD patients over conventional management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors thank Prof. Paul W.
