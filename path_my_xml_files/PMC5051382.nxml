This is in spite of the impact that interventions to reduce CVD risk&#x02014;such as BP management and weight management programmes&#x02014;might have in reducing the future occurrence of debilitating events such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke.</p><p>Telehealth is one form of condition management that may be relevant to long-term conditions in general and to CVD in particular.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of telehealth.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> To estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a de novo telehealth intervention, the Healthlines CVD risk RCT individually randomised 641 participants to receive either usual care or a theory-based telehealth intervention that encouraged participants to engage in beneficial behaviour change. The primary clinical outcome of the trial was 10-year CVD risk, measured using the QRISK2 risk prediction algorithm<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> at the end of 12&#x02005;months of follow-up.</p><p>In the absence of data from long-term follow-up, there is no means of assessing the enduring impact on cost-effectiveness of the changes in modifiable risk factors that the intervention may have wrought. For example, it is plausible that some patients who managed to reduce their BP, body mass index (BMI) or whose medication adherence was improved as a result of the intervention may continue with newly acquired beneficial behaviours after the end of the 12&#x02005;months of trial follow-up. Indeed, it is implausible that all trial participants would immediately revert to their preintervention BP or BMI immediately on trial completion.</p><p>This paper describes the development and analysis of a state transition cohort simulation cost-effectiveness model intended to estimate the expected net benefits of the Healthlines telehealth intervention over the lifetime of trial participants. This approach is consistent with the principles of economic evaluation,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and ISPOR guidelines<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which recommend that cost-effectiveness analyses be undertaken over a time period that reflects differences in cost and effect attributable to an intervention or treatment. The long-term cost-effectiveness analysis complements the analysis of cost-effectiveness of the intervention at 12&#x02005;months postrandomisation published in a companion paper.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>The Healthlines RCT</title><p>The trial protocol, methods, results and cost-effectiveness analyses have been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Briefly, patients aged between 40 and 74 with 10-year CVD risk &#x02265;20% (measured by the QRISK2 algorithm) and at least one modifiable risk factor (eg, weight management or smoking) were recruited from 42 GP practices in England. Individuals were not considered if they had a confirmed diagnosis of CVD, were pregnant, did not have access to the internet and telephones or were unable to communicate verbally. More detail on these and other exclusion criteria is available in Salisbury <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In total, 641 patients were randomised, and received either unmodified usual care (n=316) or a telehealth intervention in addition to usual care (n=325), for a follow-up period of 12&#x02005;months.</p><p>Participants in the intervention arm could receive up to 13 responsive, tailored telehealth encounters with trained Health Information Advisors. Participants were encouraged to access and use online material and apps related to CVD risk. Participants with systolic BP &#x02265;140&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and without atrial fibrillation were offered a BP monitor to use at home, and could upload readings to a portal to monitor progress. Telephone calls focused on goal setting, stimulus control and the management of CVD risk in a way that was relevant to the circumstances of each individual participant and which was in line with NICE guidelines. This included ensuring that patients were taking appropriate drug treatment, and addressing problems with medication adherence.</p><p>The within-trial economic evaluation at the end of 12&#x02005;months of follow-up adopted an NHS perspective. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated against NICE thresholds using NHS cost data collected from medical records and questionnaires during the trial, and using data on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated from responses to the EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> generic quality-of-life measure at baseline, and 6 and 12&#x02005;months from randomisation. The mean incremental NHS costs in 2012/2013 prices were estimated to be &#x000a3;138 per patient (ie, the intervention was more expensive), and the mean incremental QALY gains were estimated to be 0.012. The estimated ICER was &#x000a3;10&#x02005;859, and the estimated net benefit at a threshold of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 was estimated to be &#x000a3;116 (95% CI: &#x02212;&#x000a3;58 to &#x000a3;291). The probability that the intervention was cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.77.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Model structure</title><p>Cohorts of 1000 patients were simulated. These cohorts were based on the characteristics of the 641 trial participants. Cohorts differed according to age at randomisation, sex and trial allocation of the patient groups modelled.

Sequences of states experienced by the simulated cohort members defined clinical pathways in which QALYs (associated with utilities and mortality) and costs were accumulated. Cost-effectiveness, as measured by the averages of costs and QALYs in each arm, was the primary outcome. These averages were calculated and allowed for the construction of net benefit statistics.

Using the relatively more rapid growth rates observed in female risk levels as a basis for extrapolation would have meant that at some ages, female risk was much higher than male risk. The use of male risk growth rates constrains female risk levels to be below male levels at all ages, ensures that risk does not rise above 100%, better reflects estimated prevalence of risk in males and females, and more generally ensures that the cost-effectiveness results are based on plausible risk profiles.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The QRISK2 algorithm is not validated for ages beyond 84.

The same assumption was used in Ara <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, few of the 1000 simulated participants approached experiencing three events, and therefore, the assumption is unlikely to have influenced cost-effectiveness conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Duration of effect of intervention</title><p>The duration of the effect of the Healthlines intervention on CVD risk beyond the end of trial follow-up is unknown, but the modelling thereof is the principal motivation for undertaking the simulation modelling described here. Four different scenarios based on different durations of effect were modelled, and their implications for cost-effectiveness compared. This is similar to the approach of Mistry <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The scenarios modelled are of durations of intervention effect of 1, 2 and 5&#x02005;years from baseline, and for remaining lifetime. If, for example, the duration effect is 2&#x02005;years, then participants in the intervention arm receive the benefit of lower risk for 2&#x02005;years, after which they are modelled as having the same sex- and age-adjusted risk as participants in the control arm. Similar logic applies to the other scenarios. In the case of a lifetime duration of effect, risk is permanently lower in the intervention arm. To avoid sudden &#x02018;jumps&#x02019; in risk at the point at which the intervention ends, the model uses a smoothing adjustment which calculates the average score of intervention arm risk and usual care risk for the year after which the modelled duration of effect expires.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data on utility</title><p>QALYs in year 0 of the model were obtained from participant responses to the EQ-5D-5L measure at baseline, 6 and 12&#x02005;months of RCT follow-up and were &#x02018;cross-walked&#x02019; to UK EQ-5D-3L instrument and valued using the Euroqol UK value set.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> QALYs were adjusted to account for between-arm differences observed at the end of trial follow-up. For other years of the model, age- and sex-adjusted population, EQ-5D norms were estimated from Ara and Brazier<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> to provide baseline utility scores that applied to the event-free state. These EQ-5D data were used to calculate QALYs.</p><p>Multiplicative adjustments, which assume a constant proportional effect on baseline utility,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> were made to reflect the decremental impact of experiencing CVD-related health states. Ara and Brazier<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> was used as the source of state-specific utilities other than TIA, which were drawn from Luengo-Fernandez <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and for unstable angina. It was assumed that the utility estimates for angina in Ara and Brazier related to stable angina; it was further assumed that utility associated with the unstable angina health state would be 90% of the stable angina values, as in Ara <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Condition-specific utility values were drawn from univariate normal distributions, as recommended by Ara and Wailoo,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> to reflect uncertainty in mean values. Utilities corresponding to postevent states were never lower than for the event state itself. This means, for example, that utilities of the &#x02018;poststroke&#x02019; event state were higher than or equal to the &#x02018;stroke&#x02019; state, implying that experiencing a stroke had a greater negative impact on average on patient utility than did experiencing the &#x02018;poststroke&#x02019; state.</p><p>It was assumed that the second and third events (such as second and third non-fatal strokes) had the same impact on utility as the first event.

The longer the assumed duration of effect, the more likely it is that the intervention is cost-effective at cost-effectiveness thresholds conventionally employed (ie, &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 per QALY). It is notable that, even if the beneficial effects of the intervention on CVD risk last only 1&#x02005;year, the intervention is likely to be cost-effective. This is also apparent in the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, where a monotonic relationship between duration of the probability of cost-effectiveness is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012355F2">figure 2</xref>). The corresponding cost-effectiveness planes for each scenario illustrate this point in a different way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012355F3">figure 3</xref>). At longer durations of effect, almost all of the 1000 simulated incremental cost/incremental pairs are in the northeast or southeast quadrants. At shorter durations, an increasing but still modest number of these pairs are in the northwest or southwest quadrants.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012355TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Base case cost-effectiveness results for different durations of effect: per-patient average costs and effects</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Modelled duration of effect<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02005;year</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x02005;years</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02005;years</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lifetime (permanent) effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control arm NHS costs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6595</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6617</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6608</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6602</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention arm NHS costs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6726</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6741</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6714</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6657</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control arm QALYs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.573</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.573</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.573</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.572</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention arm QALYs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.584</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.586</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.589</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.598</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incremental costs (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;131 (&#x000a3;125 to 138)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;124 (&#x000a3;118 to 130)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;107 (101 to 112)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;55 (49 to 61)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incremental QALYs (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.011 (0.011 to 0.011)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.013 (0.012 to 0.013)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.016 (0.016 to 0.017)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.026 (0.026 to 0.027)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICER</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;11&#x02005;776</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;9886</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;6477</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;2091</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probability cost-effective at &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 threshold</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.74</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.95</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probability cost-effective at &#x000a3;30&#x02005;000 threshold</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.87</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.93</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.99</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NMB at threshold of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;92 (&#x02212;172 to 352)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;127 (&#x02212;144 to 382)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;223 (&#x02212;153 to 468)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a3;472 (197 to 728)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CE, cost-effectiveness; ICER, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; NMB, net monetary benefit; QALYs, quality-adjusted life years.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012355F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves from lifetime simulation assuming different durations of effect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012355f02"/></fig><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012355F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Cost-effectiveness planes from lifetime simulation assuming different durations of effect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012355f03"/></fig><p>The small QRISK2 difference between arms means that the control and intervention groups have very similar risk profiles once the assumed duration of effect expires. The lifetime cost-effectiveness results are therefore influenced, especially at short durations of effect, by the inclusion of costs and QALYs observed during the 12-month period of trial follow-up. The between-arm cost and QALY differences in the initial 12&#x02005;months are propagated forward over the remaining lifetime of trial participants, and are more influential than the subsequent minor differences in costs and QALYs associated with different levels of simulated QRISK2. Nevertheless, the differences in QRISK2 are consequential at longer durations of effect, since they are associated with fewer CVD events in the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cost-effectiveness over the lifetime of participants in the Healthlines telehealth trial was estimated using a cohort simulation model. The probability of cost-effectiveness increased with longer durations of effect, but even with the shortest duration of effect, the intervention was estimated to be cost-effective. These results reflect the cost-effectiveness analysis at 12&#x02005;months: because of the small difference in QRISK2 between arms, the QALY difference observed at the end of trial follow-up has a major influence on lifetime cost-effectiveness.</p><p>The model is subject to a number of limitations. The quality of the output reflects the assumptions and data used to construct and populate the model. The QRISK2 algorithm is not validated for ages beyond 84, and we made an assumption as to growth in risk for the small number of simulated trial participants who lived to 85 and beyond.</p><p>As in all modelling exercises of this type, the results may be sensitive to structural assumptions, such as the number of health states modelled.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We cannot eliminate the possibility that alternative representations of clinical pathways may produce different conclusions. However, we have relied on a representation of health states that is consistent with the QRISK2 algorithm, the defined events (eg, stroke) of which are represented as distinct states in the model.</p><p>The model understates uncertainty associated with QRISK2 because the variance structures underlying the algorithm are not published or otherwise available, and the consequence of this is to narrow CIs around net monetary benefit statistics. This may have implications, in particular, for the probability of cost-effectiveness.</p><p>We have not accounted for non-health service costs, which may have consequences for carers and the wider economy for some of the conditions modelled, such as stroke.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, it is not clear if accounting for these costs would necessarily alter the between-arm comparison of cost-effectiveness, since slightly fewer fatal and non-fatal strokes would be experienced in the intervention arm.</p><p>Finally, the analysis does not identify the most plausible duration of effect. Evidence from long-term follow-up is necessary to conclusively answer this question, although synthesis of evidence from similar trials and relevant observational studies may also offer a useful complementary approach to long-term follow-up.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Comparison with other literature</title><p>Comparison of the findings of this study with other literature assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of interventions directed at managing CVD risk is complicated by differences in the study design used to inform the modelling, patient profiles and the nature of the interventions examined. However, the approach of using different assumed durations of effect, or different effect sizes, is encountered in similar studies.</p><p>For example, the evaluations of CVD interventions from a long-term perspective undertaken by Mistry <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Asaria <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and Penaloza-Ramos <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> are all sensitive to some degree to assumptions made concerning the duration of intervention effect. This is in spite of differences between these studies in population characteristics, CVD risk equation used and interventions studied, which preclude a comparison of the findings of the present study and these other analyses.</p><p>Studies also differ in the study design used to inform long-term cost-effectiveness modelling. The effect estimates used as the basis of modelling in our study are those of the &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019; analysis of the Healthlines RCT. This is a source of difference between the present paper and, for example, the economic modelling undertaken in support of the routine use of &#x02018;health checks&#x02019; in the NHS in England.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The economic model developed to analyse the consequences of these health checks was based on a much more extensive simulation involving synthesis of various model parameters, compliance rates and effect estimates from a variety of sources.</p><p>Ultimately, although modelling and evidence synthesis will continue to be important sources of evidence in this area, definitive evidence on the long-term consequences for CVD risk of Healthlines (and similar interventions) will require RCTs with long-term follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Healthlines telehealth service is likely to be cost-effective for individuals with raised CVD risk when a lifetime perspective is adopted. Results are somewhat sensitive to the assumed duration of intervention effect. When considering the deployment of large-scale telehealth programmes in this area, decision makers may need to consider the longevity of the behavioural and other changes rendered by the type of telehealth service studied in the Healthlines RCT, alongside other evidence concerning the long-term cost-effectiveness of similar interventions for CVD risk.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are very grateful to all patients, healthcare professionals, Health Information Advisors and other NHS Direct staff who contributed time and effort to make the Healthlines trial possible.
