Most vertebral fractures are precipitated by everyday activities rather than falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and occurrence of a vertebral fracture is a powerful risk factor for future fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Vertebral fractures are associated with increased mortality, long-term morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and considerable health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] that are predicted to increase markedly over the period to 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Vertebral fractures, even those not recognized clinically, are also associated with substantial back pain and functional limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and significant loss of quality-of-life (QoL). Both mental and physical domains of quality of life may be affected, and impairment is directly related to both severity and number of fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Strontium ranelate is an oral anti-osteoporotic drug that has been shown to prevent bone loss and increase bone strength in experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Strontium ranelate increased bone formation in vitro, enhancing pre-osteoblastic cell replication and osteoblastic differentiation and decreasing abilities of osteoblasts to induce osteoclastogenesis via the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) and an increase in the OPG/RANKL ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, strontium ranelate 2&#x000a0;g/day increased bone mineral density (BMD) in a placebo-controlled, 2-year dose&#x02013;response study in 353 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention (SOTI) trial was designed to evaluate efficacy of strontium ranelate (2&#x000a0;g/day) in reducing vertebral fractures. Over the first year and first 3&#x000a0;years of treatment, strontium ranelate treatment was associated with reductions of 49% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and 41% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), respectively, relative to placebo, in the risk of vertebral fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Strontium ranelate has also shown significant efficacy against peripheral fractures and hip fractures in patient at risk over 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The purpose of the present article is to present results from the SOTI trial relating to vertebral fracture risk, changes in BMD and QoL for the 4-year initial treatment period, and also BMD results from the fifth-year treatment-switch period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Post-menopausal (&#x02265;5&#x000a0;years) women were ambulatory Caucasian, &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years of age with at least one prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fracture.

Secondary criteria included new clinical vertebral fractures, osteoporotic peripheral fractures, changes in body height, <sub>L2&#x02013;L4</sub>BMD, total hip and femoral neck BMD, bone turnover markers, and quality-of-life.</p><p>For the fifth-year treatment-switch period, the primary efficacy criterion was <sub>L2&#x02013;L4</sub>BMD. Secondary criteria included total hip and femoral neck BMD, new vertebral fractures, and bone turnover markers.</p><p>Vertebral fractures were determined from radiographs taken at baseline (M0) and annually thereafter. Radiographs were analyzed semi-quantitatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with a new vertebral fracture defined as a change from grade 0 to grade 1 or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Clinical vertebral fractures were defined as new or worsening fractures with back pain and/or body height loss of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;cm. Radiographs were assessed centrally (CEMO, France; Pr C. Roux).</p><p>Peripheral osteoporotic fractures were determined by investigators from radiographs or hospital reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Standing body height was standardized and measured by Harpenden stadiometer at all visits.</p><p>Total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using Hologic devices at baseline and every 6&#x000a0;months post-baseline. A cross-calibration program was performed throughout the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and all scans were analyzed centrally. Strontium distributes in bone and absorbs X-rays to a greater extent than calcium. The presence of strontium may account for approximately 50% of BMD increases measured by DXA with strontium ranelate treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Bone turnover markers were assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of treatment, and then annually during 4&#x000a0;years; during the fifth year, they were assessed only in patients treated for 4&#x000a0;years with strontium ranelate and after 51 and 60&#x000a0;months of treatment. Bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP) was assayed by immunoradiometric assay (Tandem&#x000ae;-R Ostase&#x000ae;, Beckman Coulter, formerly Hybritech, San Diego, CA, USA), and serum C-telopeptide cross-link of type I collagen (sCTX) was assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (serum CrossLaps&#x000ae;ELISA&#x02014;Nordic Bioscience Diagnostic, formerly Osteometer BioTech, Herlev, Denmark).</p><p>Parathyroid hormone was assessed with an immunoradiometric assay (N-tact&#x000ae;PTH SP IRMA, Diasorin, USA).</p><p>QoL was assessed using self-administered questionnaires: the Short-Form 36 (SF-36&#x000ae;), a widely used generic 36-item instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and QUALIOST&#x000ae;, a disease-specific 23-item instrument designed to complement the SF-36&#x000ae; in postmenopausal patients with vertebral osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Both questionnaires were completed every 6&#x000a0;months throughout the trial. In the SF-36&#x000ae;, items are grouped into eight dimensions, which were further combined into summary scores for mental and physical components. In each case, scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QoL. QUALIOST&#x000ae; contains two dimensions, physical (10 items) and emotional (13 items). Scores again range from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. One QUALIOST&#x000ae; item (physical dimension item 6) relates specifically to back pain. The QUALIOST&#x000ae; cross-cultural validity and responsiveness have been validated using earlier (3-year) data from the present (SOTI) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Randomized assignment of treatment was stratified by country and performed using permutation blocks with a fixed size of four.</p><p>All these pre-planned efficacy analyses were performed in accordance with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. For the M0&#x02013;M48 period, ITT population for fracture incidence analysis was defined as all randomized patients who took at least one sachet of study drug and with (at least two) X-ray assessments between M0 and M48. For the M48&#x02013;M60 period, ITT population was defined as all patients who performed the M48 visit, took at least one sachet of study drug between M0 and M48 and after M48, with validated <sub>L2&#x02013;L4</sub>DXA measurements at M0 and M48, and post M48. The ITT population for QoL analysis comprised patients from the ITT population who had at least one assessable SF-36&#x000ae; (i.e., &#x0003c;50% missing data) and one assessable QUALIOST&#x000ae; completed at baseline, plus at least one assessable SF36&#x000ae; and one assessable QUALIOST&#x000ae; completed post baseline (&#x0003e;12&#x000a0;months, until 4&#x000a0;years of treatment).</p><p>For the 4-year analysis, the incidence over time of patients with at least one new osteoporotic vertebral fracture and new clinical vertebral fracture were analyzed by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Analysis of osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures was therefore carried out on all available data (under treatment or not) up to the cutoff date of the new vertebral fracture, whatever the date of the last study visit for the patients considered. Consequently, as the population selection bias phenomenon increases year after year, any isolated yearly statistical comparison regarding fracture occurrence would provide biased (as well as inaccurate) estimates and would lead to misleading clinical interpretation. Therefore, treatment groups were compared using the Cox model over 4&#x000a0;years.</p><p>The incidence of vertebral fractures was adjusted for age, country, prevalent vertebral fractures, and <sub>L2&#x02013;L4</sub>BMD and incidence of non-vertebral fractures was adjusted for age, country, body mass index, and femoral neck BMD. A log-rank non-parametric test was used to confirm results of the Cox model. Between-group comparisons of BMD and bone markers were performed using covariance analysis with baseline value as covariate and two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> tests. Between-group comparison of body height was performed on the change from baseline using a covariance analysis adjusted on height at baseline and prevalent vertebral fracture. The number of patients in each group with a body height loss of &#x02265;1&#x000a0;cm was compared using the chi-squared test.</p><p>For the fifth-year treatment-switch period (M48 to M60), annual incidence of new vertebral fracture was estimated using a within-group 95% confidence interval of the estimates with Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Within-group comparisons of BMD were performed using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for paired samples and between-group comparisons using the same test for independent samples. Bone markers were analyzed using descriptive statistics. At entry in the fifth year, a between-group comparison on BMD (lumbar and femoral neck level) and on corresponding <italic>T</italic> scores was performed using a two-sided Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples.</p><p>Between-group comparisons of the SF-36&#x000ae; and QUALIOST&#x000ae; total and component scores at each time point were performed using a repeated-measures analysis (mixed model), followed, in the case of non-significant treatment&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time interaction, by Fisher&#x02019;s test. Analysis was first performed on raw data and confirmed by repeating with imputation of missing data. Missing data were replaced, taking into account fracture status of each patient. For example, for patients who had experienced a fracture and for whom the questionnaire was missing after they had their fracture, the average change in score seen in patients after they experienced a fracture was added to the last available score for that patient. Missing items within questionnaires had already been taken into account when calculating scores, with dimension scores being calculated as the mean of non-missing items only if at least half of the items in that dimension had been answered. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline score as covariate, was performed to compare between groups the changes between baseline and last value and between baseline and last value on treatment. The number of patients free from back pain (QUALIOST&#x000ae; item 6) in each group was compared using Poisson regression.</p><p>The type I error rate was set at 5% throughout.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed by Servier, and the study was organized under the control of independent advisory and steering committees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>Adverse events reported spontaneously by patients or elicited during interview were recorded at each study visit. Blood and urinary calcium and blood phosphorus were assessed at each visit. Hematology and biochemistry tests were performed at M0, M6, M12, and then annually.

At M60, 1,070 patients completed the study; however, 880 patients, representing 76.6% of those who entered the fifth year, were included in the ITT population at M60. The reasons for exclusion of these 190 patients were absence of treatment from M48 and absence of assessable lumbar BMD at baseline, M48, or after M48.</p><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of randomized patients are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There were no relevant between-group differences. At entry to the fifth-year treatment-switch period, BMD values and corresponding <italic>T</italic>-scores were lower in patients on placebo during the 4-year treatment period.

Comparisons of cumulative endpoints at different times during a long-term study must therefore be interpreted with caution. The patients at risk of a given endpoint, although well balanced between treatment groups in terms of disease characteristics and level of risk at randomization, become progressively unbalanced (for example, due to censoring of fracture cases, attrition of more severely affected patients, and introduction of concomitant osteoporosis medication) over time if treatments differ in efficacy. Attrition of high-risk patients will be more rapid in the low efficacy (generally placebo) group.</p><p>In the later parts of the study, therefore, the placebo group will effectively contain fewer high-risk patients than the active treatment group, and the effects of active treatment will appear to be reduced.</p><p>The vertebral antifracture efficacy of strontium ranelate over 4&#x000a0;years in this study has also been confirmed over 5&#x000a0;years in the Treatment of Peripheral Osteoporosis study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Many factors contribute to bone fragility that leads to osteoporotic fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One important mechanism is the progressive net loss of bone due to a greater degree of bone resorption than formation at focal remodeling sites, leading to an overall deficit in bone formation in later adult life. In postmenopausal women, the rate of net bone loss is accelerated by an increase in the intensity of bone remodeling in response to reduced estrogen levels. Antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates and raloxifene reduce the rate of bone remodeling, reflected in decreases in markers of both bone formation and bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Strontium ranelate appears to have a different mode of operation. In various animal models, strontium ranelate has been shown to prevent bone loss by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">34</xref>]. These in vivo results were consistent with in vitro data where strontium ranelate has been shown to reduce bone resorption by osteoclasts and to stimulate bone formation by osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It has been demonstrated in vitro that strontium ranelate is an agonist of the CaR and is able to stimulate the replication of osteoblasts through the activation of CaR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">36</xref>]. CaR is one of the major molecular determinants involved in controlling the cations concentration through regulation of PTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">37</xref>]. The slight decrease in serum calcium and PTH in association with a slight increase in blood phosphorus observed in this study is in agreement with an action mediated through the CaR in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Consistent with the dual mode of action of strontium ranelate, analysis of serum markers of bone metabolism over the first 3 and 4&#x000a0;years of the SOTI study showed that strontium ranelate treatment was associated with a small but significant increase in bALP and a significant decrease in sCTX, relative to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Following treatment withdrawal, results obtained were in agreement with this dual mode of action as they show a significant decrease in bALP and an increase in sCTX. These changes are already observed 3&#x000a0;months after treatment discontinuation, suggesting a relatively rapid release of strontium from bone.</p><p>In the present analysis, patients who continued on strontium ranelate in the main treatment period and in the treatment-switch period showed a progressive increase in BMD throughout the entire 5-year period. The increase in lumbar BMD from M48 to end in the SR/SR group (1.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.8%) is clinically significantly smaller than in the placebo/SR group (5.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.3%). Increase of bone density with strontium ranelate may be due to different effects: increase in bone mass, increase in the degree of mineralization, or artifactual increase of BMD due to the presence of strontium in bone. Studies on bone biopsies have demonstrated that the degree of mineralization is not modified compared to placebo after 3&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Regarding the bone strontium content, it has been demonstrated that bone strontium content reached a plateau after 3&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This plateau might explain at least partly the smaller increase in BMD after 4&#x000a0;years of treatment compared to the first year of treatment and suggested that strontium ranelate continue to increase bone mass despite the plateau observed in bone strontium content. Furthermore, a strong relationship between the increase in BMD and a subsequent reduction of the risk to have a new vertebral or hip fracture have been demonstrated in strontium ranelate-treated patients indicating that BMD may be of interest to monitor those patients for 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. After treatment withdrawal, patients who switched to placebo at 4&#x000a0;years experienced a significant reduction in BMD, showing effects of strontium ranelate to be progressively reversible and reflecting clearance of strontium from bone. Decrease observed after treatment cessation is also suggesting that BMD may be followed up after a treatment with strontium ranelate.</p><p>After 3&#x000a0;years, strontium ranelate treatment was associated with significant beneficial effect on QoL, relative to placebo, assessed by QUALIOST&#x000ae;, a validated disease-targeted QoL instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These results are confirmed after 4&#x000a0;years of treatment: Both the emotional and physical components of the global QUALIOST&#x000ae; score were improved in comparison to placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.012 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.034, respectively).</p><p>Relative to baseline, placebo-treated patients showed an initial improvement in global QUALIOST&#x000ae; score at the 6-month assessment, followed by a progressive worsening throughout the remainder of the 4-year treatment period, with scores at the last four assessments worse than at baseline. The strontium ranelate group showed significant benefits on QoL, relative to baseline, at all assessments, indicating that strontium ranelate prevented or delayed the progressive worsening of QoL with time seen in placebo-treated osteoporotic women.</p><p>The magnitude of the difference in the change of QUALIOST&#x000ae; total score from baseline to last assessment between the strontium ranelate and placebo groups was clinically relevant as it reached approximately 2.0; this may be compared with the difference of 1.38 observed using the same instrument between patients with one new osteoporotic fracture and patients without new fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is important to note that these changes represent predominantly the long-term effects of fractures on QoL; soon after the occurrence of fracture, the impact on QoL may be larger.</p><p>Although the impact of osteoporotic fractures on QoL has been explored in several studies, there have been relatively few studies evaluating the effects of anti-osteoporotic drugs on QoL. One year of treatment with alendronate or calcitonin significantly reduced pain and improved QoL compared with calcium supplementation in a study of 151 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Raloxifene treatment had no significant effect, relative to placebo, on QoL over 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A meta-analysis of five studies indicated that teriparatide treatment reduced the risk of new or worsening back pain, although wider QoL was not evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first large, long-term randomized study to demonstrate preplanned beneficial effects of an anti-osteoporotic drug on back pain and QoL.</p><p>In conclusion, in this 5-year randomized trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, long-term treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day was associated with a 33% reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures, relative to placebo, over a 4-year treatment period. The reduction in fractures was accompanied by a significant improvement in QoL and increase in the number of patients free of back pain. BMD increased progressively throughout 4 and 5 years of strontium ranelate treatment, and began to decline in those patients switched from strontium ranelate to placebo at 4 years. This decrease in BMD following treatment cessation may have reflected strontium elimination from bone. Strontium ranelate represents an effective first-line intervention for long-term treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Servier.</p><p><bold>Conflicts of interest</bold> Dr. Colette and Mr. Marquis have no conflict of interest.
