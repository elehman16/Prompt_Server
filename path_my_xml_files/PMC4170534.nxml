Since inflammation is a key component in the pathophysiology of asthma, anti-inflammatory drugs especially corticosteroids are typically prescribed. Vitamin D was also found to be anti-inflammatory in many tissues and lung tissue also one among. Vitamin D significantly decreases regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted (a proinflammatory molecule that attracts monocytes, T cells and eosinophils) and IP-10 (a proinflammatory mediator that recruits activated T cells, mast cells and natural killer cells).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Despite a day-to-day foods are fortified with vitamin D, many studies have shown an absolute deficiency of vitamin D in many people. Vitamin D deficiency leads to increased bronchial hyper responsiveness and reduced pulmonary function.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Nearly, 5-15% of patients with asthma symptoms and exacerbation are uncontrolled despite of routine controller medications including corticosteroids. Therefore, they are more prone to have irreversible obstruction of airflow and also associated with airway remodeling.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] If vitamin D plays either preventive or protective role against the development of asthma, then it could be the most effective therapy.</p><p>Very few studies[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have considered this point and evaluated the relationship between vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and pulmonary function and there is no clinical study report from Indian adult population to explore the role of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in asthma. Thus, the present study was undertaken to study whether or not vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can improve pulmonary function in mild to moderate persistent asthma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study protocol and recruitment</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (330/IEC/2012) and it was undertaken in Pulmonary Medicine department in SRM Medical College hospital and research center, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India. The study was conducted according to the International Conference for Harmonization good clinical practice guidelines, 2008 amendment. This is a randomized, open-labeled, pilot study. A total of 63 patients completed the study. Patients were aged between 35 and 65 years, either sex, without co-morbidities and mild to moderate persistent condition were included in the study. Patient with a history of cardiac disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pregnant women and lactating mothers, significant hepatic and renal dysfunction, intolerance to vitamin D supplementation and voluntary withdrawal were excluded from the study. Written consent was obtained from all the patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>Patients satisfying above study criteria were enrolled in the study. Enrolled patients were randomized by randomization chart generated by computer assisted random allocation procedure. Patients were divided into two groups namely usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and intervention care (<italic>n</italic> = 32) groups. Clinical information relevant for the study was collected from the patients, health-care professionals, necessary records and as well as from patient's bystanders in few cases. Anti-asthmatic drugs prescribed until date were stopped and the patients were asked to take salbutamol inhaler (i.e., rescue medication) whenever necessary for a 7-day (run-in period) prior to the study. Patients were educated and counseled about the proper usage of inhalers. Usual care group patients received budesonide 400 &#x000b5;g with formoterol 24 &#x000b5;g daily. This is the fixed dose combination (FDC). One puff contained 200 &#x000b5;g budesonide and 6 &#x000b5;g formoterol. Patients had taken two puffs morning and two puffs night. Intervention care group patients received the same FDC plus vitamin D<sub>3</sub> tablet (1000 IU). All patients could take short acting &#x003b2;-agonist in case of an asthmatic crisis. All the patient's clinical symptoms and pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>] by spirometry) were measured at baseline and every follow-up days, i.e., day 30, 60 and 90. Each and every follow-up, patient medication adherence and their inhaler usage technique were monitored.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of not less than 30 was considered for this pilot study.

Antiasthma drugs are classified into the controller and preventive medications. Among the controller medications, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is the mainstay and the use of ICS is considered as one of the best treatment options for patients with mild to moderate asthma condition.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, not all the patients achieve the asthma treatment goal with corticosteroid, because, asthma is a multi-factorial disease where inflammation alone is not playing the role. The pathophysiology of asthma is complicated. Recent data indicate that current pharmacotherapy for asthma is inadequate to control asthma.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, there is a need to identify the cause of asthma and treatment should be aimed at the identified risk.</p><p>Studies carried out in an animal model reported that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> pre-treated groups enhanced the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy in a mouse allergic asthma model.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bergman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] 2012 studied the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation to reduce the disease burden in patients with frequent respiratory tract infection. They evidenced their report from both per protocol analysis and intention-to-treat models.</p><p>Gergen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] examined the relationship between serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels and allergic diseases. They found that higher the serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentration, lower in total IgE levels and peripheral eosinophil counts. Black and Scragg[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also revealed a strong relationship between serum concentration of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and pulmonary function parameters like FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity.</p><p>Iqbal and Freishtat 2011[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] analyzed the various factors and the role of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in asthma. They concluded that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> acts on lung tissue and to improve immune function and reduce inflammation. However, they did not give any ample evidence that vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has the potential to improve pulmonary function. Studies carried out in pediatric population[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also not reported any definitive proof of improved clinical symptoms of asthma with the adjunctive therapy of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Recently Gergen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied the relationship between serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentration and prevalence of asthma with severity and response of asthma treatment. The study concluded that overall vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentrations were low in two samples of adolescents and they were not reliably linked with the presence of asthma or asthma morbidity.</p><p>From the above contradictory statement, we could not come to a conclusion whether vitamin D<sub>3</sub> has a role on asthma condition or not. Thus, the present study was undertaken and the study was designed as open-labeled, randomized trial.</p><p>Dupont <italic>et al</italic>. 2005[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed an improvement in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms with add-on leukotriene receptor antagonist therapy, for a period of 2 months in an open- labeled study with insufficiently controlled asthma patients with ICS and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists as FDC. Shah <italic>et al</italic>., 2006; Korn <italic>et al</italic>., 2009; Keith <italic>et al</italic>., 2009[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] studied the effectiveness of controller medications as add on therapy to ICS, in improving lung functions and asthma symptoms. All these studies were carried out for a period of 8 weeks. With this background, a period of 90 days study duration in the present study was relatively considered to be sufficient to identify the effectiveness of study medications along with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation. However, this may be the limitation of this study, since the present study could not measure the asthma exacerbations in the long-term control. The study is designed as an open-label study. This may be another weakness of the study, but in routine clinical practice, blinding of the drug is not appropriate and the data obtained are suitable to real life setting.</p><p>The present study did not measure the level of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in the blood. This is the major limitation of the study. Future studies can be directed towards this direction. Nevertheless, our study has some special features. For instance, we gave 1000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as a daily dose. Other studies used lower doses of vitamin D3[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and importantly, there are no clinical data on mild to moderate persistent asthma patients especially from the south Indian population. Thus, supplementation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in asthma is an innovative tactic in improving pulmonary function.</p><p>The finding of this suggests that the addition of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> to the regular treatment regimen improves pulmonary function. In recent days, an important talk and task among the researchers is to find the exact mechanism through which vitamin D<sub>3</sub> exerts its pharmacological action on bronchial airways. However it is very complicated to retort the above. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> acts on numerous ways to control asthma[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the important ways are: It inhibits bronchial smooth muscle cell proliferation and remodeling and thereby, inhibits the synthesis and release of cytokines. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> acts on mast cells and inhibits the differentiation and maturation of mast cells and down-regulate the expression of CD4+ and CD8+ cells to allergic airways. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> enhances interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; synthesis by acting on dentric and regulatory cells respectively.</p><p>In the present randomized, open-labeled study there is an evidence for improvement in pulmonary function clinically as well as statistically on supplementation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. If the dietary intake of vitamin D fails to meet the recommended daily allowance, health-care professionals may encourage the asthma people to increase their intake of vitamin D, preferably through the consumption of healthy food sources rich in vitamin D or otherwise through the use of appropriate vitamin supplements. However, considering an open-label design, future studies may be directed toward longer duration followed by serum estimation of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D to substantiate the current findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rajanandh</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Nageswari</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Ilango</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influence of demographic status on pulmonary function, quality of life and symptom scores in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma</article-title><source>J Exp Clin Med</source><year>2014</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>102</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pauwels</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Busse</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>YZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohlsson</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Early intervention with budesonide in mild persistent asthma: A randomised, double-blind trial</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2003</year><volume>361</volume><fpage>1071</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12672309</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holgate</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Polosa</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of severe asthma in adults</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2006</year><volume>368</volume><fpage>780</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16935689</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alyasin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Momen</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kashef</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Alipour</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Amin</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The relationship between serum 25 hydroxy vitamin d levels and asthma in children</article-title><source>Allergy Asthma Immunol Res</source><year>2011</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>251</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21966605</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mody</surname><given-names>RK</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of asthma in an urban population.
