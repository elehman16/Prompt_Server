Because of patients&#x02019; growing expectation on comfort during medical procedures, it is not surprising that the demand for sedation also expands. Propofol in combination with alfentanil is known to provide excellent analgosedation, however, its use is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Acupuncture could be a technique to reduce drug requirement while providing the same level of sedation and analgesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study will be performed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 153 patients scheduled for propofol/alfentanil sedation during colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture (P6, ST36, LI4), sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, NIBP, exCO<sub>2,</sub> OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. The primary outcome parameter is the dosage of propofol necessary for an adequate level of sedation to tolerate the procedure (OAA/S&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4). Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels measured by questionnaires is the secondary outcome parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Moderate to deep sedation using propofol is increasingly applied during colonoscopies with a high satisfaction level among patients despite well-known hemodynamic and respiratory side effects of this hypnotic agent. Acupuncture is known to attenuate gastrointestinal discomfort and pain. We hypothesize that the combination of conventional sedation techniques with acupuncture may result in equally satisfied patients with a lower risk of respiratory and hemodynamic events during colonoscopies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered in the Nederland&#x02019;s Trial Register NTR <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=4325">4325</ext-link>.</p><p>The first patient was randomized on 13 February 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Procedural sedation</kwd><kwd>Propofol</kwd><kwd>Acupuncture</kwd><kwd>Colonoscopy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Colonoscopies are known to be uncomfortable for patients. Pain and vasovagal reactions often necessitate administration of sedative or analgesic agents, or even the combination of both.</p><p>Propofol as a sedative agent has a rapid onset and termination of action, making it the ideal choice for endoscopic procedures. The most important disadvantage -especially in combination with an opioid- is the risk of a rapid change from conscious to deep sedation or even general anaesthesia with consecutive cardiorespiratory depression. Therefore, an important clinical question is, how to reduce the necessary dosage of propofol and the risks involved while retaining a satisfactory sedation for patient and endoscopist. Additional acupuncture could be an option to solve this problem.</p><p>Acupuncture is used worldwide for different indications, mainly for pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, only few publications exist with respect to the role of acupuncture for sedation during gastrointestinal procedures. Fanti et al. could show that the combination of LI4, S36, SP6 and SP9 can decrease the demand for sedative drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Leung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] demonstrated that electro-acupuncture at P6, ST36 and LI4 can reduce discomfort and pain during barostat-induced rectal distension. Ni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found a significant reduction in stress response and dosage of midazolam during colonoscopy by acupuncture using ST36, ST37, SP6, SP9, and LI4.</p><p>However, it is not clear whether these effects are a result of acupuncture or simply a strong placebo effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The theoretical basis of acupuncture is still not known. Two reviews report that there is no evidence for an effect of &#x02018;true&#x02019; acupuncture over acupuncture at &#x0201c;non points&#x0201d; (sham-acupuncture) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Release of neurotransmitters, parasympathetic disinhibition, or even placebo effect could also be explanations for the acupuncture results. Until now no study demonstrated a link between these effects and specific acupuncture points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim of the study</title><p>We hypothesize that &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; acupuncture causes besides an analgesic also a sedative effect that will lead to a reduction of the dosage of propofol needed for satisfactory sedation during colonoscopies.</p><p>Satisfactory sedation is defined as an Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAA/S) level 2/3. Target controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol is adapted to achieve this targeted level of sedation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis we will compare three groups. Group 1 will receive verum-acupuncture at the traditional acupuncture points P6, ST36, LI4, group 2 will get sham-acupuncture and group 3 will be the control group with placebo needles.</p><p>All three groups will receive standard sedation with propofol TCI/alfentanil.</p><p>Primary endpoint of the study is the used dosage of propofol - in combination with a limited dosage of alfentanil.</p><p>Secondary endpoint is patients&#x02019; and gastroenterologists&#x02019; satisfaction with the procedure, determined with validated questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is designed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial and reported following the STRICTA (Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) reporting guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Number of patients&#x02019; needed</title><p>Sample size calculation is based on observational propofol data from previous colonoscopies, collected in our hospital sedation database.

The Marsh pharmacokinetic model is employed to attain a pre-set propofol plasma target level.</p><p>The targeted sedation score &#x02013; measured by Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation OAAS Scale - should be 2 or 3, which means patients response maximal lethargic if their name is called loudly and/or repeatedly or after mild prodding or shaking.</p><p>If OAA/S&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4, which means that the patient is too alert or agitated to tolerate the procedure, additional sedation will be provided with step up of the TCI.</p><p>Additionally, when starting propofol TCI, patients will be given 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg alfentanil.</p><p>We use the Behavioural Pain Scale for not-intubated patients (BPS-NI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The BPS&#x02013;NI evaluates three behavioural domains (i.e., facial expression, movements of upper limbs and vocalization).

Nickel needles (Asia-med, Germany, Special No. 16 (0.30x30 mm / (Gauge 8x1.2") will be placed and left in their position for five minutes prior and throughout the endoscopic procedure. We choose the following points, which are considered relevant both - for sedation and for abdominal distension: Pericardium 6 (P6), Stomach 36 (ST36), and Large intestine 4 (LI4). The localization of these points is described in units of cun. Cun is a traditional Chinese unit of length. One cun is defined as the width of a persons thumb, whereas four fingers are defined as 3 cun. This corresponds to about 3&#x000a0;cm of length.</p><p>There are no specific acupuncture points known for their sedative effect. Large intestine 4 (LI4), Pericardium 6 (P6) and Stomach 36 (ST36) is the most used combination to reduce gastrointestinal discomfort and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] with a consecutive sedation side effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pericard 6 (P6) is stimulated with various acupuncture techniques, especially used for preventing and treatment of nausea and vomiting.

The Departments of Anesthesiology and Gastroenterology &#x00026; Hepatology of the Academic Medical Centre of Amsterdam are responsible for the design and conduct of the trial. The protocol was designed according to the Standards for reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials Acupuncture (STRICTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is registered in the Nederland&#x02019;s Trial Register (NTR NTR4325). Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherland (NL). The National Authority, the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO), performed a marginal review and there were no objections to perform this study (NL36861.018.11).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p>One might discuss to analyse the data using a non-inferiority approach because sedation quality after application of acupuncture should be at least as good as using medication only.</p><p>However, our motivation in the end to choose for the superiority approach was: During this trial acupuncture is performed by only one experienced acupuncturist. Implementing acupuncture in our daily anaesthesia sedation praxis would mean additional engagement of anaesthesia personal to learn and perform acupuncture. This investment will only be cost-effective if the dosage of propofol is reduced or - in case of the dosage of propofol is not influenced, there is an improvement of satisfaction among patients and endoscopist.</p><p>Alongside, safety concerns of deep sedation performed with propofol still remain. Cote et al. showed that hypoxemia occurred in 12.8&#x000a0;% of 799 patients sedated for endoscopic procedures with propofol applied by trained anaesthesia nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In 14.4&#x000a0;% of the patients airway manoeuvres were necessary to prevent hypoxemia. In our own previous study looking at 180 patients undergoing colonoscopy, 47&#x000a0;% of all patients with propofol sedation experienced at least one respiratory incident and 87&#x000a0;% had at least one hypotensive event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Minimizing those propofol related risks by means of a superior sedation form is therefore an important goal to make sedation procedures safer.</p><p>Aside these considerations all groups receive propofol sedation and therefore using placebo needles is not an unethical treatment.</p><p>Another point of discussion comes up with the question: Does acupuncture really have a sedative effect or is this effect the consequence of its analgesic properties.</p><p>Fanti et al. studied three groups of patients scheduled for colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Group 1 got acupuncture, group 2 sham-acupuncture and group 3 placebo. All groups were premedicated with 0.02-mg/kg midazolam before, and no analgesic agent was used. If patients complained about pain during procedure they received additional boluses of midazolam. To medicate a patient moaning about pain with a sedative and to conclude that acupuncture can decrease the demand for sedatives during colonoscopy is not the correct conclusion.</p><p>So the question whether acupuncture can reduce the dosage of sedative, and be implemented into the clinical routine as a complementary sedative method has still to be answered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first patient was included at 13 February 2014.
