hamstring extensibility and pain intensity in patients with nonspecific low back pain.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four patients with nonspecific low back pain (27&#x02013;46 years of
age) enrolled in the study. All participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
Graston technique group (n=12) and a static stretching group (n=12). The Graston Technique
was used on the hamstring muscles of the experimental group, while the static stretching
group performed static stretching. Hamstring extensibility was recorded using the sit and
reach test, and a visual analog scale was used to measure pain intensity. [Results] Both
groups showed a significant improvement after intervention. In comparison to the static
stretching group, the Graston technique group had significantly more improvement in
hamstring extensibility. [Conclusion] The Graston Technique is a simple and effective
intervention in nonspecific low back pain patients to improve hamstring extensibility and
lower pain intensity, and it would be beneficial in clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Nonspecific low back pain</kwd><kwd>Hamstring</kwd><kwd>Graston Technique</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is a condition experienced at least once by more than 80% of the human
race the world over<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. More than 85% of
cases of LBP in the USA are classified as nonspecific LBP defined by tension, soreness,
and/or stiffness of the lower back with unknown origins of pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Back pain causes decreased lumbar extensibility, limited
range of motion (LOM) and gait ability, and change of rhythm in the pelvis, limitations that
can restrict social activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of
the most widely studied outcomes in LBP patients is the reduction of hamstring
extensibility<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The hamstring is responsible for hip extension and knee flexion along with providing
stability of the hip and knee joints during walking<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. A shortening of the hamstring may result in LOM of the knee joint,
restricting a person&#x02019;s ability to walk and run. In addition, it increases posterior pelvic
tilting and reduces lumbar lordosis, contributing to a flat back that can result in back
pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Objective evaluation tools to easily assess the extensibility of the hamstring include the
sit and reach test (SRT), the passive toe touch test, and the straight leg raise (SLR) test.
The SRT is the method most commonly used in clinics<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Methods for increasing the length of the shortened hamstring include stretching, eccentric
resistance exercise, Graston instrument soft tissue mobilization, and self-myofascial
release<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recently, Graston instrument soft tissue mobilization has been reported to be effective in
promoting the extensibility of the shortened hamstring<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Graston Technique (GT) is a soft tissue mobilization treatment
method using a tool that generates mechanical micro-traumatic damage to the treated area. It
thus creates an inflammatory response to accelerate the healing process and restore
flexible, normal tissue. This technique seems to have the therapeutic effects of inhibiting
the adhesion of tissue, increasing the number of fibroblasts, and promoting collagen
synthesis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although there are several studies related to Graston instrument soft tissue mobilization
and shortened hamstrings, only healthy volunteers have been included in these studies<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in this study, nonspecific low
back pain (NSLBP) patients with shortened hamstrings were monitored.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the GT on hamstring extensibility
and pain intensity in patients with NSLBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 24 patients with LBP selected from the staff and student population of
Gachon university (except to the department of physical therapy and occupational therapy),
located in Incheon.

Prior to the experiment, the gender, age, and hamstring length of all
subjects were recorded after an interview and screening test. Participant selection criteria
were as follows: the patient should have (1) a history of NSLBP for at least 2 months (2) a
finger-to-ground distance greater than 0&#x02005;cm (3) a passive SLR angle of 70&#x000b0; or less (4) most
of the knee touching the chest in the passive hip-flexion test for those with normal
movement of the hip joint (5) no neurological signs, and (6) a visual analog scale (VAS)
score of more than three. Furthermore, all patients who participated in this trial provided
a signed written consent form after having the expected outcomes and side effects fully
explained. This study was approved by the Gachon University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The SRT was used along with the Sitting Trunk Flexion Meter (TAKEI, Japan). This test
involves sitting on the floor with the legs stretched out straight in front of the body.
Shoes are removed. The soles of the feet are placed flat against a box, and the trunk flexed
forward. With both knees locked and the back of the legs pressed flat to the floor, the
subject reaches forward along the measuring line as far as possible. After some practice
reaches, the subject holds that position for 5 seconds while the distance is recorded. The
measurement was taken three times at the same time and place, and the average was recorded.
No vigorous exercise was performed prior to the measurement. The SRT for hamstring
flexibility is likely to have moderate criterion-related validity (0.39&#x02013;0.89)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A VAS was used to assess the level of LBP in the subjects. A VAS is usually a horizontal
line, 100&#x02005;mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. The patient marks on the
line the point that subjectively matches his or her pain level and is thus scored from 0 to
10 points<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the graston technique group
(GT group, n=12) or the static stretching group (SS group, n=12). The GT was used on the
hamstrings of the GT group, while the SS group performed static stretches on the hamstring
muscle. The experiment involved one mediator and one evaluator. During the course of the
experiment, the mediator was unaware of the evaluation results. Additionally, the evaluator
did not know to which group the subjects were assigned. Both before and after training,
flexibility and pain levels were assessed by the evaluator. The SRT was performed three
times with the subjects taking 5-minute breaks between each test. Then, each group received
or performed the intervention for 60 seconds and was retested after a 5-minute break.</p><p>The GT group received soft tissue mobilization of the hamstring muscle with the Graston
instrument using GT number 1 (GT-1). First, the subject lay prone and bent the knee joint to
around 30&#x000b0; to 60&#x000b0;. After applying massage cream on the hamstring muscle, the Graston
instrument was rubbed on each subject 30 times for 60 seconds from the gluteal line to the
popliteal fossa<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SS group performed static stretching of the hamstring. In the supine position, it was
fixed at opposite leg and hip joint bending posture of the subject, the direction of the
stretch was a knee joint extension direction. The procedure started with initial stretching,
where the posture was maintained for 5 seconds. This was followed by three subsequent
increases in knee extension, each with a 5-second hold. The final increase in the knee
extension angle was maintained for 45 seconds, and then the antagonist muscle was
stimulated. The hip joint and lumbar motion were fixed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 18.0. The SRT and VAS differences
within a group before and after the treatment were tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. For
all data, statistical significance was accepted at values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes in SRT and VAS scores before and after application of GT are shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Difference for SRT, VAS between groups and within groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">GT group</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">SS group</th><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">p-value</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p1</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p2</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SRT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;5.51 &#x000b1; 2.54</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.51 &#x000b1; 3.18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;6.08 &#x000b1; 1.79</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.54 &#x000b1; 2.78</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.506</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.002</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.002</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VAS</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.33 &#x000b1; 1.30</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.42 &#x000b1; 0.79</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.83 &#x000b1; 1.34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.25 &#x000b1; 1.29</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.326</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.005</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.008</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.

intensity in patients with NSLBP and shortened hamstrings.</p><p>After the GT, a significant increase in SRT and VAS scores was observed. The GT group had a
significant difference in SRT measurements before and after the intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05).
There were no statistically significant changes in pain intensity.</p><p>In a study by Kim et al., using GT on hamstrings in healthy young adults was reported to
increase the range of motion (ROM) of the knee joint<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the target population in this study was individuals with
NSLBP with hamstring shortening, this study will be more clinically applicable.</p><p>As indicated by the above results, the two interventions were found to have positive
effects on extensibility of the hamstring and pain intensity. However, the GT group had more
significant changes in the extensibility of the hamstring than the SS group did. In a study
by Hammer and Pfefer, the hamstrings of subjects with LBP were treated with soft tissue
mobilization using GT six times, which significantly increased the ROM of the knee
joint<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our research, GT was only
applied once for 60 seconds and hamstring extensibility increased in the short term.</p><p>The static stretching used in the control group is a common physical therapy treatment
technique for ROM and physical function improvement, and it has a positive effect on pain
and extensibility in the hamstring after application<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bandy et al. reported an increase in ROM when subjects performed
static stretches on the hamstring, but there were differences depending on the length of the
stretches. Since 30 to 60 seconds was found to be most effective, the SS group held static
stretches for 60 seconds<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinically, a shortened hamstring limits the flexion of the hip joint or causes lumbar
hyperextension, resulting in back pain. Therefore, it is essential to improve hamstring
extensibility in the recovery of back pain patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, if LBP occurs with shortening of the hamstring, knee
arthritis, or functional limitation, soft tissue mobilization using the Graston instrument
is a simple and effective intervention for restoring hamstring extensibility.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that it is difficult to generalize the results due to the
low number of subjects. Second, it did not use tests with the highest level of reliability
and validity. Finally, the effect was not confirmed by the long-term application. Future
studies will need to include various disease groups to address this limitation.</p><p>In this study, the GT proved to be a more effective intervention to improve hamstring
extensibility in NSLBP patients than static stretching did. We look forward to its use in
clinical practice because of its simplicity and efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Waddell</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Somerville</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Objective clinical evaluation of physical impairment in
