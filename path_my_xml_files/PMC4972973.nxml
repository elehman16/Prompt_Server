The program focuses on women who are parenting for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Nurse visits start as early in pregnancy as possible and continue until the child reaches age two years. The program has proven effective in the United States &#x02013; improving children&#x02019;s mental health and development and maternal wellbeing, and showing long-term cost-effectiveness. But it is not known whether the same benefits will be obtained in Canada, where public services differ. The British Columbia Healthy Connections Project therefore involves a randomized controlled trial evaluating Nurse-Family Partnership&#x02019;s effectiveness compared with existing (usual) services in improving children&#x02019;s mental health and early development and mother&#x02019;s life circumstances. The trial&#x02019;s main aims are to: reduce childhood injuries by age two years (primary outcome indicator); reduce prenatal nicotine and alcohol use; improve child cognitive and language development and behaviour at age two years; and reduce subsequent pregnancies by 24&#x000a0;months postpartum. Potential explanatory factors such as maternal mental health (including self-efficacy) are also being assessed, as is the program&#x02019;s impact on exposure to intimate-partner violence. To inform future economic evaluation, data are also being collected on health and social service access and use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Eligible and consenting participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1040) are being recruited prior to 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation then individually randomized to receive existing services (comparison group) or Nurse-Family Partnership plus existing services (intervention group). Nurse-Family Partnership is being delivered following fidelity guidelines. Data are being collected during in person and telephone interviews at: baseline; 34&#x02013;36 weeks gestation; and two, 10, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months postpartum. Additional data will be obtained via linkages from provincial datasets. Recruitment commenced in October 2013 and will continue for approximately three years.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide important information about the generalizability of Nurse-Family Partnership to the Canadian context. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with policymakers and practitioners through extensive public health collaborations already underway.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Registered July 18, 2013 with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01672060">NCT01672060</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nurse-family partnership</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Early child development</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Child injuries</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>BC Ministry of Health</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>BC Ministry of Child and Family Development</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nurse-family partnership</title><p>Developed nearly 40&#x000a0;years ago by Olds and colleagues in the United States (US), Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a nurse home visitation program that aims to improve the lives of young, first-time mothers and their children who are experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. NFP is based on theories of human ecology, self-efficacy and attachment and aims to improve prenatal health and parenting while also improving life course outcomes for both children and mothers. The program concentrates on first-time mothers who are theorized as being more receptive to parenting education and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NFP starts as early in pregnancy as possible (with first visits no later than the end of the 28th week of gestation) and continues until children reach age two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the NFP program, nurses provide frequent home visits. The goals for these visits include: 1) improving prenatal health behaviours; 2) increasing sensitive and competent parenting; 3) reducing the risks of child behaviour and other mental health problems; and 4) helping mothers improve their economic self-sufficiency, e.g., through fewer subsequent pregnancies, longer intervals between pregnancies and greater workforce participation. Nurses receive extensive education and resources to use in the home visits, as well as ongoing supervision to ensure that they are not only highly skilled, but also well supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nurses have proven to be the most successful home visitors because of their training and expertise, as well as their professional credibility with families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>NFP has been evaluated in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the United States (US) &#x02013; in Elmira, New York, Memphis, Tennessee and Denver, Colorado. Results from these RCTs have been reported in numerous articles, as have long-term follow-up findings over 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. NFP has shown several robust and enduring effects on maternal and child health outcomes, including decreased mortality due to preventable causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Two independent research groups have also conducted comprehensive cost-benefit analyses of NFP in the US. The Rand Corporation estimated net returns of US $2.88 for every dollar invested, with returns for the highest-risk families nearly doubled at US $5.70 for every dollar invested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, the Washington State Institute for Public Policy estimated a return on investment of more than US $17,000 for every family served [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Both evaluations factored in averted costs across multiple public sectors over 10&#x02013;15 years, including reduced healthcare, income assistance and child protection spending. Notably, averted public expenditures were greatest for the most disadvantaged mothers and children, underscoring the importance of offering NFP to those at higher risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Results are also now available from trials of NFP conducted outside the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Findings from a trial conducted in the Netherlands indicated that in comparison to existing health and social services, NFP reduced prenatal smoking, increased breastfeeding, reduced child protection reports, and reduced exposure to intimate-partner violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, an RCT evaluating NFP in England demonstrated no additional benefits for children or mothers compared to usual health and social services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The differing findings across the American, Dutch and English trials underscore the need to conduct RCTs in countries outside the US prior to widespread implementation &#x02013; to ascertain NFP&#x02019;s effectiveness in comparison with existing services for this disadvantaged population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interventions may well have different outcomes in different contexts, particularly if existing services differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Evaluating nurse-family partnership in Canada</title><p>NFP has been shown to decrease childhood injuries and improve children&#x02019;s mental health and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In Canada, an estimated 13&#x000a0;% of children (or nearly 700,000) are affected by mental disorders at any given time, with these disorders constituting a leading health problem for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Mental disorders in childhood then generally persist into adulthood, with a wide range of negative consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Anxiety, substance use, conduct and depressive disorders are among the most common childhood disorders &#x02013; that may be preventable through programs such as NFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Younger mothers are also more likely to experience limited education and low income &#x02013; factors associated with increased risk of child injuries and poor child cognitive and behavioural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore it is vital to intervene as early as possible to reduce avoidable adversities and to avert long-term consequences such as preventable mental disorders. Yet NFP has never been tested in Canada.</p><p>Work began in Canada in 2008 with an Ontario-based pilot study, in keeping with the international replication guidelines for NFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This pilot involved first adapting NFP nurse and participant educational materials to the Canadian context. Then NFP&#x02019;s feasibility and acceptability were assessed with over 100 mothers and children. NFP was well received by these mothers &#x02013; and by nurses, family members and community partners, laying the foundation for conducting an RCT in British Columbia (BC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>In BC, children&#x02019;s mental health has long been a priority, starting in 2003 with a five-year children&#x02019;s mental health plan, and continuing in 2010 with a 10-year mental health plan for the entire provincial population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The 10-year plan made prevention a high priority, featuring nurse home visitation for disadvantaged first-time mothers and their children as a central initiative. Planning for the BC Healthy Connections Project or BCHCP &#x02013; involving an RCT evaluating NFP &#x02013; commenced in 2010. The RCT is being jointly led by researchers at Simon Fraser University (SFU) and McMaster University &#x02013; in close collaboration with senior policymakers in the BC Ministries of Health and Children and Family Development, and with four regional BC Health Authorities (Fraser Health, Interior Health, Island Health and Vancouver Coastal Health). (A fifth regional Health Authority, Northern Health, also participates in the collaboration, but not in the RCT.)</p><p>The RCT is accompanied by two adjunctive studies &#x02013; a Process Evaluation investigating NFP&#x02019;s nursing implementation in BC, and the Healthy Foundations Study, a biological evaluation of NFP&#x02019;s impact on child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Five Health Authorities are participating in the Process Evaluation, while Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health are participating in the Healthy Foundations Study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Research aim</title><p>The aim of the trial is to evaluate NFP&#x02019;s effectiveness compared with existing services in improving children&#x02019;s mental health and early development and mother&#x02019;s life circumstances. One primary outcome indicator has been identified: the average number of physician encounters per child for (intentional and unintentional) injuries, measured in community/outpatient, emergency and hospital settings from birth through to age two years. Four secondary outcome indicators have also been identified: prenatal nicotine and alcohol use; child cognitive development (language and cognitive ability) at age two years; child behaviour (internalizing and externalizing problems) at age two years; and the incidence of subsequent pregnancies by 24&#x000a0;months postpartum. (See Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.) Potential explanatory factors such as maternal mental health (including self-efficacy) are also being assessed, as is the program&#x02019;s impact on exposure to intimate-partner violence (IPV), a novel addition through the Canadian NFP curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Data are also being collected on health and social service access and use &#x02013; to set the stage for long-term economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>Prior to 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation, eligible and consenting participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;1040) complete a baseline assessment and are individually randomized to receive existing services (comparison group) or NFP plus existing services (intervention group). NFP is being delivered following fidelity guidelines &#x02013; with women being offered the program starting as early as possible in pregnancy and continuing until children reach age two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The trial opened to enrollment in October 2013 and enrollment will continue for approximately three years, with data collection ongoing for 2.5&#x000a0;years thereafter or until the last enrolled participant&#x02019;s child reaches age two years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Settings</title><p>BC has a population of 4.6 million dispersed across an area of nearly 950,000 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Regional Health Authorities are responsible for providing all local public health and healthcare services, with the Ministry of Health overseeing province-wide standards and providing funding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Regarding specific settings for the RCT, each regional Health Authority is further divided into Local Health Areas that delineate smaller geographic foci for service delivery. The BC Ministry of Health and the Health Authorities together identified particular Local Health Areas where NFP delivery would be feasible, i.e., where there was sufficient population to justify the public health nursing resources needed to deliver NFP. As part of the BCHCP&#x02019;s policy and practice collaborations, Health Authorities are hiring and overseeing the public health nurses (PHNs), who then receive their NFP education, preparing them to deliver the program to the intervention group as part of the RCT. The four participating Health Authorities are also the RCT&#x02019;s main referral source. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes the participating Local Health Areas that include a range of urban, suburban and smaller communities.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participating local health areas</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Health authority</th><th>Local health area</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fraser Health</td><td>Abbotsford, Burnaby, Chilliwack, Coquitlam, Delta, Langley, Maple Ridge, Mission, New Westminster, South Surrey/White Rock, Surrey</td></tr><tr><td>Interior Health</td><td>Central Okanagan, Kamloops, Vernon</td></tr><tr><td>Island Health</td><td>Cowichan/Lake Cowichan, Greater Victoria, Nanaimo/Ladysmith, Saanich, Sooke</td></tr><tr><td>Vancouver Coastal Health</td><td>Downtown Eastside, North East, South, North Vancouver/West Vancouver-Bowen Island, Richmond, Vancouver City Centre, Westside/Midtown</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Public health nurse preparation</title><p>Nurse preparation is critical, as these practitioners are central to the NFP intervention. Starting in 2012, Health Authorities recruited a cadre of approximately 75 experienced PHNs then sponsored intensive education to prepare them for delivering NFP through the RCT, and to prepare their supervisors. (Note that BC PHNs typically hold baccalaureate degrees, in addition to having a decade or more of public health experience.) The US NFP National Service Office provided BC&#x02019;s NFP education initially, but BC is now developing the capacity to provide this education locally. A novel aspect of this effectiveness trial is the evaluation of NFP&#x02019;s impact on maternal exposure to IPV. Previous NFP trials have indicated that when nurse-visited women reported high rates of IPV, reductions in child maltreatment significantly declined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, IPV modules were included in the BC nurses&#x02019; education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>NFP PHNs and supervisors also participated in an education pilot to consolidate and hone their skills by delivering the full NFP program to a small caseload of young women &#x02013; who served as &#x0201c;guiding clients.&#x0201d; Identified through usual public health referral sources, nearly 300 pregnant women provided written informed consent to participate as guiding clients. They have received NFP, but no research data were collected. All subsequently recruited PHNs no longer have guiding clients, but rather directly observe and practice through a mentorship model now led by experienced BC NFP nurses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Nurse-family partnership intervention</title><p>PHNs deliver NFP to eligible and consenting women through regular home visits throughout the pregnancy and continuing until the child&#x02019;s second birthday &#x02013; up to 64 visits in total over 2.5&#x000a0;years (if the program starts by the 16th week of pregnancy). Each visit typically lasts 60&#x02013;90 min. PHNs use visit-to-visit guidelines that were adapted for Canadian settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Beyond their intensive NFP education, PHNs also receive regular individual and team reflective supervision and support to ensure fidelity to essential elements of the NFP program model.

As part of these elements, each participant in the NFP intervention arm is also assigned to one specific PHN for the duration of program delivery (wherever possible) to facilitate a close and continuing relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

Existing health services for pregnant women and young children vary across BC but may include: primary healthcare services, provided by physicians and also by midwives in some circumstances; specialist physician services; public health programs including pregnancy screening and outreach, prenatal classes and brief forms of home visiting by (non-NFP) nurses or paraprofessionals; and a variety of targeted and universal parenting and early child development programs. Health Authorities also provide adult mental healthcare including substance misuse and harm reduction services. In BC, all basic public health services are typically provided at no cost. There is also no cost for BC&#x02019;s universal healthcare services including physician, emergency and hospital visits &#x02013; although there may be costs associated with prescription medications, unless the family meets low-income eligibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A wide array of related social services are also offered in BC by the federal and provincial governments, municipalities and local charitable groups including: employment assistance; child benefits; income assistance; education assistance; crisis interventions; child protection programs; justice services; shelter and housing supports; and food banks.

In the BCHCP trial population, the base rate of injuries per child from birth through two years is expected to be 0.30 (30&#x000a0;%), based on aggregate-level BC data from a 10-year cohort of children born to first-time mothers receiving income assistance, provided by the BC Ministry of Health for the trial (unpublished report). This base rate is consistent with the rate of emergency room visits for injuries (accidents and ingestions) during children&#x02019;s second year of life in a previous NFP trial in Elmira, US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By consensus, the Scientific Team set the minimal clinically-meaningful reduction in risk as a relative risk of 0.70, i.e., a reduction from 0.30 (30&#x000a0;%) in the comparison group to 0.21 (21&#x000a0;%) in the intervention (NFP) group. With the probability of a type I error rate (alpha) set at 0.05 (2-tailed), a sample size of n&#x02009;=&#x02009;495 per group is needed to detect a 30&#x000a0;% relative risk reduction with type II error (beta) set at 0.20 (power&#x02009;=&#x02009;80&#x000a0;%). Presuming 5&#x000a0;% attrition only for the primary outcome indicator, due to accessing personal data from provincial datasets to measure this indicator, the estimated total sample size is 1040.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary and secondary analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. We will use the most recent version of MLwiN multilevel modeling software for the statistical analyses of our primary and secondary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Equations for the multilevel regression models are stated in the statistical analysis plan for outcomes with Poisson and Normal distributions. Prior to analysis, data will be checked for outliers, inconsistencies and possible transformation.

We do not expect differences among Local Health Areas in the implementation of NFP due to the rigorous education and manualized delivery of the program following core model elements. Nevertheless, we will use Local Health Area (site) for stratification purposes and test for between-site differences in NFP versus existing services outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this trial is to determine NFP&#x02019;s effectiveness compared with BC&#x02019;s existing services in improving children&#x02019;s mental health and early development and mother&#x02019;s life circumstances. NFP holds singular promise for young, first-time mothers and their children who are experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage &#x02013; a population with high needs which has often been underserved. Yet NFP&#x02019;s effectiveness has not been tested previously in Canada. The BCHCP is therefore laying the foundation for NFP to be evaluated and adapted for sustained use in BC, and potentially across Canada, should RCT findings be positive.</p><p>NFP is a time-limited intervention occurring prenatally and over the first two years of life. However, evidence from the US NFP trials suggests that important benefits may either grow stronger over time, or be revealed with new developmental advantages as children grow older. For example, some of NFP&#x02019;s most compelling US findings have been demonstrated five to 20&#x000a0;years after the intervention ended including: reductions in child anxiety, depressive and substance misuse symptoms; reductions in serious antisocial behaviour in adolescence; demonstrations of cost-effectiveness; and decreased child and maternal mortality due to preventable causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Consequently, this RCT is intentionally designed to permit long-term follow up &#x02013; through both robust retention efforts and the inclusion of measures predictive of longer-term outcomes, e.g., child cognitive development and behaviour. Accordingly, any inference about NFP&#x02019;s success or failure based on the trial outcomes when children reach age two years will not rule out the possibility that findings may be overturned in subsequent developmental periods.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique aspect of the BCHCP is that it involves close collaborations with policymakers and practitioners within BC&#x02019;s public health system, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Children and Family Development and the participating Health Authorities. These research-policy-practice collaborations encourage integrated and reciprocal &#x0201c;knowledge exchange&#x0201d; throughout the trial such that findings, should they be positive, will be readily applicable in policy and practice settings across BC, and Canada. The Scientific Team hopes that by generating new evidence through the BCHCP RCT, BC policymakers and practitioners &#x02013; and all Canadians &#x02013; will be encouraged to take new steps to improve children&#x02019;s mental health and development starting very early in the lifespan, while also improving mother&#x02019;s circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BC, British Columbia; BCHCP, British Columbia healthy connections project; IPV, intimate-partner violence; NFP, nurse-family partnership; PHN, public health nurse; RCT, randomized controlled trial; SFU, Simon Fraser University; US, United States</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants and the BC NFP nurses and supervisors.
