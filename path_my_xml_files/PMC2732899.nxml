The serious adverse event rate was 27.5 events per 100 patient-years, with 5.7 serious infections per 100 patient-years, based on a total tocilizumab exposure of 612 patient-years. Of the 88 patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, 78 (88.6%) were able to decrease their corticosteroid dose and 28 (31.8%) discontinued corticosteroids. At 5 years, 79/94 (84.0%), 65/94 (69.1%) and 41/94 (43.6%) of the patients achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 improvement criteria, respectively.

All subjects had been insufficient responders to treatment with at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or immunosuppressant. Patients had active disease at the time of enrollment into the initial controlled trial, as defined by the presence of six or more swollen joints, six or more tender joints and one of the following two criteria: a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of at least 30 mm/h or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of more than 1.0 mg/dl. Patients receiving prednisolone (10 mg daily maximum) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) were eligible if the dose had not increased during the washout period of 1 month. Doses of both medications remained stable during the blinded study period of 12 weeks. Patients who had received tocilizumab or placebo twice or more were given the opportunity to receive tocilizumab in this open-label extension trial.</p><p>In the extension study, the use of prednisolone (10 mg daily maximum) and one NSAID was permitted.

After 5 years of tocilizumab treatment, 78 of 88 (88.6%) had been able to decrease their corticosteroid dose and 28 of 88 (31.8%) had discontinued corticosteroids. The mean dose of corticosteroids for these patients decreased from 6.9 mg/day (median 7.5 mg/day) to 2.4 mg/day (median 2.0 mg/day) at 5 years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The STREAM study is the first study demonstrating the long-term safety and efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy. This open-label extension trial of tocilizumab demonstrated a sustained good efficacy and a generally good safety profile over 5 years. The high retention rate at 5 years indeed indicates the favourable efficacy and safety profile. In particular, only one of 143 patients withdrew as a result of an unsatisfactory response, indicating that no general loss of response occurred during long-term treatment.</p><p>ACR responses and improvements in DAS28 scores and individual components of the ACR core set were all sustained during the long-term treatment with tocilizumab monotherapy. At 5 years, approximately half of patients had achieved ACR70 and more than half of patients had achieved clinical remission defined as a DAS28 of less than 2.6, although this study was open labelled.</p><p>Tocilizumab monotherapy markedly improved inflammation markers such as CRP and ESR and improvements were sustained throughout the study. Haemoglobin levels were also improved. It is well documented that hepcidin plays a key role in anaemia of chronic inflammatory diseases. IL-6 induces the secretion of hepcidin, an iron regulatory peptide hormone that is produced in the liver and that negatively regulates the absorption of intestinal iron and iron recycling by macrophages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> This increase in haemoglobin levels is expected to contribute to the improvement in patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>A steroid-sparing effect was another benefit of tocilizumab therapy for RA patients. As the use of corticosteroids is often associated with adverse events such as infection or steroid-induced osteoporosis, this also contributes to the improvement in patients&#x02019; quality of life from the safety point of view.</p><p>A major objective of this study was to evaluate long-term safety. Long-term treatment with tocilizumab was well tolerated. Most of the adverse events were mild and acceptable compared with the benefit provided. The rate of serious infections of 5.7/100 patient-years after 612 patient-years of treatment was comparable to that reported with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> There was no systemic opportunistic infection or tuberculosis in this study. At least two patients with a history of tuberculosis were treated with tocilizumab because this study did not exclude patients who had a history of tuberculosis. Neither had any recurrence nor exacerbation of tuberculosis without the prophylactic use of antituberculosis drugs. However, two cases of tuberculosis were reported in another study (two cases in 1891 patient-years in Japan),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and we should therefore follow patients carefully during tocilizumab treatment.</p><p>Four malignancies were reported in four patients. Yamanaka <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> reported a comparison of the incidence of malignancies in the following three populations: (1) tocilizumab cohort: all clinical trials (including this trial) of tocilizumab in active RA patients; (2) IORRA cohort: an observational cohort of RA patients in the Institute of Rheumatology, Tokyo Women&#x02019;s Medical University and (3) a Japanese population database: cancer incidence in Japan by the research group for population-based cancer registration in Japan supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The incidence of malignancies in the patients receiving tocilizumab was almost equivalent to that in the observational cohort of RA patients or the Japanese population data. Further study will be required to evaluate whether tocilizumab treatment might influence the incidence of malignancies using a much larger population of RA patients treated with tocilizumab.</p><p>Throughout long-term treatment, a serious infusion reaction was observed in only one patient who received 4 mg/kg tocilizumab in the initial double-blind trial and developed IgE anti-tocilizumab antibodies. Maini <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> reported that anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions occurred only at low doses of tocilizumab in the absence of methotrexate. Therefore, initial treatment with a relatively low dose (4 mg/kg) of tocilizumab without methotrexate may induce anti-tocilizumab antibodies.</p><p>Increases in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in the initial controlled study. In this extension study, however, they did not continue increasing. Furthermore, the atherogenic index, calculated by (total cholesterol&#x02013;high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, was stable throughout the 5-year treatment. Therefore, an increase in total cholesterol does not always mean an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As IL-6 is thought to play a causative role in atherosclerosis, IL-6 blockade may decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events, as observed with anti-TNF therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Further investigation will be required to evaluate whether tocilizumab might increase the risk of developing ischaemic heart disease. At present, we should introduce treatment according to the guideline for cholesterol management.</p><p>Neutropenia was also reported, as seen in previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> but the incidence was less frequent than that observed in combination with methotrexate therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> This may be an advantage of tocilizumab monotherapy.</p><p>Although it has been established that TNF inhibitors should be given with methotrexate for maximal efficacy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> this study indicated that tocilizumab monotherapy offered a good safety profile and sustained efficacy throughout long-term treatment. Therefore, tocilizumab has considerable clinical benefit for patients who do not tolerate methotrexate. Short-term safety and efficacy studies of tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate or DMARD have been reported,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> but further studies are required to determine long-term safety and efficacy.</p><p>In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates excellent long-term efficacy and generally good safety of tocilizumab monotherapy in active RA patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Takahiro Kakehi, Toru Suwabe, Nobuhiro Takagi and Karsten Kissel for their valuable assistance with the design and analysis of the study and preparation of this manuscript and the members of the MRA clinical study group for RA for treatment of the patients.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was financially supported by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> NN has served as a consultant to and received honoraria from Chugai Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of tocilizumab.
