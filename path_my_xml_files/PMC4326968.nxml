In children, EA has been described as a mental disturbance that consists of confusion, hallucinations, and delusions manifested by inconsolable crying, disorientation, nonpurposeful restlessness, involuntary physical activity, and thrashing about in bed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Among all inhalational anesthetics, sevoflurane is considered an agent of choice for induction and maintenance of day care anesthesia in children and enjoys wide acceptance among pediatric anesthesiologists.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The occurrence of EA in children after sevoflurane anesthesia is common, with an incidence ranging between 10% and 80%.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Though EA is generally short-lived with no after-effect, it may not only cause injury to the child or bleeding from the surgical site, but also lead to the accidental removal of the surgical dressings, IV access, and drains. EA also leads to dissatisfaction and anxiety for the parents about the quality of child's recovery and requires extra nursing care with associated enhanced costs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Supplemental sedative and/or analgesic medications may often be necessary to control the symptoms leading to delayed discharge from postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Parents who witness EA in their child may worry about a permanent sequel.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Various pre-, intra-, and immediate postoperative pharmacological agents like-analgesics,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Dexa- methasone,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] opioids,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] propofol,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] benzo- diazepines,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] alpha-2 (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>) agonists,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] were used with the aim of reducing the occurrence of EA after sevoflurane-based anesthesia, with variable results.</p><p>Alpha-2 agonists have sedative and analgesic properties without significant respiratory depression at clinical dosages. Kulka <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Bock <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in their study with 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and 3 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine, respectively; reported a decrease in EA and no delay in patient discharge. Again, Ibacache <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that another &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine had effectively reduced EA after sevoflurane anesthesia in children. Dexmedetomidine, is a more highly specific &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>= 1620/1) than clonidine (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>= 220/1), has significantly reduced EA frequency after sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric surgery and nonsurgical procedures in inpatient[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and outpatient settings.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this double-blinded randomized prospective parallel group study was to compare the effect of these two &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists (dexmedetomidine and clonidine) when administered intranasally 45 min prior to the induction of sevoflurane-based anesthesia on the incidence and severity of EA as well as emergence and discharge time in children undergoing day care surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining permission from Institutional Ethics Committee, written informed consent was taken from the parents/guardians. Total 80 children of either sex, aged 3-7 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] grade I-II, scheduled for elective day care surgery under general anesthesia with expected operation time duration &#x0003c;60 min were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included: Children with a developmental, psychological, and cognitive disorders; active airway disease, cerebral palsy, history of sleep apnea or epileptic fits; patients on chronic or acute intake of any sedative or analgesic medications; inborn errors of metabolism, body weight &#x0003c;10 kg or frank obese; patients with known allergy to any of the medications used for procedures; and children with cardiovascular or neurological abnormality.</p><p>All patients underwent thorough preoperative evaluation, which included the history, physical examination and relevant laboratory investigations. During the preoperative visit, each enrolled child was asked to choose a sealed envelope with his code number inside. The name, admission registration number, and body weight were recorded on the sealed envelope after been chosen.</p><p>The patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups to receive either 4 &#x003bc;g/kg intranasal clonidine (group C) or 1 &#x003bc;g/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine (group D) as premedication, via computer-generated random numbers which matched with the sealed envelope. Prior to arrival of the child, a resident doctor in anesthesiology who did not participate in clinical assessment, drew up the study drug (either clonidine or dexmedetomidine) into a tuberculin syringe that was labeled study drug. To ensure blinding, the volume of the study medication was standardized at 0.04 ml/kg. Intranasal dexmedetomidine and clonidine were prepared from the parenteral preparation (100 &#x003bc;g/ml and 150 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively). The drugs were administered 45 min prior to induction of anesthesia.</p><p>The intranasal premedication was administered by on-duty resident doctor not knowing the composition of the prefilled syringe. On premedicating and shifting the child to preoperative room, hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>]) were studied continuously. If the fall in (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 90%) detected, then O<sub>2</sub> were delivered by oxygen mask.</p><p>About 45 min after premedication, children were brought to the operating room where anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane in 100% oxygen (6 L/min) through a face mask.</p><p>At the end of surgery, once hemostasis was achieved, the anesthetic agents were discontinued and replaced with O<sub>2</sub>100% (6 L/min).</p><p>Time to regular breathing is the time period from discontinuation of anesthesia to time of deep, regular breathing. Time to awakening is the time period from discontinuation of anesthesia to time of initial arousal (eye opening, child showing purposeful movements). From discontinuation of anesthesia to tracheal extubation was defined as the time to extubation. First response to command or eye opening on command after extubation was the emergence time.</p><p>In the PACU, the incidence of EA was assessed with Aonos four-point scale and the severity of EA was assessed with pediatric anesthesia ED (PAED) scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] upon admission and 5,15 and 25 min (T0, T5, T15, T25), respectively. One parent who was very close to the child was allowed to be with the child at PACU. Twenty-five minutes after entry into PACU, the agitated children were managed by giving intravenous increments of fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg with at least a 10 min time interval between each dose, during which time the children were monitored for any signs of respiratory depression. Resident anesthesiologists who were observers blinded to study groups recorded all the scores and observations at PACU and operation theater. The time for PACU stay (admission-discharge from PACU) and hospital discharge (eye opening-discharge), and the incidence of adverse events (bradycardia, desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 95%), vomiting, shivering, coughing, breath holding, laryngospasm) were also recorded. Children were considered ready for discharge from the PACU when the modified Aldrete postanesthesia score was &#x02265;9.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Patients were transferred to ward after being discharged from PACU. For nausea and vomiting, ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV was administered.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PAED scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRPP-4-24-g001"/></table-wrap><p>This study was powered on the basis of preliminary results showing 50% incidence of ED in the control group.

Since 1961, the discontinued or decreased use of ether, cyclopropane, ketamine, scopolamine like older anesthetics and the increased use of short-acting opioids, sedatives, and regional techniques rendered this problem one of mere historical interest. With the introduction of a new, relatively insoluble volatile anesthetics, desflurane and sevoflurane, ED and agitation have reappeared, particularly in children.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In pediatric ambulatory surgery, EA is a difficult problem, because EA itself and its treatment using sedative or analgesics may delay discharge and patient's home return. Extended hospital stay discourages both patients and their caregivers from undergoing ambulatory surgery. Therefore, ambulatory pediatric anesthesiologists have been trying to prevent EA in order to provide efficient and high-quality care that is a positive experience for children and their parents.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Among several medications,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] tried for prevention of EA after sevoflurane-based anesthesia &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists has shown promising results.</p><p>Clonidine is an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist that have been used for premedication in adult and pediatric patients. Clonidine is effective by the stimulation of pre- and post-synaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists in many areas of the central nervous system leading to sedation, analgesia, and reduction of sympathetic tone.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In adult intensive care patients, clonidine is used in the treatment of agitation associated with withdrawal syndromes.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We, therefore, assumed that clonidine to be a promising drug for the treatment of agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia. We had chosen 4 &#x003bc;g/kg intranasal clonidine as used by Almenrader <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anesthetic sparing properties and has been approved by Food and Drug Administration as a short-term sedative for mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has recently been used successfully with reduced EA frequency after sevoflurane anesthesia for pediatric surgery in- and outpatient settings.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Intranasal dose of dexmedetomidine was kept 1 &#x003bc;g/kg as per study by Isik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this prospective, double-blinded trial we had compared the effect of intranasal premedication; with 4 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine administered 45 min before induction of anesthesia; on incidence, severity of EA, amount of fentanyl consumption, duration of PACU as well as hospital stay.</p><p>The indications for operations and demographic profile of patients, which were statistically insignificant between two groups, were quite similar with other research investigations,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and provided us the uniform platform to evenly compare the results obtained. The study was conducted by Srivastava <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] on the comparative role of clonidine and dexmedetomidine for short-term sedation in ICU in a total of 70 patients yielded similar results.</p><p>In our study, the incidence and severity of EA were significantly lower in group D compared to group C. Di <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] similarly found a single dose dexmedetomidine administered 30 min prior to end of surgery had reduced the incidence of sevoflurane induced EA significantly compared to control group (13.3% vs. 30%). But Ham <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] when compared single dose dexmedetomidine with remifentanil found it did not attenuate EA in intubated adult patients. Again Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Sun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found from two different meta-analyses consisting 12 and 15 clinical trials, respectively that the dexmedetomidinehad significantly decreased the incidence of EA in children under sevoflurane anesthesia. Similarly, Heinmiller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] also found that Clonidine reduced EA after strabismus surgery when compared with placebo.</p><p>Time of regular breathing, awakening, extubation, and emergence all were delayed in group D than C, and the difference was both clinically and statistically significant. Di <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in their study found that the dexmedetomidine did not produce delay in extubation when compared with placebo. Ham <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found delayed awakening of patients in the dexmedetomidine group undergoing orthognathic surgery. Prolonged extubation time and emergence time was found by dexmedetomidine while doing a meta-analysis by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Again in the study for prevention of sevoflurane induced EA, Malviya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that clonidine produced significant delay in awakening when compared with placebo. Though the awakening, extubation, and emergence were delayed in group D but the delay did not produce any clinical problem.</p><p>It is often difficult to distinguish between postoperative pain and EA in younger children as symptoms of both might be similar so that different assessments tools have been used by different investigators to differentiate between the two. Number of patients treated with fentanyl and the mean dose of fentanyl used at PACU was significantly higher in group C than group D both clinically and statistically. These observations were supported by Di <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who observed that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced fentanyl consumption in the postoperative period after cleft leap and palate repair (56.7% vs. 66.7%) when compared with placebo. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] also observed less pain in the dexmedetomidine-treated groups in their meta-analysis study.</p><p>In our study, duration of PACU stay and time for hospital discharge were slightly delayed in group D than C but the results were statistically and clinically insignificant. But on the contrary, Di <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that dexmedetomidine produced significantly shorter PACU stay than a placebo group. Again in the study by Heinmiller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found clonidine-treated group spent insignificantly longer time at PACU than the placebo group. Malviya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also found that clonidine produced significantly longer PACU stay when compared with placebo.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting were seen in our both study groups, but there was no clinical or statistical difference among two groups. This finding was quite similar with other research investigators.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>One of the limitations of the current study is the absence of a placebo-controlled group. Though it was initially planned, but rejected by the Hospital Ethics Committee as administering no premedication may lead to severe ED and day care anesthesia may not be feasible due to parental anxiety arising from their children's unfamiliar behavior after operations. Second, we had to allow parental presence during recovery at PACU, which was not accordance to our hospital policy. Another limitation is that we compared clonidine and dexmedetomidine based on their known optimal as well as safe doses for day care setting without the knowledge of their equipotent doses.</p><p>In conclusion, the intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) prevents incidence and severity of ED more effectively than intranasal clonidine (4 &#x003bc;g/kg) when administered 45 min prior to induction. Dexmedetomidine also reduces fentanyl consumption than clonidine, but PACU as well as a hospital stay were slightly delayed in the dexmedetomidine group without producing any appreciable side effect in children undergoing ambulatory surgery under sevoflurane-based general anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTION</title><p>A.
