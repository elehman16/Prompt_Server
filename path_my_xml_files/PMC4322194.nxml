While VADs are replaced only when necessary, AS are routinely replaced every 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;days in the belief that this reduces infectious complications.

VAD insertion is the most common invasive healthcare procedure with approximately 14 million VADs used in Australia each year and billions throughout the world.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> VADs are inserted either centrally (eg, central venous catheter (CVC)) or peripherally (eg, peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC)) for haemodynamic monitoring and the delivery of intravascular fluids, nutrition and medications. VADs also include peripheral arterial catheters (PAC) used predominantly in the operating theatre and critical care units to provide continuous blood pressure monitoring and access for repeated blood sampling. In order to deliver many therapies, VADs require connection to an administration set (AS). The AS refers to infusion systems comprised of some or all of tubing, fluid containers, pressure monitoring transducers, blood sampling ports, measuring burettes, extension tubing and needleless connectors. VADs break the natural defence barrier of the skin and are the single most important cause of healthcare-acquired bloodstream infection (BSI). About 250&#x02005;000&#x02013;500&#x02005;000 VAD-BSIs occur each year in the USA alone.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> VAD-BSIs are associated with increased mortality and substantially increase hospital stay and treatment costs by up to 20&#x02005;days and US$56&#x02005;000/episode, respectively.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Clinicians traditionally limit the duration of AS use by routinely replacing AS at regular intervals. That is, the VAD may be used for a week or more, whereas the AS is routinely disconnected, discarded and replaced every 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;days. The practice of routinely changing AS is not based on strong evidence of efficacy. Prior to the 1970s, AS were used until no longer required.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Routine AS replacement developed as a response to the 1970&#x02013;1971 USA epidemic of VAD-BSI; this epidemic was later traced to manufacturer-contaminated intravenous fluid.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Despite the unrelated nature of this cause to the duration of AS use, 24&#x02005;h routine replacement of AS was advocated and universally implemented at that time.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The policy of routine replacement has continued since.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>VAD AS replacement at 24&#x02013;96&#x02005;h</title><p>Each AS replacement involves significant nursing time and costs up to $A300 (2004) for one VAD AS change in equipment alone.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Since 1971, the length of time between AS changes has gradually been extended. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared time frames such as 24 versus 48&#x02005;h or 24 versus 72&#x02005;h. A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 RCTs included 5001 patients and AS use of 24 to &#x02265;96&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> No significant difference was found in VAD-BSI with longer periods of AS use. In addition, no significant effect was found on any of the device colonisation, infusate colonisation, infusate-related BSI or all-cause BSI. There was some evidence that less frequent AS replacement increased mortality rate in neonates (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.66). This was based on two studies of 24 versus 48&#x02005;h AS replacement<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and 24 versus 72&#x02005;h replacement,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with 96% of the statistical weight coming from the latter study which was at risk of bias from a suboptimal randomisation technique (10% of sample were rerandomised).</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>VAD AS use beyond 96&#x02005;h</title><p>The Cochrane Review found inadequate trials to investigate AS use beyond 96&#x02005;h.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> One RCT (512 patients) compared 3-day with &#x02018;between 4-day and 7-day&#x02019; use and found no significant difference in infusate-related BSI.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> An unpublished conference abstract reported another RCT of 769 patients with AS replaced at 72 or 120&#x02005;h, with no between-group differences in catheter colonisation or VAD-BSI.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Jakobsen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> undertook a five-group RCT with AS changed at 24, 48, 72, 96 or 120&#x02005;h and found no difference in catheter colonisation.

This highlights the uncertainty of relative risk between these two time frames. All AS guidelines exclude high growth media of lipid-based and blood-based AS infusions which are discarded within 24&#x02005;h.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Theoretical framework for AS replacement</title><p>The theoretical principle behind routine AS replacement is that AS are initially sterile and become contaminated through clinical use, but if removed at set intervals, BSI is prevented.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Limiting AS use to 4&#x02005;days presumes microbes within sets are not problematic before day 4 and ignores the potential for immediate microbial contamination when staff inject medicine or fluids. It seems likely that if an AS is contaminated, virulent pathogens would cause significant growth and patient infection within a shorter time; thus, fourth day replacement would have no effect on pathogens already infused.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Routine AS replacement itself provides an opportunity for contamination, as it breaks a closed circuit, and this suggests it should actually be avoided.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Increased occasions of AS manipulations are known to increase infection, yet routine replacement causes extra handling of the hub and AS.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Poor aseptic technique in accessing the AS is not uncommon<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and would likely over-ride any benefit of routine AS replacement. Further, AS replacement does not replace the hub component of the VAD itself, which is known to be the main reservoir for infection from VADs after the first week.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The current incongruous situation is that VADs are used for extended periods and only removed for VAD-BSI or at completion of treatment, yet the AS are disconnected and replaced twice each week.</p><p>VADs are vital and ubiquitous medical devices, with billions used around the world each year. Consequently, reliable evidence that informs the safe, effective use of these devices is important to patients, nurses, doctors and the community. The aim of the study is to compare the impact of VAD AS replacement at 4 versus 7&#x02005;days on infective, clinical and cost outcomes. The primary hypothesis is that there will be equivalence in the incidence of VAD-BSIs between patients assigned to AS replacement at 4 versus 7&#x02005;days. We also hypothesise that there will be equivalence between groups in the incidence of: (1) AS colonisation, (2) hub colonisation, (3) VAD colonisation, (4) all-cause BSI rate, (5) VAD time in situ, and (6) all-cause mortality; and that patients assigned to 4-day replacement will have significantly higher: (1) number of AS used and (2) associated healthcare costs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study is a pragmatic, multicentre, RCT of equivalence design. Adult and paediatric patients with a CVC, PICC or PAC will be enrolled. The experimental group will have AS routinely replaced every 7&#x02005;days and the control group every 4&#x02005;days. There will be a 4-year recruitment period of 6554 patients.

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we consider &#x0003e;2% difference in the primary end point between groups to be very unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>The medical, surgical, haematology&#x02013;oncology wards and intensive care units (ICU) will be screened at least 3&#x02005;days each week by dedicated research nurses and all eligible patients (or their representative) will be approached for informed consent (except in hospitals where the requirement for consent has been waived by the local HREC). Patients will be randomly assigned, using computer-generated random assignment in a 1:1 ratio, to either the 4-day AS change group or 7-day AS change group. This will be stratified by device type (short-term CVC, long-term CVC, PICC or PAC), acuity (ICU and non-ICU), and hospital site to ensure equal distribution of patient and therapy types between groups. As randomisation will be conducted via a centralised computer randomisation service, allocation will be concealed until the point of randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Replacement and care of AS</title><p>The experimental group will have all AS changed on day 7, and then weekly, by clinical staff. The control group will have AS changed by clinical staff every 4&#x02005;days. In both groups, additional AS reconfiguration will occur if clinically indicated due to treatment addition/completion, VAD removal or AS malfunction. AS configurations, number, timing and reason for AS changes will be documented. VADs will be removed at the decision of the treating clinician. Clinical staff will be responsible for the insertion and care of VADs and AS following CDC Guidelines, including discard of any AS used for chemotherapy immediately after use and blood-based or lipid-based products within 12 and 24&#x02005;h, respectively.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Protocol adherence will be monitored by the research nurses, with breaks in the protocol documented. Once the VAD is removed (even if replaced by guidewire into the same vein), or continuous infusions have been ceased for the three study visits, the patient has completed the study (with the exception of the 48&#x02005;h follow-up).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Microbiological testing and end points</title><p>Blood and VAD tip cultures will be taken by clinical staff on suspicion of infection as per usual hospital and pathology department protocols. It is well validated that it is unnecessary to culture non-symptomatic patients&#x02019; samples routinely, as almost identical rates of VAD-BSI are achieved with culture only on clinical suspicion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> All patients with a BSI while the VAD is in situ (+48&#x02005;h postremoval) will have a standardised data collection sheet (that includes all data necessary for VAD-BSI diagnosis as per the CDC definitions but does not reveal the study group) prepared by the research nurses. This data will then be reviewed by one of the blinded investigators (EGP) who is an infectious diseases specialist familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of VAD-BSI. This investigator will assign the primary end point of VAD-BSI and nominate the likely source (VAD, AS, skin or haematogenous seeding). The blinded hospital microbiology staff will assign the secondary end points of BSI and device colonisation, using objective measures and techniques that are routine daily procedures.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For the secondary end points of hub and AS colonisation, a random subset of 325 patients per group whose VAD are removed for suspected VAD-BSI and 325 patients per group without suspected VAD-BSI (total 20% of sample) will have AS samples cultured.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The specimens will be processed by scientists with expertise in such bacterial counts and identification.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These end points will be of interest regarding potential pathogenic impact of AS replacement timing. It would be unfeasible and prohibitively expensive to perform these for the whole sample and also unnecessary, given that our primary interest is the effectiveness of the intervention to prevent clinical infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Blinding</title><p>This trial is blinded for the primary end point of VAD-BSI and for the secondary end points of AS, device and hub colonisation. These are performed by blinded infectious disease and microbiologists. AS replacement procedures and the time frames will not be possible to conceal from patients, research nurses or clinical staff. However, as they are not assessing the primary end point this will not introduce bias.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data collection</title><p>The research nurses, all of whom have had study-specific database training, will directly enter data in the clinical areas using hand-held password-protected electronic devices with a purpose-built Access database and form-based interface or using REDCap (project-redcap.org). This technology is well established in our group. All data is de-identified at this point and only identifiable within the database by specific study number. The master list of participants will be kept separate to the study database in a different password-protected computer programme. Baseline data will include age, gender, diagnostic group, severity of infection risk and immunosuppression status.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36&#x02013;38</xref> Other data collected will be the concurrent infection, antibiotic therapy, type of infusate and additives, VAD type, insertion site, inserter, VAD dwell time, AS hang time, reason for VAD and AS removal, and mortality status.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> AS configuration at the time of AS recruitment and at each replacement will be noted. Microbiological data will include BSI, VAD and other cultures taken during AS use and for 48&#x02005;h postremoval if patients are still in hospital. Some patients in each group will cease VAD therapy for clinical reasons &#x0003c;96&#x02005;h (eg, deceased). Outcome data will be collected for these cases and included in the final analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Intention to treat analysis will be used and the patient is the unit of measurement (patient randomised once but may have multiple VADs and AS). Relative incidence rates of VAD-BSI per 100 devices and hazard rates per 1000 device days with 95% CIs will summarise the impact of the 7-day relative to 4-day AS use and test equivalence for CVCs, PICCs and PACs. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare VAD-BSI rates over time. Subgroup analysis will be stratified by VAD type. Secondary end points will be compared between groups using parametric or non-parametric techniques appropriate to level of measurement. Secondary analysis using multivariate regression (Cox) will test the effect of variables associated with VAD-BSI risk on the outcome: lipids, parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, length of stay, diagnostic group, initial versus subsequent VADs, age, gender, VAD-BSI in a preceding catheter, site of VAD placement, inserter and patient risk category. All possible attempts will be made to collect the primary end point. Missing data will be modelled for best-case and worst-case outcomes to assess any potential effect on overall results and a per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. p Values of &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered significant. We do not expect effect sizes to vary between sites; however, intersite variability will be assessed and if necessary, adjustment is made in the model, with consideration of potential institutional differences in patient variables.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Estimating cost parameters</title><p>Procedure costs will be measured by assessing the staff time associated with AS change, and the type and volume of equipment used.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The economic opportunity costs of workers&#x02019; time will be valued by national wage rates to include full costs of employment; costs of equipment will be valued based on standard contracts between state health services and commercial manufacturers. Mean costs of 7-day and 4-day changes will be compared to identify the likely cost savings of a decision to make 7-day changes standard practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Time frame and feasibility</title><p>It is expected that, with staggered site start-ups, recruitment will be 4&#x02005;years, 6&#x02005;months. We will implement trial-specific education to ensure clinical staff support for the study and protocol adherence. To test if the 4-day and 7-day replacement are equivalent, it is crucial that adequate numbers of AS are used beyond this point. It is expected that a small number of VADs in both groups will be removed before scheduled AS replacement; this reflects the real world of clinical practice and will not limit generalisability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Monitoring, ethics and dissemination of results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Monitoring</title><p>Study managers (NMM and ER) who report to the chief investigator (CMR) and are employed by the sponsor (Griffith University), provide initial training and ongoing support to the research nurses and site investigators, and monitor data quality and site processes, at least monthly.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Ethical and safety considerations</title><p>Both 4-day and 7-day AS use is within the recommendations of the CDC and the Cochrane Collaboration.

For paediatrics, as per the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research, consent will be sought from both the child, if sufficiently competent, and parents. As part of providing consent, participants also consent to the data and specimens being used for subsequent studies relevant to infection prevention and VAD care. Serious adverse events (SAE) of mortality or ICU admission while on the trial will be monitored and reported to the Human Research Ethics Committee. A data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) of two biostatisticians and two medically qualified researchers (independent of the study) will review the primary end point and SAEs after each 1000 cases. The DSMC will inform the investigators if (1) based on the VAD-BSI rate, the sample size needs to be significantly recalculated or (2) the study needs to be stopped because of a statistically higher VAD-BSI or SAE rate favouring either group.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Neither the sponsor nor funder will be involved in data analysis or reporting. Data will be analysed by MRM the study statistician. Only the research team will have access to the study data; data generated from the trial will be available for inspection by the HREC and funders on request. The prevention of healthcare-associated infections and responsible use of the health dollar are of high interest to all stakeholders, including the community. We will present results locally, and at relevant local and international meetings of the infection control and vascular access specialty groups, and a media release will be circulated. The investigators will be available for interviews in the community/health media and we will supply results to organisations that publish clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with VADs. The study will be published in a peer-reviewed healthcare journal. Authorship will be consistent with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors&#x02019; criteria, and will be undertaken by the investigators without the use of professional writers. The results will have international application and should be rapidly translated into clinical policies. During the study, monthly investigator meetings will be held at one of the participating hospitals, with remote sites joining by teleconference/videoconference. These meetings are a forum for tracking recruitment and communicating important protocol modificants or clarifications. These issues are also followed up via email or telephone calls to the Local Site Investigators/Study Nurses by the Study Managers (NMM, EL). The study managers along with the chief investigator (CMR) also organise regular updates and annual reports to the Human Research Ethics Committees, local hospital Research Governance Officers, the granting bodies and the trial registry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients to the study is ongoing. The first patient was recruited in May 2011 and it is expected that recruitment will be completed in December 2015. Steady recruitment has been maintained through regular site visits by the project manager, monthly study meetings of all participating sites and continued education to both clinical and study staff at each site. Additional and replacement study sites have been added over the course of the trial to increase participant enrolment and/or to address the resignation of the local site principle investigator, where relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>While good evidence exists to support AS use up to 4&#x02005;days,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> there are minimal data about use beyond this time. Approximately 14 million VADs are used each year in Australia alone and nurses care for these devices daily.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Changing from 4-day to 7-day AS replacement saved US$7425 per year per ward in a US study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In Australia, each AS replacement costs up to $A300 (2004 estimate) in equipment and about 0.5 nursing hours.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> If 7-day AS use is adopted and even if four million VADs avoided one AS replacement at $250, then $A1 billion and 2 million nursing hours would be saved each year. This would also incur significant reductions in plastic waste. Evidence to date has favoured the adult intensive-care setting and it is vital that further knowledge is gathered across the spectrum of VAD use in medical, surgical, oncology and haematology units, as well as paediatric patients. This study will support or refute the practice of restricting AS use to 4&#x02005;days and if the safety of 7-day use is confirmed, will change practice worldwide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e418" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007257.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e419" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-007257.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Claire Rickard at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/avatar_grp">@avatar_grp</ext-link>, Emily Larsen at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/EmilyLarsenAU">@EmilyLarsenAU</ext-link>, Margherita Murgo at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/mlase">@mlase</ext-link> and David McMillan at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/DrDaveMacca">@DrDaveMacca</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> The authors would like to thank Professor Michael Whitby, Princess Alexandra Hospital, for assistance with funding applications; The National Health and Medical Research Council, The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Foundation, the Cancer Nurses&#x02019; Society of Australia, the Gold Coast Hospital Foundation, Griffith University and the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses (Queensland) for research grant funding.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CMR conceived the study, wrote grant, developed protocol and funding application, wrote the first draft of manuscript and approved the final draft.
