Mindfulness is a quality that reduces both emotional stress and aggression, so increasing mindfulness should be helpful.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>To study the effects of Yoga Pranayama (YP) and Vedic Mathematics (VM) on mindfulness, aggression, and emotion regulation.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods:</title><p>Participants were 12<sup>th</sup> graders attending a preuniversity college in Chikkamagaluru, India, of both genders. Exclusion criteria included major psychological problems. Three classes were arbitrarily assigned to one of three interventions, which consisted of 15 days each of 30 min daily instruction in YP, Group 1, VM, Group 2, or 30 min ordinary class work, Group 3, the control group.

Most high paid private sector jobs like basic engineering or other professional degrees require mathematics as a major subject. These circumstances have made emotional stress a major problem for students attempting to enter the college or university course of their choice.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Frustration can lead to increase in aggression[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] toward teachers and fellow students, and other antisocial behavior patterns.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In schools, competitive professional examinations select those entering higher education for various professions. Today, they put new pressures and workloads on schoolchildren that some even argue to be unnecessary. Reducing the effects of such pressures is a matter of national urgency.</p><p>The concept of mindfulness comes from the Pali concept of <italic>sati</italic>,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] i.e., being aware of one's stream of consciousness, thinking patterns, and associated tendencies to action in the present moment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Recent years have seen the publication of many studies on the quality of mind known as mindfulness[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] including studies of mindfulness training in schools.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Attempts have been made to design mindfulness-based education programs to improve the quality of teaching and learning.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Mindfulness is said to reduce aggression[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and improve emotion regulation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This study reports effects of two easily applied methods, Yoga Pranayama (YP) and Vedic Mathematics (VM), aiming to decrease emotional stress and aggression and increase mindfulness in preuniversity students facing competitive entrance examinations particularly in mathematics. An integrated Yoga intervention including Yoga postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation which have been reported to improve both mindfulness and emotional balance,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as cognitive performance,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] but to our knowledge, the effect of teaching mathematics according to the methods of VM has not been studied in this context nor have the effects of YP alone been evaluated for effects on mindfulness.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Yoga Pranayama</title><p>Pranayama is the fourth of the eight limbs of Yoga[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has a deeply settling influence on the mind[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] helping the subject be in the present, i.e., &#x0201c;mindful.&#x0201d; It is, therefore, widely employed as a preparation for meditation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It enlivens prana, or &#x0201c;subtle energy&#x0201d; in the tissues, now measured electrically at acupuncture points.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Its settling influence has been confirmed by such observations as test anxiety reduction, improved test performance,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and perceived stress reduction and improvement in cardiovascular parameters;[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] it also reduces aggression.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] These results suggest that application of pranayama methods to decrease effects of stress in society might prove valuable. Teaching them in schools would make a highly beneficial life-long skill available[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] just as mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are seen as achieving.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Hence, so many studies have been published on various pranayama programs that its effects may be considered quite well standardized. It can be used as a comparison for another method requiring assessment for comparative effects. In this context, YP represents a recognized way of managing mild levels of stress, and so improving emotion regulation and decreasing tendencies to aggression. In particular, pranayama practice usually involves focusing on the breathing process bringing the mind to the present moment. Improving that ability will clearly be of value when taking tests and exams.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Vedic Mathematics</title><p>VM[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] presents a new method of problem-solving in high school mathematics comprising 16 sutras and 16 upasutras, which have been much appreciated wherever they have been applied.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] According to Charak (2002) (Quoted on back cover of Glover [2005]), &#x0201c;They make arduous mathematical situations look terribly simple to solve. I have taught &#x02026; the principles &#x02026; to my students in B. Ed. classes. They found the techniques extremely simple, less time consuming, and less likely to lead to mistakes.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] We have found that they offer students choice when performing calculations, thus introducing a &#x0201c;fun&#x0201d; element and increasing student enthusiasm. As a result, mathematics teachers in many different countries have extended their applications.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The system's ability to empower students to choose how to perform calculations means that students can select their preferred method in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc. Its use helps to develop students&#x02019; confidence and basic problem-solving abilities. Visualizing pictorial or algebraic patterns to solve problems increases students&#x02019; enjoyment of the process.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Problem-solving calculations become a game.</p><p>This approach of VM allows teachers to give detailed reasons for the success of each method. In our estimate, a mature approach teaches VM not as a set of magical tricks but as teaching aids to communicate deeper aspects of a problem's structure and solution. In short, enabling students to visualize how and why each method works, resulting in added understanding, and increased confidence when faced with exam questions. A previously submitted paper has reported reductions in mathematics anxiety (Impact of Pranayama and VM on Math Anxiety and Cognitive Skills, submitted for publication). On this basis, we hypothesized that using VM would improve mindfulness and emotional regulation and reduce aggression in school students, particularly those in 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grades.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Participants</title><p>Three classes totaling 243 students studying in 12<sup>th</sup> Standard at Sri Sai Angels Preuniversity College, Chikkamagaluru, India, were arbitrarily assigned to YP group (YP &#x02013; 73 students), VM group (VM &#x02013; 80 students), and control group (CG &#x02013; 90 students).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Design</title><p>Three group, pre&#x02013;post control design [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Three classes of 12<sup>th</sup> grade preuniversity students were arbitrarily assigned to one of three interventions: Yoga Pranayama, Vedic Mathematics, and Controls.

The first employs &#x0201c;vertically and crosswise&#x0201d; to solve an example of simultaneous equations. The second simplifies integration of a reciprocal quadratic function (factorizable) using &#x0201c;transpose and apply.&#x0201d; The third example offers a multiple choice question on integrating reciprocal quadratic functions that cannot be factorized.</p><p>This represents the most difficult kind of problem in this level of mathematics in India since it requires understanding functions such as inverse hyperbolic functions that are less familiar to the student. Even good students incur conceptual problems, time loss, and errors when attempting these problems. In the workshops, VM sutras, &#x0201c;vertically and crosswise,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;transpose and apply,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;addition and subtraction,&#x0201d; were all separately utilized in demonstrating alternative approaches to solving simultaneous equations, emphasizing the choice now being offered to students.

The YP group performed best overall on the tests, possibly because the sequence of YP practices settles the mind and may bear some similarity to MBI. The VM group was observed to increase by a small amount in mindfulness with high significance but was not observed to decrease significantly in aggression as had been hypothesized. Increased confidence in a single subject, mathematics, may not necessarily translate into decreases in self-reported feelings of aggression, particularly as the learning environment did not change for teaching other subjects, and the learning environment has been found to be a significant factor in stress generation.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>A possible reason for the observed increase in mindfulness in the VM group may be that giving students choice of how to perform calculations enhances their ability to reflect internally on their own preferences, thus increasing their capacity for a more internally directed orientation of awareness. It can also be argued that adding a fun element to the learning process involving pattern recognition, a right hemisphere activity,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] may have improved participants&#x02019; capacity for being in the present moment.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Another possible reason is that reductions in mathematics anxiety may make mindfulness easier to maintain.</p><p>The YP group improved far more in mindfulness than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001 in both cases), and alone decreased highly significantly in aggression and significantly on negative emotion regulation. Several studies have reported increases in emotional regulation resulting from mindfulness training.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] For one group to both increase in a measure of mindfulness and decrease in aggression and negative emotion is consistent with these results. In support of this, Yoga, including nadi-shodana pranayama as used in this study, has been found to be very effective in changing the levels of key endocrine molecules associated with stress such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] This may explain its effectiveness in decreasing self-reported aggression on the Nonphysical Aggression Scale from Pittsburgh Youth Study.</p><p>The observed effect of YP on mindfulness is important. Although the practice is not specifically designed to increase mindfulness, it is extremely calming and centering for participants&#x02019; awareness, and evidently increases mindfulness as a beneficial side effect.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Further studies of this could prove helpful.</p><p>Yogic <italic>Kapalabhati Kriya</italic> washes away carbon dioxide and increases oxygen concentration, also revitalizes the functions of brain cells. <italic>N&#x00101;&#x01e0d;&#x0012b; &#x0015a;uddhi</italic> brings sympathetic and parasympathetic balance in the nervous system and balance in anabolic and catabolic processes which would lead to clarity of mind and concentration.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Hence, this could be the reason to find the overall improvement in YP group.</p><p>In contrast, controls&#x02019; observed decrease in aggression seems anomalous. When 12 group comparisons are made in a single study, one change reaching <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 by chance is not unusual.</p><p>As regards possible connections between MAAS measured mindfulness and emotion and behavior regulation, we performed various correlations between premeasurements of our 243 participants in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis.

While the first is clearly expected, the second result is interesting in that those with higher scores on mindfulness felt less need to hide negative feelings, possibly indicating that their general levels of negativity were less and equally that negative feelings may block mindful awareness.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] The same might also be said about the first correlation, those with high levels of outward aggression, presumably originating in internal frustration, may be less capable of being in present moment states of mindfulness.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, a similar analysis of correlations between the ERQ positive and ERQ negative scales yielded extraordinary results: Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.24, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0002, prevalues, and <italic>r</italic> = 0.35, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 postvalues. Positive correlations between supposedly independent scales, even correlations of this magnitude, are not to be expected. The interpretation of this correlation is difficult but may mean that the test needs revalidation in India, where English may not be English speakers&#x02019; mother tongue.</p><p>The strengths of the study include the number of participants for pre&#x02013;post within group changes and intergroup comparisons. Moreover, it specifically supports the idea that YP can improve participants&#x02019; quality of mindfulness[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and help in students&#x02019; management of aggression issues.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The main weakness was the assignment of participants to groups by an arbitrary choice of which class took which intervention, rather than by a fully randomized assignment to different groups. Although the latter would have made the study technically superior, each class was naturally heterogeneous and had similar baseline sociodemographic characteristics; there is no reason to believe that it would have changed the overall findings and conclusions.</p><p>Results of the study were sufficiently promising to encourage further research, particularly in light of the measurements on mathematics anxiety and other variables (submitted for publication). It is hoped that funds for larger, fully randomized studies will be forthcoming.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While VM has been found highly effective in enhancing 12<sup>th</sup> grade exam results, it seems less effective on variables reported in this study. YP techniques, on the other hand, could be useful in schools and preuniversity colleges to produce more settled states of mind such as those associated with mindfulness and also to reduce symptoms of aggression that seem to result from examination pressures during the 12<sup>th</sup> grade year of high school/preuniversity college when such stressors are at their peak.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-12" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Sri Sai Angels School for providing subjects, place, and equipment to carry out the study.
