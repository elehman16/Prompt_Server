effectiveness of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) after total knee
arthroplasty. [Subjects and Methods] We included 30 patients and they were randomly
assigned to two groups. In addition to the standard rehabilitation program the PNF group
received proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation therapy and the CPM group received
continuous passive motion therapy. The outcome measures included range of motion using a
goniometer, pain scores using a numeric pain rating scale, days to reach functional
benchmarks, the Beck depression scale and isokinetic torque and isometric strength
measurements. [Results] There were no significant differences between the two groups in
terms of baseline demographic data, clinical findings and length of stay. Days to reach
range of motion benchmarks were similar in the two groups. Pain at the 8th week was
slightly higher in the PNF group. With the exception of walking with a walker, days to
reach functional benchmarks were statistically significantly fewer in patients of the PNF
group despite similar isokinetic measurements. Administration of PNF resulted in earlier
functional gains in patients after total knee arthroplasty. These functional
accomplishments were more pronounced in the PNF group despite it having isokinetic torque
measurements similar to those of the CPM group. [Conclusion] PNF techniques can positively
affect functional outcomes over the long term.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional gains</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reaching maximum possible knee range of motion (ROM) and attaining certain functional
milestones remain the mainstay of rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
ROM constitutes one of the most important outcomes following TKA since patients with less
than 105&#x000b0; knee ROM have difficulty going up and down the stairs or getting out of a low
chair<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Restricted postoperative knee
flexion is one of the most frequent postoperative complications and is an indicator of
patient dissatisfaction<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After Salter et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated the
beneficial effects of continuous passive motion (CPM) on articular cartilage defect healing
in rabbits, various studies have investigated the effectiveness of CPM. Despite
controversies it has been regarded as a standard postoperative management tool, since CPM
offers short-term benefits<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, its long term effectiveness remains obscure.
Postel et al. suggested the comparison of alternative intermittent mobilization techniques
with CPM<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, few studies have
addressed this issue. Chow et al. have assessed the effects of active, passive and
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching for patients with TKA on ROM in
the early postoperative period<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the
long term effectiveness or benefits of mobilization techniques on functional parameters has
not been investigated.</p><p>PNF exercises involving agonist and antagonist muscles are designed to promote the
neuromuscular responses of the proprioceptors and are frequently used in the clinics to
relieve pain and increase ROM for various ailments. It is an attractive method for
increasing strength and proprioception in elderly individuals<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>; and may have additional benefits in addition to increasing ROM. In
this study, the long term functional effectiveness of PNF was investigated from various
aspects with a special emphasis on the functional point of view.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty subjects who underwent TKA in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Marmara
University for a diagnosis of osteoarthritis were included in this study. Patients with
infection of the affected knee, neuromuscular problems, psychiatric disorders or cardiac
problems were excluded. After surgery patients were randomly assigned to either PNF (Group
1) or CPM (Group 2) treatment groups. Patients were treated everyday during their hospital
stay, 3 times/week after discharge for 2 months, 1/week in the following 2 months, and
performed home exercises in the remaining days. They were followed by the same
physiotherapist.</p><p>In addition to the standard TKA rehabilitation program<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> including pain control, knee mobilization, exercises, transfer,
mobility, the PNF group received PNF therapy and the CPM group received CPM therapy lasting
1 hour similar to the intervention of Denis et al<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After detailed instruction of the procedure, patients in the PNF group were placed supine
and were asked to follow the exercises with visual feedback. They performed 3 sets of 5
repetitions of the rhythmic initiation technique<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> starting from the first postoperative day. After a patient became
competent in performing in exercises in both directions, leg patterns in the sitting
position were commenced. A combination of isotonics (described by Gregg Johnson and Vicky
Saliba)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and 3 sets of 5 repetitions
of the rhythmic stabilisation technique were performed. Each contraction was held for 6
seconds with alternation between the agonist and antagonist muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the CPM group after 5 minutes warm-up, ROM was set as tolerated by the patient. The CPM
protocol was started with 0&#x000b0; to the maximum tolerated flexion angle, depending on the
tolerance of the patient. Participants were instructed not to interfere with the movement of
the CPM device.</p><p>For each participant, anthropometric, personal, and clinical characteristics were recorded,
including gender, age, weight, height, social status, comorbid conditions, previous disease
or surgeries, and time from the onset of symptoms.</p><p>The ROM measurement was taken every day with a 1-degree-increment goniometer. Its center of
rotation was placed in line with the center of the knee, the fixed arm was aligned with the
greater trochanter, and the mobile arm aligned with the lateral malleolus. Measurements were
recorded with respect to full extension being 0 degree with positive numbers indicating a
more flexed position and negative numbers indicating hyperextension. The criterion validity
and the intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of data obtained with the goniometer have been
demonstrated to be high<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to
the baseline values, we noted the days to reach ROM benchmarks of 45, 60, 90 and 100 degrees
of flexion (active and passive), and extension deficits of 20 and 5 degrees.</p><p>Pain scores were measured using a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) similar to Chow et al.,
with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst imaginable pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient was asked to answer the following question:
&#x0201c;How intense is the pain in your knee now?&#x0201d; The patients selected the number that best
reflected the intensity of the pain. Pain was assessed at weeks 1, 2, 8 and 16. Knee
circumference was measured at the center of patella and noted at the ends of weeks 1, 2, 8
and 16<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The days to reach functional
benchmarks such as: pain free use of a walker, double and single canadian use and walking
100 meters without using an aid were recorded, and assessments using the Beck depression
scale at baseline and at the end of the study period were also performed.</p><p>Four months after the surgery, isokinetic torque and isometric strength measurements were
performed using a Cybex 350 isokinetic dynamometer. The bilateral quadriceps and hamstring
muscle strengths were measured at 4 months after surgery; our time frame was similar to
Lauermann et al<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients were seated
on the dynamometer chair (Cybex 350) with a trunk-thigh angle of 90&#x000b0;. Body, pelvis and
thighs were secured with straps. Visual and verbal feedback was provided to the patients.
(1) For the isometric strength measurement, the patients were asked to contract the
quadriceps and hamstring muscle as forcefully as possible for 5 seconds separated by 20
seconds of rest for 4 times. Muscle strength was measured isometrically at 30&#x000b0; and 60&#x000b0;. The
highest MVC torque from four trials was evaluated. (2) Isokinetic concentric peak torque was
evaluated at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;/s, for 4 times separated by 20 seconds of rest. The
peak torque from each of four consecutive trials was used in the analysis.</p><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of Marmara University and the
patients provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of baseline

gains after TKA. These functional accomplishments were more pronounced in the PNF group
despite similar isokinetic torque measurements. Also, earlier recovery was demonstrated by
patients with lower BMI values independent of the treatment. Obesity is a known risk factor
of osteoarthritis<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our findings are in
agreement with Jarvenpaa et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, who
has demonstrated that obesity may delay the recovery from TKA.</p><p>Despite controversies; CPM remains widely used in rehabilitation following TKA surgery, to
accelerate recovery. Various protocols for CPM have been described in the literature;
however, using CPM for long hours is not practical in clinical practice. In the present
study, CPM was administered following Denis et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and similar to their findings, LOS was similar in the two
treatment groups.</p><p>CPM has been argued against since it is a passive mobilization and does not encourage
patients to actively participate in their rehabilitation<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study involving 132 subjects with knee osteoarthritis, it was
demonstrated that PNF techniques were more effective than static stretching<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Minshull et al. have demonstrated that
PNF is as equally efficious for flexibility conditioning as compared to passive stretching,
and they suggested it should be used in preference to passive stretching to preserve dynamic
joint stability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies have noted out the close relationship between ROM, function, and quality of life in
older patients. Stanziano et al. have examined the effects of an 8 week active-assisted
stretching program on functionality, mobility, power and ROM in elderly residents of a
residential retirement community and concluded that this type of exercise is beneficial for
the elderly who have insufficient physical reserves to perform higher-intensity
exercises<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. PNF has been used with
caution for the elderly since it involves close-to-maximal loads and isometric contractions;
however, Pereira et al. have studied the effect of PNF on the diastolic and systolic blood
pressures of the elderly and concluded that this technique is safe<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The PNF group was able to reach functional benchmarks earlier than the CPM group; however,
isokinetic measurements were similar in the two groups. A 6 week PNF stretching program for
49 volunteers has been demonstrated that it increased ROM and decreased tendon stiffness,
despite the absence of change in passive resistive torque<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly Konrad et al. and Higgs et al. reported that a 4 week
quadriceps flexibility training program improved knee ROM without altering muscle isokinetic
strength characteristics<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to these findings, elderly patients benefit
from active-assisted stretching, which is a form of PNF, in terms of both ROM and
performance measures. Thus PNF improves the functional performance of elderly patients with
insufficient reserves to perform higher-intensity exercises<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gonzalez-Rave have compared passive versus proprioceptive
stretching using elderly subjects and concluded that the ROM gain was similar for both
techniques however, they didn&#x02019;t perform functional measures<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lauermann et al. asserted that open chain mono-articular testing may not reflect functional
activities of living<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In agreement with
this, the results of the present study demonstrate increased ROM and accelerated functional
recovery without change in peak isokinetic torque.</p><p>The short term effects of neuromuscular joint facilitation treatment, which integrates a
facilitation component of PNF, have previously been demonstrated. This treatment have led to
increased walking velocity, step length and decreased cadence as well as decreased pain in
patients with osteoarthritis of the knee<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The advantage of our study is that patients were followed for a
long period of time, they were evaluated from the various standing points of ROM, functional
gains, isokinetic measurements and psychological variables. The number of subjects included
in this study were limited by the demands of PNF and the workload of the physiotherapist.
Additionally, we were unable to include a control group since CPM is widely known in our
country and was requested by the patients.</p><p>The present study is the first study to demonstrate the beneficial effects of PNF from a
functional point of view in a prospective long term setting. Further studies of the effects
of PNF using larger patient groups may help to optimize the postoperative rehabilitation of
the TKA patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>MacDonald</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourne</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Rorabeck</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Prospective randomized clinical trial of continuous
