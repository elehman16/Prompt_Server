Flavan-3-ols comprise monomeric flavan-3-ols, or &#x02018;catechins&#x02019;, such as epicatechin as well as oligomers and polymers of catechins called proanthocyanidins. Previous experimental studies have indicated that epicatechin can exert cardioprotective actions, which may involve endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) -mediated nitric oxide production in endothelial cells. Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with epicatechin activates eNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] have demonstrated that cocoa, which is a rich source of flavan-3-ols, improves endothelial function in man. Pure epicatechin has also been shown to have an acute beneficial effect on endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and a non-significant tendency for improved flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) has been reported following supplementation with 100&#x000a0;mg epicatechin for 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, it has been suggested that ingestion of epicatechin is at least partially responsible for the reported vascular effects observed after consumption of cocoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Hypertension is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. It has been estimated that the risk of coronary heart disease is doubled with each blood pressure (BP) increment of 20/10&#x000a0;mmHg (systolic/diastolic), beginning at 115/75&#x000a0;mmHg. Elevated BP may interfere with the integrity of arterial endothelial cells, causing endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest changes in arteries associated with the process of atherosclerosis. A non-invasive ultrasound technique to evaluate endothelium-dependent FMD of the brachial artery has been used in clinical studies on endothelial function. Impaired endothelial function, assessed with the FMD method, was associated with the risk for cardiovascular events in middle-aged adults, also after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, systolic BP, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, heart rate (HR), statin use, and BP medication use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Brachial FMD responses have been in agreement with the results of tests carried out with invasive methods to assess coronary and brachial artery endothelial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Impaired brachial artery endothelial function is also associated with the prevalence and extent of coronary atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In cross-sectional studies, BP levels have been shown to be negatively associated with FMD, and hypertensive subjects have been observed to have decreased FMD responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an orally ingested apple polyphenol extract rich in epicatechin and flavan-3-ol oligomers improves brachial artery endothelial function in volunteers with borderline hypertension. The secondary aim of the study was to test whether the investigational product would non-specifically improve the capacity for vasodilatation, as assessed with nitrate-mediated vasodilatation (NMD) responses. In addition, clinical and laboratory safety assessments were performed before and during the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par25">This was a single-centre, repeated-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the effect of an apple-derived polyphenol extract on endothelial function in otherwise healthy subjects with borderline hypertension or unmedicated mild hypertension.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par26">The study recruited 60 otherwise healthy male and female volunteer subjects, aged 40-65&#x000a0;years, with borderline hypertension or mild hypertension.

The apple extract was provided by Coressence Ltd. The source apples (Evesse&#x02122; Apples) for the extract have the botanical classification <italic>Malus pumila</italic> MILLER, more generally known as <italic>Malus domestica</italic> or the domestic modern apple. Evesse&#x02122; Apples are selected from the Herefordshire Pomona in the UK, a nineteenth Century catalogue of variety type / names of apples and pears known to have been grown in Herefordshire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The apples are harvested at maturity in a period between August and November each year and either freeze dried and powdered or stored in controlled atmosphere and/or coldstores at chilled conditions (2-5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) until processed. Whole fresh apples are de-waxed by an ethanol wash then combined with a proportion of freeze dried apple granules and hot water. While continually stirring, the extraction mixture is rapidly cooled and enzymes are added to assist in the liberation of flavan-3-ols from the apple granule matrix. Denaturing of the enzymes by heating and filtration yields a sugar-rich syrup. Residual carbohydrate polymers are further degraded with enzymes before the sugar-rich intermediate extract is passed over an ion-exchange column to remove sugars. The apple polyphenol extract rich in epicatechin is precipitated using food-grade ethanol and dried. The apple extract is stable at ambient temperatures for at least 18&#x000a0;months from date of manufacturing. Epicatechin and flavan-3-ol content was determined by Reversed Phase HPLC.</p><p id="Par32">In a study by Schroeter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] vascular response measured by the flow mediated dilation and pulse amplitude tonometry was improved with oral administration of 1 or 2&#x000a0;mg/kg bw of epicatechin in a small proof-of-concept study with healthy volunteers. Similarly, significant increases in vascular response were reported after oral administration of 1.5. mk/kg bw of epicatechin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These studies provide rationale for a target dose of dietary supplement delivering 1-2&#x000a0;mg/kg bw epicatechin to improve vascular function. Thus, in this study the daily dose of 100&#x000a0;mg epicatechin was administrated.</p><p id="Par33">The study product was given orally as a single dose of 330&#x000a0;mg/day, containing 100&#x000a0;mg of epicatechin, and encapsulated in hard gelatine capsule. The study subjects were instructed to take the study product preferably in the morning, with breakfast, approximately at 8&#x000a0;a.m. (between 6 and 10&#x000a0;a.m.). The first and the last study product dose of each treatment period were administered at the study site after a standard breakfast.</p><p id="Par34">The placebo capsules had similar appearance as verum/epicatechin capsules but contained 335&#x000a0;mg Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (Tabulose Blanver, Florida, USA).

The method was based on the measurement of brachial arterial diameter at baseline and after a vasodilatory stimulus.</p><p id="Par36">Brachial artery scans were obtained at rest and during reactive hyperaemia to study endothelium-dependent FMD. The luminal diameter of the artery was first measured at rest at a fixed distance from an anatomical marker at end-diastole, incident with the R wave on the ECG (3 measurements; the mean was used in the analyses). The artery was then occluded by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed around the forearm to a pressure of 250&#x000a0;mmHg. After 4.5&#x000a0;min, the cuff was deflated, causing increased blood flow in the artery, i.e. reactive hyperaemia. The arterial diameter was now recorded at 40, 60 and 80&#x000a0;s after cuff release, and dilatation of the artery from baseline was measured offline at end-diastole, incident with the R wave. From these data, the maximal FMD response was calculated as per cent increase of the arterial diameter from the baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The pre and post FMD tests were performed on all Visits 1 to 4. The pre FMD test was performed at baseline, prior to study treatment administration, and the post FMD test was repeated 1.5&#x000a0;h after the administration. The timing of the second FMD measurement was based on a recent human bioavailability study showing that the time for maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of the active moiety (epicatechin and its metabolites: 3&#x02019;methylepicatechin, 4&#x02019;methylepicatechin, epicatechin sulfates and methyl-epicatechin sulfates) observed for a drink fortified with the same apple polyphenol extract rich in epicatechin and flavan-3-ol oligomers was at 1.0 -1.5&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Long-term changes in endothelial function were evaluated by comparing the pre FMD test values measured at the beginning and end of each Treatment Period. Acute changes in endothelial function were evaluated by comparing the pre and post FMD test values measured on the first visit of each treatment period (Visits 1 and 3). Additionally, acute changes in endothelial function were assessed by comparing the pre and post FMD test values measured on the last visit of each Treatment Period (visits 2 and 4), and taking into account the possible long-term change.</p><p id="Par39">The NMD test was performed on all Visits (1-4), after the post FMD test. A new baseline measurement of the luminal diameter was performed 10&#x000a0;min after the postFMD test, and a dose of 1.25&#x000a0;mg of isosorbide dinitrate (Dinit, Leiras, Finland, 1.25&#x000a0;mg/dose; 1 spray) was administered sublingually, and the arterial diameter was measured 4&#x000a0;min later. From this measurement, the NMD% (per cent increase of the arterial diameter from the baseline) was calculated.

The secondary efficacy variables were the brachial NMD% test result, systolic and diastolic BP and the seven investigated biomarkers (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, PAI-1, CRP, ADMA, vWf and sE-selectin).

No statistically significant effects of gender or age on the FMD responses were seen.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par66">This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study showed a significant acute improvement in FMD of the brachial artery, an indicator of endothelial function, in subjects with borderline or mild hypertension after intake of the epicatechin-containing study product. Nevertheless, when contrasted with placebo administration, the study did not reveal statistically significant improvements in FMD, neither associated with acute ingestion nor long-term consumption of the epicatechin product. In addition, no significant effects on the secondary efficacy variables, NMD, BP and biomarkers of vascular function, were found.</p><p id="Par67">Endothelial function can be non-invasively assessed by ultrasound imaging. This ultrasound test measures flow-mediated changes in the diameter of the brachial artery. Flow-mediated changes in brachial artery diameter are caused by shear stress -induced generation of endothelial-derived vasoactive mediators. Since the brachial artery dilatation response to shear stress can be almost completely blocked by pretreatment with nitric oxide synthase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], it has been suggested that the phenomenon is predominantly due to endothelial release of nitric oxide. Increasing evidence suggests that brachial FMD is not only associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also with future cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis estimated that a 1 % decrease in FMD and a one SD decrease in FMD are associated with 8% and 22% increases in the risk of future cardiovascular events, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Risk factors that have been associated with impaired FMD responses include hypertension, increasing age, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, passive smoking, and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Dietary factors that have been shown to impair FMD responses include e.g. high intake of sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and, saturated fats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], whereas the intake of vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], vitamin D3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] improve FMD responses.</p><p id="Par68">Many flavonoids are potent antioxidants in in vitro systems. High intake of flavonoid-rich foods has been associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the current study, we found no significant improvement in endothelial function, as assessed with the FMD test, after ingestion of the dietary supplement epicatechin, a flavonoid enriched in a specific variety of apples, compared to placebo, although significant acute improvements were observed after epicatechin intake.</p><p id="Par69">According to previous studies, the brachial FMD response is reduced in individuals with elevated BP compared to individuals with healthy BP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Importantly, the inverse association between systolic BP and the brachial FMD response is linear. Elevated BP may interfere with the integrity of arterial endothelial cells, causing endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the present study that included individuals with elevated BP values, the FMD values averaged ~6-7%. As expected, these responses were smaller than those reported in the general Finnish population that are typically in the range of ~8-9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, as no pre-selection of the study subjects was done based on the baseline FMD responses, many pre-hypertensive individuals with FMD values within the normal range were included in the study.</p><p id="Par70">The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an orally ingested apple polyphenol extract rich in epicatechin and flavan-3-ol oligomers improves brachial artery endothelial function in volunteers with borderline hypertension or mild unmedicated hypertension, either acutely or in a longer term, or both. At treatment start, acute apple extract administration was associated with a mean FMD% increase of ~0.9%. During the end-of-treatment visit, the corresponding FMD% increase was ~1.5%. However, small acute improvements in FMD% were also seen after placebo intake. The corresponding changes after placebo were ~0.4 and ~0.7%. Therefore, the superiority of apple extract over placebo did not reach statistical significance. There is no clear explanation why the administration of placebo was associated with enhanced FMD responses. Mental stress has been associated with endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and one possible explanation is alleviation of the initial stress related to the vascular testing situation in the course of the study visits, as the subjects became accustomed to the testing environment and circumstances.</p><p id="Par71">The changes in FMD% after intake of apple extract showed large inter-individual variation, ranging from a small reduction of 1% to a maximum increase of 24.6%. With placebo, the corresponding minimum and maximum changes were &#x02212;2.8% and 20.9%. Despite this large variation, the standard deviations for FMD% were quite similar to those reported earlier from a healthy Finnish population in a similar age range (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2185), where the mean FMD% was greater (8.9%) than that observed in the current study, but the standard deviation was of similar magnitude (SD 4.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par72">After four weeks of once-daily intake of apple extract, there was a sustained increase in epicatechin concentrations in plasma. Despite this, however, and the suggestive acute vascular effects, there was no significant improvement in FMD at four weeks. The reasons for this lack of efficacy are unclear, but may indicate some kind of desensitization to the vascular effects of epicatechin associated with prolonged exposure. One explanation could be that the subjects did not have significant enough hypertension for the effects of the extract to be significant. An analogous finding has been previously reported with vitamin C. In cigarette smokers, short-term oral administration of vitamin C acutely improved brachial FMD responses but there was no sustained effect after eight weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis were analyzed from blood samples collected at the start and end of both Treatment Periods. Apple extract supplementation did not have statistically significant effects on the levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, ADMA, PAI-1, vWf, sE-selectin, or CRP. The mean levels of CRP, sICAM-1, and sE-selectin (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) were well within the reference ranges found in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast, the mean concentrations of total PAI-1, sVCAM-1, and ADMA (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) in the study population were at the high end of the normal range, which is in line with the study population being borderline hypertensive. It is important to note, however, that the published reference ranges may not be transferrable to other populations, depending for example on different genetic backgrounds and environments. For total vWf protein concentration, reference ranges were not found in the literature, because in the clinical diagnostics, the biological activity of vWf is measured rather than the concentration of the protein. The statistical associations between the biomarkers and total epicatechin levels in blood were evaluated but no significant correlations were found. As the levels of the biomarkers were within or at the high end of the literature-based reference ranges (i.e. close to normal), it may be that the possible effects of epicatechin, if any, on pathological levels of these markers remained undetected. Also, statistically significant associations were not found between the levels of the biomarkers and acute FMD%, which is in line with the results above.</p><p id="Par74">In a dietary intervention trial such as the present study, it is important to make an attempt to control for large fluctuations in diet. For this reason, the subjects were advised to maintain their normal diets during the duration of the study and not make any major changes. In addition, high intake of epicatechin was an exclusion criterion in this trial. According to food diaries, the macronutrient intakes were similar as those reported by national dietary intake statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, no differences in daily dietary intake of macronutrients, vitamins or major food groups known to contain flavonoids (e.g. apples, tea, cocoa, red wine) were seen between the baseline records or those of the intervention periods. The dietary habits as reported by the study subjects thus offer no explanation for the lack of efficacy of apple extract. The subjects came to the visits after fasting overnight and were offered a standard snack after the first blood samples were drawn. The snack included a bread-roll and sugar-free juice. In an earlier study by J&#x000e4;rvisalo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], eating a low-fat breakfast or lunch did not have any significant effect on FMD, so it is unlikely that the snack offered in this study would explain the lack of difference between the apple extract and placebo interventions on FMD.</p><p id="Par75">The reasons for the lack of a significant effect of apple extract on FMD compared to placebo in this study are unclear. Future trials should further evaluate determinants of efficacy, e.g. studying individual differences in epicatechin pharmacokinetics might offer information on the best timing of the FMD% measurement after administration of epicatechin when evaluating acute effects. In this study, FMD% was measured at 1&#x000bd;&#x000a0;hours after administration of the investigational product, but analysis of serum concentrations of epicatechin showed that there were some individuals whose epicatechin concentration in serum was still undetectable&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;h after apple extract administration. Also, it would be of interest to carry out a dose-finding study and to repeat an acute and long-term effect study by prescreening the study subjects and include only those who have been shown to efficiently absorb epicatechin.</p><p id="Par76">The present study population included many individuals with FMD responses within the normal range in spite of elevated BP. Therefore, future studies could consider prescreening the study subjects to include only individuals with documented endothelial dysfunction, e.g. with FMD responses repeatedly below the population average (FMD% 8.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.5, Raitakari, personal communication). In an attempt to increase statistical power, the current study employed a cross-over design instead of a parallel design. Despite this, the study may have been underpowered, and it is recommended that future studies should take into account the large variation in FMD responses when calculating statistical power. The study showed that the sequence of administration had significant effects on the FMD results which is a valid reason to recommend a parallel-group design in future studies. In the selection of a population with elevated BP, future studies might also consider the use of ambulatory BP measurements, in order to further refine the target population by exclusion of subjects with transient white-coat hypertension. This might lead to more accurate target group selection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par77">We found a significant acute improvement in maximum FMD% with apple extract rich in epicatechin administration.

The overall long-term effect of apple extract on FMD% was not different from placebo.
