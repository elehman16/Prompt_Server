We also examined the effect of adding the immune modulator levamisole to the two different schedules of IL-2. Thirty-nine patients were entered into two sequential phase I/II studies. Eighteen patients entered study 1 and were randomised to receive IL-2, 3 x 10(6) IU m-2 day-1, subcutaneously for 3 months with or without levamisole 50 mg t.d.s. p.o. on days 1-3 on alternate weeks. Twenty-one patients entered study 2 and were randomised to receive 5.4 x 10(6) IU m-2 day-1 subcutaneously for 3 months with or without levamisole 50 mg t.d.s. p.o. on days 1-3 on alternate weeks. Blood was taken for peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) phenotype analysis, and measurement of IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and neopterin concentration. Two patients with metastatic melanoma, one in each study, responded (11.8%); both received IL-2 alone. Observations of immunological parameters showed that treatment with subcutaneous IL-2 resulted in a significant rise in the percentage of PBLs bearing CD25, CD3/HLA-DR, CD56 and levels of IL-2 receptor and neopterin. The total white blood cell count (WBC) and total lymphocyte count rose significantly on day 18 compared with pretreatment levels. The addition of levamisole to either IL-2 schedule resulted in no significant changes in any immunological parameters. This study illustrates that prolonged subcutaneous IL-2 can be given safely in the outpatient setting. There was no evidence that levamisole acts as an immunomodulator in this study.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1109" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1110" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1111" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1112" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00023-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1113" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
