Internet interventions have the potential for enormous public health impact given their broad reach and effectiveness. However, most users engage only minimally with even the best designed websites, diminishing their impact due to an insufficient &#x02018;dose&#x02019;. Two approaches to improve adherence to Internet cessation programs are integrating smokers into an online social network and providing free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Active participation in online communities is associated with higher rates of cessation. Integrating smokers into an online social network can increase support and may also increase utilization of cessation tools and NRT. Removing barriers to NRT may increase uptake and adherence, and may also increase use of online cessation tools as smokers look for information and support while quitting. The combination of both strategies may exert the most powerful effects on adherence compared to either strategy alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study compares the efficacy of a smoking cessation website (WEB) alone and in conjunction with free NRT and a social network (SN) protocol designed to integrate participants into the online community. Using a 2 (SN, no SN) x 2 (NRT, no NRT) randomized, controlled factorial design with repeated measures at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months, this study will recruit N = 4,000 new members of an internet cessation program and randomize them to: 1) WEB, 2) WEB + SN, 3) WEB + NRT, or 4) WEB + SN + NRT. Hypotheses are that all interventions will outperform WEB and that WEB + SN + NRT will outperform WEB + NRT and WEB + SN on 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 9 months. Exploratory analyses will examine theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Addressing adherence in internet cessation programs is critical and timely to leverage their potential public health impact. This study is innovative in its use of a social network approach to improve behavioral and pharmacological treatment utilization to improve cessation. This approach is significant for reducing tobacco&#x02019;s devastating disease burden and for optimizing behavior change in other arenas where adherence is just as critical.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN45127327">ISRCTN45127327</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>Social networks</kwd><kwd>Nicotine replacement therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, causing 443,000 premature deaths among adults and nearly $200 billion in total economic burden each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Currently, 20.4% of adults smoke, and reductions in smoking prevalence have stalled in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Accelerating the reduction in the population prevalence of smoking will require innovative approaches to reach and treat current smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The internet is a promising delivery channel for tobacco cessation interventions that has the potential for enormous public health impact (reach x efficacy; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). The majority of U.S. adults are internet users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and internet use continues to expand through all segments of the U.S. population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], especially among rural populations, racial/ethnic minorities, and lower income groups that are at disproportionate risk for smoking. Recent reports indicate 6 to 9% of all internet users in the United States - more than 10 million adults - search for assistance in quitting smoking each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The internet is well-suited to deliver the core elements of evidence-based cessation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]: 1) Practical counseling (problem solving/skills training) information and feedback can be tailored and produced immediately; 2) Social support from peers and experts can be provided in online communities; and 3) Information about pharmacotherapy can be provided, with tailored guidance for medication selection and dosing. Internet treatment can be accessed 24/7 - particularly at relapse-sensitive times - and used as long as a smoker desires. The costs of internet programs are relatively fixed, resulting in greater efficiency as use increases. Studies have shown quit rates of 7 to 26% at 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and recent meta-analyses support its effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A &#x02018;dose response&#x02019; relationship between intensity of use (for example, number of visits, duration of use) and higher abstinence rates has also been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The internet is not a panacea for reaching or treating all smokers, but its current use among millions of smokers provides an extraordinary opportunity to increase population cessation rates.</p><p>Despite this enormous potential, however, the impact of internet cessation interventions is yet to be realized given the challenges of poor adherence. Adherence is traditionally defined as &#x02018;the extent to which a person&#x02019;s behaviour corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Since internet interventions have no specified prescriptions for use, adherence in this context may best be defined as &#x02018;the extent to which individuals experience the content of the intervention&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or more simply &#x02018;use of the eHealth intervention over time&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Adherence is measured by website utilization metrics which may include the number of logins a participant makes during a specific period of time, the number of days between registration and last login as a measure of duration of use, the number of interactive features used, and the number of modules or materials read [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A consistent finding - across internet cessation programs and study populations - is that most users engage only minimally with even the most popular, field-tested websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Most users visit only one to two times and do not use many of the interactive tools, community support, or pharmacotherapy that can promote abstinence. Also referred to as engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], non-usage attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] in a growing number of eHealth research studies, the problem of adherence has been observed across internet studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Low levels of adherence in internet programs is not a phenomenon unique to one or two sites, but rather an aspect of this treatment modality that has yet to be understood or fully addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study is to test two independent strategies - and their interaction - to improve quit rates through greater adherence to the evidence-based components of cessation treatment (practical counseling, social support, pharmacotherapy). Increasing adherence to these treatment components could result in an extraordinary increase in population rates of cessation.</p><sec><title>Promoting adherence to cessation treatment via social network effects</title><p>One approach to increasing adherence in internet cessation programs - and improving treatment outcomes - lies within online social networks. Data from several sources demonstrate powerful links between participation in online social networks, web-based treatment adherence, and improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. For example, Cobb <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found that a composite measure of website utilization intensity (number of logins x duration in minutes per login) was highly correlated with use of support resources (that is, number of emails sent and received, number of people an individual sent email to and received email from), suggesting that greater website use was largely a function of involvement in the online community. Individuals who participated in the community were almost three times as likely to have quit three months later (odds ratio = 2.71) and four times more likely to be continuously abstinent for two months or more (OR = 4.08) as compared to less intensive users, even after controlling for motivation. Quitters were more likely to have posted in forums, made an online buddy, and sent or received internal email than those who did not quit. An <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found that weekly peer emails may have contributed to significantly higher cessation website utilization throughout a 20-week smoking cessation study with college students. More recently, Richardson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that compared to participants who did not access the online community on BecomeAnEX.org, those who used it one time were 1.7 times more likely to be abstinent, and those who used it two or more times were 2.2 times more likely to be abstinent even after controlling for general utilization (visits) and a broad range of demographic, smoking, and psychosocial covariates. An observational study by Poirier and Cobb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] found that participants with social ties in a web-based program to improve well-being showed higher levels of engagement as measured by website visits, opening program emails, and completing program challenges.</p><p>Unfortunately, only a small percentage of users engage in online cessation communities either actively (that is, sending messages, posting in forums) or passively (that is, reading posts by others, viewing profiles) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since social support is a key component of cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and participation in an online social network may yield important benefits for cessation, it is important to investigate how to increase the percentage of users who benefit from these interactions.</p><p>This study uses a social network approach - proactive, directed, and personalized outreach from within an online community - to increase the proportion of new members that participate in and become integrated into an existing online social network. The approach centers on social networking, defined as the formation of ties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and evidenced by reciprocal communications between members. While there are robust associations between social network factors and improved health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], there are few reports of network interventions in which ties between individuals are modified or manipulated to effect behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Network interventions may work by targeting individuals based on their position within the network, or by modifying the social networking process to alter the structure of the network. Social processes such as smoking cessation are thought to exhibit a threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] or complex contagion effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] where social influence increases non-linearly as additional contacts adopt (or drop) the behavior of interest. This study is based on the premise that increasing the number of ties among members of an online network may enhance a range of behavior changes (for example, repeat visits to a website, community participation, sustained NRT use, cessation), particularly in individuals who start with no connections and might otherwise form few or no connections within the network.</p></sec><sec><title>Promoting adherence to cessation treatment via free NRT</title><p>A second strategy to improve adherence in the evidence-based elements of cessation treatment is to provide smokers with access to NRT free of charge. Although NRT doubles the chances of successful cessation and is a proven quitting strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], the vast majority of smokers do not use NRT when quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Among the small percentage of smokers that do use NRT, the majority does not follow recommended usage guidelines for duration and/or dosage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Providing smokers with free or reduced-cost NRT has been shown to increase initial uptake (that is, trial of NRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Importantly, providing smokers with free NRT may also increase utilization of the practical counseling tools and social support available in an internet cessation program. It may induce smokers to make a quit attempt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] during which they may be more likely to make use of internet tools to plan for cessation, to assist them in setting a quit date, and to help them learn how to cope with craving and withdrawal symptoms. They may also be more likely to turn to current and former smokers in an online community for guidance through the cessation process and for information about medication dosing or side effects. There may also be reciprocal and interactive effects, with greater internet cessation program use leading to greater NRT adherence and vice versa. Several randomized trials have examined the combined efficacy of internet cessation treatment and NRT on abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. No study that we are aware of has specifically addressed whether providing NRT free of charge in conjunction with internet cessation can improve cessation outcomes through greater adherence to the problem solving/skills training, pharmacological, and social support components of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The overarching goal of this study is to test the individual and combined effects of two potentially complementary strategies to improve adherence to the evidence-based elements of cessation treatment: 1) leveraging powerful social network effects for behavior change, and 2) providing access to an initial course of free nicotine replacement therapy. Primary Aim 1 is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of WEB + SN, WEB + NRT, and WEB + SN + NRT versus WEB alone with regard to self-reported 30-day point prevalence abstinence at the primary endpoint of 9 months and at secondary endpoint of 3 months. We hypothesize that all three intervention conditions will outperform WEB and that WEB + SN + NRT will outperform WEB + SN and WEB + NRT. Primary Aim 2 is to examine whether the impact of treatment condition on cessation is mediated by greater adherence to problem solving/skills training tools, social support via the community, and pharmacotherapy (see Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We hypothesize that WEB + SN + NRT will have the greatest impact on treatment adherence, which will yield higher quit rates than the other treatments. Exploratory analyses will examine whether social support and social norms are active elements in the pathway to increased adherence, along with other known mediators of abstinence such as self-efficacy.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Research model. </bold>Theoretical model depicting the intervention components, main outcome variable, and mediating variables.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-48-1"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a randomized controlled trial that uses a 2 (SN, no SN) x 2 (NRT, no NRT) factorial design to compare four treatment conditions in a repeated measures design: WEB, WEB + SN, WEB + NRT, and WEB + SN + NRT. Assessments occur at baseline, at 3 months, and at 9 months, with 30-day self-reported point prevalence abstinence at 9 months as the primary outcome. Self-reported smoking status is a commonly accepted outcome measure in web-based cessation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Biochemical verification of abstinence is not feasible on a national sample enrolled through the internet. Furthermore, misreporting of abstinence is expected to be low for several reasons: low demand characteristics of the interventions, the use of a proactive recruitment strategy to recruit a representative sample of smokers that do not have special consideration that might elicit misreporting, the fact that participation is completely under the control of the participants, and the use of an extended, 9-month follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. We will verify smoking status among a random sample of 10% of self-reported quitters with an established protocol for verification by a significant other.

Immediately following registration on BecomeAnEX, participants are shown an invitation that briefly describes the study. Interested participants complete an online screening form that includes questions about smoking status (current, former, never), motivation to change (planning to quit in the next 30 days, next 6 months, not planning to quit), demographic variables (gender, age, ethnicity, race, education), and contraindications to nicotine replacement therapy (Are you pregnant or breast-feeding, or do you plan to become pregnant in the next year? Do you have heart disease, an irregular heartbeat, or high blood pressure not controlled with medication, or have you had a heart attack in the past 3 months? Are you currently using any kind of stop smoking medication, such as the nicotine patch, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenge or nicotine spray, or prescription medications such as Zyban/bupropion or Chantix/varenicline?). Eligible individuals are presented with the study consent form and asked to provide online informed consent. Those who consent to participate provide contact information (name, email address, phone number). The baseline survey is sent via email to this address and must be completed within 24 hours.

Within 24 hours, they post a public message on the new member&#x02019;s &#x02018;wall&#x02019; within BecomeAnEX to welcome them to the site, encourage them to fill out their profile, or comment on some aspect of an existing profile. In communications with participants, Integrators may use any of the following approaches to engage participants: 1) pose open-ended questions; 2) share their personal experience with smoking and quitting; 3) recommend specific tools and features of the website; 4) inquire about medication use and the participant&#x02019;s experience with a chosen medication; 5) monitor the participant&#x02019;s profile to determine when they have set a quit date and provide encouragement around the quit date; 6) respond to any forum posts by participants; and 7) suggest &#x02018;friends&#x02019; or groups within the community. Integrators are blind to treatment condition in that they do not know whether participants are also receiving NRT (Group 4). The goal is for Integrators to have routine contact with participants for at least 3 months, with ongoing communication with those who respond throughout the duration of the study. Treatment duration of 3 months will provide sufficient time to examine the effectiveness of the integration protocol and will also allow us to evaluate if the effects are persistent at the 9-month follow-up. Each Integrator spends approximately 1 to 2 hours per day in this role.</p><p>Selection of the Integrators was based on analysis of key social network metrics for an online cessation community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Specifically, we identified two individuals within the BecomeAnEX community who had: 1) been a member for at least 6 months; 2) logged in within the previous 2 weeks; 3) made 10 or more blog posts; 4) friended at least 25 other members; 5) both posted and received at least 500 wall comments; 6) posted at least 500 comments on blog posts; 7) joined 1 or more groups; and 8) never received any flags for offensive content. Integrators completed a one-day training to familiarize them with the aims and scope of the project, and to review recent and planned updates and modifications to the BecomeAnEX website. Unlike many other lay person/peer interventions in which those delivering the intervention are trained in the basics of tobacco dependence treatment or counseling approaches, the Integrators in this study did not receive any formal training in tobacco dependence treatment. The protocol is not designed to deliver tobacco dependence treatment or advice; rather, the overarching goal is for the Integrators to facilitate the integration of new members into the BecomeAnEX online social network.</p><p>All communications are monitored by study staff, including review of the timing, content, and tone for outgoing communications. Integrators participate in biweekly supervision meetings via teleconference.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 3 (WEB + NRT)</title><p>Participants are mailed a free 4-week supply of the NRT product of their choice (patch, gum, or lozenge) within 3 days of randomization. The decision to provide 4 weeks of free NRT (versus a full course of 8 to 12 weeks depending on product type) was based on two factors: 1) previous published studies have shown that adherence to NRT remains an issue even when participants are provided a full course of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] and that sending more free NRT to smokers does not necessarily translate into enhanced duration of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] or chances of quitting and remaining smoke-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], and 2) we are interested in examining whether providing a starter kit of free NRT increases initial uptake (that is, any use) and whether the information and resources provided on BecomeAnEX.org increase overall adherence to NRT, including purchase of additional product beyond the free supply.</p><p>Participants are notified by email following randomization that they have been assigned to a treatment group that includes NRT and again when the product has been shipped. NRT is provided as an over-the-counter product (that is, with no additional support or guidance provided) to parallel the experience subjects would have if they purchased NRT on their own. A printed calendar with study contact information is included with the NRT shipment for participants to mark the days they used the product.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 4 (WEB + SN + NRT)</title><p>Participants will have access to 4 weeks of NRT and the SN protocol as described in the sections above.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional contact</title><p>Participants in Groups 1 (WEB) and 2 (WEB + SN) are mailed a letter at the start of the study confirming that they have been enrolled. This letter is to control for the contact present in both NRT treatment arms (Groups 3 and 4) since participants in those conditions receive a mailed package at the start of the study. The content of the letter mirrors the calendar insert included in the NRT mailing.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data for the study are obtained through two sources: 1) self-report assessments at baseline, at 3 months and at 9 months, and 2) online tracking software that records utilization of BecomeAnEX. Online surveys are hosted on a secure server at Legacy; all data transfer is encrypted using SSL protocols. Mixed-mode follow-up (online surveys, telephone for online non-responders; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]) is used to maximize follow-up rates. Mailed reminders are sent prior to each follow-up. An email with a link to the online survey is sent at 3 and 9 months post-randomization; non-respondents receive reminders 3 and 6 days after the initial email. Individuals who have not responded within 7 days are contacted by telephone by professional telephone interviewers. Phone surveys are conducted by research staff blind to treatment condition. Participants are reimbursed via Amazon or PayPal for survey completion ($20 for web survey, $15 for phone survey). Individual level tracking metrics of BecomeAnEX utilization (for example, number of visits, page views, feature utilization) are recorded using Adobe/Omniture SiteCatalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>] software.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>Brief measures with known psychometric properties were selected when possible to minimize respondent burden.

If participants visited a physician/health professional, they are asked whether they discussed quitting and if any cessation treatments were offered or undertaken (for example, bupropion).

Participants randomized to receive nicotine replacement therapy may experience side effects. An extensive literature has generally supported the safety of nicotine patch, gum, and lozenge for healthy smokers and for distribution via population-based treatment modalities as long as clients are screened adequately per labeling instructions. This study encourages use of products that are FDA-approved and sold over-the-counter, and provides all product materials including the instructional package insert. Participants who make a quit attempt may experience withdrawal symptoms after quitting. There is no reason to believe that participation in this study would worsen nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The overall severity of withdrawal discomfort should be diminished among participants who choose to use NRT, although medication will not necessarily eliminate withdrawal discomfort entirely. In any case, withdrawal symptoms tend to be short-lived, with most symptoms abating within 1 to 2 weeks of quitting. Data security and confidentiality are protected at all times. Institutional Review Board approval for the study was provided by Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB protocol #20110887).</p></sec><sec><title>Power analysis</title><p>Sample size is based on assumed quit rates of WEB = 10%, WEB + SN = 16.5%, WEB + NRT = 18%, and WEB + SN + NRT = 26% at 9 months. Assuming a non-differential attrition rate of 25% at the 9-month follow-up, these translate into Intent-To-Treat (ITT) quit rates of WEB = 7.5%, WEB + SN = 12.375%, WEB + NRT = 13.5%, and WEB + SN + NRT = 19.5%. Based upon an extensive set of simulations, we expect power to exceed 85% for all five pair-wise contrasts required for testing the hypotheses of Primary Aim 1 at a multiplicity-adjusted two-tailed significance level of 1%, chosen to maintain the study-wide Type I error rate at 5%.</p><p>Although our 2 x 2 factorial design naturally lends itself to estimation and testing of a SN x NRT interaction, interpretation of such interaction effects is highly dependent on the choice of measurement scale. For example, our assumed quit rates lead to synergistic interaction effects in the probability scale (6.5% + 8.0% for the individual SN and NRT treatments versus 16% assumed for the SN + NRT combination therapy), but antagonistic interaction effects in the odds ratio scale commonly used in logistic regression (SN versus no SN ORs that equal 1.60 when WEB + NRT is the reference group versus 1.78 when WEB alone is the reference group, leading to an SN &#x000d7; NRT interaction OR = 0.90). Hence, we decided to focus instead on a more clinically relevant inferential goal, that is, establishing whether the combination treatment is superior to either treatment alone, irrespective of the presence or absence of an interaction effect. However, to the extent that the presence of such a SN x NRT interaction (OR = 0.90) is of interest to the field, extensive simulation established that it can be estimated and reported with a moderate degree of precision given our planned sample size. In particular, we can be 80% certain that the length of the 95% confidence interval will not exceed 0.72 units in the OR scale (for example, 95% CI = 0.60-1.32).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><sec><title>Preliminary analyses</title><p>The distributional properties of continuously scaled variables will be examined to determine the need for normalizing transformations. Next, we will determine whether the groups show large standardized mean differences at pre-treatment on demographic characteristics, psychosocial variables, or smoking variables.

Differences in abstinence rates between the four study conditions will be evaluated at our primary endpoint of 9 months post-randomization, as well as the secondary endpoint of 3 months post-randomization. To account for within-subject correlation due to the repeated-measures aspect of our study, we will employ the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE), which extends generalized linear model methodology to correlated data in PROC GENMOD of SAS/STAT. Analyses will be conducted first using an ITT principle, analyzing data from all subjects randomized to treatment, counting as smokers those lost to follow-up (missing = smoking).

But the impact of internet cessation interventions is yet to be realized given the limited use of effective treatment components. It is important to note that the focus of this study is not on increasing internet use among all smokers; rather, the focus is on testing specific methods to improve adherence to proven components of cessation treatment for smokers <bold>already</bold> using the internet to quit smoking. As internet use continues to expand through all segments of the U.S. population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] - especially among rural populations, racial/ethnic minorities, and lower income groups at disproportionate risk for smoking - the potential of web-based interventions to reduce population prevalence of smoking will become even more important. Given the demonstrated reach of web-based interventions to millions of smokers, it is critical that we advance scientific understanding about how to engage all users so that they receive the optimal dose of treatment necessary for abstinence in order to realize the full population impact of web-based interventions. The need to improve adherence in cessation treatments is clear: even the best treatment will have little impact if it is not used.</p><p>This study is innovative in the use of a social network approach to formally manipulate and enhance social network effects (that is, individual and network level) to promote smoking cessation through improved treatment adherence. The use of dedicated staff to enhance online communities and social networks is an established industry strategy. Full time professionals typically manage a diffuse group of paraprofessionals recruited from the network itself and trained by the hosting organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>]. This model dates back to the earliest days of online networks, such as support forums on Compuserve, and continues today where companies such as Kaiser Permanente recruit, incentivize, and train specific key-players in their online support communities to enhance discussions, recruit new members, and enforce discipline. These individuals (often called &#x02018;peer moderators&#x02019; or &#x02018;MVPs&#x02019;) are usually managed virtually online, critically enabling the workforce to be spread across time zones. While this model is pervasive in industry, it has never been explicitly tested in a rigorous research trial with a specific focus on increasing adherence. If proven effective, this approach can be scaled to meet the demand of even the largest online health communities.</p><p>The potential scientific and public health impact of this study may extend beyond smoking cessation. Millions of adults use the internet for assistance with other health behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>] and low levels of treatment utilization and attrition have been noted across eHealth studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>]. Results from this study may inform advances in intervention design and implementation, making existing internet programs more effective across a range of behavioral risk factors. Even modest increases in the effectiveness of web-based programs can have enormous public health impact given the broad reach to millions of users.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>We recognize that participants in Groups 1 (WEB) and 2 (WEB + SN) may use NRT on their own and participants in Groups 1 (WEB) and 3 (WEB + NRT) may participate in the BecomeAnEX social network. In an explanatory randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>] use of unassigned treatments may be considered &#x02018;contamination&#x02019;. However, in the context of a web-based pragmatic randomized trial such as this, the use of unassigned treatments is unavoidable but is expected to be minimal. That is, we anticipate that a small proportion of WEB or WEB + SN will use NRT on their own without any prompting or intervention, and a small proportion of WEB or WEB + NRT will engage in the community without any prompting or intervention. The aim of our research is to test the effectiveness of two strategies to increase the proportion of participants who adhere to all components of cessation treatment over and above the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; rates of use. Our power analysis, measurement instruments, and assessment protocols are designed to account for the ways in which individuals use these resources in the real-world.</p><p>Other potential limitations may be difficulty in recruiting racial/ethnic minorities in accordance with targeted enrollment projections, and difficulty in achieving follow-up rates greater than 75% as projected. In the unlikely scenario that recruitment lags, we will extend recruitment until targeted recruitment goals are met and/or modify our analytic plan accordingly. If follow-up rates are less than 75%, we will use a more intensive telephone follow-up approach and consider increasing follow-up incentives as our budget will allow.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Study recruitment began in March 2012.
