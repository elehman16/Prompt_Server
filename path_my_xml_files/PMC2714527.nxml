Medication for on-demand treatment also should have a rapid onset of action to assure that symptoms are controlled. Multiple agents including antacids, histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently available. PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion when used regularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, no study has yet examined whether an H2RA with mosapride (orally ingested) more rapidly increases intragastric pH than the H2RA on its own.

There was a washout period of at least 7 days between each protocol. The subjects fasted overnight (at least 8 hours) before each treatment protocol and during the 4 hours after ingesting the drug or drugs, and both experiments were performed in the morning.</p><p>The pH electrode was inserted transnasally under local anaesthesia and located in the body of the stomach. The gastric pH was measured at 10 second intervals by a portable pH meter attached to the antimony pH electrode (Chemical Instrument Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The pH electrode was calibrated before each recording using standard buffers of pH 4.01 and 6.86. The pH data were analyzed using established software (Chemical Instrument Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The average pH and the percentage of times during which intragastric pH remained above 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 over the 4 hour monitoring period after the administration of each drug programme were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical evaluation was carried out using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.

Mosapride stimulates acetylcholine release from cholinergic neurons in the gastrointestinal wall and may enhance upper gastrointestinal motor activity in the postprandial state in conscious dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. After oral administration, mosapride is absorbed in the small intestine in rats, rather than the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Mosapride accelerates gastric emptying in healthy adults. This study may indicate that mosapride accelerates the absorption of lafutidine. For example, mosapride accelerates the gastric emptying and completion rate of small bowel examinations in patients undergoing capsule endoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The time of gastric emptying time (GET) in the mosapride group was reduced and indicated the obvious effect of mosapride on shortening GET. Moreover, Preparation for barium enemas using mosapride before and after oral intestinal lavage solution (PEG-ELS) intake is more effective than the modified Brown's method that is commonly used in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Mosapride improves gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric stasis or gastroesophageal reflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Mosapride also alleviates gastrointestinal dysfunction.</p><p>Although many factors are implicated in the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), acid reflux to the esophagus is considered to be the major causes of this disease. Treatment with PPIs to provide potent, long-term suppression of gastric acid is essential for disease management. On the other hand, the transient heartburn associated with mild GERD is attributed mainly to temporary, short-term gastric acid reflux. For example, water and antacid immediately increased gastric pH, while PPIs showed a delayed but prolonged effect compared to H2RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because lafutidine promptly suppressed gastric acid secrerion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it was orginally considered to be a useful drug for the on-demand treatment of mild GERD. Because mosapride accelerates gastric emptying, Lafutidine can pass from stomach to duodenum and be absorbed quickly. Lafutidine used with mosapride may cause the rapid onset of action, and may thus be more suitable for on-demand use.</p><p>The limitation of the present study is that the data were collected from healthy volunteers and not GERD patients requiring on-demand therapy. The clinical implications of our results remain unclear; however, our findings suggest that the orally administered combination of lafutidine 10 mg preceded by mosapride 5 mg tablets may be suitable for on-demand treatment in patients with GERD. Further studies are necessary to confirm this assumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In <italic>H. pylori </italic>negative healthy male subjects, an oral dose of lafutidine 10 mg with mosapride 5 mg more rapidly increased intragastric pH than lafutidine 10 mg alone.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>H2RAs: histamine H2 receptor antagonists; PPIs: proton pump inhibitors; 5-HT4: 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 4; GET: gastric emptying time; PEG-ELS: polyethylene glycol electrolyte; GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HI analyzed, collected the clinical data and wrote the manuscript, with contributions from MI, CT an YN.
