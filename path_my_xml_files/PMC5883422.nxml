This study aimed to assess the efficacy of scheduling multiple periods of outdoor free-play in increasing the time children spend in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) while attending childcare.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study employed a cluster randomised controlled trial design involving children aged 3 to 6 years, attending ten childcare services in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Five services were randomised to receive the intervention and five to a control condition. The intervention involved services scheduling three separate periods of outdoor free-play from 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm per day, each at least 15&#x000a0;min in duration, with the total equivalent to their usual daily duration of outdoor play period. Control services implemented the usual single continuous period of outdoor free-play over this time. The primary outcome, children&#x02019;s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) while in care per day, was measured over 5 days via accelerometers at baseline and at 3 months post baseline. Secondary outcomes included percentage of time spent in MVPA while in care per day, total physical activity while in care per day and documented child injury, a hypothesised potential unintended adverse event. Childcare services and data collectors were not blind to the experimental group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Parents of 439 (71.6%) children attending participating childcare services consented for their child to participate in the trial. Of these, 316 (72.0%) children provided valid accelerometer data at both time points. Relative to children in control services, mean daily minutes of MVPA in care was significantly greater at follow-up among children attending intervention services (adjusted difference between groups 5.21&#x000a0;min, 95% CI 0.59&#x02013;9.83 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03). Percentage of time spent in MVPA in care per day was also greater at follow-up among children in intervention services relative to control services (adjusted difference between groups 1.57, 95% CI 0.64&#x02013;2.49 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Total physical activity while in care per day, assessed via counts per minute approached but did not reach significance (adjusted difference between groups 14.25, 95% CI 2.26&#x02013;30.76 <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09). There were no differences between groups in child injury nor subgroup interactions for the primary trial outcome by child age, sex, or baseline MVPA levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Scheduling multiple periods of outdoor free-play significantly increased the time children spent in MVPA while in attendance at childcare. This simple ecological intervention could be considered for broader dissemination as a strategy to increase child physical activity at a population level.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370303&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN1261000347460</ext-link>).

Adequate physical activity is also associated with social, emotional, cognitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and motor skill development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, physical activity in early childhood tracks into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite this, just 41.6 to 50.2% of preschool-aged children in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and 10% in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] currently meet recommended levels of at least 15&#x000a0;min physical activity per hour while in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], measured objectively.</p><p id="Par13">Childcare services are a key setting in which to intervene to improve physical activity levels given that they provide access to a large number of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for prolonged periods. In Australia, children in long day care spend 20&#x000a0;h each week on average, with 43% attending three to 5 weekdays and 57% attending just one to 2 weekdays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For preschools, children attend an average of only 13&#x000a0;h a week with 54% attending 1&#x02013;2 weekdays in care. Long day care services provide centre-based care for eight or more hours per day for 5 days a week and typically enrol children from 6&#x000a0;weeks to under 6&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Preschools provide centre-based care for 6 to 8 h per day and enrol children between 3 and 6 years. Childcare services also have infrastructure that can be utilised to create environments supportive of physically active play via outdoor space and equipment which cater to children&#x02019;s varying activity interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">A recent meta-analysis of randomised trials of childcare-based physical activity interventions reported that their effectiveness was equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The review identified poor implementation of multi-component and complex interventions requiring staff training and resources as a potential contributing factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One potential opportunity to improve the impact of physical activity interventions in the childcare setting may be to design interventions that are more likely to be implemented. Previous research has established that preschool children&#x02019;s activity is characterized by short intense bouts of activity between 3 and 15 min occurring at the start of periods of outdoor free-play, followed by extended recovery periods of sedentary behaviour or light activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Increasing the frequency of outdoor free-play opportunities may, therefore, capitalise on the natural tendency for children to be active at the start of outdoor free-play periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, incorporating such changes into childcare service scheduling and programming may not require additional skills, training or expensive resources to implement, frequently reported barriers to the delivery of other physical activity interventions in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">A recently published study assessed the effect of scheduling more frequent periods of free-play, as part of a multi-component intervention, on children&#x02019;s physical activity levels and sedentary time in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Specifically, intervention services scheduled four 30&#x000a0;min periods of outdoor free-play, with trained educators in physical activity promotion, during which additional portable equipment such as balls, hula hoops, hopscotch mats, obstacle courses, stepping domes, ribbon wands and hop along bouncers was also made available. The 8 week intervention was found to be effective while the more frequent outdoor free-play periods were implemented as scheduled, but not at 12&#x000a0;months follow-up; when services were observed to have ceased their implementation. Furthermore, being multi-component, this trial was unable to delineate which components of the trial had been effective in improving child activity.</p><p id="Par16">Given the promising effects observed for outdoor free-play period scheduling, in combination with trained staff and equipment provision, the current study sought to extend the evidence base and isolate the effectiveness of repeated periods of outdoor free-play opportunities on child physical activity. Specifically, the aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of scheduling three periods of outdoor free-play each day in childcare services in increasing the time children spend in MVPA when attending childcare, compared to a period of continuous play of equal duration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par17">The trial is reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement and its extension on cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A detailed protocol for this trial has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p id="Par18">The study employed a between group, cluster randomised controlled trial design (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Ten centre-based childcare services, with only one scheduled period of outdoor free-play during their core operating hours of 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm (of at least 45&#x000a0;min duration) were randomised to an intervention or control group (1:1 ratio). Services were selected from the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. The intervention was 3&#x000a0;months in duration. Data on child physical activity during care were assessed on a cohort of children, via accelerometer over a 5-day period at baseline and immediately post intervention at approximately 3 months post baseline.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Illustration of the flow of trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>3&#x000a0;weeks</th><th>5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days</th><th>3&#x000a0;months</th><th>5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recruitment<break/>-Services (verbal)<break/>-Parent (informed consent)<break/>-Child (verbal)</td><td>Baseline data collection<break/>NS Interviews<break/>In-care &#x00026; out of care accelerometry<break/>EPAO<break/>Parent CATI</td><td>After randomisation, intervention services &#x02013; 3 outdoor free-play periods; control services &#x02013; maintain 1 continuous free-play period</td><td>Follow-up data collection<break/>In-care &#x00026; out of care accelerometry<break/>EPAO</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Childcare services</title><p id="Par19">To be eligible to participate in the trial, services were required to have a daily enrolment of at least 25 children aged 3 to 6 years. Services also needed to have an existing schedule of outdoor free-play time for children consisting of a single period of at least 45&#x000a0;min during the core hours of service from 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm. Services that reported already having more than one outdoor free-play period were ineligible to participate in the trial. Services catering solely for occasional care or children with special needs (e.g. requiring specialist support, which may affect physical activity scheduling) were excluded from the trial as were services currently participating in other interventions trials within the study region (nutrition and educator trials).</p><p id="Par20">Recruitment was conducted from April to June 2016. A member of the research team, who was not involved in the delivery of the trial or data collection, made telephone contact with childcare services to assess eligibility, and invited eligible services to participate in the study. Once verbal consent was obtained, services were invited to take part in a short telephone interview. Study information forms and consent forms were sent to the services to distribute to parents of eligible children enrolled at consenting childcare services (14 out of a potential 219 services) across the study region.</p><p id="Par21">The trial originally sought to utilise probability-sampling methods to recruit childcare services; however a change in recommended practice for the setting (that services provide ongoing rather than structured opportunities for outdoor free-play across the day) meant that a large proportion of services (58%) were ineligible for the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As such, a convenience sample of 14 eligible services were identified and consented to participate. A further four services were deemed ineligible at baseline due to not having one period of outdoor free-play in core hours of 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Parents and children</title><p id="Par22">To be eligible to participate in the data collection component of the study, children were required to be aged 3 to 6 years and, to have attended participating services between 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm on 1 or more days during the week of data collection. During the week prior to the agreed week of baseline data collection, a research assistant was also deployed during periods of drop-off or pick-up of children to distribute information and consent forms to parents at each service. Parents were invited to provide consent for their child to participate in measurement i) at childcare and ii) at home (using accelerometers). Parents could consent to children wearing accelerometers in care but not at home. All parents of participating children were also invited to participate in a computer -assisted telephone interview (CATI).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation, allocation and blinding</title><p id="Par23">A statistician with no other involvement in recruitment or data collection allocated services to either the intervention or the control condition in a 1:1 ratio using a computerised random number generator, following baseline data collection. Randomisation of childcare services were stratified by the socioeconomic status of the areas where the services were located (using their postcode), and the service type (long day care service or preschool) based on previous finding of an association between these factors and the physical activity policies and practices of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Services were informed of their experimental group allocation after baseline data collection by a member of the research team. Data analysts were blinded to the group allocation of intervention and control services.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par24">The intervention sought to create a childcare environment supportive of child physical activity by scheduling multiple opportunities for outdoor free-play in a way that is consistent with a child&#x02019;s natural physical activity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Specifically, within a 6 h day (9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm), the intervention involved dividing the single usual period of outdoor free-play from children into three periods of at least 15&#x000a0;min duration per period. For example, an intervention service, which usually scheduled one 60&#x000a0;min continuous free-play period, was rescheduled to two shorter periods in the morning of 15 min each, and one period in the afternoon of 30&#x000a0;min. Services were encouraged to keep the total duration of outdoor free-play across the day consistent with that assessed at baseline.</p><p id="Par25">Immediately following baseline data collection services allocated to receive the intervention were contacted by a member of the research team and an early childhood education specialist to support the implementation of the intervention. All services were asked to accept two visits and two telephone calls to their service to assess if implementation was taking place and provide the opportunity to give feedback to those services experiencing any difficulties. Services were also offered written materials covering national guidelines on physical activity, &#x0201c;Get up &#x00026; Grow&#x0201d; materials, Sun Smart Shade manual, benefits of outdoor play resources from the Raising Children network, relevant National Quality Standard professional learning newsletters. A standardised recording template were used to record the delivery of a site visit, telephone contacts and resources (if any) supplied to the service to support implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control</title><p id="Par26">Services allocated to the control group were asked to continue to schedule their usual single period of outdoor free-play in the core hours of 9&#x000a0;am to 3&#x000a0;pm. Control services agreed not to make any changes to the total duration of this single continuous period throughout the duration of the study. No other support was offered to control services during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data collection procedures and measures</title><p id="Par27">Baseline data collection was conducted between May and July 2016 (autumn/fall&#x02013;winter season) and follow-up data collected 3 months later (August&#x02013;November 2016; winter&#x02013;spring season).

EPAO assessment conducted over 5&#x000a0;days have been shown to provide more reliable estimates of usual childcare environments than those conducted over a single day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The following types of physical activity observation elements were assessed as part of the EPAO: active play opportunities, sedentary opportunities, sedentary environment, portable play environment, fixed play environment, staff behaviours (e.g. prompts and positive statements), physical activity training, education, and existence of a written physical activity policy. These items are used to calculate a sub-score and an overall score. Other data collected included the number of children in attendance, number of room staff working on the days of data collection, outdoor play area size (m <sup>2</sup>), and minimum and maximum daily temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and UV index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Child physical activity</title><p id="Par33">Accelerometers (Actigraph GT3X+) were used to collect information on child physical activity. The accelerometers were worn by children from the time they first arrived at the childcare service until 3&#x000a0;pm on each day of attendance. Accelerometer data were collected on every day of 1 week (5 days in total) of the data collection period at baseline and follow-up. Two data collectors (not blinded to experimental group allocation) attended the services during the data collection period to fit and collect the accelerometers using a standard protocol. Accelerometers were placed above the left iliac crest at the hip of the child using a clip or band. Children with at least 50% of wear time during childcare hours on 1 day/week were considered to have valid wear time. All participating children wore an &#x02018;in care&#x02019; accelerometer each day (up to 5 days) that they attended care. Data from children consenting to also wear an additional accelerometer &#x02018;out of care&#x02019;, was used for descriptive purposes to assess any potential compensatory effect in children&#x02019;s physical activity during out of care periods on days children attend care.. These children had their &#x02018;in care&#x02019; device removed at 3&#x000a0;pm on each day of attendance or earlier if they left the service for the day, but kept on wearing the &#x02018;out of care&#x02019; device. Data collectors also recorded if children removed accelerometers during naps or other times when the belt was removed. On the first day of wearing for home, parents were reminded of their agreement to keep a daily log of their child&#x02019;s activities, when they did not wear the device, and periods of sleep.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par34">The primary trial outcome was the mean daily minutes that children spent in MVPA from the time of arrival at the service until 3&#x000a0;pm, over the course of 1 week (5 days) and for every day of care attendance (ranging from 1 to 5 days). Minutes of MVPA were assessed using recommended cut points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Twenty minutes of consecutive, 0 min were classified as non-wear and eligible data for in-care periods was based on a least 50% of wear time during the school day. Invalid wear days were removed from the analysed dataset. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), to take into account the clustering of individual children within services, were used for primary and secondary physical activity outcomes. An intention to treat framework was used to test a mean difference between groups after 3 months, while adjusting for baseline assessment of outcomes.

The intervention was effective in increasing daily MVPA in children attending care by approximately 5 min. Further to this, enhanced physical activity during the childcare hours did not reduce physical activity levels in periods out of care, nor result in adverse effects such as injuries. Modifying the scheduling of outdoor free-play periods in childcare services may therefore, provide an effective strategy to contribute to population level improvements at child physical activity.</p><p id="Par57">The findings from this study are consistent with another trial that has modified the scheduling of outdoor free-playtime to enhance child activity. The intervention trialled by Tucker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] combined staff training, provision of portable play equipment and four opportunities for outdoor free-play (four 30&#x000a0;min blocks) and found that the intervention increased children&#x02019;s MVPA by 1.28&#x000a0;min per hour compared to control services. In addition, a pilot study conducted in Belgian preschools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] found that by scheduling extra recesses to reduce playground density by dividing children playing at the same time, small increases in MVPA were observed. The findings from the current study are also consistent with ecological interventions in other settings, which have aimed to modify the scheduling of free-play. For example, ecological interventions conducted in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] have also reported increases in child physical activity and observational studies have reported an association between periods of outdoor free-play and child activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Collectively such findings provide an increasing evidence base for supporting the implementation of scheduling based interventions in childcare services.</p><p id="Par58">Subgroup analysis did not support a moderator of the intervention effect for age, sex, or physical activity at baseline. These findings are in contrast to other effective physical activity interventions in this setting that have reported differences in intervention effects in subgroup analysis including sex and age. Such subgroup effects have been previously observed in trials that have targeted a range of organisational, social, and environmental determinants of child activity in care. The findings suggest that, unlike such complex interventions, simple interventions targeting environmental stimuli that align with natural physical activity patterns of children may produce more equitable intervention effects for females and children of varying ages.</p><p id="Par59">The recently released 24-h physical activity guidelines recommend that children accumulate 180&#x000a0;min of active play of which 60&#x000a0;min are energetic in nature. The mean daily total physical activity among children in our sample are well below the current 180 mins recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and increased, relative to control by approximately 5 min in the intervention group. The findings suggests that while the intervention may make an important contribution to achieving the new guidelines, additional intervention is likely required. The addition of other ecological interventions, such as reducing playground density in childcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] where crowding is an issue, or the introduction of portable play equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] may provide additional enhancement to the effects of intervention. Reviews have also identified a range of other policies and practices that childcare services could undertake to enhance child physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, intervention in this setting alone will not be sufficient to achieve the movement guidelines. Investment in interventions across community settings and in the home is therefore warranted.</p><p id="Par60">Collectively the findings of this study, and previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] support the implementation of interventions to increase the frequency of opportunities for outdoor free-play. However further research is required to identify what specific types of support services may be required to assist them to do so in the long term. In the current study, anecdotally, four of the five intervention services, continued to deliver the intervention following trial completion. By contrast, in the trial by Tucker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], services reported difficulties in implementing four periods of outdoor free-play as part of their curriculum and at a longer follow up, implementation had ceased. A greater understanding of the barriers to implementation of such interventions reported by representative samples of childcare services are required to better assess the potential for setting wide uptake of the intervention. During this study, educator concerns include disruption of routines for children with behavioural challenges, additional time taken for the application of sunscreen and hats, and having to adjust the childcare curriculum. Consideration of such barriers are required if large-scale dissemination and uptake of the intervention is to be achieved.</p><p id="Par61">Strengths of this study include the use of a randomized trial design, and objective measurement of child physical activity over five consecutive days. The addition of reporting child injury also complements the assessment of physical activity to allay carer safety concerns that comes with outdoor risky play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, participating families in the study were from higher educated and higher incomes brackets than the general population, which could limit the representativeness of the study. Furthermore, the study used a convenience sample, a group that may be pre-disposed to implementation of the intervention. Data collectors were not blind to group allocation, and while research assistants were instructed to limit any interactions with children or staff during data collection, the presence of research assistants may have influenced typical physical activity practices or staff child interactions in both intervention and control services. The use of other data collection methods that are less intrusive, such as light sensors or global positioning systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], may reduce the potential for any researcher reactivity in future trials. Lastly, data were collected over a change of seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which may have affected the number of days available for outdoor free-play. Future studies may look into conducting their data collection over a period of 2 years to remove the effect of season change on the availability of outdoor free-play time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par62">Low levels of physical activity amongst preschool-aged children continue to be of concern. The study found that modest but meaningful improvements in child activity in this setting can be achieved with simple changes to scheduling of outdoor play periods. Future research identifying optimal methods to support implementation of the intervention is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec31"><p>
