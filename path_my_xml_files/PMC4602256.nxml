The visualisation of the mucosa must always be the most important factor especially concerning the evaluation of potential malignant changes. Non-acceptance of suboptimal bowel preparation is also required in order to ensure universally high standards in screening procedures. The cleansing should be easy for the patient to administrate and take effect soon after administration.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>Several preparations for bowel cleansing for flexible sigmoidoscopy are available today, and the method of bowel cleansing varies between countries and individual clinics.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The optimal and most cost-effective bowel-cleansing regimen is not known.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Only a few studies have compared the different bowel-cleansing methods for flexible sigmoidoscopy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Common methods of bowel cleansing include enemas, sulfate-free polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, bisacodyl, senna, cascara, castor oil, magnesium citrate and oral sodium phosphate.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> According to the guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, one or two enemas are recommended as the bowel preparation of choice for flexible sigmoidoscopy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Recently, suppositories containing free fatty acids derived from cod liver oil, as the active ingredient, were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In this trial, these suppositories were found to have a clear laxative effect compared with placebo, where 90% in the study group defecated compared with 33% in the control group.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This study also showed that the suppositories were safe to use with no significant difference in side effect between the two groups.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these recently developed suppositories as a bowel-cleansing agent prior to flexible sigmoidoscopy and compare them with Klyx (docusate sodium/sorbitol), which is the standard preparation used for cleansing prior to flexible sigmoidoscopy in our institutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a controlled, non-inferiority, single-blind randomised prospective clinical trial on outpatients undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy in three study centres. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (EudraCT nr.: 2010-018761-35). This study was approved by the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland, the Icelandic Medicines Agency and the Data Protection Authority.</p><p>All patients referred to our institutions for flexible sigmoidoscopy during the period of November 2010 to November 2011 were invited to participate in the study. After a screening visit, all eligible candidates, after signing an informed consent, were enrolled in the study and randomised to either the study group or the control group by block randomisation. The inclusion criteria included patients with previous history of rectal bleeding, follow-up examination after rectosigmoid surgery or for polyps. Patients under the age of 18, pregnant women and patients with diarrhoea or active bleeding from rectum at the time of the examination as well as all patients receiving any laxative treatment were excluded. A total of 53 patients participated in the study. The number of subjects included and their demographics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="FLGASTRO2014100497TB1">table 1</xref>. One of the participants in the Klyx group did not answer the patient's questionnaire. The most common indication for the flexible sigmoidoscopy was bleeding per rectum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="FLGASTRO2014100497TB1">table 1</xref>). Patients were randomised to receive either the study suppositories or a standard treatment with self-administered Klyx enema (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Switzerland). In the study group, the participants self-administered two suppositories, the evening before, as well as the following morning, prior to the flexible sigmoidoscopy. In the control group, Klyx enema (120&#x02005;mL) was, in a similar manner, self-administered the evening before the procedure, as well as the following morning, prior to the procedure. Before undertaking the sigmoidoscopy, participants filled out a questionnaire about the possible side effects of the cleansing, that is, if there was any irritation or bleeding, if and when they felt the urge for defecation, if and when they defecated, as well as if the smell of the preparations (suppositories and Klyx) during the treatment was bothering. The investigating physicians were masked for which bowel cleansing the participant received and, because of a potential revealing smell from the suppositories, they wore a surgical mask containing perfume during the sigmoidoscopy. The physicians filled out a questionnaire about the amount of faeces noted in the rectum and sigmoid colon, any bleeding or mucus, total view, how satisfied the investigating physicians were with the bowel preparation, the depth of scope insertion, as well as whether they felt that the endoscopy should be repeated. The endoscopists were all experienced and certified specialists in gastroenterology and endoscopy.</p><table-wrap id="FLGASTRO2014100497TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Demographics and indications for the examinations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Suppositories</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Klyx</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Demographics</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Average age (range)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">42 (22&#x02013;83)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 (23&#x02013;83)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Gender (men/women)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15/13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/17</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Reason for endoscopy</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Rectal bleeding</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Control cancer</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Control operation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Pruritus ani</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Polyp</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Haemorrhoids</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2a"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were performed with the statistical software R, V.2.15.3.

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although enemas seem to be the preferred by most physicians,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> there are several options in bowel preparation for patients undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy, both regarding type of medication and administration route and the timing of the administration. Oral preparations have, in some studies, shown to be superior to enemas,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> whereas other studies have found enemas to be superior to oral preparations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, other researchers have not found any differences between enemas and oral preparations.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Few studies have compared suppositories with other form of cleansing, thus making it somewhat difficult to compare our results with the results of previous studies. Underwood <italic>et al</italic> conducted a study on 203 patients undertaking flexible sigmoidoscopy who were randomised to receive one Fleet ready-to-use enema (sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, disodium phosphate dodecahydrate) or 2&#x000d7;4&#x02005;g glycerin suppositories 2&#x02005;h prior to the procedure. They found that the average depth of endoscope insertion in the enema group was significantly deeper compared with the group receiving suppositories. Moreover, the physicians grated the quality of preparation as excellent in 67% among the patients in the enema group as compared with only 17% in the glycerin group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These results are in line with our findings, although the difference between the suppositories and enema was less evident in our study.</p><p>The quality of bowel preparation scale (excellent, good, adequate or poor) derived from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> or the assessment used in the United Kingdom flexible sigmoidoscopy trial (UKFSST) study<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> do not distinguish between the amount of faeces in the rectum and in the sigmoid. It is important to note this difference as cleansing for flexible sigmoidoscopy should provide the same view in the sigmoid colon as in the rectum. In this study, the amount of faeces noted in the sigmoid colon was significantly higher in the study group, but the amount of faeces in the rectum was small and similar in both groups.</p><p>Although the bowel preparation for the flexible sigmoidoscopy was better with Klyx, it is possible that the suppositories are more appropriate as preparation for proctoscopies. This as well as the effect of dose escalation remains to be studied.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The suppositories were well tolerated with no significant side effects. The suppositories are as good as Klyx in regards to providing view of the rectum. The optimal use of these suppositories could be for patients undergoing proctoscopy and to initiate rectal evacuation when needed. The laxative effect of the suppositories is confirmed, as is their safety.
