An intravenous or intramuscular injection of analgesics will be provided as the initial standard pain control intervention for all patients. Patients who still have moderate to severe pain after the 30&#x02005;min of initial standard ED management will be considered eligible. These patients will be allocated in equal proportions to acupuncture plus standard ED management or to standard ED management alone based on computer-generated random numbers concealed in opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes. A 30&#x02005;min session of acupuncture treatment with manual and/or electrical stimulation will be provided by qualified Korean medicine doctors. All patients will receive additional ED management at the ED physician's discretion and based on each patient's response to the allocated intervention. The primary outcome will be pain reduction measured at discharge from the ED by an unblinded assessor. Adverse events in both groups will be documented. Other outcomes will include the patient-reported overall improvement, disability due to neck pain (only for neck-pain patients), the treatment response rate, the use of other healthcare resources and the patients&#x02019; perceived effectiveness of the acupuncture treatment.

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Previous studies have shown that insufficient pain relief at ED discharge was not uncommon. For instance, according to a multicentre study regarding the quality of pain management in ED settings, 27% of patients had pain at discharge.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Another audit of pain management in the ED also revealed that approximately two-thirds of patients with pain in the ED could not obtain pain relief when measured at discharge.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> An integrated patient care approach to improve patient satisfaction and the efficient use of healthcare resources by non-emergent patients in the ED have been explored,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which implies the potential role of acupuncture in such contexts. In a systematic review, we found that current evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations concerning the use of acupuncture in the ED due to the high risk of bias and the scarcity of primary studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A multicentre study in Australia to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for acute pain management in patients with low back pain, ankle sprain or migraine in the ED setting is ongoing,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the feasibility of acupuncture treatments in the ED has been suggested in a recent observational study.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> These results need to be confirmed by replicate studies in different contexts. In South Korea, acupuncture is regularly practised to treat various conditions due to the pluralistic medical system incorporating Western medicine and Korean medicine.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Nevertheless, no study has assessed the role of acupuncture in treating non-emergent acute musculoskeletal conditions in the ED setting.</p><p>We aim to conduct this pilot study to assess the feasibility of acupuncture research that evaluates the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as an add-on intervention for patients with non-emergent acute musculoskeletal pain or primary headache in the context of the ED.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>A computer-generated block random sequence will be tabulated by an independent statistician.

Complete physical, neurological and/or radiological examinations related to the patients&#x02019; conditions will be performed by an ED physician to exclude any case that is inappropriate for study inclusion. Analgesics will be administered to a patient according to the standard ED pain management protocol. After 30&#x02005;min of observation, a patient who still reports a moderate to severe pain level defined as a numerical rating scale (NRS) of at least four points will be regarded as a potential participant for the trial. The ED physician will provide initial verbal information about the recruitment to a potentially eligible patient at the patient's bedside in the ED. If the patient shows a willingness to participate in the trial, a study KMD will be called and will arrive within 10&#x000b1;5&#x02005;min in the ED. At the bedside, the study KMD will explain the objective and process of the trial and obtain a written informed consent from the patient.

Blinding of the participants to the study hypothesis (ie, acupuncture plus standard ED management is potentially more effective than standard ED management alone) will be attempted by avoiding descriptions of the direction and magnitude of the effectiveness of the allocated treatments on the information sheet included in the informed consent form. However, we cannot guarantee that such blinding will be helpful in reducing performance bias among the South Korean participants, who are likely to already have cultural familiarity with acupuncture. Owing to the lack of independent outcome assessors for primary outcome measurement due to limited research resources, blinding of the outcome assessors to the primary outcomes will not be possible. However, the outcome assessors who will measure the outcomes will not be involved in the treatment allocation process to reduce any potential performance bias among the patients and outcome assessors.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Regarding the 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h telephone follow-up assessments, an independent outcome assessor who will be blinded to the groups will conduct the outcome measurements.

If the patient presents with a new onset of severe headache or continues to experience severe headache, brain CT will be performed to exclude the possibility of stroke or other serious neurological conditions such as brain tumour or other pathological brain lesions before the administration of the NSAID injection.

Patients with pain that is equal to or more than four points on the Wong-Baker scale after group allocation and after receiving the allocated treatments (ie, acupuncture in the acupuncture group and observation in the standard ED management group) will be considered as a possible case for rescue medication administration. The final decision of administering rescue medicine will be at the discretion of the ED physician.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>The rationale of the comparison and the lack of a placebo/sham intervention group</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to explore whether acupuncture treatment combined with standard ED management can provide benefits to patients with non-emergent acute musculoskeletal pain and primary headache who do not respond to the standard pain management in an ED setting. Currently, sham or placebo acupuncture is used to assess the net efficacy of the hypothesised specific component of the acupuncture treatment while reducing any possible influence from clinical contexts and other treatment-related processes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> With the pragmatic purpose of this study, we decided not to employ a placebo/sham acupuncture as a control group intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The pain intensity NRS score (ranging from 0, referring to no pain at all, to 10, indicating intolerable and extreme pain) will be measured to assess pain reduction measured at ED discharge in all three conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Subjective pain</title><p>The pain intensity NRS score at 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h after ED discharge will be assessed via a phone call as one of the secondary outcomes. The treatment responders will be defined as patients who have experienced at least a 50% reduction in pain intensity from baseline values; these values will be calculated using the pain intensity NRS scores. Differences in the proportion of participants who are classified as treated responders at ED discharge and 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h after ED discharge will be compared between treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Pain-related disability (for neck pain)</title><p>The participant-perceived reduction in disability due to neck pain will be measured using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) in patients with acute non-specific neck pain. The NDI is a validated 10-item scale for patients with neck pain and disability.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Each item is scored between 0 and 5 points, with higher scores indicating worse clinical outcomes, and the summation of the 10-item scores is transformed into percentage scores (ranging from 0 to 100). A validated Korean version of the NDI<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> will be used at 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h after discharge via a phone call.</p></sec><sec id="s3b3"><title>Patient-reported overall improvement</title><p>Patient global assessment is a widely used scale for measuring subjective pain. Patient global assessments of overall treatment outcomes will be measured by a single item consisting of a five-point Likert-scale question (much improved, somewhat improved, the same as baseline, somewhat worsened or much worsened) to assess the immediate and short-term treatment outcomes in all three conditions. The answers &#x02018;much improved&#x02019; and &#x02018;somewhat improved&#x02019; will be dichotomised as &#x02018;improved&#x02019;, and the rest of the answers will be categorised as &#x02018;not improved&#x02019; for the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b4"><title>Use of healthcare resources</title><p>The use of additional rescue medication to relieve pain during the ED stay and the length of stay in the ED (from group allocation to ED discharge) will be measured based on electronic medical charts. The use of additional medication or healthcare resources (such as hospital admissions and outpatient clinic visits) will be measured based on the patients&#x02019; self-reports via telephone interviews 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h after ED discharge via a phone call.</p></sec><sec id="s3b5"><title>Adverse events</title><p>All expected and unexpected adverse events in both groups will be measured during the allocated intervention process and during the entire study period. The types and frequencies of adverse events will be measured. The adverse events of acupuncture may include bleeding, needling pain, and other discomforts and complications that have been deemed to be related to acupuncture treatments by patients, the study KMDs and the ED staff. Open-ended questions and a checklist of possible adverse events, which were compiled based on literature reviews and our own clinical observations and which have been routinely used in the outpatient acupuncture clinics at our hospital, will be used for the collection of information. The items of a checklist include the following: symptoms aggravated; pain at the needled sites; feel exhausted; dizziness; nausea; bruising (more than 20&#x02005;mm in diameter); itching; local redness; feeling or generalised hot sensation all over the body and generalised discomfort (other than hot sensation). In addition, whether any procedure-related event (such as needles forgotten on the patient's body and broken needles) occurs in the busy context of the ED will be closely monitored by the study investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s3b6"><title>Patients&#x02019; perceived effectiveness of acupuncture treatment</title><p>Patients&#x02019; perceived effectiveness of acupuncture will be measured via telephone follow-up 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h after ED discharge. Perceived effectiveness will be defined as the patients&#x02019; response to the question &#x02018;How much do you agree that the acupuncture treatment that you have received was helpful for your condition?&#x02019; (very helpful, somewhat helpful, do not know, somewhat unhelpful or very unhelpful). The answers &#x02018;very helpful&#x02019; and &#x02018;somewhat helpful&#x02019; will be dichotomised as &#x02018;effective&#x02019;, and the rest of the answers will be categorised as &#x02018;not effective&#x02019; for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Data management</title><p>Research assistants will complete the Case Report Forms (CRFs) with the information required by the protocol. An independent research assistant who remains blinded to the group allocation will enter the data into the Excel spreadsheet after the completion of the trial. Another independent research assistant will enter the data separately. An independent researcher will compare the two data sets to check whether they are entered correctly. When different data entry is identified, data entry will be compared with the original CRF to resolve the inconsistency. All changes to the entered data set will be recorded on the data entry log. Access to the data set file during data entry will be allowed only for specific research assistants and members of a data monitoring committee (DMC). The DMC will consist of two independent researchers (one in research methodology and the other a clinical expert on Korean medicine) who will not be involved in the trial and will regularly monitor patient safety, investigate adverse events and perform quality control assessments of the data. Errors or omissions in the CRFs will be addressed on the data query forms that will be used to request resolution from the researchers. If there is any serious concern with regard to the patient safety, the DMC will terminate the trial. The investigators will convene to discuss practical issues such as protocol revision and any clinical events that may need discussion. There is no plan for regular interim or prespecified interim analysis because we expect this small pilot trial to be of short duration and anticipate a minimal risk of harm to be associated with acupuncture and standard ED management. However, interim analysis will be performed at the request of the committee regarding safety or other important issues raised by the DMC.</p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>This is a pilot trial whose exploratory nature does not necessarily require a formal sample size calculation. Thus, the sample size was determined as the minimum number required to achieve the pragmatic purpose of the trial (ie, the collection of information such as aggregate values of the outcome results and their variation, safety data and feasibility-related information necessary for designing a future, full-scale clinical trial).</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Statistical data analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses of the obtained data will be conducted for two populations: (1) an intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomised participants with a primary outcome assessment at baseline, and (2) a per-protocol population, defined as participants who will complete the final post-treatment primary outcome assessment without major protocol deviations (eg, changing the allocation group). The primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis, whereas a per-protocol assessment will be conducted as a sensitivity analysis. For continuous outcomes, the data will be presented as the mean and SD (or the median and IQR) according to the normality of the distribution. For dichotomous outcomes, the data will be presented as the frequency. An independent experienced biostatistician who will be blinded to the allocation of the groups will perform the data analysis using the SAS 9.3 software package (SAS Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA), and the two-sided p&#x0003c;0.05 will be regarded as the level of significance with 90% power. Analysis of covariance will be performed using the mean reductions in the pain NRS and the NDI scores (only for patients with neck pain) at ED discharge as the dependent variable, the baseline pain NRS and the baseline NDI scores (only for patients with neck pain) as the covariate and the allocated group as the fixed factor. To investigate the trend of changes in pain and neck function scores within each group, repeated-measure analysis of variance using the pain NRS and the NDI scores as the repeated measures will be performed.</p><p>Categorical outcome variables (ie, the perceived effectiveness of acupuncture treatments, patients&#x02019; expectations of acupuncture treatments and patient global assessment) will be dichotomised according to the predefined criteria and analysed along with other dichotomous variables. These dichotomous variables will be analysed using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test. Within-group differences from baseline to ED discharge and 72&#x000b1;12&#x02005;h follow-up will be analysed by a paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3d1"><title>Written informed consent and study approval</title><p>Written informed consent will be obtained from each study participant.
