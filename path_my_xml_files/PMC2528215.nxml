COPD is treatable, and pharmacological treatment is effective in controlling symptoms and health status. In particular, the use of bronchodilators plays a central role in the pharmacological treatment of symptomatic COPD patients. Bronchodilators improve airway obstruction, symptom control, health status, and health-related quality of life (QOL), and they reduce the frequency of exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Donohue 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gold 2006</xref>).</p><p>Tiotropium bromide is a long-acting anticholinergic that provides sustained bronchodilation through prolonged M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptor blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Disse et al 1999</xref>). Previous studies have shown that inhaled tiotropium improves pulmonary function, dyspnea, and QOL in COPD to a significantly greater extent than placebo or the short-acting anticholinergic ipratropium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Casaburi et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vincken et al 2002</xref>). Tiotropium also reduces COPD exacerbations and may reduce related utilization of health-care facilities in patients with moderate to severe COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Niewoehner et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Dusser et al 2006</xref>). Furthermore, one recent study based on a retrospective 1-year analysis has raised the possibility that tiotropium is associated with a reduced rate of loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Anzueto et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Oral slow-released theophylline is used widely as a bronchodilator worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Turner-Warwick 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jackson et al 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mitenko and Ogilvie 1973</xref>). Previous studies have reported that long-term theophylline use for COPD results in improvement of pulmonary functions, including vital capacity (VC), FEV<sub>1</sub>, minute ventilation, and gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Murciano et al 1989</xref>). Theophylline also has a beneficial effect on exercise endurance in COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Guyatt et al 1987</xref>). Recent studies have shown that theophylline reduces the numbers of neutrophils and concentrations of interleukin-8 in the airways of COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Culpitt et al 2002</xref>). Low-dose theophylline can also prevent oxidative stress, and it restores corticosteroid responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ito et al 2002</xref>). These results suggest that theophylline has anti-inflammatory effects in COPD, as it does in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Sullivan et al 1994</xref>).</p><p>The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines recommend combination therapy with different potential bronchodilators for the pharmacological treatment of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gold 2006</xref>). Theophylline has an additional effect in the clinical improvement of COPD when it is used in combination with a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zuwallack et al 2001</xref>). However, few investigations have reported the efficacy of combination therapy with inhalation of the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium and oral administration of slow-release theophylline in COPD patients. In Japan, theophylline is prescribed for most COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Ichinose et al 2006</xref>). Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy and safety of add-on treatment with tiotropium in COPD patients treated with theophylline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>The study was performed at Kurume University Hospital and at each medical institute of the Kurume COPD Study Group. The protocol was designed in accordance with good clinical practice and the latest revisions to the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the institutional ethics committees of Kurume University and each medical institute.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>COPD patients &#x02265;40 years old and with a cigarette smoking history of &#x02265;10 pack-years and respiratory symptoms related to COPD were enrolled in the study. All patients were diagnosed on the basis of clinical history, physical examination, chest X-ray, chest computed tomography, and pulmonary function tests, in accordance with the clinical criteria for the diagnosis and severity of COPD by the GOLD guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gold 2006</xref>). Patients with a history of asthma, atopy, absolute peripheral eosinophil count &#x0003e;600 mm<sup>3</sup>, and/or reversibility of FEV<sub>1</sub> by &#x0003e;200 mL and &#x0003e;12% after inhalation of 200 &#x003bc;g salbutamol were carefully excluded. Patients who had a history of renal failure, moderate to severe prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction, narrow-angle glaucoma, heart failure, arrhythmia, bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, old mycobacterial infections, interstitial pneumonia, mental disorders, lung surgery, or any malignancies were also excluded. Five patients (16.6%) in the theophylline alone group and two patients (6.5%) in the combination group were being treated with inhaled corticosteroids at the screening visit. There was no significant difference of number between the two groups (p = 0.2554). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was performed over a 12-week period. We used an open-labeled, parallel-group, randomized design to compare the efficacy and safety of the addition of 18 &#x003bc;g inhaled tiotropium once daily to theophylline in stable COPD patients. The primary end-point for this study was the change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline to the end of 8 weeks after treatment, and the secondary end-points were the British MRC (Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale and forced vital capacity (FVC).</p><p>At the first visit, each patient underwent recording of medical, occupational, and smoking history; physical examination; chest radiography, including high-resolution computed tomography; electrocardiogram; blood testing; and spirometry as screening tests to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria. The spirometry was performed before and after inhalation of a bronchodilator at the first visit. Dyspnea was scored using the British MRC dyspnea scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Moor-Jankowski 1976</xref>). Patients who met all the criteria were enrolled and given 200 mg theophylline twice daily for 4 weeks (a run-in period). The patients had been receiving different doses of theophylline, or none, before the run-in period. In those patients who had been receiving higher doses, the dose was reduced to 200 mg twice daily, as reported in previous studies, to prevent high serum concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kelly 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Barnes 1997</xref>). None of the patients was treated with anti-histamines, anti-leukotrienes, cromolyn, &#x003b2;-blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral prednisolone, and/or LABAs during the study. Some of the patients had discontinued these medications at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had experienced an exacerbation within 4 weeks before enrollment. The use of a short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist or short-acting anticholinergic on demand was permitted.</p><p>Following a 4-week run-in period (the end of which was defined as the baseline), patients were randomized to two groups. In one group, 18 &#x003bc;g of tiotropium was added on once daily from 6:00 to 8:00 am (combination group), and the other continued with the theophylline alone (theophylline alone group) for 8 weeks (the end of the treatment period). Patients who developed emesis or anorexia associated with the theophylline were withdrawn from the study. Smoking status and participation in rehabilitation programs were not altered during the trial.</p><p>Physical examinations, spirometry, and blood testing, including the monitoring of plasma concentrations of theophylline and MRC scoring, were performed at screening and baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Spirometry was performed at least three times between 11:00 am and noon, and the best dataset was accepted. On the basis of the results of a previous study, these values were regarded as the near-peak changes after tiotropium inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Disse et al 1999</xref>).

Two-way ANOVA was used for comparison of the time course data of each group at the baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. MRC scoring of the time course data of each group was performed by non-parametric two-way ANOVA corrected by post-testing. The relationship between the changes in each spirometric parameter and MRC score was tested by Spearman&#x02019;s non-parametric correlation test. Data on the plasma concentration of theophylline were expressed as means &#x000b1; SD and compared between the two groups by an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.

There was no significance difference in demographic characteristics between the two groups at the end of the run-in period. Seventy-seven COPD patients were matched to the entry criteria and enrolled in the study; they received theophylline (200 mg twice daily) for 4-weeks as a run-in period. During the run-in period, 13 patients were withdrawn from the study: 7 patients had adverse events associated with the theophylline (anorexia, 4; emesis, 1; ischuria, 1; and stomatitis, 1); 4 patients refused for personal reasons to continue; 1 patient had accompanying asthma, and one had an exacerbation of COPD. During the 8-week treatment period, two and one patient dropped out from the combination and theophylline alone groups, respectively. Finally, data on 61 COPD patients (31 combination; 30 theophylline alone) were used in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We demonstrated that add-on therapy with tiotropium significantly improved the MRC dyspnea score and pulmonary function in COPD patients already being treated with theophylline. According to the GOLD guidelines, combination therapy with different kinds of bronchodilators is recommended for COPD patients, because it can improve efficacy without increasing the risk of side effects, as compared with increasing the dose of monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gold 2006</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have reported that treatment with relatively low dose of theophylline has anti-inflammatory effects in COPD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Culpitt et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kobayashi et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hirano et al 2006</xref>). These patients were treated with theophylline at 400 mg/day, and/or plasma levels of theophylline were approximately 5 to 10 mg/L. These concentrations of theophylline had anti-inflammatory effects. However, these studies did not determine whether theophylline had clinical benefits on pulmonary function or physical condition in COPD patients. The Japanese Respiratory Society&#x02019;s guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COPD suggested that low dose of theophylline may be effective for COPD patients, as high doses of theophylline have toxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD 2006</xref>). On the basis of these studies, we treated COPD patients with 400 mg theophylline (200 mg twice daily). Plasma levels of theophylline were approximately 8 to 10 mg/L in these patients, and theophylline alone did not improve pulmonary function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or MRC scores in 30 COPD patients analyzed. Moreover, in 17 patients who were not receiving theophylline at screening, treatment with theophylline alone did not improve MRC score or FEV<sub>1</sub>. The possibility remains that this concentration of theophylline in the plasma may not exert sufficient bronchodilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mitenko and Ogilvie 1973</xref>). Here we evaluated whether the combination of theophylline and tiotropium could improve FEV<sub>1</sub> and MRC scores in COPD patients, and we compared our results with those of previous studies in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hirata et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ichinose et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>A study that compared the effects of the short-acting anticholinergic ipratropium and theophylline reported that improvement of pulmonary function and exercise endurance was significantly greater in the combination therapy group than in each monotherapy group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tsukino et al 1998</xref>). In addition, a combination of the short-acting anti-cholinergic oxitropium and theophylline improved QOL to a significantly greater extent than did each monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bellia et al 2002</xref>). Furthermore, combination treatment with a short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, a short-acting anticholinergic agent, and oral theophylline led to significantly greater improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with the results of monotherapy, without any severe adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Karpel et al 1994</xref>).</p><p>Long-acting bronchodilators have recently become standard medicines in the pharmacological treatment of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gold 2006</xref>). Therefore, the establishment of combination therapy for COPD with long-acting bronchodilators is an expected trend. Combination of the LABA salmeterol with theophylline leads to significantly better pulmonary functions, greater improvement in symptoms, improved reduction in the use of short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, and decrease in exacerbation frequency compared with the use of theophylline alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zuwallack et al 2001</xref>). In both stable COPD patients and those with exacerbations, combination therapy with the inhaled LABA formoterol and the inhaled long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium improves pulmonary function indicators such as FEV<sub>1</sub>, IC, and FVC to a significantly greater extent than is seen with each agent alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Di Marco et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Van Noord et al 2006</xref>). A previous study also showed additional clinical improvement when COPD patients were treated with theophylline added to salmeterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zuwallack et al 2001</xref>). However, evidence of the effects of combination therapy with long-acting bronchodilators, especially anticholinergics and theophylline, is still scant.</p><p>One recent study reported the effect of combination therapy with tiotropium and theophylline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cazzola and Gabriella Matera 2007</xref>). They investigated the additive effect of theophylline in patients with stable COPD who were receiving both tiotropium and formoterol. Although their findings question the importance of adding theophylline in stable COPD patients already being treated with two long-acting bronchodilators, they also indicate that some patients may benefit from theophylline because of symptomatic improvement. We chose to investigate the effects of adding tiotropium in patients already treated with theophylline because theophylline is widely used for COPD treatment, both in Japan and worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Ichinose et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>Dyspnea upon exercise is one of the most important symptoms in patients with COPD. We used the MRC dyspnea score to assess symptoms: the MRC questionnaire can easily classify symptom severity. We demonstrated that the mean MRC dyspnea score in patients with combination therapy improved significantly after both 4 and 8 weeks of tiotropium add-on therapy.</p><p>The beneficial effect of combination therapy might be attributable to the different mechanisms of bronchodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Thirstrup 2000</xref>). Theophylline had been reported to have extrapulmonary effects, such as increased diaphragmatic contractility and reversed diaphragm fatigue, although the validity of these effects remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Aubier et al 1981</xref>). There is also increasing evidence that low-dose theophylline has anti-inflammatory effects in asthma and COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Culpitt et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cosio et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Barnes et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>The effects of treatment with tiotropium alone on pulmonary function, when compared with placebo, include improvements in peak expiratory flow volume, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, VC, and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Casaburi et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vincken et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Brusasco et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Celli et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">O&#x02019;Donnell et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Van Noord et al 2006</xref>). Our findings confirmed these previous observations. In the study of Japanese COPD patients, the increase in peak FEV<sub>1</sub> with tiotropium alone was 0.20 &#x000b1; 0.02 L after 6 months of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hirata et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ichinose et al 2003</xref>). In our patients, addition of tiotropium to theophylline increased the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> by 0.17 &#x000b1; 0.03 L and 0.21 &#x000b1; 0.03 L after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. These increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> were similar to those in other investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hirata et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ichinose et al 2003</xref>). Our present study did not include a group of patients treated with tiotropium alone, so we were unable to assess whether there was any benefit of adding theophylline to patients treated with tiotropium. The above-mentioned recent study in which the add-on effect of theophylline was investigated in patients already being treated with tiotropium and formoterol reported a limited effect of theophylline add-on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cazzola and Gabriella Matera 2007</xref>). Evaluation of all of these results together indicates that tiotropium is a useful addition in COPD patients already treated with theophylline.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We especially thank Dr Gail M Gauvreau of the Asthma Research Group, McMaster University, Canada, for critical reading of this manuscript.
