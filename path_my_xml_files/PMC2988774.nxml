We tested the hypotheses that a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen treatment during fasting decreased renal water and sodium excretion by increased absorption of water and sodium via the aquaporin2 water channels and the epithelial sodium channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The effect of ibuprofen, 600 mg thrice daily, was measured during fasting in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study of 17 healthy humans. The subjects received a standardized diet on day 1, fasted at day 2, and received an IV infusion of 3% NaCl on day 3. The effect variables were urinary excretions of aquaporin2 (u-AQP2), the beta-fraction of the epithelial sodium channel (u-ENaCbeta), cyclic-AMP (u-cAMP), prostaglandin E2 (u-PGE2). Free water clearance (CH2O), fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), and plasma concentrations of vasopressin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, atrial-, and brain natriuretic peptide.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ibuprofen decreased u-AQP2, u-PGE2, and FENa at all parts of the study. During the same time, ibuprofen significantly increased u-ENaCbeta. Ibuprofen did not change the response in p-AVP, u-c-AMP, urinary output, and free water clearance during any of these periods. Atrial-and brain natriuretic peptide were higher.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>During inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, urinary sodium excretion decreased in parallel with an increase in sodium absorption and increase in u-ENaCbeta. U-AQP2 decreased indicating that water transport via AQP2 fell. The vasopressin-c-AMP-axis did not mediate this effect, but it may be a consequence of the changes in the natriuretic peptide system and/or the angiotensin-aldosterone system</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00281762</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis reduces renal water and sodium excretion in the kidneys, especially in patients with renal disease or heart failure. A recent study suggested that increased absorption of sodium took place in the thick ascending limb of Henle during prostaglandin inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the distal part of the nephron might also participate in this process, i. e. by an increase in the absorption of water and sodium via the aquaporine2 water channels (AQP2) and epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), respectively. The effect of prostaglandin inhibition on renal water and sodium excretion is most pronounced during conditions with an increased prostaglandin synthesis. During fasting, urinary concentrating and diluting ability was reduced, and AQP2 expression down regulated, possibly due to an antagonizing effect of increased prostaglandin level on the effect of vasopressin on water transport in the principal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, fasting induced natriuresis in man, and prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>inhibited sodium absorption in the collecting ducts in rats and rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, elevated renal levels of prostaglandin during fasting might mediate natriuresis via ENaC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The degree of water transport via AQP2 is reflected by the level of urinary excretion of aquaporine2 (u-AQP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Correspondingly, the sodium transport via ENaC is supposed to be reflected by level of urinary excretion of the &#x003b2;-fraction of ENaC (u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>). This is the first report with measurement of u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>as a biomarker of the activity of the epithelial sodium channels in the distal tubuli.</p><p>In the present study, we measured the effect of inhibition of prostaglandins on u-AQP2 and u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>during fasting. We wanted to test the hypotheses that a reduction of prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen treatment during fasting would 1. Increase u-AQP2 and u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>during baseline condition and change the renal response to hypertonic saline infusion, and 2. The increased renal water and sodium absorption during ibuprofen treatment was mediated via increased transport via AQP2 and ENaC.</p><p>We performed a randomized, placebo controlled crossover study in healthy humans during baseline condition and during hypertonic saline infusion to examine the effect of ibuprofen on renal handling of water and sodium during fasting. We measured the effect of ibuprofen/placebo on u-AQP2, u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>, fractional urinary excretion of sodium (FE<sub>Na</sub>), urinary excretion of prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(u-PGE<sub>2</sub>), urinary excretion of cyclic AMP (u-c-AMP), free water clearance (C<sub>H2O </sub>), and plasma concentrations of renin (PRC), angiotensin II (p-Ang II), aldosterone (p-Aldo), vasopressin (p-AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (p-ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (p-BNP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p><italic>Inclusion criteria</italic>: Both males and females; age 18-65 years; body mass index &#x0003c;30. <italic>Exclusion criteria: </italic>Clinical signs or history of disease in the heart, lungs, kidneys or endocrine organs; abnormal laboratory tests (blood hemoglobin, white cell count, platelet counts, plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium, creatinine, albumine, bilirubine, alanine-aminotransferase, and cholesterol; blood glucose and albumin and glucose in urine); malignancies; arterial hypertension (i.e. casual blood pressure &#x0003e;140/90 mmHg); alcohol abuse (more than 21 drinks per week for males and more than 14 for females); medical treatment; pregnancy; breast-feeding; lack of oral contraceptive treatment to women in the fertile age; intercurrent diseases; problems with blood sampling or urine collection; allergy to ibuprofen; medicine abuse; donation of blood less than 1 month before the study; and unwillingness to participate. <italic>Withdrawal criteria: </italic>Development of one or more of the exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The Scientific Committee of Ringk&#x000f8;bing, Ribe and Southern Jutland Counties (j.no.2623-04) approved the study.

The increased tubular sodium absorption during ibuprofen treatment might be attributed to increased sodium transport from the tubular lumen via the epithelial sodium channels. Our hypothesis was not falsified regarding this point. However, ibuprofen decreased u-AQP2 and u-PGE<sub>2</sub>, and did not change p-AVP, u-c-AMP, urinary output, and free water clearance during any of the study periods. Thus, our results demonstrated that u-AQP2 was reduced, although an increased AQP2 trafficking might be expected, when the antagonizing effect of prostaglandins on the vasopressin mediated effect on the principal cells was reduced/eliminated during ibuprofen treatment. Consequently, our hypothesis that reduction of prostaglandin synthesis would increase u-AQP2 was falsified.</p><p>In the present study we have used a new and original method to evaluate sodium reabsorption in the principal cells in the distal tubules using a radioimmunoassay of the &#x003b2;-fraction of the protein in the epithelial sodium channel. The amount of ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>in urine is supposed to reflect the activity of sodium transport via the epithelial sodium channels just as u-AQP2 reflects the functional status of the AQP2 water channels (31). Our analyses showed that the assay has a satisfactory reliability. In addition, we demonstrated a significant correlation between changes in urinary sodium excretion and changes in u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>. Thus, our results are in accordance with u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>being a biomarker of the transport of sodium via ENaC during acute studies, presumably reflecting up- and down regulation &#x003b2;-ENaC expression and sodium transport via ENaC. It is well known that ibuprofen reduces renal sodium excretion. Our study adds new information, since our data might suggest that prostaglandin inhibition possibly reduce renal sodium excretion via an increased transport through ENaC.</p><p>In our study, ibuprofen significantly reduced FE<sub>Na </sub>during all parts of study to a level around 35% lower than placebo. The response in FE<sub>Na </sub>during hypertonic saline infusion was the same during treatment with ibuprofen and placebo, and the difference, i.e. the lower level of FE<sub>Na </sub>during ibuprofen treatment, persisted during the infusion. Several animal studies have shown that PGE<sub>2 </sub>has a direct inhibitory effect on sodium chloride transport in the collecting ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In rats, this is regulated by the EP2 receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We found that u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was significantly increased during ibuprofen treatment. Thus, the decrease in FE<sub>Na </sub>might, at least partly, be explained by an increased transport of sodium from the tubular lumen via ENaC. However, we cannot exclude that the antinatriuretic effect of ibuprofen was also attributed to some extent by an upregulation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the ascending limb of Henle's loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. U-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was increased by ibuprofen without an increase in either p-AVP or u-c-AMP, which indicates that AVP does not seem to play a direct regulatory role in the increased u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>. However, the marked reduction in u-PGE<sub>2 </sub>makes it likely that the reduced prostaglandin level results in the increase sodium transport via ENaC, and this explanation is supported by evidence from animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Ibuprofen did not change the response in the effect variables qualitatively during hypertonic saline infusion, but renal sodium excretion was reduced as hypothesized. After hypertonic saline infusion u-ENaC was reduced significantly at 60 minutes, and at the same time p-ANP tended to increase. An increase in ANP might be responsible for reduction in u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>during this condition, and could be seen as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent sodium and fluid expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Aldosterone is an important regulator of the transport activity via ENaC. Aldosterone stimulates the MR receptor. The result is an increased transcription of genes, which code for proteins involved in sodium transport, i. e. ENaC and Na-K-ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that aldosterone increases the synthesis of the &#x003b1;-fraction of ENaC in the distal tubuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found that u-ENaC&#x003b2; was reduced in the ibuprofen group during and after hypertonic saline infusion. We did not measure a reduction in p-aldosterone. This might be due to the fact that our study was too short to allow the regulatory effect of aldosterone.</p><p>A time delay in aldosterone secretion has previously been demonstrated in another study, in which an acute infusion of hypertonic saline infusion decreased PRA, but plasma aldosterone was unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We think the short observation time after the hypertonic saline infusion might explain the fact that p-aldosterone was unchanged in the present study.</p><p>During placebo treatment, hypertonic saline resulted in a significant increase in u-ENaC&#x003b2;. This increase was associated with an increased FE<sub>Na</sub>. The explanation of this phenomenon is not clear for the time being. A considerably decrease in the renal sodium absorption more proximally in the nephron might be compensated for by an increase in absorption in the distal part of the nephron, but additional studies are required to determine the precise use of u-ENaC&#x003b2; as biomarker for ENaC activity during these conditions. However, a rise in the intracellular sodium concentration was suggested to be a trigger for the feedback inhibition of sodium absorption via ENaC in rats when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, the reduction in u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>during sodium loading could alternatively be attributed to this inhibitory feedback mechanism of increased intracellular sodium on sodium transport via ENaC.</p><p>In a previous study, we showed that fasting decreased u-AQP2 and reduced the stimulating effect of vasopressin on u-AQP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Fasting increased prostaglandin synthesis, and the refractoriness to vasopressin during fasting was proposed to be due to an antagonizing effect of prostaglandins on AQP2 trafficking. Thus, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that an increase in u-AQP2 could be expected by ibuprofen treatment. On the contrary, ibuprofen reduced u-PGE<sub>2 </sub>markedly in the present study during all conditions i.e. in 24 hours urine, in the period shortly after 24 hours of fasting, and during infusion of hypertonic saline, as expected. However, ibuprofen also reduced u-AQP2 during all parts of the study, and thereby falsified our hypothesis that reduction of prostaglandin synthesis would increase u-AQP2.</p><p>A previous study in humans showed that prostacyclin infusion increased u-AQP2 excretion, and this seems to be in agreement with our results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Apparently, a discrepancy exists between animal studies on the one hand and studies in man on the other. In animals, prostaglandin decreased APQ2 trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by infusion of indomethacin increased urinary excretion of AQP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In healthy man prostaglandin and prostaglandin-inhibitors had the opposite effects, as demonstrated in the present study and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]</p><p>We found that ibuprofen significantly reduced u-PGE<sub>2 </sub>due to a reduced renal prostaglandin synthesis. This is in accordance with other studies in healthy man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>increased urinary output and sodium excretion by inhibition of AVP stimulated water absorption, inhibition of sodium absorption and stimulation of basal water absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Different subtypes of prostaglandin receptors mediate this effect from the basolateral part of the tubular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Receptor stimulation by PGE<sub>2 </sub>reduced sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle and in the cortical collecting duct, and reduced AVP-induced water absorption in cortical collecting duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Both p-AVP and u-c-AMP were unchanged by ibuprofen, but simultaneously we measured a clear reduction in u-AQP2. Thus, the vasopressin-c-AMP axis was not involved in the reduction in u-AQP2. It is generally accepted that prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>antagonizes the effect of vasopressin on AQP2 trafficking via the EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor. Activation of this receptor inhibits adenylyl-cyclase, reduces the level of c-AMP, causing increased urinary output. However, the close relationship between c-AMP production and increased AQP2 trafficking was challenged in a recent experimental study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Activation of the EP3 receptor inhibited AQP2 trafficking in inner medullary cells from rats, despite high levels of c-AMP, probably due to an cAMP- and Ca2+-independent Rho activation. Rho promotes the formation F-actin which hinders AQP2 coated vesicles reaching the apical membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Our study in healthy man is in agreement with these findings, in the sense that we found a reduction in u-AQP2 excretion without changes in urinary excretion of c-AMP. This suggests that adenylyl cyclase activity did not contribute to our results regarding u-AQP2 excretion. The changes in p-AVP during hypertonic saline infusion was as expected, and the changes were not significantly different during ibuprofen treatment compared with placebo.</p><p>As expected, we measured a marked reduction in urinary sodium excretion during ibuprofen treatment as reflected in the decrease in FE<sub>Na</sub>, but no significant changes in urinary output and free water clearance. However, some tubular reabsorption of water must take place simultaneously with sodium reabsorption due to the effect of ibuprofen on basal renal water transport. Most likely, this fact explains our findings, i.e. the lack of increase in urinary output and free water clearance despite decreased u-AQP2 during ibuprofen treatment. Both p-AVP and u-c-AMP were unchanged by ibuprofen, but simultaneously we measured a clear reduction in u-AQP2. Thus, the vasopressin-c-AMP axis was not involved in the reduction in u-AQP2. The changes in p-AVP during hypertonic saline infusion was as expected, and the changes were not significantly different during ibuprofen treatment compared with placebo.</p><p>However, other regulatory factors than vasopressin and prostaglandins may influences the expression of AQP2 and u-AQP2 such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the natriuretic peptide system, and the sympathetic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We measured higher levels of p-BNP and a clear tendency to an increase in p-ANP simultaneous with a tendency to a lower level of p-Ang II and p-Aldo during ibuprofen treatment. Most likely, these changes in hormones with both vasoactive- and sodium- and water regulating properties are secondary to the sodium retention induced by ibuprofen. This is supported by the fact that p-albumin fell significantly, and that body weight tended to increase, presumably due to an expansion of the extracellular fluid volume. Animal studies support this explanation. Angiotensin II stimulated/enhanced AQP2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and angiotensin II receptor blockade reduced AQP2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Aldosterone agonism and antagonism increased and decreased AQP2 expression, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We suggest that the tendency to reduced levels of the components in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system contributes to the reduced level of u-AQP2 during ibuprofen treatment in fasting healthy humans.</p><p>The role of ANP in the regulation of intracellular distribution of AQP2 was addressed in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. ANP-infusion had no immediate effect on the intracellular localization of AQP2, but after 90 minutes of ANP-infusion an increased apical targeting of AQP2 was noted. This was regarded as either a direct or compensatory effect to volume depletion to avoid dehydration. A human study with head out water immersion demonstrated increased AQP2 expression accompanied by an increase in p-ANP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These findings do not prove any causal relationship, as several other homeostatic systems as the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are also influenced by the intervention. Thus, the effect of the natriuretic peptide system on AQP2 trafficking and urinary excretion is not fully elucidated. Accordingly, we cannot rule out that the increased levels of the natriuretic peptides after ibuprofen treatment had modulated u-AQP2 in our study.</p><p>Inhibition of the renal prostaglandin synthesis might be dangerous in patients with heart failure, lever disease and renal insufficiency. It can result in sodium and water retention and hypertension. We did not measure any changes in blood pressure and the increase in body weight was marginal. Most like, this can be attributed to the fact that we studied healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, ibuprofen decreased urinary sodium excretion considerably in healthy man during fasting, a state with an increased prostaglandin synthesis. During the reduced prostaglandin synthesis u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was markedly increased. Our results suggest that prostaglandins have an important direct regulatory function on ENaC trafficking. During hypertonic saline infusion, angiotensin II and aldosterone tended to decrease in plasma and the natriuretic peptides increased, which presumably can be seen as compensatory phenomena to prevent extracellular fluid expansion. Surprisingly, ibuprofen also decreased urinary u-AQP2 both during 24 hours of fasting and during hypertonic saline infusion. This effect was not mediated via the vasopressin-c-AMP-axis, but may be mediated by the changes in the natriuretic peptide system and/or the angiotensin-aldosterone system.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have made substantial contribution in designing the study and collection of data.

ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was synthesized and and purchased by Lofstrand Labs Limited - Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.</p><p>The &#x003b2;-ENaC antibody was raised against a synthethic peptide in rabbits and affinity purified as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] Iodination of ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was performed by the chloramine T method using 40 &#x003bc;g of ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>and 37 MBq <sup>125</sup>I. The reaction was stopped by addition of 20% human serum albumin. <sup>125</sup>I-labeled ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>was separated from the iodination mixture by the use of a Sephadex G-25 Fine column. The assay buffer was 40 mM sodium phosphate (pH = 7.4), 0.2% human albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.4% EDTA. A 1.5% solution of gamma globulins from pig (Sigma) and 25% polyethylene glycol 6000 (Merck) also containing 0.625% Tween 20 (Merck) was prepared using the 0.4 M phosphate buffer. Urine samples were kept frozen at - 20&#x000b0;C. After thawing out urine samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1.6 &#x000d7; 100 <italic>g </italic>(3,000 rpm). The supernatant was extracted using Sep-pak C<sub>18</sub>. The eluation fluid was 4 ml of a mixture comprising 90% methanol, 0.5% acetic acid and 9.5% demineralized water. The eluates were freeze-dried and kept at - 20&#x000b0;C until assayed. The mixture of 300 &#x003bc;l of standard or freeze-dried urine eluates redissolved in 300 &#x003bc;l assay buffer and 50 &#x003bc;l of antibody was incubated for 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Thereafter, 50 &#x003bc;l of the tracer were added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Gamma globulin from pigs (100 &#x003bc;l) and 2 ml polyethylene glycol 6000 were added. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant (free fraction) was poured off, and the precipitate (bound fraction) was counted in a gamma counter. The unknown content in urine extracts was read from a standard curve. For 13 consecutive standard curves, the zero standard was 70 &#x000b1; 1.6%, and for increasing amounts of ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>standard the binding inhibition was: 69 &#x000b1; 1.4% (15.6 pg/tube), 66 &#x000b1; 1.5% (31.25 pg/tube), 62 &#x000b1; 1.6% (62.5 pg/tube), 54 &#x000b1; 1.5% (125 pg/tube), 40 &#x000b1; 1.4% (250 pg/tube), 26 &#x000b1; 1.2% (500 pg/tube), 14 &#x000b1; 0.6% (1000 pg/tube), 8.2 &#x000b1; 0.4% (2000 pg/tube), and 5.1 &#x000b1; 0.3% (4000 pg/tube). The ID 50, i.e. the concentration of standard needed for 50% binding inhibition was 322 &#x000b1; 12 pg/tube (n = 13). The nonspecific binding determined by performing the RIA without antibody was 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.3% (n = 13). The inter-assay variation was determined by quality controls from the same urine pool spiked with ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>standard. In consecutive assays the coefficient of variation was: at a mean level of 78 pg/tube 12% (12 assays), at a mean level of 155 pg/tube 10% (12 assays), and at a mean level of 394 pg/tube 17% (10 assays). The intra-assay variation was determined on samples from the same urine pool in several assays at different concentration levels. At a mean level of 180 pg/tube (<italic>n </italic>= 10) and 406 pg/tube (n = 10), the coefficients of variation were 6.4% and 9.0%, respectively. In addition, coefficients of variation were calculated on the basis of duplicate determinations in different assays to 9.1% (n = 22) in the range 58-101 pg/tube, 8.6% (n = 26) in the range 143-203 pg/tube, 8.7% (n = 20) in the range 205-421 pg/tube, and 10.0% (n = 68) in the whole range 58-421 pg/tube. The sensitivity calculated as the smallest detectable difference at the 95% confidence limit was 10 pg/tube in the range 58-101 pg/tube (n = 22), 20 pg/tube in the range 143-203 pg/tube (n = 26), 48 pg/tube in the range 205-421 pg/tube (n = 20), and 28 pg/tube in the whole range 58-421 pg/tube (n = 68). The lower detectable limit of the assay was 34 pg/tube. It was calculated using the average zero binding for 13 consecutive assays minus 2 SD. The volume of urine used for extraction from the same pool was varied (18 different volumes in the range 250-6000 &#x003bc;l), and the mean concentration measured was 89 &#x000b1; 6 pg/ml. There was a highly significant correlation between the extracted volume of urine and the amount of pg/tube (r = 0.99, n = 18). Recovery of the labeled tracer during the extraction-freezing drying procedure was 94 &#x000b1; 3% (n = 13), 95 &#x000b1; 3% (n = 13), 95 &#x000b1; 2% (n = 10), and 95 &#x000b1; 2% (n = 7) in four different pools used in several extraction procedures. When ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>in the range 62.5 to 250 pg was added to urine, a highly significant correlation was found between the measured and the expected values (r = 0.981, n = 12, P &#x0003c; 0.001). We measured u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2; </sub>in 9 patients with arterial hypertension treated with amiloride. During the study day, patients collected a urine sample at 08.00 and 11.00. They took no medication in the morning before the first urine sample. Immediately after the first urine sampling, the patients took their usually dosis of amiloride 5 or 10 mg. For the whole group a significant correlation was found between the changes in u-Na/Crea and changes in u-ENaC<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>/crea (&#x003c1; = -0.720, n = 9, P =
