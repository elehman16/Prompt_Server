Primary health care (PHC) has been shown to be an effective setting to address lifestyle risk factors at the individual level. However much of the focus of research to date has been in general practice. Relatively little attention has been paid to the role of nurses working in the PHC setting. Community health nurses are well placed to provide lifestyle intervention as they often see clients in their own homes over an extended period of time, providing the opportunity to offer intervention and enhance motivation through repeated contacts. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a brief lifestyle intervention delivered by community nurses in routine practice on changes in clients' SNAP risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The trial uses a quasi-experimental design involving four generalist community nursing services in NSW Australia. Services have been randomly allocated to an 'early intervention' group or 'late intervention' (comparison) group. 'Early intervention' sites are provided with training and support for nurses in identifying and offering brief lifestyle intervention for clients during routine consultations. 'Late intervention site' provide usual care and will be offered the study intervention following the final data collection point. A total of 720 generalist community nursing clients will be recruited at the time of referral from participating sites. Data collection consists of 1) telephone surveys with clients at baseline, three months and six months to examine change in SNAP risk factors and readiness to change 2) nurse survey at baseline, six and 12 months to examine changes in nurse confidence, attitudes and practices in the assessment and management of SNAP risk factors 3) semi-structured interviews/focus with nurses, managers and clients in 'early intervention' sites to explore the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide evidence about the effectiveness and feasibility of brief lifestyle interventions delivered by generalist community nurses as part of routine practice.

In Australia, over 90% of adults do not consume the recommended five serves of vegetables per day, over half do not consume adequate amounts of fruit and 62% are overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Approximately one third of adults are classified as physically inactive, one in five (20%) smoke and of the 59% of the population who drink alcohol, 21% do so at a level which would pose a risk to their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The four SNAP risk factors have been shown to predict a fourfold difference in mortality, equivalent to 14 years in chronological age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In terms of morbidity, the World Health Organization estimates that 80% of cardiovascular disease, 90% of type 2 diabetes and 30% of all cancers could be prevented if lifestyle risk factors were eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Primary health care (PHC) has been identified as a suitable setting to provide individual intervention for lifestyle risk factors because of the accessibility, continuity, and comprehensiveness of the care provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that brief lifestyle interventions delivered in PHC are effective for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and 'at-risk alcohol' consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while moderate to high intensity interventions have shown promise for improving weight, diet and physical activity levels in high risk patients in PHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Within the context of PHC, general practitioners have been the main targets to deliver lifestyle interventions to patients, but relatively little attention has been paid to the role of nurses working in the PHC setting, in particular community health nurses. In Australia, generalist community nurses (GCN) are uniquely placed to provide individual lifestyle intervention because they: 1) frequently see patient with existing chronic conditions that may benefit from lifestyle change; 2) often have ongoing contact with patients over an extended period of time, providing the opportunity to offer intervention and foster motivation through repeated contacts; 3) mainly see clients in their own home providing opportunity for observation of the living situation and intervention with the wider family/carers; 4) may reach disadvantaged individuals and other segments of the population who have poor contact with GPs. Furthermore, our previous research has shown that community health nurses consider the provision of lifestyle intervention an appropriate component of their role as it fits well with their philosophy of providing holistic care, is often relevant to the clients presenting issue and is well accepted by clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>While the health education and promotion role of community nurses is well recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions provided by community nurses in routine practice. A study in the USA reported that patients who received smoking cessation counselling from a home health care nurse were twice as likely to be continuously abstinent at 12 months compared to those receiving usual nursing care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Community nursing follow up has also been shown to be effective in promoting abstinence and retention rates in outpatient treatment of alcohol dependent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. While these findings are promising, we are unaware of previous studies that have examined the effectiveness of community nurses delivering intervention across all four lifestyle risk factors in routine practice.</p><sec><title>Study Aim, Objectives and Hypotheses</title><p>The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a brief lifestyle intervention delivered by GCNs in routine practice on changes in clients' SNAP risk factors.</p><p>The study has three main objectives:</p><p>1. To develop an intervention to facilitate GCNs to undertake lifestyle screening and brief intervention during routine consultations and to promote referral of 'at-risk' clients to available private and public services;</p><p>2. To evaluate the impact of these interventions on change in clients' lifestyle risk factors and related mediators (eg stages of change);</p><p>3. To describe the indicative costs and resources utilised by the community nurse services in delivering the intervention.</p><p>It is hypothesised that:</p><p>1. 20% more clients who are at high risk (defined as having at least one lifestyle risk factor) in the intervention group will be offered evidence-based interventions to modify their risk factors compared with clients in the comparison group.</p><p>2. Clients in the intervention group will be significantly more likely to progress in their stage of change compared to comparison clients.</p><p>3. Clients in the intervention group will have a reduction in their lifestyle risk factor scores compared to clients in the comparison group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>This quasi-experimental study is being conducted in GCN services in the state of NSW, Australia. Within Australia, GCNs can be either registered or enrolled nurses who perform a diversity of roles depending on the service in which they work. The role has traditionally focused on providing a range of nursing care in people's homes such as assisting with activities of daily living, wound management, chronic disease care, continence management, palliative care, medication management, disability and dementia care. Coordination of care with other service providers and health promotion has also traditionally been a major part of their role.</p><p>A quasi-experimental design was chosen because it was not feasible to randomise the intervention according to individual patient or practitioners within the services. GCN services have been randomly allocated to an 'early intervention' group or 'late intervention' (comparison) group. 'Early intervention' services are provided with training and support for nurses in identifying and offering brief SNAP intervention for clients during routine consultations (see service-level intervention). Data is being collected from clients in both groups at baseline, three months and six months to examine short and medium term change in SNAP risk factors. This will enable a comparison of client outcomes between early and late intervention groups. After the six month data collection point the 'late intervention' group will be offered the same training and support as the early intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Power and Sample Size Calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcomes of change in continuous self reported measures of lifestyle risk factors rather than differences in proportion of individuals in each risk category (secondary outcomes). There is evidence that risk associated with diet, physical activity and weight is continuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Achieving a shift in risk categories is more difficult to demonstrate in the context of a brief intervention and would require a very large sample size which is beyond the scope and resources of this trial. Hence the focus is on change in continuous measures of lifestyle risk factors as the primary outcomes.</p><p>A sample size of 360 clients in each group (total n = 720) is required to have 80% of power to detect the following difference between intervention and comparison groups:</p><p>&#x025aa; Mean difference of 1 serve of fruit and vegetables consumed (equivalent to 22% increase in the 'early intervention' group);</p><p>&#x025aa; Mean difference of 1.2 for physical activity scores as measured by a validated brief physical activity assessment tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (equivalent to a 29% increase in mean scores in the 'early intervention' group);</p><p>&#x025aa; Mean difference of 0.6 for alcohol risk scores as measured by the AUDIT-C tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (equivalent to a 10% reduction in mean scores in the 'early intervention' group);</p><p>&#x025aa; Mean difference of 4.1 kg in self reported weight (equivalent to a 4.4% weight reduction in the 'early intervention' group).</p><p>This is based on 5% significance level and 80% power (&#x003b2; = 0.8 and &#x003b1; = 0.05) allowing 20% lost to follow-up and a design effect of 1.8 due to clustering. The expected differences between intervention and comparison groups has been estimated based on previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These differences are also considered meaningful from a population health perspective. Baseline prevalence of risk factors is based on NSW Health Survey 2006 for individuals aged 45-74 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><sec><title>Generalist Community Nursing Services</title><p>Four GCN services were recruited to participate in the trial.

The design of the intervention has been informed by our previous research reporting on a theoretical model of the factors shaping the lifestyle risk factor management practices of non GP PHC providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The model suggests lifestyle risk factor management practices are shaped by: 1) clinician commitment, in particular beliefs about role congruence, client receptiveness and outcome expectations; and 2) clinician capacity, including self-efficacy, role support (provision of training, decision support tools, client education materials and linkages to referral services) and the extent to which lifestyle risk factor management activities fit with clinicians' way of working.</p><p>Specifically, the service-level intervention comprises of the following components:</p><p>&#x025aa; A one day training program for participating nurses delivered by the research team in conjunction with local providers.

An emphasis is placed on experiential learning including the use of role-plays with simulated clients (actors), group discussions and activities, which have been shown to be effective in improving knowledge, skills and confidence related to lifestyle risk factor management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>&#x025aa; The integration of standard screening tools and prompts for SNAP risk factors (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) into the service specific assessment process used by the nurses (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>&#x025aa; The development and dissemination of a local service referral directory to each GCN team to promote referral of clients for ongoing specialist management or more/ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention (such as the proactive telephone Quitline).</p><p>&#x025aa; The provision of resources to support the implementation of the intervention including a written guide for nurses, written action plans for use with clients on each SNAP risk factor, tape measures for measuring waist circumference, and pedometers to loan out to clients to encourage self monitoring of incidental physical activity</p><p>Consultation has been undertaken with participating sites to ensure that intervention activities are feasible to deliver within routine practice.

These stages include not thinking about change (pre-contemplation), considering change in the next six months (contemplation), making steps to prepare for change in the next month (preparation), making changes to behaviour (action) and maintaining behaviour change for six months or more (maintenance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The model hypothesises that the balance of potential risks and benefits of change (decisional balance) and self efficacy predict movement through these various stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

The telephone survey is being conducted by trained independent data collectors blinded to the group allocation (intervention or comparison) of services. Measures of lifestyle risk factors used in the survey are based on validated tools as detailed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. Nurse outcomes are being measured using a web-based survey adapted from the Preventive Medicine Attitudes and Activities Questionnaire (PMAAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] administered at baseline, six and 12 months.

Because this is a quasi-experimental study, clients in the intervention group are not randomly allocated and may have characteristics that are related to outcomes independent of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Co-variates will be included in the analysis to adjust for baseline differences between the intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Regression method for clustered data or multilevel models will be used to adjust for confounding client variables such as age, gender, locality (rural versus urban), socio-economic status, existing health conditions and number of contacts with the nurse. Thus, this method is used to estimate intervention effect after adjustment for client characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In the study we will use multilevel models in which three repeated measures (the level 1 units) are nested within clients (level 2 units) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Multilevel models can accommodate unbalanced data due to attrition or missing values. Linear multilevel models would be used for continuous response variables and multilevel logistic models used for binary responses. The independent variables will be intervention (1 = intervention &#x00026; 0 = control), time (0 = baseline, 1 = three months &#x00026; 2 = six months) as a continuous variable, sex, age, health status of the client and the interaction between intervention and time. This model will allow us to test for a significant interaction between time and intervention, which would indicate an effect of the intervention on outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Nurse Outcomes</title><p>Change in nurses risk factor management confidence, attitudes and practice scores between early and late intervention services (comparison) will be assessed for clustering and, if this is not significant, comparison will be made between the change in early and late intervention providers using unilevel multivariate methods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Qualitative Evaluation</title><p>As this is a complex intervention delivered within the context of normal practice, a qualitative evaluation of the implementation process is important in interpreting the study findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

Much of the focus in health professional interventions to date has been on general practitioners, with relatively little attention paid to nurses outside of general practice. Community health nurses are well placed to deliver lifestyle interventions to clients and their involvement should make these types of intervention more accessible to the population, but little is known about the effectiveness of such interventions delivered in routine practice.</p><p>This study is a complex intervention trial examining the effectiveness lifestyle risk factor management delivered by GCNs. The trial is unique in that it is being delivered as part of routine practice (without additional nurse resources) and aims to examine the impact of brief intervention on multiple lifestyle risk factors. The collection of quantitative outcome data will provide new information about the efficacy of such an approach at both the clinician and client level. This will be supplemented by the qualitative evaluation which will provide important contextual information about the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of this approach for both nurses and clients. Together this information will help inform future community nursing practice and PHC policy including:</p><p>&#x02022; defining the roles of GCNs in assessing and intervening with clients to modify lifestyle risk factors</p><p>&#x02022; identifying competencies for vocational training and continuing education of GCNs</p><p>&#x02022; organisation of care and the place of health promotion interventions in the care pathway for GCN clients</p><p>&#x02022; investment in health promotion programs involving GCNs</p><p>&#x02022; the role of referral pathways linking PHC with support services for lifestyle risk factor management including both public and private providers</p><p>The findings and intervention materials of the study will be disseminated using a knowledge transfer exchange strategy. This will include dissemination of key findings using peer reviewed journals, conference presentations, the formulation of simple research summaries tailored for practitioner, service managers and policy makers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest in the conduct of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors have contributed to study design and have reviewed and approved the final manuscript.
