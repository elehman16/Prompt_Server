However this pathway exposes healthy individuals to significant reduction in nephron mass via major surgical procedure. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is now the most common method for live donor transplantation, reducing both donor post-operative pain and recovery time. However this procedure exposes kidneys to additional haemodynamic stresses. It has been suggested that donor hydration&#x02014;particularly the use of preoperative intravenous fluids&#x02014;may counteract these stresses, reducing subclinical acute kidney injury and ultimately improving long-term renal function. This may be important in both preservation of donor renal function and recipient graft longevity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A prospective single-centre single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to determine the effects of donor preoperative intravenous fluids. The primary outcome is donor subclinical acute kidney injury (defined as plasma NGAL, &#x0003e;153&#x000a0;ng/ml) on day 1 postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include intraoperative haemodynamics, recipient subclinical acute kidney injury, perioperative complications and donor sleep quality.</p><p>Donors will be randomised into two groups: the intervention group will receive active pre-hydration consisting of three litres of intravenous Hartmann&#x02019;s solution between midnight and 8&#x000a0;am before morning kidney donation, while the control group will not receive this. Both groups will receive unlimited oral fluids until midnight, as is routine. Plasma NGAL will be measured at pre-specified perioperative time points, intraoperative haemodynamic data will be collected using non-invasive cardiac output monitoring and clinical notes will be used to obtain demographic and clinical data. The researcher will be blinded to the donor fluid hydration status. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A prospective power calculation estimates a required sample size of 86 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide important data, as there is currently little evidence about the use of donor preoperative fluids in laparoscopic nephrectomy. It is hoped that the results obtained will guide future clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (reference no. 14/WS/1160, 27 January 2015) and is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (reference no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10199225">ISRCTN10199225</ext-link>, 20 April 2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>Hemodynamics</kwd><kwd>Kidney transplantation</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>Lipocalins</kwd><kwd>Living donors</kwd><kwd>Nephrectomy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Chronic Kidney Disease and Renal Transplant</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has an estimated prevalence of 8.5% in the UK adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A small but significant proportion of patients develop end stage renal disease (ESRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]&#x02014;irreversibly reduced renal function where renal replacement therapy, either dialysis or transplant, is required for survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently around 4800 patients in Scotland are on some form of renal replacement therapy, with over 50% of these patients having received a renal transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Renal transplantation is associated with increased life expectancy and quality of life compared to dialysis and so should be considered in all patients with ESRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there is an intense kidney shortage (the average UK renal transplant waiting time for a cadaveric kidney is 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Almost 300 people die in the UK each year while waiting for a kidney transplant, and many more are removed from the waiting list, having become too ill for a transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, everything possible must be done to maximise renal transplant benefit, particularly the benefit of living donation which is associated with superior graft and patient survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The price of better recipient outcomes with living kidney donation is some associated additional donor risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Earlier studies suggested that kidney donation does not affect mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] but a recent prospective observational study by Mj&#x000f8;en et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], comparing kidney donors with carefully matched controls and longer follow-up periods found kidney donation to be associated with a 30% increase in the relative risk of all-cause mortality over a long follow up period (more than 20&#x000a0;years). Furthermore, Muzaale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] estimated the lifetime risk of ESRD to be 0.9% in living kidney donors, compared with 0.14% in healthy non-donors. Ethically everything possible must be done to preserve renal function in this group, who are undertaking these risks for no personal health benefit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pneumoperitoneum, Renal Perfusion and Subclinical Acute Kidney Injury</title><p>First carried out in 1995, laparoscopic nephrectomy is now widespread and has resulted in increasing live donor transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite reducing post-operative pain and speeding up recovery, the technique exposes the kidney to theoretical additional haemodynamic stresses of extremes of posture for optimal access and pneumoperitoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The effect of increased intra-abdominal pressure is well characterized in abdominal compartment syndrome&#x02014;organ dysfunction secondary to intra-abdominal hypertension, defined as &#x02265;12&#x000a0;mm Hg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Pneumoperitoneum usually uses pressures of between 12&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mmHg. The kidneys are particularly sensitive to haemodynamic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Studies have shown a decrease in renal blood flow and renal function associated with pneumoperitoneum, though as renal function returns to normal afterwards this phenomenon has been deemed of &#x0201c;uncertain clinical significance&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Indeed a recent Cochrane review found no difference in kidney function in open vs laparoscopic nephrectomy at 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>This may reflect the fact that the kidneys have a large reserve, with approximately 50% of renal parenchyma compromise needed to see changes in eGFR. Therefore, even if renal damage has taken place, it may not be detectable by these functional measures. There is a new and emerging concept of subclinical acute kidney injury&#x02014;injury not detected by functional criteria, but through measurement of biomarkers associated with tubular necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>NGAL as a Biomarker of Subclinical Acute Kidney Injury</title><p>NGAL is a small 25&#x000a0;kDa protein of the lipocalin family, and was first identified by transcriptome analysis of the murine model, investigating the early induction of gene expression after renal ischaemia. Its expression was found to be upregulated in tubular cells after ischaemic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. NGAL levels have been shown to increase in both blood and urine in response to subclinical acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In an evaluation of 125 specimens from healthy individuals using the Alere Triage&#x000ae; CardioRenal Panel, it was found that the 95th percentile upper limit was 153&#x000a0;ng/mL. A study to determine the clinical utility of this compared the NGAL level of 494 plasma samples from patients in intensive care with the standard RIFLE criteria for acute kidney injury. AUC was 0.83 and a positive test threshold of 150&#x000a0;ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.62 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It was therefore shown to be a sensitive marker of disease.</p><p>There has been wide variation in reports of the diagnostic accuracy of NGAL, including variation in the specificities reported. This may be in part as a result of the different populations studied. NGAL is also produced by activated neutrophils and therefore may be raised in infection or inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Plasma NGAL levels have been shown to be raised in septic ICU patients without acute kidney injury, and therefore plasma NGAL should be used with caution in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As our population of interest is healthy, studies looking at populations outside a critical care setting are likely to be more generalizable to our population.</p><p>Other studies, using the point of care Triage<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> NGAL Device, have demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracies. For example, 2-h plasma NGAL measurement of 120 children who underwent cardiopulmonary by-pass obtained AUC of 0.96 and the same AKI threshold of 150&#x000a0;ng/ml yielded a sensitivity 0.84 and specificity of 0.94 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Several other studies have also confirmed the usefulness of these bedside NGAL assays in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, conclusions drawn from previous studies support the diagnostic accuracy of this method.</p><p>In the living donor population, Yoon et al. demonstrated that perioperative plasma NGAL in living donors correlates with 6&#x000a0;month donor eGFR. This correlation was found to be strongest using plasma NGAL at 1&#x000a0;week post-operatively, but a correlation was found at all time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Pilot Data</title><p>Pilot data obtained at our study centre involving 20 donors indicate that hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy is associated with significant subclinical acute kidney injury, defined as plasma NGAL &#x0003e;153&#x000a0;ng/ml, and that preoperative fluids may reduce the incidence of this. In a non-randomised pilot series, where fluids were administered as per surgeon preference, there was found to be an incidence of subclinical acute kidney injury of approximately 50% in patients receiving &#x0003c;1000&#x000a0;ml of intravenous fluids compared with a 20% incidence in those receiving &#x0003e;2500&#x000a0;ml of intravenous fluids. An inverse correlation between increase in NGAL and post donation eGFR at 6&#x000a0;weeks was also demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The risk of subclinical acute kidney injury has been demonstrated by Hasse et al. who analysed pooled data from ten prospective observational studies, involving over 2000 patients with cardiorenal syndrome type 1. Subclinical acute kidney injury detected by NGAL was found to increase the risk of adverse outcomes, such as need for renal replacement therapy, hospital mortality, and duration of hospital stay, even in the absence of a diagnostically significant increase in serum creatinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Any decrease in subclinical acute kidney injury is therefore likely to be beneficial. In the long term, it may result in a small increase in GFR, which may be beneficial for the remaining donor function, and reduced haemodynamic stress on the donated kidney may potentially result in greater longevity of the allograft. Therefore optimisation of perioperative fluid management is likely to have a protective role.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Fluids in Transplant Optimization</title><p>There is some controversy surrounding perioperative fluid administration, and optimal fluid balance. The risks of restrictive fluid administration include inadequate organ perfusion and post-operative nausea, whereas liberal fluid use may increase the risk of prolonged post-operative ileus, poor wound healing and the potential for fluid overload leading to heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>There have been variable findings in this field, with some studies demonstrating benefit from liberal fluid administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and others demonstrating either deleterious effects or no difference in outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. There is some suggestion that in &#x0201c;low-risk&#x0201d; patients undergoing mild to moderate surgery, a high-volume fluid strategy is superior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Our donor study population is a very healthy one, and all perioperative complications will be closely monitored for and reported.</p><p>Potential mechanisms behind attenuation of subclinical acute kidney injury using preoperative fluids are that optimal hydration results in increased renal venous and arteriolar filling, preventing collapse and congestion. Also, increased inferior vena cava pressure may prevent reduced venous return during pneumoperitoneum, maintaining cardiac output. These mechanisms may also reduce vasoconstriction caused by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>We have chosen to use Hartmann&#x02019;s solution (compound sodium lactate) preoperatively. This contains the following electrolyte concentrations: Na<sup>+</sup>131&#x000a0;mmol/L, K<sup>+</sup> 5&#x000a0;mmol/L, HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x02212;</sup> 29&#x000a0;mmol/L, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> 111&#x000a0;mmol/L and Ca<sup>2</sup> 2&#x000a0;mmol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Although there is some concern about the possibility of chloride increasing the incidence of AKI, Hartmann&#x02019;s solution is considered to be a chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>There have been few studies of donor perioperative fluids in laparoscopic nephrectomy. Intraoperative fluid restriction was associated with a lower urine output, but no difference in post-operative serum creatinine levels or complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This may be because hydration after the establishment of pneumoperitoneum is too late to attenuate any haemodynamic effects. Donors given preoperative fluid were shown to be more resistant to the haemodynamic compromise associated with pneumoperitoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>As discussed, existing studies used functional criteria, such as serum creatinine, which detect only damage extensive enough to cause immediate functional changes, and any subtle effects present may be masked by the overwhelming effect of nephrectomy and subsequent compensatory renal hypertrophy (CRH). There is therefore currently a lack of evidence about preoperative fluids in laparoscopic nephrectomy, and significant variation in clinical practice. This study aims to address this.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study Aims and Hypothesis</title><p>This study hypothesis is that the use of preoperative intravenous Hartmann&#x02019;s solution will result in a decrease in donor subclinical acute kidney injury, defined as plasma NGAL &#x0003e;153&#x000a0;ng/ml.</p><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether preoperative intravenous fluids result in a decrease in donor subclinical acute kidney injury.

Additionally, in order to obtain key haemodynamic measurements, such as cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and stroke volume index (SVI) measurements, the use of a non-invasive cardiac output monitor will be required. The NICCOMO<sup>&#x02122;</sup> bioimpedance system (Medis, Germany) will be used&#x02014;a novel and totally non-invasive monitor which employs impedance cardiography to measure cardiac output. It does so by measuring electrical signals produced by changes in the volume and velocity of the blood in the thoracic aorta. This NICCOMO system is complemented by another device&#x02014;the CNAP<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Monitor 500 (CNSystems, Austria). The CNAP Monitor employs the volume-clamp method of Penaz to measure non-invasive arterial blood pressure continuously via two small inflatable cuffs applied to the fingers of one hand. The cardiac output monitor will be attached to the patient shortly after the induction of anaesthesia and will remain in situ throughout the surgical procedure.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data Management</title><p>Data will be entered on a patient-by-patient basis into a computerised password-protected database on a computer within the Department of Renal Transplantation by an investigator blinded to the study group allocation. Patients will be identified by their study number only. After data analysis has been performed, it will be combined with the randomisation code and the nature of each patient&#x02019;s perioperative fluid regimen will be revealed. This will be performed in accordance with the Data Protection Act. A case report file will be created for each patient. These will be archived in a locked facility and kept for a period of 3&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe continuous variables. Results for continuous variables will be reported as mean (+/&#x02212; standard deviation) or median (interquartile range). The primary outcome, proportion of patients in each group with subclinical acute kidney injury, will be compared using a chi-square test and 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions.</p><p>If the data for continuous variables follow a Normal distribution, the variables will be compared using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. If data are found to not be Normally distributed, a Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test will be used. Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</p><p>Study reporting will be in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p>As there is currently relatively little data about preoperative fluid use in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, it is hoped that this study will provide important clinical information. Prior to this study, trials looking at preoperative fluids have shown a beneficial effect on intraoperative haemodynamics. In this study, plasma NGAL will be used to determine whether this effect translates to a reduction in subclinical acute kidney injury, which may be of benefit for both the donor and the recipient.</p><p>In terms of the volume of intravenous fluid administration, Mertens zur Borg et al. based the volume of fluid administered on ideal body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Though this is a useful approach in terms of monitoring the relative effects of fluid on patient physiology, it was decided that in this study a pragmatic approach to this would be the most feasible option. As approximately 3&#x000a0;L of intravenous fluid has been administered preoperatively previously, it was decided that this volume would be used. This is useful both in terms of facilitating adherence to the protocol and in terms of potential future clinical utility, as it would be more easily reproduced in future clinical practice, should any clinical benefit be found.</p><p>It is hoped that, whatever the findings of the study, the results will be of real clinical relevance. If preoperative intravenous fluids are found to be of benefit, then this could lead to their widespread use in clinical practice. If, however, no difference is found between the groups, then live donors may not need be admitted to hospital until the morning of the surgery which would mean greater patient convenience and reduced costs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AKI</term><def><p>Acute kidney injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Cardiac index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CKD</term><def><p>Chronic kidney disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRH</term><def><p>Compensatory renal hypertrophy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DGF</term><def><p>Delayed graft function</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eGFR</term><def><p>Estimated glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESRD</term><def><p>End stage renal disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAH</term><def><p>Intra-abdominal hypertension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NGAL</term><def><p>Neutrophil-gelatinase associated lipocalin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVI</term><def><p>Stroke volume index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVRI</term><def><p>Systemic vascular resistance index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to David Young, University of Strathclyde, for his statistical advice and Julie Glen and Loraine Lawson, the renal transplant co-ordinators.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SM wrote this manuscript.
