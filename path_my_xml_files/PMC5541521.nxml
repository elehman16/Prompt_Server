The incidence is high in older populations due to osteoporosis and increased falls risk. Considerable practice variation exists in the management of distal radius fractures in older patients ranging from closed reduction with cast immobilisation to open reduction with plate fixation. Plating is currently the most common surgical treatment. While there is evidence showing no significant advantage for some forms of surgical fixation over conservative treatment, and no difference between different surgical techniques, there is a lack of evidence comparing two of the most common treatments used: closed reduction and casting versus plating. Surgical management involves significant costs and risks compared with conservative management. High-level evidence is required to address practice variation, justify costs and to provide the best clinical outcomes for patients.</p><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This pragmatic, multicentre randomised comparative effectiveness trial aims to determine whether plating leads to better pain and function and is more cost-effective than closed reduction and casting of displaced distal radius fractures in adults aged 60 years and older. The trial will compare the two techniques but will also follow consenting patients who are unwilling to be randomised in a separate, observational cohort. Inclusion of non-randomised patients addresses selection bias, provides practice and outcome insights about standard care, and improves the generalisability of the results from the randomised trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>CROSSFIRE(Combined Randomised and Observational Study of Surgery for Fractures In the distal Radius in the Elderly) was reviewed and approved by The Hunter New England HREC (HNEHREC Reference No: 16/02/17/3.04).

In Australia, it is estimated that the number of osteoporotic wrist fractures (in people aged 50 years and over) will increase over 25% from approximately 20&#x02009;000 in 2013 to over 25&#x02009;000 in 2022, and most of these will be aged 65 years and over.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Direct costs from osteoporotic wrist fractures have been estimated to be over 130&#x02009;million dollars (AUD)&#x000a0;per year in Australia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the European Union in 2010, it was estimated that there were 5&#x02009;60&#x02009;000 osteoporotic forearm fractures sustained, at a cost of almost &#x020ac;1&#x02009;billion.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> With increasing use of surgical fixation, the cost is expected to increase disproportionately.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>Considerable practice variation exists in the management of distal radius fractures in the elderly.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Historically, these fractures have been treated by closed reduction (manipulation of the fracture) and plaster cast immobilisation. Over the last 10&#x02013;20 years, the use of internal fixation for these fractures has increased more than fivefold<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> due to the frequent loss of alignment seen with plaster fixation, despite a lack of any clear association between alignment and function in this population.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Open reduction and (volar locking) plate fixation is currently the most common surgical&#x000a0;treatment provided. In 2011, a survey of Australian orthopaedic surgeons showed that nearly half (47%) of surgeons preferred surgical (plate) fixation for the case example used (typical distal radius fracture in a female aged 75 years).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><sec id="s1a"><title>What the evidence says</title><p>Comparative trials have not shown clear superiority of pain and function with plate fixation compared with plaster fixation, despite better radiographic appearance with operative (plate) fixation. The improved radiographic and clinical alignment noted with surgical (plate) fixation is a driver of the preference for surgical fixation among surgeons, despite evidence that the residual alignment (or malalignment) is not correlated with pain or function in these fractures.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>In 2009, a Cochrane review involving 3371 mainly elderly female patients concluded that there was a &#x02018;lack of clear evidence for the surgical management of these fractures&#x02019;.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The Cochrane review did not contain any studies comparing plate fixation to closed reduction and cast immobilisation. Surgery has also been associated with significant complications otherwise not seen with non-surgical approaches.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p><p>In 2011, a high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 73 participants aged 65 years and older found no difference in patient-reported outcomes when volar plating was compared with plaster fixation for unstable distal radius fractures that had redisplaced after initial closed reduction.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, this was a single-centre study, limiting generalisability, and it did not report changes in quality of life. Furthermore, this study only included patients in whom the initial closed reduction had failed on first review, a practice not followed in Australia, where the decision to operate is made on initial presentation. In many countries, including Australia, a treatment decision is made on the initial radiographs (degree of displacement) with no trial of closed treatment first. Therefore, the current study reflects that practice by randomising based on the initial radiographs. It is the consideration of many (particularly in Australia and the USA) that &#x02018;stability&#x02019; is decided on the initial radiographs (displacement, comminution) and &#x02018;reducibility&#x02019; decided on the postreduction radiographs.</p><p>In 2014, a second randomised trial involving 185 participants aged 65 years and older also showed no significant benefit to volar locked plating over closed reduction for displaced distal radius fractures, but this paper had a high rate of crossover and only included the less common intra-articular fracture type, making interpretation and generalisation difficult.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>We initially considered using an age cut-off of 65 years in order to align with other studies. However, the frequency of these fractures increases from age 50. Investigators were surveyed to consider lowering the age cut-off. Age 60 was the lowest age cut-off accepted by all investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Justification for, and aims of, a new trial</title><p>Given the increased resource utilisation and risks associated with surgery, a clear benefit is required to make this treatment cost-effective. No clear benefit to surgery has yet been established. Our aim is to definitively quantify the true benefit (if any) and harms of the current standard surgical treatment, and to determine its cost-effectiveness, in comparison with closed reduction and cast immobilisation.

An analysis of covariance will be used to compare the mean PRWE between the two independent groups. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed in the primary analysis. A per-protocol analysis (including participants according to treatment received) will be added as a secondary analysis.

Repeated measures analysis will be performed as a secondary analysis.</p><p>Attempts will be made to minimise missing data, such as obtaining multiple contact details at recruitment and using telephone follow-up rather than mail. Missing data will be dealt with according to the instructions on the use of the outcome tools (PRWE, DASH and EQ-5D-5L).

A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the hospital perspective and an healthcare funder perspective, and limited to clearly defined costs. Costs will be calculated from: (1) length of stay (if admitted), (2) theatre costs (based on standard fees for public hospitals in each state), (3) implant costs and (4) outpatient rehabilitation-related costs. Using the mean costs and the mean health outcomes in each trial cohort, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the plate group compared with cast group will be calculated; results will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Bootstrapping will be used to estimate a distribution around costs and health outcomes, and to calculate the CIs around the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. One-way sensitivity analysis will be conducted around key variables and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate the joint uncertainty in all parameters. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be plotted to provide information about the probability that the intervention is cost-effective, given willingness to pay for each additional QALY gained.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>The study compares two treatments that comprise usual care.
