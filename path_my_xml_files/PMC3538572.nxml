[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but unfortunately, it is also well known that children and adolescents are actually getting less than their recommended hours of sleep
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, Gibson and colleagues
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that 70% of students (aged 14&#x02013;18&#x02009;years) had less than eight and a half hours of sleep per night; with the average sleep time of the over 2000 students surveyed at about seven and a half hours. This inadequate sleep might be the reason why daytime sleepiness is prevalent in children and adolescents, with up to half of students surveyed in one study reporting daytime sleepiness at least once a week
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>This pattern of inadequate sleep in children and adolescents is thought to be due to a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include natural, developmental changes such as a shift in circadian rhythm during puberty
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], delayed sleep phase syndrome (estimated to occur in 7% of adolescents)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, insomnia type symptoms, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, seem to be the most prevalent cause of inadequate sleep with studies estimating insomnia type symptoms affecting up to 34% of adolescents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, such as early school start times
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and sleep habits (also known as sleep hygiene) such as caffeine consumption
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the use of electronic devices
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] near bedtime have also been shown to adversely impinge on adolescent sleep time. Indeed, numerous studies have shown good sleep hygiene to be an important predictor of sleep quality in adolescents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As such, sleep hygiene has been used to try and alleviate the sleep problems found in adolescents today. For example, a behavioural sleep programme, incorporating sleep hygiene and stimulus control instructions was developed and trialled in University students in a bid to improve sleep quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A similar study also looked at the effectiveness of a school-based intervention in increasing sleep knowledge and improving adolescent sleep problems in high school students
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. More interestingly, a behavioural sleep intervention utilizing a combination of sleep hygiene, cognitive therapy and stress reduction techniques has also been used as a means for improving sleep in the hope of lowering the risk for recidivism of substance abuse in adolescent substance users
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These sleep hygiene studies have reported positive outcomes in various aspects of sleep quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and even drug use at 12&#x02009;months follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, these studies have focussed on older aged adolescents and were delivered in a group or classroom setting. We have taken a different approach and developed a one-on-one sleep hygiene programme designed specifically for children and adolescents aged 10&#x02013;18&#x02009;years old. To the best of our knowledge, this sleep programme is the first of its kind to be developed for youth in consultation with children and adolescents themselves. The current study thus aimed to examine the changes following a novel sleep hygiene intervention on sleep hygiene, sleep quality, and daytime symptoms in children and adolescents. As a secondary outcome, the study also measured changes in BMI because of reported associations between inadequate sleep, disturbed sleep and overweight and obesity in children and adolescents

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Based on a review of the literature, the researchers assembled two thematic versions (animal theme, sports theme) of a sleep hygiene education programme covering three main sleep hygiene categories of sleep routine, sleep environment and eating and drinking habits before bedtime. Twenty-two developmentally healthy children and adolescents of the same age group as the pilot population were recruited and consulted about the programmes; 11 aged 10 to 14&#x02009;years (5 females, 6 males) and 11 aged 15 to 18&#x02009;years (6 females, 5 males). Both thematic versions of the programmes were delivered (alternate sequences) by the researcher to participants (in pairs), and at the conclusion, participants completed a pop quiz to evaluate recall and were then interviewed about the suitability of content structure (including wording), programme preference, and their ideas to aid compliance to the programme. Interviews were transcribed and naive reading and thematic structural analyses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] conducted on the transcripts. Results showed the animal theme version had the highest correct acronym and rule recall (96% and 27% animal theme respectively versus 18% and 23% sports theme respectively) and was equally appealing to both boys and girls and across both age groups. Based on the interview results, wording was modified and aesthetic changes made to the multi-media presentation and take-home resource materials. The final programme was packaged as the F.E.R.R.E.T sleep hygiene programme; an acronym for Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing, with each category consisting of three easy to remember sleep hygiene rules pertaining to their respective categories with the last rule reinforcing the acronym (Table
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Inclusion criteria were children/adolescents aged 10&#x02013;18&#x02009;years who experience difficulties falling asleep, and/or maintaining sleep. Exclusion criteria included current diagnosis of a primary sleep disorder or any uncontrolled medical condition, living outside the greater Dunedin area, and taking prescribed or over-the-counter medication for insomnia currently, or throughout the period of enrolment. An initial phone call was made after the participants had volunteered to ensure eligibility and then assessed again at the first face-face appointment. This study was approved by the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee, Dunedin, New Zealand (Project Key: LRS/07/12/055).

During the intervention session lasting approximately 90&#x02009;minutes, participants were also given an individualised F.E.R.R.E.T flip-book containing the acronyms and rules in an easy reference format, and space to write notes down should they wish to. The F.E.R.R.E.T flip-book also had a compact disc (CD) containing the F.E.R.R.E.T multi-media presentation and participants were also given a number of resources to help them remember what they had learnt during the intervention: a wall poster, fridge magnets and a progress chart. Post-intervention support included fortnightly telephone calls to the participant, a dedicated F.E.R.R.E.T cell phone number that participants could call or text at any time with sleep issues, as well as one-one informal session every six weeks with the researcher to discuss progress.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Table

Anthropometric measures were taken once pre-intervention (2&#x02009;weeks) and once post intervention (20&#x02009;weeks post-intervention). In preparation for the first data collection point (2&#x02009;weeks pre-intervention), sleep questionnaires and Acticals were delivered the week prior. Participants then brought the completed questionnaires and Actical&#x000ae; monitors to this first visit. Anthropometric measures were taken and a parent/guardian completed the demographic questionnaire covering participant age, ethnicity, and residential address, and parental level of education and household income. Deprivation index values were generated based on the NZDep2006 value from the participants&#x02019; given addresses where 1 represents the areas with the least deprived scores and 10, the areas with the most deprived scores. The deprivation index is measured from nine characteristics related to deprivation such as telephone and automobile access, household income and occupant&#x02019;s educational qualifications.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Data collection tools and time points for each</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Measures</bold></th><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Collection Tools</bold></th><th colspan="5" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Intervention (weeks)</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Pre-</bold><hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Post-</bold><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center"><bold>2</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>1</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>6</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>12</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>20</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Socio-demographic<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Self-styled questionnaire<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anthropometric<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Height, weight, waist circumference<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sleep hygiene<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sleep quality<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sleep quality (parent report)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Daytime sleepiness<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">&#x02713;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sleep duration &#x00026; energy expenditure</td><td align="left">Actical</td><td align="center">&#x02713;</td><td align="center">&#x02713;</td><td align="center">&#x02713;</td><td align="center">&#x02713;</td><td align="center">&#x02713;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><sec><title>Adolescent sleep hygiene scale (ASHS)</title><p>The ASHS is a 28-item self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep-facilitating and sleep-inhibiting practices in adolescents along nine different domains: physiological, cognitive, emotional, sleep environment, daytime sleep, substances, bedtime routine, sleep stability, and bed/bedroom sharing

Further, a sample size of 28 participants would be sufficient in the same way for showing that reliability of categorical measures, as assessed by Kappa, was at least 0.60 (indicating at least adequate reliability) assuming a true Kappa of 0.85 (very good) or better and 50% responses in each category.

We found significant improvements in sleep hygiene, sleep quality as well as daytime symptoms such as a reduction in daytime sleepiness and sedentary/light activity, following the intervention. We reported statistically significant improvements in sleep hygiene practices post-intervention which earlier studies have also demonstrated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The improvements in sleep practices (as assessed by the ASHS) reported in the current study, albeit significant, were small. However, although the improvements in sleep practices reported are slight, the statistically significant increase might indeed reflect real-life benefits as seen in the improvements in sleep quality reported by both parents and participants, as well as the decrease in daytime sleepiness.</p><p>The improvements in sleep hygiene and sleep quality reported in the current study are also consistent with previous studies that have shown similar findings in participants ranging from infants to adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However given both participants and parents were aware of the treatment, a study of sleep hygiene intervention with a concurrent control group with parents blind to treatment would be required to provide definitive answers in regard to efficacy. Baseline data on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness indicated that the cohort of enrolled children had poor sleep quality and elevated index scores for daytime sleepiness. With regard to sleep quality, baseline mean (SD) PSQI scores of 7.47 (2.43) were greater than five, indicating poor sleep quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] while baseline mean (SD) SDSC scores of 53.4 (9.0) were greater than 39 which was also an indication of poor sleep quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These scores were very similar to those reported in slightly older students with poor sleep quality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and baseline SDSC index scores were also very similar to those of patients with known sleep disorders such as insomnia and respiratory disturbances
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Baseline daytime sleepiness scores were also indicative of daytime sleepiness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and similar to those reported in children of a similar age with OSA and epilepsy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The baseline mean sleep duration was within recommended sleep times for this age group
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] which might be why the mean increase in total sleep time (after the intervention) was only five minutes.</p><p>A significant decrease in daytime sleepiness (PDSS), a daytime symptom of poor sleep quality, also suggests further evidence of improved sleep quality. Mean scores for PSQI, SDSC, and PDSS improved from scores indicative of sleep dysfunction or above control group means, to acceptable or control group mean scores. There was a trend (albeit non-significant) for energy expenditure during sleep to decrease post-intervention which could indicate this as a marker for the improved sleep quality reported subjectively. Furthermore, a significant decrease in participants&#x02019; sedentary/light activity behaviour during the day was also observed which could be due to the decrease in sleepiness during the day as observed in PDSS scores.</p><p>Encouragingly, we found a slight but significant reduction in BMI z-scores 20&#x02009;weeks post-intervention. This seems to suggest that although significant increases in absolute weight and height were also observed, the reduction in BMI z-scores reflects a slower weight gain of our participants (compared to peers of the same age and sex) rather than an increase in height that led to improved BMI z-scores. The recruited sample of children, although not overweight, had BMI z-scores almost one SD above the population mean that reduced by <italic>&#x02212;</italic>0.13 (CI <italic>&#x02212;</italic>0.20 to 0.05, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) to a mean (SD) BMI z-score of 0.66 (1.19) 20&#x02009;weeks post-intervention. An earlier study, adopting a diet and physical activity behavioural intervention in children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] reported a slightly smaller reduction in BMI z-scores, as did a similar study in obese adolescents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Compared to the two above mentioned studies, the reduction in BMI z-scores reported in the current study are important given the fact that our sample of children were not overweight/obese. It is possible improvements in sleep might have led to the decrease in BMI z-scores seen through the changes in the regulation of appetite hormones leptin and ghrelin
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and/or due to changes in fat metabolism
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However caution must be applied in linking this BMI reduction to improved sleep as rules around food restriction before bedtime were part of the sleep hygiene practice regime to encourage sleep and thus more research is needed to corroborate our findings around sleep and weight. A larger, behavioural sleep study investigating the health outcomes of obese adults after a behavioural sleep extension intervention of sleep deprived (&#x0003c; 6.5&#x02009;hours) participants is currently underway
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It employs a non-pharmacological sleep only intervention (no modifications to energy intake or expenditure). Interim analysis of PSQI scores also revealed a greater reduction in PSQI scores in the sleep intervention group compared to the control group at the first year of follow-up
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. These trends provide indications that sleep may be an effective adjunct treatment strategy for weight management.</p><p>This study was not without limitations. First, our sample was a small community-recruited sample, which limits generalizability. For example, as enrolment to the study was voluntary and dependent on the participant/family approaching us, this cohort of participants could have been especially motivated. Secondly, this was a before and after intervention study and did not include a control group, thus any improvements seen could be due to the placebo effect which might have been amplified by the participants&#x02019; motivation for change. Thirdly, although the measurement of sleep quality by participant using the PSQI is written in a language easily understood by this age group, the validity and reliability of the instrument in this young age group has yet to be demonstrated. Finally, it is likely that the self-selected recruitment of parents will have produced a sample of children with high levels of sleep problems. This was an intended effect of the recruitment strategies used in order to demonstrate that the pilot was acceptable for this population and so could be used in a larger trial. In the absence of a control group, however, regression towards the mean cannot be ruled out as at least partially explaining the changes observed during the study. The full study was completed over a school year, thus we cannot exclude seasonal changes being an advantage or disadvantage to sleep changes in some. A strength of the study was the retention rate at 100% with every enrolled participant completing the 20&#x02009;week&#x02009;F.E.R.R.E.T sleep hygiene programme. This is probably atypical, but the high retention may have reflected the age-appropriateness of the intervention, perhaps aided by the multiple researcher contact time points and/or by the individuals being more motivated to complete because they volunteered and presented with self-identified sleep problems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings suggest the F.E.R.R.E.T sleep hygiene education programme might be effective in improving sleep in children and adolescents, but given the limitations of a pilot study, caution must be applied in interpretation of the findings. The weight loss findings support the current research impetus on the link between sleep and obesity. However because this was a before and after study within a pilot study, the findings would need to be replicated within a randomized controlled trial to prove efficacy, and ideally within a sleep hygiene intervention that does not address pre-bedtime food consumption. Future research should also investigate the long-term effect of a sleep hygiene intervention on various physiological, psychological, and behavioural health outcomes in youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASHS: Adolescent sleep hygiene scale; PDSS: Pediatric daytime sleepiness scale; PSQI: Pittsburgh sleep quality index; SDSC: Sleep disturbance scale for children.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The study chief investigators ET and BCG were responsible for identifying the research question, study design, obtaining ethical approval, overseeing the day-to-day implementation of the study, and securing funding.
