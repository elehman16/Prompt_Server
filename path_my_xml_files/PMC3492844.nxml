At progression on either therapy, the patients were offered crossover to the alternative drug combination. An estimated 300 patients would be needed for the trial to detect a 50% difference in median PFS between the treatment arms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After inclusion of 131 patients, the trial was prematurely closed because of low accrual. Sixty-seven patients were randomized to Thal-Dex and 64 to Bort-Dex. Progression-free survival was similar (median, 9.0 months for Thal-Dex and 7.2 for Bort-Dex). Response rate was similar (55% for Thal-Dex and 63% for Bort-Dex), but time to response was shorter (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and the VGPR rate higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) for Bort-Dex. Time-to-other treatment after crossover was similar (median, 13.2 months for Thal-Dex and 11.2 months for Bort-Dex), as was overall survival (22.8 months for Thal-Dex and 19.0 for Bort-Dex). Venous thromboembolism was seen in seven patients and cerebrovascular events in four patients in the Thal-Dex group. Severe neuropathy, reactivation of herpes virus infections, and mental depression were more frequently observed in the Bort-Dex group. In the quality-of-life analysis, no difference was noted for physical function, pain, and global quality of life. Fatigue and sleep disturbances were significantly more prevalent in the Bort-Dex group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thalidomide (50&#x02013;100 mg daily) in combination with dexamethasone seems to have an efficacy comparable with that of bortezomib and dexamethasone in melphalan refractory myeloma. However, the statistical strength of the results in this study is limited by the low number of included patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>thalidomide</kwd><kwd>bortezomib</kwd><kwd>randomized trial</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The treatment options for multiple myeloma have improved considerably in recent years, both as concerns initial therapy and treatment for refractory and relapsing disease. In 2007, when this study was initiated, there was still a consensus in most centers on the use of high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell support for initial therapy in younger patients and melphalan&#x02013;prednisone in elderly patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). For relapsed and refractory disease, however, few randomized clinical trials had been performed and no consensus on best choice of therapy was present. Thalidomide was frequently used since the initial report on favorable results in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). A systematic review of published phase II studies on thalidomide monotherapy reported a 29% response rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The addition of dexamethasone to thalidomide was reported to increase the response rate to 46% with a median event-free survival of 8 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). However, no randomized trials were carried out, and thalidomide was not approved by the European authorities. Bortezomib was introduced in 2006 and approved after the publications of two phase II studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and one phase III study comparing bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Briefly, these studies reported a response rate of 30&#x02013;43% for bortezomib monotherapy, increasing 10&#x02013;15% after the addition of dexamethasone, and a median time to progression of 7 months. The phase III trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) showed a superiority of bortezomib over dexamethasone. In the setting of this study, no randomized studies have been published comparing thalidomide with bortezomib, nor any studies comparing any of these drugs with other chemotherapy.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare thalidomide + dexamethasone with bortezomib + dexamethasone for efficacy, toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with melphalan refractory myeloma. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were response rate and duration, toxicity, QoL, time to next treatment, and overall survival. The study was carried out in a multicenter setting involving several local hospitals. In our study, we used drug doses considered the current best standard treatment, which reflects day-to-day clinical practice. This was a genuinely academic study without any support or involvement from the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Since 2008, when the trial was opened for patient inclusions, the prerequisites for the study have changed. Both thalidomide and bortezomib have been approved for use in combination with melphalan and prednisone for initial therapy and lenalidomide for relapsed and refractory myeloma. For these reasons, the accrual rate of the study dropped and the study was prematurely closed before half of the projected number of patients was included. Nevertheless, no other randomized trial comparing thalidomide with bortezomib has been published, and the results of the trial are still of relevance for patients who have not received thalidomide or bortezomib as part of initial therapy, as well as for patients relapsing after high-dose melphalan.</p><p>The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. identifier: NCT00602511.</p><sec><title>Design and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This open phase III randomized multicenter trial was conducted in 29 hospitals in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. From October 2007 to September 2010, 131 patients entered the study (60 were recruited from university hospitals and 71 from local hospitals). Eligible for the study was patients of any age who had treatment demanding myeloma and were refractory to melphalan defined by (i) the absence of response or progression on initial melphalan-based treatment (primary refractory disease), (ii) the absence of response or progression on reinstituted melphalan treatment after previous response (relapsed and refractory), and (iii) treatment demanding relapse after previous response if occurring within 12 months after high-dose therapy or within 6 months after oral melphalan treatment (relapsing disease). However, even patients with later relapse could be included if further melphalan-based therapy was regarded as futile according to the responsible physician. Exclusion criteria were (i) former treatment with thalidomide, bortezomib, or lenalidomide; (ii) sensory neuropathy (grade 3 or more) or neuropathic pain (grade 2 or more); (iii) platelet counts &#x0003c;25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L; (iv) severe comorbidity; (v) transformation to plasma cell leukemia or aggressive lymphoma; and (vi) non-secreting myeloma without abnormal free light chain ratio. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and was approved by ethical committees in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>We estimated that 300 patients would be needed for the trial assuming a median PFS in the control arm of 7 months, a 50% difference in median PFS between the treatment arms, an accrual rate of 12 patients per month during 25 months and a 4-month follow-up after the last included patient, and a PFS analysis with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p><italic>Randomization:</italic> After stratification for previously given high-dose melphalan or not, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive treatment with either thalidomide and dexamethasone (Thal-Dex) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Bort-Dex). The randomization procedure was centralized and performed electronically by a web-based form.</p><p><italic>Treatment according to randomization:</italic> In the Thal-Dex group, thalidomide was given at a dose of 50 mg once daily initially, escalated by 50 mg every 3 wk to a maximum of 200 mg daily, unless sufficient response was achieved by a lower dose. The dexamethasone dose was 40 mg on days 1&#x02013;4, repeated every third week. In the Bort-Dex group, bortezomib was given with 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-wk cycle. The dexamethasone dose was 20 mg on days 1&#x02013;2, 4&#x02013;5, 8&#x02013;9, and 11&#x02013;12. In both groups, treatment was continued until the achievement of best response followed by 1&#x02013;2 additional 3-wk treatment cycles, followed by a treatment pause. In case of progression during the treatment pause, the initial treatment was reinstituted and continued until definitive failure. In case of neurotoxicity or other dose-dependent side effects, the doses of thalidomide and bortezomib were reduced. For bortezomib neurotoxicity, internationally accepted guidelines were followed. The initial dose of dexamethasone was given for two treatment cycles and thereafter individualized depending on response and side effects.</p><p><italic>Crossover treatment:</italic> Patients with definitive failure in the Thal-Dex group were offered crossover treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Similarly, patients with failure in the Bort-Dex group received crossover treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone. The principles, dosing, schedules, and duration of treatment were the same after crossover as for initial treatment according to randomization.</p><p><italic>Concomitant medication:</italic> Antithrombotic prophylaxis and acyclovir prophylaxis were not mandatory according to the study protocol but used routinely in an increasing proportion of participating centers during the study period.</p><p><italic>Follow-up:</italic> Patients were followed every 3 wk until the achievement of response and plateau phase or at least four treatment cycles; thereafter, follow-up was every 3&#x02013;6 wk until the patient reached the end of the study, defined by death or start of other treatment off-protocol. At each visit, a response evaluation was performed after laboratory check-up of relevant tests, including M protein in blood or urine or serum free light lambda chains, as well as toxicity evaluation according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). All patients were followed until death or until January 2011.</p><p><italic>Quality-of-life assessment:</italic> Health-related QoL (HRQoL) was measured by the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. It is constructed to be cancer specific and multidimensional and has been validated for MM patients. The questionnaire incorporates five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), three symptom scales (pain, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting), a global health and quality-of-life scale, and a number of single items (appetite loss, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, sleep disturbances, and financial impact). All scale and item scores were linearly transformed, so that the results ranged from 0 to 100. For the five functioning scales and the single global health/quality-of-life scale, higher scores represent higher level of functioning. For the three symptom scales and the single symptom items, higher scores represent higher level of symptoms. The patients completed the questionnaires before randomization and thereby before start of treatment, and later mailed to the patients after 6, 12 wk, 6 months, and thereafter every 6 months until the patient reached the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions</title><p>Partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), and progressive disease (PD) were defined according to the IMWG guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Failure was defined by (i) PD during treatment, (ii) stable disease, that is, neither PR nor PD, but with remaining treatment demanding ROTI despite treatment with optimal drug doses, (iii) PD on reinstituted treatment after previous response, and (iv) PD during treatment pause in responding patients in which reinstituted treatment was contraindicated because of toxicity.</p><p>PFS was calculated from the time of randomization until definitive failure on treatment according to randomization, or death. Time to response was calculated from randomization until the achievement of at least PR and response duration from that time until definitive failure. Time to next treatment after the first treatment line was calculated from randomization until start of crossover treatment, other treatment off-protocol, or death, whichever came first. Time to other treatment off-protocol was calculated from randomization until start of other treatment off-protocol, or death. Overall survival was calculated from the time of randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Comparisons between groups for PFS, time to response, response duration, time to other treatment, and overall survival were performed by a two-sided log-rank test based on Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves. Comparisons between groups for response rates were performed by Fisher's exact test. Cox's regression test was used to analyze prognostic factors. The principle of intention-to-treat was applied in all analyses, except time to response and response duration, in which only responding patients were included. The patients&#x02019; self-assessments of QoL using the QLQ-C30 were analyzed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test for related samples. Differences or changes of 10 or more on a 0&#x02013;100 scale were regarded as clinically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). As a large number of comparisons were performed, in the QoL analysis, a <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.01 was considered necessary for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Evaluable patients</title><p>Sixty-seven patients were randomized to Thal-Dex and 64 to Bort-Dex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).

All these analyses are performed according to the principle of intention-to-treat.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of randomized patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ejh0088-0485-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Patients&#x02019; clinical and laboratory characteristics at the time of randomization are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. About half of the patients in both groups were previously treated with high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell support. 30% of patients in the Thal-Dex group and 25% in the Bort-Dex group were true refractory to melphalan. The remaining patients had relapsed off-therapy after previous response or plateau phase. There were significantly more women in the Thal-Dex group. However, in a univariate analysis, no prognostic importance of gender for PFS was found. For all other patient characteristics, the treatment arms were well balanced.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics at the time of

Sensory or motor neuropathy (grade 3&#x02013;4) was noted in 12 compared with six patients, and neuropathic pain (grade 2&#x02013;4) was seen in 21 compared with 5.</p><p><italic>Infections</italic> that are clinically or microbiologically documented (grade 3&#x02013;5), herpes infections excluded, were detected in 16 patients in the Thal-Dex group and in 21 patients in the Bort-Dex group. About half of the cases in both groups were pneumonia. Reactivation of herpes zoster (grade 2&#x02013;3) was seen in five patients in the Bort-Dex group and in one patient in the Thal-Dex group, while herpes simplex (grade 3) was found in two patients in the Bort-Dex group and in one patient in the Thal-Dex group. Only one of these patients, assigned to the Bort-Dex group, was on prophylactic acyclovir treatment at the time of the outbreak.</p><p><italic>Psychiatric reactions</italic> (grade 3&#x02013;4) were discovered in two patients in the Thal-Dex group, one of whom developed visual hallucinations and one severe anxiety. Five patients in the Bort-Dex group developed depressive reactions (grade 3&#x02013;4).</p><p><italic>Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism</italic> was observed in seven patients in the Thal-Dex group and in one patient in the Bort-Dex group.

One patient suffered a hemorrhagic stroke with a fatal outcome; one patient had a major ischemic stroke with subsequent sequel; and two patients had minor strokes without sequel. As for the patients with venous thromboembolism, none of these patients was on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment at the time of the event.</p><p><italic>Pulmonary and cardiac toxicity:</italic> One patient developed acute pulmonary edema (grade 4) the day after the second injection of bortezomib. The cardiac function was found to be normal, and a bortezomib-induced pulmonary edema could not be excluded. Cardiac failure (grade 3&#x02013;4) was seen in two patients in the Thal-Dex group and three in the Bort-Dex group. No case of myocardial infarction was noted.</p><p><italic>Toxicity during crossover treatment:</italic> Toxicity after crossover was similar to that during treatment according to randomization. In the Thal-Dex group receiving bortezomib + dexamethasone after crossover, one patient had a minor ischemic stroke. In the Bort-Dex group receiving thalidomide + dexamethasone, one additional patient experienced deep vein thrombosis, one had a minor stroke, and one developed intestinal gangrene, probably from arterial obstruction, with a fatal outcome. None of these patients was on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment at the time of the event.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of life</title><p>The quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ) was completed by 96% of patients still alive at 6 wk, 90% at 12 wk, and 76% at 6 months.

Bortezomib and lenalidomide have both showed superiority to high-dose dexamethasone in relapse patients. However, high-dose dexamethasone is a treatment strategy that has never been regarded as standard treatment in the Nordic countries. Thus, in the absence of comparative trials for the practicing physician, it was not possible to make an evidence-based choice between thalidomide and bortezomib for melphalan refractory patients. This trial was designed to answer the question of whether any of these drugs was to be preferred before the other and, for patients in whom both drugs were planned to be used, whether there were any advantages to start with one or another.</p><p>The main result of this trial is that low-dose thalidomide (50&#x02013;100 mg daily) in combination with dexamethasone has comparable efficacy as bortezomib + dexamethasone regarding PFS and time to next treatment for patients with melphalan refractory myeloma. Bortezomib was found to induce a more rapid response and a higher rate of VGPR, but this did not translate into a longer PFS or overall survival.</p><p>The median time on bortezomib (3.5 months) and thalidomide treatment (5.1 months) was short in this trial. The main reasons for early termination of treatment were therapeutic failure and toxicity. Peripheral neuropathy was a major concern, especially in the Bort-Dex group, and frequently the cause of early treatment discontinuation although we deliberately tried to limit this problem by early bortezomib dose reduction and a low starting dose for thalidomide.</p><p>The main strength of the study, additional to the unique design, was that it was performed in a multicenter setting with several local hospitals involved and that the doses of the study drugs were those generally used in the Nordic countries at the time of the trial, thereby reflecting everyday clinical practice.</p><p>The main weakness was that less than a half of the projected number of patients was included. The primary reason for this event was the introduction of thalidomide and bortezomib in the treatment strategies for initial therapy during the years 2007&#x02013;2010, resulting in a drop in patient accrual and a premature closing of the study. However, the fact that response rates and PFS for both treatment arms are in the same magnitude as in other published trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b5 b6 b7">4&#x02013;7</xref>) makes it probable that the results of this trial are reliable.</p><p>The time to other treatment off-protocol was similar for the two treatment groups, and we cannot answer the question of any probable advantage of giving thalidomide or bortezomib before the other. In this trial, there was a higher rate of neurotoxicity in the bortezomib group, thereby precluding crossover treatment with thalidomide. Recently, reports on single weekly bortezomib dosing and subcutaneous administration have shown a reduced rate of neurotoxicity without loss of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the patients in the Bort-Dex group had done better with once weekly bortezomib instead of twice weekly that was the standard dose at the time of the study.</p><p>The spectrum of toxicity was mainly as expected. The limited number of patients in the study makes it difficult to compare the treatment arms for toxicity. Nevertheless, some observations are worth noting. There was a high rate of neurotoxicity in the Bort-Dex group, which underlines the necessity of a high grade of observance and dose reductions even at minor signs of neurotoxicity. A high but similar rate of severe infections was found in both treatment groups. Dexamethasone, which may have contributed to this event, was given in an equivalent total dose in the two treatment groups. The increased risk of herpes virus reactivations during bortezomib treatment has been noted in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and underscores the recommendations of acyclovir prophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). As concerns psychiatric toxicity, we observed several depressive reactions in the Bort-Dex group. However, the significance of this finding is not clear because of the low number of patients. This complication has not been described in other reports.</p><p>An important observation is the high number of vascular adverse events in the Thal-Dex group: seven patients experienced venous thromboembolism and four cerebrovascular complications. All these events occurred in those 46 patients who were not on thromboprophylactic medication. Three additional vascular events occurred during treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone after cross-over. The risk of venous thromboembolism is well recognized since several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16 b17 b18">16&#x02013;18</xref>), whereas the risk of arterial obstruction has been observed more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19 b20 b21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). The results of this study support the recommendation that anticoagulant prophylaxis should be given when the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone is used for relapsed or refractory myeloma as well as for initial therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to what is ordinarily seen in the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), the quality-of-life analysis did not reveal any improvement over time for either treatment group. The reasons for this could be that treatment in relapsing patients is initiated before the patient has as severe symptoms as in newly diagnosed disease and that the response rate is lower than for initial treatment. In the interpretation of QoL results, a score difference of 6&#x02013;17 points or more is regarded as clinically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In this study, a difference of 10 was seen for fatigue, suggesting possible clinical importance albeit not reaching the statistical significance level of 0.01. For sleep disturbances, the score increment in the Bort-Dex group and the difference compared to the Thal-Dex group was both statistically significant and clinically important. The reason for the increase in sleep disturbances is not clear but may be related to neurotoxicity-dependent paresthesia and pains.</p><p>The value of prognostic factors is well established in newly diagnosed myeloma in which ISS stage and cytogenetics are used both for characterizing patients in clinical trials and for discussion of prognosis and choice of treatment for the individual patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In this trial, we found that serum &#x003b2;-2-microglobulin also had prognostic importance in the relapse setting. Therefore, &#x003b2;-2-microglobulin can also be used for prognostic purposes in relapsed and refractory patients.</p><p>In conclusion, low-dose thalidomide (50&#x02013;100 mg daily), in combination with dexamethasone, seems to have an efficacy that is comparable with that of bortezomib and dexamethasone in melphalan refractory myeloma. In clinical practice, most patients will receive both drugs, one after the other. For the majority of patients, in the absence of differences in efficacy, the choice of initial treatment should be based on the differences in toxicity, QoL aspects, and other patient-related factors. For a patient with advanced disease with threatening complications, when a rapid response is desirable, bortezomib may be the preferred drug. For both drugs, measures should be taken to prevent evitable toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Authorship</title><p>MH, <bold>&#x000d8;</bold>H, LMK, NG, and PTP designed the study, participated in patient enrollment and data acquisition and interpretation, and wrote the article.
