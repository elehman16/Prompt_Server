Training consisted of cycling 3 times weekly for 35&#x0200a;minutes (combination of strength, high-intensity interval, and low-intensity aerobic) at home for 24 weeks. Patients in CG also performed an identical training program (CTG) after 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) measured every 6 weeks. The principal secondary outcomes were maximal quadriceps strength (MVC) and local quadriceps endurance every 12 weeks. Other outcome measures included maximal aerobic power (MAP) and experienced fatigue every 6 weeks, 6-minute walking distance every 12 weeks, and muscle characteristics from vastus lateralis biopsies taken pre- and postintervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>The compliance rate was 91% in TG.

There is also a lack of long-term studies on FSHD and exercise, specifically long-term exercise effects on muscle and patient autonomy and whether regular exercise can realistically be integrated into patients&#x02019; daily lives.</p><p>Therefore, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a 24-week adapted home-based exercise training program designed to be compatible with FSHD patients&#x02019; daily professional, social, and familial activities. We hypothesized that the program, combining high-intensity, low-intensity aerobic and strength exercises, would improve aerobic capacity, muscle characteristics (i.e., histological, chemical) and function (i.e., strength, fatigue, endurance), and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>A 24-week multicenter randomized controlled trial with outcome assessments at 0 (T0), 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18), and 24 (T24) weeks for training (TG) and control (CG) groups was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Visit 1 consisted of quadriceps neuromuscular function (i.e., strength, fatigability, endurance) assessment (QIF-test)<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> and 6-minute walking test. During visit 2, patients performed an incremental cycling test to task failure and completed questionnaires about perceived fatigue and quality of life. The same investigator performed muscle biopsies at both centers during visit 3 using the Weil&#x02013;Blakesley percutaneous conchotome technique.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Creatine kinase concentrations were measured before training at baseline and 24&#x0200a;hours after each functional evaluation session (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the nonrandomized trial, CG values at T24 were considered baseline for CTG. The randomized controlled trial interassessment period was 6 weeks and increased to 8 weeks in the nonrandomized trial to facilitate compliance over the additional 24 weeks.</p><p>Aside from the training program, patients in all groups were instructed not to change normal daily activities or habits. Training consisted of three 35-minute cycling sessions per week at home performed entirely on a stationary ergocycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Two combined sessions consisted of aerobic exercise at constant moderate intensity (60% of maximal aerobic power, MAP) followed by sets of near-maximal revolutions. Session 3 consisted of interval training (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The first 5 to 10 training sessions were supervised by an exercise physiologist experienced in training clinical populations at the patients&#x02019; homes. Every week, the exercise physiologist provided telephone support for 2 sessions and attended the third session to supervise it, assess heart rate recorded from each training session, verify training log completion, check equipment, and adjust the individualized exercise intensity based on either observed heart rate reduction with training or the new MAP from incremental cycling assessments.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Training sessions.

Both VO<sub>2</sub> peak and MAP were assessed using an incremental cycling test performed on a stationary bicycle (Monark Ergomedic, 839E, Vansbro, Sweden) with breath-by-breath gas analysis and electrocardiogram (Ergocard, Medisoft, Sorinnes, Belgium). Power output was increased every 2&#x0200a;minutes (10&#x02013;30&#x0200a;W increment) until task failure. VO<sub>2</sub> peak was considered as the oxygen consumption during the last 30 s before task failure and MAP as the power output of the last completed stage plus 25% of per stage increment for each additional 30 s completed. Before and 3&#x0200a;minutes after exercise termination, a 20-&#x003bc;L capillary blood sample was collected for lactate concentration determination.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Quadriceps neuromuscular function was assessed by the QIF test as previously developed and validated in FSHD patients by our group (typical error coefficient of variation of voluntary activation and evoked force responses &#x0003c; 8 and 10%, respectively; intraclass correlation coefficient &#x0003e; 0.85).<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Patients were seated in a custom chair with hips at 130&#x000b0; and knees at 90&#x000b0; and noncompliant straps securing the hips and chest. Force was measured via force transducer (SBB 200&#x0200a;kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan) connected by noncompliant strap to the ankle, sampled at 2000&#x0200a;Hz and analyzed using Labchart 8 software (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia). Torque was calculated as force measured by the force transducer multiplied by the length of the lever arm. The test consisted of stages of 10 intermittent submaximal isometric contractions (5-s on/5-s off) with neuromuscular evaluations before the QIF-test, immediately after each stage and immediately after task failure. The neuromuscular evaluation was composed of isometric maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) with femoral nerve magnetic stimuli delivered during MVCs and at rest. Magnetic stimulation (FNMS) was delivered via 2 Magstim 200 stimulators (Magstim, Whitland, UK) connected by Bistim module and a 45-mm figure-eight coil. Submaximal target torques started at 10% MVC for the first stage and increased by 10% MVC per stage until task failure. Target torque levels were identical for a given patient throughout the intervention (i.e., as a percentage of T0 MVC). Peak MVC and evoked torques in relaxed muscle and maximal voluntary activation were also calculated. In addition to pre-post changes for each test, data from the 10% to 40% MVC stages were analyzed because they were completed by all patients for all tests.</p><p>Participant adherence is reported as the percentage of scheduled training sessions completed.</p><p>Muscle damage 24&#x0200a;hours after neuromuscular and physiological assessments (incremental cycling, fatigue, and strength tests) was assessed from serum creatine kinase concentrations. All patients had serum creatine kinase analysis performed at their same local laboratory.</p><p>The 6-minute walking test to assess motor function consisted of walking as far as possible in 6&#x0200a;minutes and was conducted as previously described.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Quality of life and perceived fatigue were respectively evaluated by 2 questionnaires validated in French: the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Fatigue Severity Scale.

The main findings are that combined home-based strength and endurance training (i) increases VO<sub>2</sub> peak, MAP, and citrate synthase enzyme activity, (ii) increases muscle strength and endurance and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, (iii) improves motor function (walking speed), and (iv) reduces experienced fatigue. The training intervention did not alter general quality of life or muscle integrity (serum creatine kinase concentrations and muscle morphology). Together, these findings confirm our hypothesis that combined training is a well-tolerated, safe, and effective long-term method to induce functional gains without muscle damage in FSHD patients.</p><p>The present training program was more than twice the length of most previous FSHD training studies. Despite the longer duration, training adherence (&#x0003e;80%) was similar to shorter FSHD<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> and neuromuscular disease<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> studies. This contrasts a recent 16-week training intervention<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> where 39% of FSHD patients had unacceptable adherence, with travel time to the study site stated as 1 reason for lower adherence levels. In the present study, all sessions were closely supervised in person or by telephone. As training was performed at home, time constraints imposed by traditional rehabilitation programs at clinical centers were avoided. This result supports a therapeutic approach for FSHD patients based on closely supervised home-based training to promote patient participation.</p><p>A major concern was whether FSHD patients could perform long-term exercise training safely and without muscle damage. In TG, subjective ratings of perceived soreness and fatigue and serum creatine kinase concentrations remained unchanged during the intervention, consistent with observations that creatine kinase returned to baseline by 24&#x0200a;h following high-intensity cycling.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Serum creatine kinase results in the present study suggest an absence of muscle structure changes indicating that sarcolemmal integrity was not degraded with training. Thus, long-term exercise training appears to be a safe therapeutic method without muscle damage or adverse effects.</p><p>As expected, the VO<sub>2</sub> peak and MAP increased in both training groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). Improvements in the VO<sub>2</sub> peak were accompanied by greater muscle citrate synthase (+46%) and a near-significant increase in creatine kinase (+15%) activity in TG. Creatine kinase plays a key role in the regulation of aerobic metabolism<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> and citrate synthase and creatine kinase work together to meet the ATP requirements of contracting muscles. These results suggest improved oxidative phosphorylation with training. Interestingly, VO<sub>2</sub> peak and MAP improvements at T12 were greater than in most dystrophy studies and 12-week FSHD aerobic training interventions.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Another FSHD randomized controlled trial reported no aerobic power improvement after 16 weeks of aerobic training.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> One potential explanation for the comparatively large increase in aerobic capacity in the present study is initial patient fitness level; however, training type was likely crucial. High-intensity interval training induces greater improvements in aerobic power compared to continuous aerobic training.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In 3 previous FSHD studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> continuous aerobic training was used whereas our study combined continuous aerobic exercise with interval training. It can be hypothesized that high-intensity aerobic intervals are more effective in FSHD patients. Moreover, we observed improvements in VO<sub>2</sub> peak and MAP at T6 and further increases to 24 weeks. MAP increases after T12 underscore the potential for long-term continuous aerobic power improvements in FSHD. Thus, our study advances previous reports of short-term aerobic capacity improvements by demonstrating aerobic power can be improved beyond 3 months with combined aerobic and interval training. This has important practical consequences in designing training programs for FSHD patients.</p><p>Unlike previous FSHD studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> combined training improved maximal quadriceps strength (+14% at T24). Although some neuromuscular disease studies have shown strength gains after resistance training, it was unclear whether neural and/or muscle adaptation (e.g., hypertrophy) mechanisms underpinned this improvement. High maximal voluntary activation was observed in both TG and CG at baseline (&#x0223c;95%), confirming recent findings.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> It was thus unsurprising that training effects were not observed, suggesting strength gains were due to structural changes. This was confirmed by muscle biopsy analysis showing a 34% increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area at T24. Muscle hypertrophy has been reported to play a major role in strength enhancement.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup></p><p>Recently, lower quadriceps endurance was reported in FSHD patients compared to healthy controls.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Significant improvements in both TG and CTG were found for muscle endurance and motor function. As absolute QIF-test target torques were maintained throughout the 24-week intervention, muscle endurance improvement might be explained by concomitant improvements in aerobic capacity and quadriceps muscle strength. This is supported by the significant positive correlations between muscle endurance and both MAP and MVC. A positive relationship between quadriceps endurance and strength in FSHD patients has previously been demonstrated with both parameters positively correlated with functional parameters.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, another study reported mitochondrial disruption and oxidative stress are important causes of muscle weakness and functional muscle impairment in FSHD.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Thus, any intervention limiting mitochondrial impairment might be useful for maintaining muscle function. In the present study, increased VO<sub>2</sub> peak suggests possible activation of mitochondrial biogenesis since citrate synthase increased with training.</p><p>Beneficial changes were also observed for motor function (6-minute walking test) in both TG and CTG and these changes were positively correlated with changes in VO<sub>2</sub> peak, MVC, and muscle endurance, suggesting increases in both VO<sub>2</sub>peak and strength contribute to improved motor function. Subjective fatigue is a critical symptom for FSHD patients as it is directly associated with lower functional capacity and quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In agreement with another recent randomized controlled trial,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> the present study observed decreased subjective fatigue with training that was correlated with increases in VO<sub>2</sub> peak, MAP, MVC, muscle endurance, and 6-minute walking test distance and improvements in mental health (Short Form Health Survey). Meanwhile, quality of life scores (Short Form Health Survey) were unchanged, indicating that despite the progressive and incurable nature of FSHD and the load of the study, quality of life during the 24-week training intervention was maintained. This suggests the beneficial effects of a long-term training program on experienced fatigue impact motor function and quality of life in FSHD patients.</p><p>The main limit of this trial is patient number. However, analysis of the primary endpoint (VO<sub>2</sub> peak) from 16 patients showed larger than expected improvements in TG compared to CG, suggesting that the results are reliable and provide valid conclusions while encouraging further study.</p><p>This study demonstrates clinically relevant benefits of a long-term training program combining (low-intensity with high-intensity intervals) aerobic and strength training in FSHD patients. These benefits occurred without inducing muscle damage or adverse effects and in spite of the progressive nature of FSHD. Clinicians are thus encouraged to promote an active lifestyle based on regular home-based exercise compatible with patients&#x02019; daily professional and social activities as a therapeutic approach. Based on the time-course of adaptations, long-term exercise programs should be prescribed in order to optimize the training effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors sincerely acknowledge all FSHD patients for their participation.
