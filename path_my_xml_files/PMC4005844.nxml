Bronchiectasis airways are commonly colonized with bacterial species. Infections of the airways play important role in bronchiectasis exacerbations. The non-specific prevention of recurrent airway infections by immunostimulating agents has gained growing interest. OM-85, consisting of extracts of eight kinds of bacteria important in respiratory infections, could support the respiratory tract resistance to the pathogens. OM-85 has been shown to be a benefit by decreasing the risk of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in several perspective clinical trials. Exacerbation of bronchiectasis substantially contributes to a more rapid decline in lung function, reduced quality of life, and healthcare costs. In this context, we plan to conduct a clinical trial to investigate the PReventive effect of OM-85 on Bronchiectasis Exacerbation in Chinese patients (iPROBE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. A total of 244 patients with bronchiectasis, who have had at least one exacerbation of bronchiectasis in the previous year, will be included. The subjects will randomly receive two courses of 7 mg of OM-85 or a matching placebo. The treatment dose of OM-85 will be one daily capsule taken orally for 10 days each month for 3 consecutive months at the beginning of the study, followed by 3 months of no drug. This schedule will repeat until the patient has been seen for one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We will investigate whether long-term treatment with an oral immunostimulant (OM-85) could decrease exacerbations of bronchiectasis over a one-year period. We will also assess other relevant outcomes, including the rate of event-based exacerbation, lung function parameters, and total scores judged by the St George&#x02019;s respiratory questionnaire, Leicester cough questionnaire, and inflammatory index. We hope that this study will provide new information on the preventive effects of OM-85 on bronchiectasis exacerbations and will address a knowledge gap for this understudied disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01968421">NCT01968421</ext-link>) on 19 October 2013.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>OM-85</kwd><kwd>Bronchiectasis</kwd><kwd>Placebo</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary exacerbation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Bronchiectasis is a common, however, under-recognized chronic respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of bronchiectasis in adult populations worldwide is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the United States, an estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis in adults was 52 in every 100,000 people, and increased by 8.7% per year between 2000 and 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is pathologically characterized by an irreversible dilatation of the medium-sized bronchi as a result of airway injury due to recurrent or chronic inflammation and infection. Clinical features of bronchiectasis include chronic production of sputum (often mucopurulent or purulent in nature), persistent bacterial colonization, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and hemoptysis, with breathlessness characterized by mild to moderate airflow obstruction, lethargy, and reduced health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Bronchiectatic airways are often colonized with bacterial species such as <italic>Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, it is believed that infections of the airways frequently play an important role in bronchiectasis exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Macrolide antibiotics with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties are increasingly prescribed for subjects with this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recently, Wong <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that azithromycin three times a week for six months significantly decreases the incidence of bronchiectasis exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, widespread use of long-acting macrolides, particularly azithromycin, risks significantly increasing population antimicrobial resistance as well as potential adverse drug effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Abnormalities in innate and adaptive immunity may cause a predisposition to bronchiectasis. Progressive lung damage in bronchiectasis results from a &#x02018;vicious cycle&#x02019; of recurrent bacterial infection and a deregulated inflammatory response. This indicates the failure of the host defenses that have evolved to maintain the sterility of the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The non-specific prevention of recurrent airway infections by immunostimulating agents has gained growing scientific interest over the past 40 years and is increasingly applied in different clinical situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>OM-85 has been known to support the respiratory tract resistance to pathogens. It consists of extracts of eight kinds of bacteria thought to be important in respiratory infections. OM-85 does not appear to be a bacterial vaccine but is thought to function by activating pulmonary macrophages, increasing the ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes, and changing the level of a variety of cytokines in the lung. The changes are thought to be indicative of an increased level of host defense against a wide variety of pathogens including both viruses and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, the protective effect of OM-85 implicates infection as an important player in the pathogenesis of exacerbations but does not indicate a specific class of infectious agent. As such, the potential benefit of OM-85 has been evaluated in a variety of chronic respiratory diseases. The best studied condition is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in which there have been several randomized controlled trials showing evidence of benefit by significantly reducing the incidence of exacerbations of COPD of all severities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Bronchiectasis exacerbations contribute substantially to rapid decline in lung function, reduced quality of life, and the medical costs. In patients with bronchiectasis, exacerbations occur with a frequency rate of 2.6 exacerbations annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial is to investigate the PReventive effect of OM-85 on Bronchiectasis Exacerbations in adult Chinese patients (iPROBE). The iPROBE project is generally based on the concept that the majority of patients with bronchiectasis often suffer from exacerbations.</p><sec><title>Aims of the study</title><p>This study is structured as a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) to study the effect of treatment with OM-85 in preventing acute exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the patients through the clinical trial.</bold> BV: broncho-vaxom (OM-85).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-15-150-1"/></fig><p>The primary goals of this study include two domains: (1) a reduction in the numbers of acute exacerbation; and (2) percentage of patients free of event-based exacerbation after one year.</p><p>The secondary efficacy variables are St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ); use of antibiotics and rapid-acting bronchodilator; lung function parameters: forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, immunoglobulin (Ig), total immunoglobulin E (TIgE), rheumatic factor (RF); C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum; and sputum bacteria clearance.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Overall design and patient selection</title><p>This RCT study will be performed at 10 major medical centers in Beijing, Shenyang, Tianjin, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, China.

It has been concluded that bronchiectasis remains a common and important cause of respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is an overlap between COPD and bronchiectasis, with a reported incidence of bronchiectasis in COPD being between 29% and 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There are also reports of a high prevalence in relatively isolated populations with poor access to health care and high rates of respiratory tract infection during childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, treatment of bronchiectasis is unsatisfactory with only very small trials being conducted, and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs. Immunomodulation agents such as low-dose macrolides have also been shown to have some efficacy, although more data are needed to advocate their long-term usage. Some studies have shown that chronic azithromycin treatment increases the development of macrolide-resistant organisms such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, azithromycin could also predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to the development of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, there is new evidence that the combination of azithromycin and tobramycin, through the alteration of intracellular antibacterial activity, may lead to even worse bacteriological outcomes. However, recent evidence has shown that azithromycin may antagonize inhaled tobramycin when targeting <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in cystic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Finally, an optimum duration of treatment with azithromycin is unclear.</p><p>A possible mechanism for bronchiectasis is a significant infection in early childhood which causes structural damage to the developing lung, allowing perpetual bacterial infection. Over time, persistent infection may then result in chronic inflammation, resulting in tissue damage and impaired mucociliary motility. This in turn leads to more infection, with a cycle of progressive inflammation, causing lung damage. Based on the &#x02018;vicious cycle&#x02019; model of the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis, persistent infection and a defect in host defense are two factors for the development of this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Some observations have shown that airway inflammation in bronchiectasis is due to a deregulated cytokine network independent of bacterial airway colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The iPROBE study is taking an approach that is distinct from other studies using antibiotics (oral, nebulized) to reduce the bacterial load and then decrease lower airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. OM-85 would be used to improve host defense and reduce airway inflammation, allowing airway healing and thus modifying the long-term course of disease. The rationale of the current study for choosing OM-85 includes its immunomodulatory property and potential activity based on common respiratory tract bacterial isolates. OM-85 is not a new drug, having apparently been available in Europe over 40 years with a very good safety profile. OM-85 is relatively easy to administer, so it is likely that patient compliance would be as good as it is with mucolytic therapy.</p><p>The variables (primary and secondary) chosen in this study reflect the nature of bronchiectasis, and have been widely adopted by the majority of clinical trials on bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this doubleblind RCT examining the prevention of OM-85 against exacerbation of bronchiectasis addresses a gap in the knowledge and treatment for this neglected disease. If the intervention is efficacious, it would provide long-term benefits for patients with bronchiectasis and improve the prognosis of this condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is scheduled to begin recruiting participants from May 2013, and expected to complete the enrollment by May 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JG: conception and design, data collection and analysis, manuscript writing and final approval of the manuscript.
