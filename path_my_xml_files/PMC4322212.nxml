<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A 1985 Canadian Health Promotion study reported that 6.1% of Canadian adults were found to be obese, as compared with 18.1% in 2010.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Some studies link obesity to higher levels of multiple chronic and mental health conditions and physical challenges.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;12</xref> Hence, it is important that adults and specifically older adults who are overweight or obese attempt to become fitter to avoid or delay the onset of chronic disease.</p><p>Obesity is a multifaceted problem that defies magic bullet solutions often touted by popular media reporting (eg, extreme or fad dieting, intensive exercise). Obesity is influenced by genetics, environment, behaviour and socioeconomic conditions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Recent research also suggests that geography and income impact obesity and physical activity levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> In particular, rural citizens tend to have higher levels of obesity than their urban counterparts.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This same trend is true for income, such that people with lower incomes present with higher obesity levels than those with higher income levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In Canada, on average, rural citizens have lower incomes<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and high obesity rates related to physical inactivity.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Despite its complex aetiology, obesity can be treated. The most common treatment involves lifestyle changes such as improved nutrition and increased physical activity.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> Studies have demonstrated that, for example, cardiometabolic risk factors were reduced in a group of morbidly obese individuals after a 1&#x02005;year lifestyle intervention targeting nutrition and physical activity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In another study examining the effectiveness of an 18-month intervention focusing on exercise and goal setting, a group of sedentary, middle-aged women increased their participation in physical activity and improved their self-efficacy related to overcoming barriers and accomplishing goals.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> An analysis of the literature examining intervention programmes for overweight and obese people concluded that intervention programmes &#x0201c;...have potential in changing energy balance related lifestyle and anthropometric outcomes.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Research indicates that lifestyle intervention programmes can work<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> if the participants remain engaged long enough to complete the programming. It seems that psychological support as part of lifestyle intervention programmes is important to assist in weight management.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Research examining the effectiveness of lifestyle changing studies that included goal setting sessions, or sometimes also called group-mediated cognitive&#x02013;behavior interventions (GMCBI),<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> had better outcomes compared with those without GMCBI components.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;34</xref></p><p>Although primary care providers can prescribe lifestyle changes, such treatments have poor uptake.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Obese patients need guidance to learn and implement lifestyle changes. Primary care providers are often unable to provide this kind of complex, prolonged and intense treatment,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> whereas other professionals are uniquely trained for it. A Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) Certified Exercise Physiologist (CSEP-CEP) is certified to assess exercise capacity and prescribe appropriate physical activity and rehabilitative exercise programming to individuals with a variety of clinical conditions. Certification is achieved after completing a 4-year Bachelor's degree in exercise sciences from an accredited postsecondary institution specialising in health-related and performance-related fitness applications, clinical experiences with various populations, and successful completion of the Society's written and practical examinations. CSEP Certified Personal Trainers (CSEP-CPT) have a minimum of 2&#x02005;years of university/college coursework in a specific core competency related to exercise and have successfully completed standard theory and practical examinations. The CSEP certifications are comparable to those provided in the USA by the American College of Sports Medicine. Registered Dietitians (RDs) must successfully complete a Bachelor's degree in food and nutrition from an accredited university, a 12-month supervised internship and a written national accreditation examination with Dietitians of Canada. These non-physician allied health professionals are uniquely trained to treat obesity and are excellent candidates to deliver lifestyle intervention programmes.</p><p>The primary objective of the current study was to examine how well a 6-month active intervention (based on physical activity and teaching nutritional knowledge) with content specialists, followed by a 6-month self-management period, would improve the health of obese participants. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that behavioural change strategies guided by principles of GMCBI would further improve health outcomes. Lastly, we examined whether the geographic location of the intervention (urban/rural) was related to the effectiveness of the health outcomes. We deliberately did not include a control group in this long and complex study. The literature indicates that when obese people do not engage in lifestyle modifications, they will not improve their health outcomes.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref> Hence, we felt that inclusion of a control group that received no intervention would provide little new information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and study population</title><p>The Healthy Eating, Active Living for Tomorrow's Health (HEALTH) study was conducted in the Eastern Canadian Province of New Brunswick. This province has one of the highest obesity rates in the country.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The multisite study was conducted in three separate locations, two rural and one urban, using four separate groups, two rural and two urban (the two urban groups were conducted in the same city). Owing to the long, cold and icy winters, the intervention took place indoors. The urban interventions took place in two public arenas equipped with a community room and a walking track. One of the two rural interventions took place in a local arena that did not have a walking track. The participants walked the perimeter of the rink and through the stands. The other rural community did not have an arena, so the programme was delivered in the local Legion Hall. Tables were used to create walking lanes.</p><p>Recruitment was achieved through media articles and advertisements in physicians&#x02019; offices and no incentives to patients or their physicians were provided. Potential participants were screened to assess if they fit the inclusion criteria: having a BMI between 30 and 40&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and being between 19 and 69&#x02005;years of age. To ensure that participants were physically able to complete the intervention, each participant obtained approval to participate from their physician by having their physician complete a Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination (PARmed-X). Once deemed suitable by their physician, participants were able to enrol in the study. A total of 146 participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 85% were female. Participants were enrolled into one of two urban or two rural community groups based on their community of residence. All four experimental groups received InI and Urban I and Rural II received InI and InII. The Urban I and Rural I groups began their programmes in January 2012 while the Urban II and Rural II groups started in September 2012. Intervention programme staff travelled to the communities to deliver the programme.</p><p>A priori sample size calculations indicated that a minimum of 25 participants were required for each group; we oversampled and allowed 35 participants in each group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref></sup> After recruitment, participants were required to sign a consent form in order to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>The active intervention (InI) consisted of 1&#x02005;h of physical activity three times a week over a 6-month period. The physical activity was supervised and delivered by a CSEP-CEP and CSEP-CPTs, as well as CSEP-CEP and CSEP-CPT students in training. Additionally, all participants took part in biweekly nutritional interventions delivered by an RD. The nutritional component was comprehensive, covering topics including learning how to read nutrition food labels; portion control; fat, sugar and sodium intake; meal planning; and grocery shopping, including a grocery store tour. Nested in the InI was a second intervention, InII, in which two of the four groups (one urban, one rural) received biweekly GMCBI sessions delivered by an exercise psychologist.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The assignment of the groups for GMCBI was in advance and based on the location of the intervention, and not based on the individual participants&#x02019; characteristics.</p><p>The GMCBI sessions were developed to equip participants with psychological skills to help address the barriers participants often perceive or create when attempting to make lifestyle changes, particularly around physical activity. The sessions provided participants with psychological skills to address these challenges while also leveraging the positive aspects of group dynamics to motivate and support new behaviours around nutrition and physical activity. The GMCBI sessions addressed group identity, teaching self-monitoring skills, individual and group goal-setting, developing strategies to overcoming barriers, sharing and support of group and individual goals, relapse prevention planning, cognitive regulation strategies, and transitory strategies for when the programme terminated.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>

<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>Each InI was followed by a 6-month self-management period. Each participant received a lifestyle resource book, but there was no contact between programme staff and participants for the duration of this phase. For the entire intervention, no control groups were used. Past research robustly indicates that when obese people do not engage in lifestyle changes, their health outcomes typically do not improve.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Instruments and assessment</title><p>Health measures such as blood pressure, resting heart rate, weight and height (BMI), waist circumference and mental health&#x02014;part of the SF-36v2 Health Survey&#x02014;were measured. We focused on the SF-36v2 Mental Health Summary Score because 26 participants scored at or below 42, which is the cut-off point for a positive first stage depression screening.</p><p>Additional measures related to physiological abilities, nutrition knowledge and behaviour were taken but will not be reported in this paper. We hypothesised that the intervention programme and the GMCBI would improve the health and well-being of the participants but geographic location (rural and urban) would have little impact on outcomes. Participants were measured at three different times: preintervention (T0) for initial measurements, after the 6-month active intervention (T1) and after the 6-month self-management phase (T2) for their final measurements. The measurements were conducted by the CPTs under the leadership of one CEP. The staff was the same throughout the entire programme, for all four sites, including all three measurement periods.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>For the primary objective of this study, the effectiveness of both components of the intervention (InI and the self-management period) was examined by conducting a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with time of measurement (T0, T1, and T2) as the independent variable and five dependent variables (resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI and the mental health component summary). This analysis was conducted using only the final 59 participants who completed all three measurement points.</p><p>Differences in the improvement of the health outcomes between the GMCBI and non-GMCBI groups were examined using a between-subject MANOVA. Difference scores were calculated between T0 and T1, T0 and T2, and T1 and T2 for resting heart rate, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI and the mental health component summary on the SF-36v2. These difference scores were then included as the dependent variables in the GMCBI MANOVA with GMCBI status as the independent variable. The comparison of the effectiveness of the intervention between geographic locations (urban/rural) was also examined using a between-subject MANOVA, with the health variables difference scores included as the dependent variables and geographic location (urban/rural) as the independent variable.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant profile</title><p>Over the four sites, a total of 146 participants enrolled in the study (85% women and 15% men).

Moreover, post-hoc comparisons revealed that the difference in mental health scores between the urban and rural groups were only significant between T1 and T2, suggesting that rural participants were able to maintain their mental health better during the self-management phase than their urban counterparts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006650TB6">table 6</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014006650TB6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Means and SDs for the health outcomes difference scores between urban and rural groups (N=59)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Change in health outcomes</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Urban group<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Rural group<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Resting heart rate (bpm)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;5.13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.91</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;5.04</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.71</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.96</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;8.15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.67</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.22</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.60</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Systolic blood pressure (mm&#x02005;Hg)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.88</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.27</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;8.44</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.87</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;6.56</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;11.63</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.41</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.69</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.19</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.81</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.35</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.78</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.72</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.83</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.61</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.27</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.45</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.04</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Waist circumference (cm)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.85</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;6.29</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;3.06</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.47</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2.15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.31</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.06</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.47</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">Mental health component summary</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;3.85</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.27</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.92</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.39</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;2.41</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.65</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.85</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.36</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;D3*</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1.43</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.89</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.92</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.12</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>D1=T1&#x02013;T0, D2=T2&#x02013;T0;

The dropout rate, or therapy incompliance, was high but consistent with other similar programmes.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> In fact, research suggests a lack of compliance with even less demanding therapies, such as taking oral medications for hypertension.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Poor compliance with medical therapy is considered common, and may significantly impact outcomes of chronic disease issues requiring serious attention.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p><p>On the basis of our study results, it is evident that the GMCBI sessions are an important component of any lifestyle therapy as participants adhered to the intervention longer than did those who did not receive GMCBI. While both groups most likely experienced many of the same challenges, the GMCBI sessions dealt directly with these challenges and helped people persevere. By discussing challenges directly, participants may have indirectly eliminated the bank of acceptable rationalisations for their non-participation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In addition, the GMCBI groups were also able to maintain their reduced waist circumference better than the non-GMCBI group during the self-management period.</p><p>Nevertheless, to make a programme like this sustainable in the community, dropout is a serious concern. Although all participants appeared motivated, many were not <italic>yet</italic> ready to commit to making lifestyle changes. However, among those who completed the intervention, the sense of camaraderie and support that developed was important in their continuation on the path of lifestyle changes. This is consistent with the teaching of GMCBI.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Community programmes may need to accept that participants may need to join lifestyle change programmes several times before they successfully complete staying in a programme, akin to what often happens in smoking cessation programmes.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>In general, the question of whether participants resided in rural or urban communities did not have an impact on the health outcomes, with the exception that rural participants scored more favourably on the mental health component summary of the SF-36v2. This is somewhat surprising considering that the rural participants had lower incomes and less education. Although income and education may impact health, the sample size was too small to examine the socioeconomic background and its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, there was no difference in BMI between the urban and rural groups before, during and after the intervention as is often reported, even though the rural participants had less education and lower incomes. They had slightly higher levels of self-reported diagnosed chronic disease, and a greater incidence of smoking, but lower levels of scoring positive for depression on the SF-36v2. Therefore, this study has demonstrated that rural participants should be offered lifestyle change programmes as often as urban participants, despite the fact that many rural communities lack &#x02018;proper&#x02019; exercise facilities.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In fact, this study shows that significant health improvements can be made using existing community space such as a meeting hall or community centre and little equipment so long as knowledgeable exercise and nutritional staff are available to implement and lead the programme. During the self-management phase, participants did not make additional gains and some trended towards their preintervention state, suggesting that even after 6&#x02005;months of intensive regular contact with programme staff the participants had not fully adopted new lifestyle behaviours. This is consistent with other studies and suggests that obese adults may benefit from programming that continues contact in some form for an extended period.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>The challenges of community-based programming/limitations</title><p>This intervention was conducted in a real-world environment and sought to strike a balance between scientific control and allowing the intervention to unfold as it would in any community circumstance. Every attempt was made to ensure that the intervention was consistent between the four sites despite physical differences in facilities (walking track vs no walking track). The realities of conducting an intensive prolonged community-based intervention include but are not limited to cancelling sessions due to snowstorms, bad roads and changing seasonal weather. Although these issues are difficult to quantify, they play a significant role in delivering an intervention in a community setting. The January and September start date of the intervention for the groups may have had an impact on the attrition, although both periods covered a substantial part of the winter months, traditionally a time in New Brunswick when people reduce outdoor activities. Initially, we wanted to focus on class I and II obese people for health and safety reasons; however, in the end, we did include 13% of participants who had a slightly higher BMI than 40&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> because of the numbers we needed to have enrolled in each site.</p><p>This study relied on self-referred or physician-referred participants, with the majority of participants being female and having a BMI between 30 and 42&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, thus introducing selection bias. The intervention used premeasure and postmeasure and did not use a control group. The potential lack of experimental control was at least partially overcome by using experienced, well-trained staff and objective measures that can be reliably obtained under differing field conditions. Despite these limitations, this study embodies the direct translation of laboratory and clinical-based best practices for treating obesity through increased physical activity, nutritional education and counselling and allows for evaluation of their efficacy in a real-world setting.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Future directions</title><p>We learnt that a 6-month intervention is not long enough. Considering that, on average, participants were able to attend three quarters of the sessions, it seems that a longer intervention would be more beneficial. More work needs to be conducted to ensure adherence to lifestyle interventions for people who are already motivated to make changes, to reduce dropout.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Primary healthcare providers should use other trained certified professionals to assist in the treatment of obesity in utilising non-pharmaceutical lifestyle changes in their own communities. Simple physical activity group programmes led by CSEP-CEPs or CSEP-CPTs and nutritional group education programmes led by RDs should become an extended part of the primary healthcare community. GMCBI appears to be particularly effective in helping obese patients achieve success in overcoming the barriers that lie between them and their participation in healthy lifestyle activities. Programmes need to be designed in such a way as to allow obese patients to make several attempts at making lifestyle changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e184" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006650.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e185" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006650.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BM and SAR were the principal investigators on the grants and they have played a significant role in all aspects of the project, including data analysis and writing of the manuscript.
