Acupressure is one of the most popular non-pharmacologic methods used to reduce fatigue in other settings. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on reducing fatigue among children with ALL compared with a placebo treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 120 hospitalized school-aged children with ALL, 24 h after chemotherapy, they were randomly divided into experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 60) and placebo groups (<italic>n</italic> = 60). Intensity of fatigue was rated using the Visual Analog Scale. The intervention (finger acupressure) was applied on ST36 (true points) in the experimental group and on LI12 (sham points) in the placebo group. We evaluated the symptoms of fatigue intensity immediately and 1 h after intervention. Fatigue was also measured 24 h after intervention by Fatigue Scale-Child (FS-C). Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16.0 using descriptive statistics, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, and Chi-square and Fisher exact tests.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Significant differences were observed between the two groups in the intensity of fatigue 1 h after intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Therefore, acupressure could be recommended as an effective, non-pharmacologic method for some CRF control. Applying one time acupressure did not have a long-term effect.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acupressure</kwd><kwd>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common cancers in children and adolescents and accounts for 75&#x02013;80% of childhood leukemia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] According to a research done in 2011, there were 1.9 billion children forming 27% of the world population,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and about 20&#x02013;50 million children and adolescents are diagnosed with leukemia every year.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] With the improvement in cancer treatment, children with leukemia have an enhanced survival rate nowadays. However, this has increased the number and severity of side effects and unpleasant symptoms, for instance, fatigue, pain, mucositis, nutritional concerns, nausea, and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Fatigue is a pervasive, distressing, and weakening symptom that has an extreme negative impact on daily activity, involvement in social activities, maintenance of interpersonal relationships, quality of life, and personal well-being.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Unlike other cancer symptoms that may disappear when the treatment is completed, fatigue has a persistent and lasting effect on children and adolescents undergoing cancer treatment.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Pediatric patients with ALL who require chemotherapy often report the symptom of fatigue as one of the most prevalent illness-related effects that they experience during treatment.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Fatigue is a side effect of chemotherapy and is experienced by the affected children, so it has to be managed by pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In studies on adults, fatigue has been reported as a multidimensional symptom including physical, psychological, and emotional aspects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In two longitudinal studies in which pediatric oncology patients rated 10 treatment-related symptoms for symptom distress, fatigue was rated as the most distressing and a common clinical problem during cancer treatment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Fatigue is reported to be more upsetting and troublesome for performing daily activities than, for example, cancer-related pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>About 40% of cancer patients may experience fatigue even years after they complete treatment.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Various complementary and alternative therapies are often used to manage the side effects and symptoms from cancer treatments, including fatigue.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Some preliminary evidence indicates that acupressure (the non-invasive form of acupuncture) was helpful in relieving fatigue in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients attending a pulmonary rehabilitation program.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Moreover, acupressure and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation were found effective in relieving fatigue, sleep problems, and depression in a sample of 106 patients undergoing hemodialysis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, a strong placebo effect was noted in the study, as the sham acupressure group also improved significantly. Recently, a Phase II uncontrolled trial (<italic>N</italic> = 37) of acupuncture treatment in cancer patients at least 3 weeks after chemotherapy found that acupuncture improved fatigue by 31.1%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In another study, one cohort received twice-weekly acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and another cohort received treatment once a week for 6 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 12), but the difference in the two schedules of treatment was minimal.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] However, the non-invasive form of acupuncture, acupressure, has received little attention in oncology, although it has been in use in some places for more than 2000 years. Acupressure involves using pressure instead of needles applied to the same points, but is safer, less expensive, and patients can easily learn to apply pressure on their own. Acupressure is a technique derived from acupuncture, a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Acupressure involves pressure with fingers or bands on the body's acupoints and is simple to perform, painless, inexpensive, and effective.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The practice of acupressure is derived from a philosophy of balance and unity between the universe, living beings, and energy flow. Chernyak and Sessler reported that any imbalance, disruption, or energy flow blockage within the body can cause disease or pain. The aim of acupoint stimulation is to return the body to a harmonized, balanced condition.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] During acupressure, physical force is applied to acupuncture points by hand, elbow, or with various devices, in an attempt to treat disease and reduce symptoms. Acupressure has demonstrated optimistic effects on sleep quality,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] sleep quantity,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and depression[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in cancer patients and other chronically ill populations. Pilot clinical trials have also demonstrated that acupressure and acupuncture can significantly reduce persistent cancer fatigue by as much as 38%.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The Joksamly or ST36 located at 4-finger breadths below the knee depression lateral to the tibia [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>ST36 (Joksamly)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-545-g001"/></fig><p>Although in many Western countries cancer-related fatigue in both adults and children has received attention as an important issue and has been studied widely, unfortunately, it has not received enough attention in comparison with pain, nausea, and vomiting management by healthcare professionals and researchers in Iran. No studies could be identified on whether cancer-related fatigue is a common tolerable or distressing symptom among Iranian pediatric oncology patients nor have the coping mechanisms for dealing with the unique fatigue syndrome among these children been methodically studied.</p><p>Patients with cancer and their families may not report fatigue to clinicians because they might think fatigue or being &#x0201c;tired&#x0201d; is a predictable cancer-related symptom, and that they must tolerate and deal with fatigue and reduce their expectations for symptom relief. Consequently, cancer-related fatigue is persistently ignored, under-diagnosed, and not treated in Iran.</p><p>The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of acupressure in the relief of cancer related fatigue (CRF) in pediatric cancer patients after they undergo chemotherapy. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effect of acupressure on CRF in school-aged children being treated for ALL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, wherein 120 children with ALL between the ages of 8 and 12 were recruited, and they were randomly divided into experimental and placebo groups. After completing a demographic form, baseline intensity of fatigue was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before the intervention. Ethical considerations, such as informed consent and confidentiality, were adequately addressed, and approval of a Research and Ethics Committee was obtained. Also, providing the research results for both experimental and placebo groups was considered and the researcher's email address was available for both groups to be informed of the results.</p><p>On the second day of chemotherapy, the intervention (finger acupressure) was applied for 3 min on ST36 (true points) in the experimental group and on LI12 (sham points) in the placebo group.</p><p>Given that in the present study patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy were selected, who also suffered from cancer-related fatigue, applying acupressure on various acupoints could be frustrating for the patients. Regarding ethical considerations in this research and according to the results of a previous study that was performed to relieve cancer-related fatigue, ST36 was chosen as the acupressure point and LI12 as the sham point. LI12 is not associated with energy in the TCM and was also used as the sham point in a previous study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, applying acupressure on one point is easy to learn for patients and their family members. Thus, patients and their family members can do this intervention at home to get relieved of cancer-related fatigue.</p><p>We evaluated fatigue intensity using VAS immediately and 1 h after the intervention. Fatigue was again measured 24 h after the intervention by the instrument of Fatigue Scale-Child (FS-C). Routine care was administered to both the groups.</p><p>Patients were recruited from an oncology unit of two pediatric educational hospitals in Tehran.

The patient indicates fatigue intensity by moving a pointer on the device, yielding a score measured by the pointer location. Patients were familiarized with the VAS device on the first day of hospitalization. The FS-C is a 10-item, self-report instrument that measures cancer-related fatigue and provides a fatigue intensity score. Each item has a 5-point Likert-type format; total scale intensity ratings range from 0 (no fatigue symptoms) to 50 (highest possible fatigue score). The 10-item version of the FS-C achieved a Cronbach alpha of 0.76, whereas the standard FS-C achieved a Cronbach alpha of 0.81. The 10-item FS-C consists of items that discriminate between children who have high cancer-related fatigue and those who do not.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>On the second day of chemotherapy, patients in the experimental group received 3 min finger acupressure on point ST36, a point traditionally used for &#x0201c;energy,&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] located below the knee in the anterior border of tibia.

They also promised to keep the confidentiality for other participants. Verbal assent from children and adolescents was required for study participation, while the consent forms were signed by their parents. At the end of the study and for ethical reasons, all patients in the sham acupressure group were contacted, presented with the findings of the study, and taught how to locate and press the more effective points.

The mean and Standard Deviation of the ages of both groups was identical. To ensure homogeneity between the groups, subjects in the experimental and placebo groups were matched for age. Girls accounted for 31.7% and boys formed 68.3% of the subjects.

Parents&#x02019; education and job was not significantly different between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Fatigue intensity before intervention was measured in both groups (3.73 &#x000b1; 2.26 in the experimental group and 4.25 &#x000b1; 2.44 in the placebo group); the results showed that they were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23).</p><p>Fatigue intensity of the two groups was compared immediately after intervention, but indicated no significant difference between them (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Acupressure on non-acupoints may produce some effects on fatigue. This may be the result of physiological and psychological effects of the massage itself.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Apparently, patients are aware that they are receiving treatment on acupoints or non-acupoint and are more likely to experience positive outcomes because of their expectations.</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Fatigue intensity over time in Sham Acupuncture group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-545-g008"/></table-wrap><p>Subjects in the sham acupressure group and acupressure group showed improvement in the VAS fatigue score immediately after intervention.

First, acupressure on sham points is sometimes genuinely effective. Second, subjects&#x02019; expectation about the efficacy of intervention may be affected simply by the presence of the researcher as a member of therapy team (Hawthorn effect).[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>On comparing the severity of fatigue in subjects 24 h post-intervention, most subjects in both the experimental group (68.3%) and the placebo group (73.3%) had fatigue scores of 10&#x02013;23, making it difficult to evaluate the residual effects after 24 h. To determine whether acupressure at shorter intervals and more frequently would reduce fatigue, more extensive study needs to be performed.
