Free radicals are produced in the body as byproducts of normal metabolism, as a result of exposure to radiation and some environmental pollutants. Because they are highly reactive, they can damage cellular components and are implicated in a variety of diseases. Free radicals are normally neutralized by efficient systems in the body that include the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and the nutrient-derived antioxidant small molecules (vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenes, flavonoids, glutathione, uric acid, and taurine). In healthy individuals, a delicate balance exists between free radicals and antioxidants. In some pathologic conditions such as diabetes and in critically ill patients, oxidative stress causes the level of antioxidants to fall below normal. Antioxidant supplements for such conditions are expected to be of benefit. As a preventive measure against certain diseases, the best approach for healthy individuals is to regularly consume an adequate amount of antioxidant-rich foods or herbs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p><italic>Rasayana Chikitsa</italic> (rejuvenation) is a unique branch of Ayurveda. The word &#x0201c;<italic>Rasayana</italic>&#x0201d; means the way for attaining excellent <italic>Rasadi Dhatus</italic>. The improved nutritional status and the better qualities of <italic>Dhatus</italic> lead to a series of secondary attributes of <italic>Rasayana</italic>, which bestow longevity, impart strength, <italic>Ojabala</italic>, etc.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Several medicinal plants have been described as <italic>Rasayanas</italic> in Ayurveda. <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> and <italic>Guduchi</italic> are the best of the <italic>Rasayanas</italic> described by <italic>Charaka</italic>. <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> (<italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (L.) Dunal.), is also known as Indian ginseng, or winter cherry. It has been an important herb in the Ayurvedic and indigenous medical systems for over 3000 years. The roots of the plant are categorized as <italic>Rasayanas</italic> and described to promote health and longevity by augmenting defenses against disease, arresting the ageing process, revitalizing the body in debilitated conditions and thus creating a sense of well-being.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The extract of <italic>W. somnifera</italic> has analgesic, mildly sedative, anti-inflammatory, and anabolic activities.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is useful in stress, strain, fatigue, skin diseases, diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and even during pregnancy without any side-effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p><italic>Guduchi</italic> (<italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (Thunb.)

The whole plant is used medicinally; however, the stem is approved for use in medicine as listed by the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This is due to higher alkaloid content in the stems than in the leaves.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives</title><p>

Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. So <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> and <italic>Guduchi</italic> may prove beneficial in combating these problems. <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> and <italic>Guduchi</italic> may be very helpful to maintain healthy body and mind in today's environmental condition and life style.
