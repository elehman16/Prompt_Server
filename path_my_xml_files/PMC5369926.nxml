Traditionally, residents gain experience with VE performance using a learning-by-doing approach under expert guidance. However, many vaginal operative deliveries are performed under stressful conditions due to maternal or fetal distress. This interferes with the efficiency of the teaching and learning process, since it is well-known that teaching and also learning performance is hampered by stress.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Also, it is ethically questionable to teach residents obstetric techniques with women as study objects, especially in the early stages of surgical training.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Low and high-fidelity training models and simulators have therefore been tested as potentially effective tools to enhance technical performance of medical staff.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Based on these data, standardized trainings on pelvic models may be potentially useful to prepare residents before they start to perform VEs on women. No data have been published regarding the validity of various training methods of VE (PUBMED search; 03-february-2016; search terms: vacuum extraction, training, model, randomized, pelvic trainer, vaginal operative delivery).</p><p>Since surgical and manual obstetric techniques such as hysteroscopy, resolution of a shoulder dystocia, and vaginal delivery for breech presentation can be effectively trained with dummy models,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> it is reasonable to assume that dummy trainings for VE may also be effective. Previously, our group has demonstrated that Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) in combination with pelvic dummy training can effectively improve the skills of obstetric trainees.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Specifically, we have shown in a randomized trial of 172 medical students that OSATS scores, performance time (PT), global effectiveness, and confidence (CON) for vaginal delivery for breech presentation were significantly higher after hands-on dummy training compared with demonstration alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> In another randomized trial, we randomized 203 probands to a 30-minute hands-on and a 30-minute demonstration training session, teaching a standardized shoulder dystocia management scheme on a pelvic training model. In this study, hands-on dummy training helped to achieve a significant improvement of shoulder dystocia management. OSATS scores, and also PT, global effectiveness, self-assessment (SA), and CON were significantly higher after hands-on dummy training.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>The present study adds to and builds on these previous OSATS studies in a number of ways. For example, in the present study, we have added participant characteristics such as handedness and sports activities to the multivariate analysis. Also, the OSATS procedure has been improved compared with the previous studies using a number of metric scores. Also, we used a standardized teaching video in the control group to avoid intra and interteacher variabilities observed in previous experiments. Lastly, we tested for constructive validity using a comparison of metric scores between experts and nonexperts.</p><p>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hands-on training of VE in a pelvic training model is more effective than expert video training with effectiveness defined as high OSATS scores. To test this hypothesis, we designed a randomized controlled trial measuring OSATS scores of students working through a defined VE management algorithm after a 30-minute hands-on training compared with a 30-minutes expert demonstration using a training video (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/XpZOHSq2-qA">https://youtu.be/XpZOHSq2-qA</ext-link>). To test for immediate and also delayed training effects, we tested students immediately after training (day 1) and retested them after 4 days (day 5).</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This randomized, single-blinded, single-center trial was carried out between May 2015 and October 2015 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany. The study participants were medical students who did an Obstetrics rotationship. This randomized study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (approval number: 4999&#x02013;14; Date of approval: 23.10.2014). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02468427). Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a CONSORT diagram of the students flow through the study. There were no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria other than informed consent and language barrier. For group assignment, we used a computer-generated randomization list, with a 1:1 allocation ratio without blocking. After randomization, students were allocated to different rooms, where the hands-on training and the video training session took place. The assessor (A.K.), who tested the students afterwards, was not present at the allocation, during the hands-on training, and during the video training session. Thus, the assessor was unaware of the participants&#x02019; group assignment. Students allocated to group 1 underwent a 30-minute video training session, watching an instruction video demonstrating all 40 items of VE as listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The video was produced by our Department and is in use for resident training purposes. In this 30-minute training video, 1 of the authors (C.T.) acts as an expert instructor, demonstrating all 40 steps of performing a VE according to the OSATS checklist used in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For the training video, we used the same pelvic training model also used in the study (Phantom; Schultes Medacta, Germany). Students allocated to group 2 underwent a 30-minute hands-on training session with the students performing all 40 items of VE as listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> at least once under expert instruction. The key maneuvers were as follows: vaginal digital examination, correct diagnosis of fetal lie, placement of the cup, episiotomy, correct traction, and delivery of the fetal head. Also, additional items such as establishing the indication for VE, information of a senior obstetrician and anesthesiologist, or addition of oxytocin and emptying of the bladder were part of the OSATS (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The pelvic model and the model of the baby used in this study allowed the correct determination of the fetal position. We used a soft cup, single use vacuum extractor (KIWI OmniCup Single Use VAC 6000&#x0200a;M; Clinical Innovations LLC, South Murray), licensed in the EU, for obstetric use.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of the students flow through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6355-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) checklist using 40 items to test proficiency in performing a vacuum extraction (VE) on a pelvic training model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6355-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Students did not take photographs or cell phone videos during the study procedures and they were not allowed to take written notes. After the training session, study participants were tested by an assessor (A.K.). Testing was repeated 4 days later. The assessor was unaware of the group assignment of the study participants. Testing of the study participants was performed using the OSATS technique. Specifically, the assessor calculated an OSATS score by adding points given for each of the 40 items on a task-specific check list (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), with 1 point for correctly performing each item and 0 point for not performing or not correctly performing the item. Thus, a higher score indicates greater proficiency. The secondary outcomes SA, CON, and global rating scale (GRS) were graded using a 5-scale Likert scale, with lower values denominating better performance.</p><p>We tested the construct validity of the OSATS setting used in this study by comparing predefined metric scores between 6 experts and the 137 medical students recruited for this study. The metric scores were: number of cup detachments, pressure applied by the vacuum extractor (measured in mm Hg using the pressure scale attached to the KIWI OmniCup vacuum extractor), PT, and OSATS scores. PT was defined as the time between the starting point (start of item 1 of the OSATS checklist) and the stop time (completion of item 40 of the OSATS checklist). The 6 experts were consultants and residents with at least 4 years of practical obstetrical experience. We defined construct validity as given, when all metric scores were different between the 2 groups favoring the experts.</p><p>We chose to randomize medical students, because they had no previous obstetrics training or practical obstetric experience. In contrast to residents with various degrees of expertise and personal experience, this fact makes students ideal study participants in the sense that they make training effects easily visible.</p><p>Categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, with a significance level of 0.05. We performed a multiple linear regression model to test whether the training effect, as measured by OSATS scores, was independent of potential confounders such as the students&#x02019; sex (male vs female) or handedness. In addition, we included regular sports activities as a potential confounder, based on the assumption that engagement in regular sports may select a population with expert manual and coordination skills. Values are given as medians or means. A power calculation demonstrated that, with a sample size of 137, the study has a power of &#x0003e;80% to detect an absolute 20% difference in OSATS scores at a significance level of 0.05 using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. An OSATS score difference of 20%, that is, a median score difference of 4, range 0 to 8, was estimated to be achievable by hands-on training and to be clinically relevant based on previous OSATS training trials.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> We used the statistical software SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS 11.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>We randomized 137 students.

Specifically, the metric scores were different between the experts (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) and the nonexperts (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;137), all favoring the expert group (number of cup detachments [0 vs 2, respectively], pressure applied by the vacuum extractor [0.78&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.04 vs 0.76&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.07&#x0200a;mm Hg, respectively], PT [33.83&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;10.57 vs 43.68&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;15.09&#x0200a;seconds, respectively], and OSATS scores [37.83&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.75 vs 30.50&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;10.79, respectively]).</p></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we found that structured hands-on training on a pelvic dummy is more effective than a teaching video regarding OSATS scores for technical achievement, and also CON and procedural speed when performing a delivery by VE. In a multivariate linear regression model, group assignment was an independent predictor of OSATS scores. Based on these results, hands-on training helps to achieve a significant improvement of VE management skills compared with expert video demonstration, with the effect persisting for at least 5 days. Based on these results, we conclude that hands-on training is superior to expert video demonstration and should be recommended for teaching residents how to perform VE on a pelvic model.</p><p>Surgical simulators and pelvic training models have been described as useful tools for residents and advanced physicians for the training of surgical skills.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, no data are available regarding the effectiveness of dummy trainings for VE delivery (PUBMED search; 03-february-2016; search terms: vaginal breech, training, model, randomized, pelvic trainer, vaginal breech management). The present study is the first controlled trial establishing the superiority of hands-on training over expert video demonstration in a frontal teaching setting. The results of our trial are in line with previous studies on shoulder dystocia or vaginal breech delivery trainings.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Specifically, hands-on training of shoulder dystocia management using a pelvic training model improved technical performance in a previously published randomized trial.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In this trial, students achieved significantly higher performance scores, had higher CON, and were quicker to complete the necessary steps after hands-on training compared with expert demonstration. The data of our actual trial show similar results demonstrating that hands-on training improves technical skills, in this case, performing a VE in a pelvic training model. Another randomized trial also demonstrated the superiority of hands-on training over expert demonstration regarding the management of a vaginal breech delivery.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Thus, our data and the data of others support the use of training models and simulators in clinical practice in general and for the training of obstetric interventions in particular. In addition, the present study also looked at additional participant characteristics such as handedness and sports activities, and included a number of metric scores to test for constructive validity.</p><p>In the expert demonstration group, we used a training video instead of a live expert demonstrator. This approach was chosen to standardize the frontal teaching experience and to avoid variations in the quality of the expert demonstration based on intraindividual variations in daily performance or interindividual variations due to changing experts. Moreover, the training video is in practical use at our Department and has consistently demonstrated its practical usefulness. On the contrary, we cannot rule out that live experts may have achieved better results.</p><p>Hands-on simulator training programs are time-consuming. Therefore, it is important to document their effectiveness in prospective randomized trials. Based on the results of our trial, we support the implementation of hands-on simulator training schemes into medical staff training programs.</p><p>Regular trainings for the management of obstetric complications such as breech presentation, shoulder dystocia, and vaginal operative delivery are recommended at least on a yearly basis for both novices and experts to acquire and maintain manual skills.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, the exact means of training are unknown. Therefore, our study may help to design specific training plans by using the checklist described in our study and OSATS-scoring to judge the trainees&#x02019; performance. Our data indicate that technical proficiency in the management of VE can be objectively measured by OSATS. We found that OSATS had constructive validity differentiating between the performances of experts and novices.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, we cannot report period. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the training effect may disappear over time. However, the beneficial effect of hands-on training was still visible after 4 days in our study, suggesting the presence of a delayed training effect after hands-on training. Based on the lack of longer follow-up data in our study, we cannot rule out that additional trainings may be necessary to achieve durable results in the long term.</p><p>Loss to follow-up was considerable in both groups between days 1 and 5 of the study. We have not used systematic measures of evaluation to find out the reasons for nonadherence. Therefore, we cannot comment on the reasons why study students decided not to participate in the testing on day 5. On the contrary, the number of students lost to follow-up did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups. Therefore, a bias of the day 5 study results due to group-specific self-selection of study participants is unlikely.</p><p>The internal validity of our study is high, because all participants were medical students without prior experience, thus forming a homogenous population. On the contrary, the performance of medical students may be representative of young residents, but may not necessarily translate to older Obstetrics and Gynecology residents and other staff.</p><p>In our study, we assessed training performance, which may not be consistent with the performance in a real clinical situation. Our study suggests, but does not prove, that better VE performance on a model will also result in better performance in women. This assumption is supported by literature demonstrating improved real-life performance of shoulder dystocia management, and also laparoscopic surgery after simulator training.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Lastly, not all OSATS items used in our study may be the standard of care of VE in other institutions.</p><p>In summary, the data collected in this prospective, randomized study provide level I evidence that hands-on training helps to achieve a significant improvement of VE performance over expert demonstration in a pelvic training model. These data support the incorporation of hands-on training and OSATS for teaching and training of VE into educational curriculums.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hands-on training is superior to video demonstration for teaching VE on a pelvic model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We acknowledge support by the DFG Open Access Publication Funds of the Ruhr-Universit&#x000e4;t Bochum.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CON = confidence, GRS = global rating scale, OSATS = Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills, PT = performance time, SA = self-assessment, VE = vacuum extraction.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Author contributions: Z.H. made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the study, to the analysis and interpretation of data, and to writing the article, and gave final approval of the version to be published.
