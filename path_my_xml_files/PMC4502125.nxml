A no. 10 K-file was inserted in the root canal, and the length was noted at which the tip of the file was just visible at the apex. One mm was subtracted from this length and was used as the working length. The roots were instrumented to a no. 40 K-file and shaped using the step-back technique. Gates glidden drills (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were used to enlarge the middle and coronal portions of the root canals. Irrigation of the root canals was done using 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (Vishal Dentocare, India) and 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Canalarge, Ammdent, India), followed by final irrigation with saline (Axaline, India). Following instrumentation, the canals were dried with absorbent paper points (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland), and were divided into four experimental groups and two control groups.</p><p>Group A: (<italic>n</italic> = 10) cold lateral Gutta-percha compaction, followed by immediate post space preparation.</p><p>Group B: (<italic>n</italic> = 10) 8 mm MTA apical plug as obturation, followed by removal of 4 mm MTA for post space preparation.</p><p>Group C: (<italic>n</italic> = 10) 4 mm MTA apical plug only, followed by delayed post space preparation.</p><p>Positive control: (<italic>n</italic> = 10) did not receive any filling material after instrumentation.</p><p>Negative control: (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were not instrumented, but were completely sealed with cyanoacrylate glue (Pidilite, India) and fingernail varnish at the apical portion.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group A: Cold lateral compaction followed by post space preparation</title><p>Canals were obturated with Gutta-percha and AH plus sealer (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) using the lateral compaction technique. After completion of the canal obturation, post space was prepared immediately using Peeso reamers (Mani Inc., Japan) sequentially in a contra-angled handpiece running at 4000 rpm until 4 mm root canal filling was left. The remaining root canal filling was then vertically compacted using a cold plugger. A radiograph was taken to confirm the adequacy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Group B: Mineral trioxide aggregate obturation followed by post space preparation</title><p>White ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) was mixed as recommended by the manufacturer. The MTA was compacted in increments using no. 3 and no. 4 endodontic finger pluggers (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland). An apical plug of 1-2 mm was first placed and checked radiographically to ensure optimal positioning. Further increments were similarly added under light hand pressure and the canals were obturated with 8 mm of MTA in the orthograde manner. Standard radiographs were taken to evaluate the quality of the obturation. Moist cotton pellet was placed over the MTA filling to facilitate setting of the material.</p><p>Each specimen was placed into a moistened oasis (Oasis Choice, India) for 24 h. The cotton pellet was then removed, and setting of the material was confirmed with an endodontic probe. Subsequently, 4 mm of MTA was removed, using a high-speed long shank diamond round no. 2 bur (Mani Inc., Japan) and water coolant spray, simulating post space preparation. The bur was placed on the surface of the MTA for 1 s, followed by irrigation with saline and drying with an air syringe. The process was repeated until an apical plug of 4 mm MTA retained in the canals and was confirmed radiographically.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Group C: 4 mm mineral trioxide aggregate apical plug only</title><p>All the teeth in this experimental group received an apical plug of 4 mm white ProRoot MTA, similar to the method described for Group C. Delayed post space preparation was done till the MTA apical plug using Peeso reamers.</p><p>All specimens were placed in an incubator (Accumax, India) at 37&#x000b0;C for 7 days, for the materials to set. Later the external surfaces of all the specimens, except 2 mm of the apical area were coated with two layers of nail varnish to ensure seal. The teeth in the negative control group were completely coated with nail varnish and cyanoacrylate. All specimens from the four experimental groups and the two control groups were subjected to microleakage analysis using bacterial leakage model.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Bacterial leakage model</title><p>The apparatus used to evaluate microbial leakage [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] was modified from the apparatus previously described by Siqueira <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Gomes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> MTCC 439 (Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India) was used for the bacterial leakage test and the strain was sub-cultured weekly. The apparatus was designed so that there would be a single pathway between the upper chamber (bacterial reservoir) and the lower chamber (brain heart infusion [BHI] broth), which would allow access only through the root canal.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Diagrammatic representation and photograph of the dual-chamber model used to assess bacterial leakage</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-18-297-g001"/></fig><p>Polyethylene tubes with rubber stoppers were modified for use. 1 mm diameter circular entry was made through the center of each rubber stopper using a high speed air rotor handpiece into which the tooth was inserted in such a way that only the apical end was in the BHI broth in the polyethylene tube. The tips of 5 ml disposable plastic syringes were cut and modified to adapt to the outer surface of the stoppers so as to create a chamber around the coronal end of the tooth.</p><p>The components of the bacterial leakage model were subjected to ethylene oxide sterilization and then assembled under laminar flow hood. Two layers of cyanoacrylate glue were applied to the interface between the tooth and the stopper to avoid direct bacterial penetration into the broth.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Each assembly was labeled and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 days in order to confirm the sterility of the assembly. Once the samples were deemed sterile, the upper chamber of the split-model was filled with 500 &#x003bc;L aliquots of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. After every 7 days, this BHI inoculated with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was replaced with a new 500 &#x003bc;L aliquots.</p><p>The whole apparatus was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. Over the experimental period of 120 days, the lower chamber was examined daily for the presence of turbidity, which indicated that bacteria had penetrated through the residual filling in the root canals and had reached the broth. When the turbidity of the BHI was observed, bacterial confirmation was carried out by gram staining. The number of leaking samples for each group at different time intervals were observed and noted. The absence of turbidity in the BHI medium indicated no bacterial leakage.

The teeth indicated for post and core often result in the disturbance of the apical seal during post space preparation, irrespective of the method chosen for Gutta-percha removal.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Thus, the quest for the ideal root canal filling material for teeth indicated for post and core is still debated.</p><p>Mineral trioxide aggregate has not been tested conclusively for use as a root canal filling material in teeth requiring post and core. This study was thus aimed at assessing whether MTA can provide an adequate apical seal in teeth indicated for post and core. The positive control group helped to test the hypothesis that when the leakage occurred from the upper chamber to the lower chamber, it caused turbidity of the medium. Conversely, the negative control group confirmed that the test apparatus was efficient and that the BHI broth in the lower chamber was not in contact with any environmental contamination due to improper seals.</p><p>Boutsioukis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] evaluated the use of ultrasonic tips and rotary GT files for removal of set MTA and concluded that both these techniques are inefficient for removing the set MTA from the root canals. Chemical solvents such as 2% carbonic acid and 10% citric acid have also been proposed for the dissolution of MTA.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, it is difficult to control the depth of penetration of these liquid chemical agents manually. Therefore, for the controlled removal of MTA in this study, long shank rotary diamond points no. 2 were used. In a study conducted by Jalalzadeh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the removal of MTA was achieved efficiently by using long shank rotary diamond points. However, no research is available in the literature that demonstrates an optimum technique for safe removal of MTA for post and core and, therefore, further research is warranted in this field. The risk of root perforation must be considered when selecting the most appropriate instrument for MTA removal. In this study, a diamond bur was used because the teeth were decoronated and teeth with relatively straight roots had been selected. Alternatively, surgical length small round burs, end cutting burs, LN burs (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland) and Mueller burs (Meisinger, USA) could also be proposed for MTA removal.</p><p>The use of organic dyes has been one of the oldest and most popular techniques for microleakage assessment.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, the use of bacteria as tracers most closely approximates clinical conditions in terms of leakage,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] because it uses a biological marker.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Furthermore, the root canal fillings are very susceptible to leakage when attacked coronally by saliva and micro-organisms.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Therefore, coronal bacterial microleakage was the method chosen in this study.</p><p>As per the results of this study, all the samples of the lateral compaction and immediate post space preparation group (Group A) exhibited leakage in a short time, which correlated with the results of other similar studies.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Five samples of Group B (MTA obturation, followed by post space preparation) and six samples of Group C (4 mm MTA apical plug only) did not exhibit leakage. This is also in conjunction with the results of a study by Khademi and Shekarchizadeh,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in which only 4 out of 15 samples filled with MTA showed bacterial leakage after 120 days.</p><p>The current study exhibited results with minimum differences between Groups B and C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.87) but, performed better than the Gutta-percha Group A, in terms of the number of samples that did not leak, as well as the mean days at which turbidity was observed. These results are also supportive to previous studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] demonstrating similar superiority of MTA over Gutta-percha in terms of sealing ability and therefore preventing bacterial influx.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The methodology adapted in this study could help clinicians address cases of badly mutilated coronal tooth structure, requiring post and core restorations, in teeth, which have been previously obturated with MTA. Hence within the scope of this study, it can be concluded that, MTA exhibits superior sealing ability even after the removal of set MTA for the post space preparation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of Interest:</bold> None
