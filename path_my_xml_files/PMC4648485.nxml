Nonetheless, evidence remains equivocal, as several studies have reported no effect on exercise theoretically limited by muscle acidosis [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has recently been suggested that the way in which intervention studies are analysed (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. using mean differences between groups or trials) does not account for the potentially high variation within individuals thus compromising the magnitude of effect of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, repeat administration of the experimental treatment in the same set of individuals allows quantification of individual responses and determination of the consistency of these responses [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in addition to standard analyses.</p><p>The relationship between dose and the degree of blood alkalosis following SB ingestion has long been suggested to be weak [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the large variability in individual blood pH and bicarbonate responses to supplementation may result in the purported mechanism underlying a potential ergogenic effect of SB not always being present in all individuals which may have contributed to the inconsistent exercise results reported. Saunders et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] recently showed a large variability in the exercise response following SB ingestion. Furthermore, improvements in high-intensity cycling capacity were shown only when individuals experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort were removed from the analyses, although GI discomfort could not explain a lack of improvement in all individuals. Importantly, the majority of studies have investigated the effect of SB during a solitary trial and not during multiple trials at the same intensity to determine group and individual consistencies in blood and exercise responses.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the consistency in blood responses and high-intensity cycling capacity following an identical dose of SB supplementation over repeated trials using the same individuals and exercise protocol. It was hypothesised that SB supplementation would consistently increase blood bicarbonate and pH while subsequent exercise responses would be more variable with individuals not always improving their exercise capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen recreationally active males (mean &#x000b1; SD; age 25 &#x000b1; 4 y, body mass 76.0 &#x000b1; 7.3 kg, height 1.77 &#x000b1; 0.05 m, maximum cycling output [W<sub>max</sub>] 270 &#x000b1; 29 W) volunteered and gave their written informed consent to participate in this study.

There were two preliminary trials, which comprised of an incremental cycling test to exhaustion to determine W<sub>max</sub>, followed by a familiarisation trial of the high-intensity cycling capacity test to exhaustion at 110% of W<sub>max</sub> (CCT<sub>110%</sub>). Participants then completed six randomised, repeated measures, counterbalanced and double-blind trials following the ingestion of 0.3 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>BM of either SB on four occasions or calcium carbonate placebo (PL) on two occasions. This was attained through the random drawing of lots containing all fifteen possible trial orders; this process was performed by an individual not involved in any of the data collection. Thereafter, we classified SB1 as the first SB trial performed by participants in their own designation, SB2 as the second SB trial performed by participants and so forth. Similarly, PL1 was classified as the first PL trial performed by participants and PL2 as the second PL trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Design</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Preliminary testing</title><p>Each participant performed a graded cycle capacity test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur, Germany) to determine W<sub>max</sub>.

Exercise was initiated at 100 W, and increased by 6 W every 15 s (ramp rate of 24 W&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>) until participants reached volitional exhaustion. The last completed stage plus the fraction of time spent in the final non-completed stage multiplied by 6 W was defined as an individual&#x02019;s W<sub>max</sub>.</p><p>All participants performed a familiarisation of the CCT<sub>110%</sub> to minimise any learning effect during the main trials. A 5 min cycling warm up was performed at 100 W followed by a 3 min period of self-selected stretching. Due to the intense nature of the exercise, each participant&#x02019;s CCT<sub>110%</sub> was incremented over the first 30 s, which corresponded to 80% W<sub>max</sub> during the first 15 s, 95% W<sub>max</sub> over the second 15 s followed by 110% W<sub>max</sub> until volitional exhaustion. Participants pedalled at a self-selected pedal cadence (range 70&#x02013;110 rev&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup> across participants) and were required to maintain this cadence throughout the entire test. Verbal encouragement was given throughout. Volitional exhaustion was deemed to have occurred when participants dropped below 60 rev&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup> for over 3 consecutive seconds, at which point they were instructed to stop pedalling. TWD (kJ) was recorded as the outcome measures for all tests. The CCT<sub>110%</sub> is reliable within recreationally active individuals following a single familiarisation session; the coefficient of variation (CV) for TWD has been shown to be 4.94% [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Main trials</title><p>Twenty-four hours prior to the main trials, participants were required to refrain from alcohol, caffeine and any strenuous exercise.

They were then required to ingest 0.3 g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>BM of SB or matching PL (calcium carbonate) alongside 500 ml water within a 10-minute period. All supplements were administered in unmarked gelatine capsules identical in size, colour and overall appearance, and participants were supervised to ensure 100% compliance.

Venous blood samples were taken at identical time points from the antecubital vein and analysed for blood pH, bicarbonate and base excess (Rapid Point 350, Siemens, Germany). The baseline, post-exercise and 5-min post-exercise CVs for pH, bicarbonate and base excess ranged from 0.07 &#x000b1; 0.03% to 2.77 &#x000b1; 2.2%.

Tukey tests were used for <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses to determine where any differences lay as indicated by the ANOVA. Exercise capacity data were analysed using a two-way ANOVA (supplement x trial) with repeated measures to determine any differences. Further analyses were performed to mimic an alternative design in which each SB trial had been performed as an independent study to highlight the variability and inconsistency in exercise responses. Since no differences in exercise capacity were seen between trials for PL, data from the two trials were pooled and the mean used as the PL exercise capacity value in order to perform these further individual analyses. Thereafter, t-tests were performed between all trials for TWD to mimic the results if each SB trial been an independent study. Statistical significance was accepted at p &#x02264; 0.05. In addition, magnitude based inferences [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were used to determine the practical significance of SB on the CCT<sub>110%</sub> using a spreadsheet to establish the likelihood of a meaningful effect on exercise capacity. The smallest worthwhile improvement in TWD was 1.27 kJ, which was equivalent to half the unbiased typical error associated with the measurement.

There were a number of non-responders as five individuals did not improve exercise capacity above the variation of the test in any trial, although the majority of individuals improved in some trials with SB and one improved in all. SB results in highly consistent blood responses in the same individuals, although this does not necessarily translate into an improved exercise capacity.</p><p>SB ingestion resulted in alkalosis prior to exercise in all participants; mean increases in blood bicarbonate of between +5.7 and +6.1 mmol&#x02219;L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> were similar in all trials and higher than the average increases (+3.9 &#x000b1; 0.9 mmol&#x02219;L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) in the literature as shown by Carr et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in a meta-analysis. SB only failed to increase blood bicarbonate on one occasion in all trials and resultant increases in blood pH and base excess were also consistent in all SB trials. Therefore, pre-exercise blood parameters cannot explain a lack of an ergogenic effect, since these were always increased prior to exercise, suggesting the mechanism for an improved exercise capacity was in place prior to every trial. Since the absolute increases in blood pH, bicarbonate and base excess prior to exercise were extremely similar between all SB trials, it may be, therefore, that an individual cannot always make full use of this blood alkalosis and enhanced buffering capacity. We speculate that this may be due to a variability in monocarboxylate (MCT) transporter protein activity following SB supplementation and the rate at which H<sup>+</sup> is removed from the working cell. Future research should establish the activity profile of MCT1 and MCT4 following SB ingestion and the consistency thereof.</p><p>Repeated-bout high-intensity activity has been shown to be highly susceptible to improvements with SB [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143086.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with evidence to suggest that multiple bouts of supra-maximal exercise results in increased muscle acidosis compared to continuous supra-maximal exercise [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nonetheless, the CCT<sub>110%</sub> has been suggested to be a highly sensitive test to increases in buffering capacity since similar improvements were consistently shown following increases in muscle buffering capacity achieved via &#x003b2;-alanine supplementation in recreationally active participants [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143086.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; importantly, exercise improvements in these studies were shown in almost all individuals. Despite this, CCT<sub>110%</sub> was only improved in one out of four trials following SB supplementation. Individual analysis revealed that five individuals did not improve exercise capacity in a single trial following SB supplementation. This is the first study to suggest some individuals may be consistent non-responders to SB although all participants were improved in at least one trial when improvements above the CV were disregarded. Additionally, only one individual in our study improved above the variation in every trial with SB, while the majority of the remaining individuals improved in some, but not all, trials. The results of this study highlight the difficulty in interpreting results from a solitary trial following SB since it appears that almost no individual consistently improves following supplementation despite prior alkalosis.</p><p>In this study we performed standard statistical analyses to determine the effect of supplementation on exercise capacity and the mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures showed no effect of SB compared to PL. Thus, additional analyses were performed to investigate group and individual responses during the repeated trials. The various data analyses techniques performed in this study further support the difficulty in reporting on the results from a single trial, since ANOVA revealed no effect during any trial. However, if only a solitary SB trial had been performed and routine analyses employed (t-tests), then SB1, SB2 and SB3 would not have resulted in a beneficial effect while SB4 would be in support of an ergogenic effect. Additionally, magnitude based inferences support the results of the independent t-test with respect to SB4. These data support the claims of Hecksteden et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that variability in responses may compromise the magnitude of effect of an intervention. Additional analyses suggest that some individuals are consistent non-responders to SB while others respond positively only occasionally, further highlighting the difficulty in interpreting only grouped means from a single trial since subsequent exercise responses following SB supplementation appear to be inconsistent. The present study provides data to support the necessity in employing multiple trials to determine the effect of SB supplementation on exercise due to the variability and inconsistency in exercise responses. Furthermore, supplementing conventional statistics and analysing both group and individual responses appear necessary in order to draw appropriate conclusions from subsequent results.</p><p>Similar to Saunders et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the associated side effects of SB supplementation appeared to affect exercise responses in at least one trial (SB1). A threshold of &#x02265;6 in any individual score was considered sufficient to influence exercise, and data were subsequently reanalysed following the exclusion of these PL and SB results. This resulted in a significant improvement in exercise capacity in SB1, which was previously not improved. The results give further support to the notion that associated side effects may cause SB supplementation to be ergolytic despite resulting in pre-exercise alkalosis. However, associated side effects appear to be inconsistent with discomfort reported across all trials. This means that trialling SB during training will likely not increase an individual&#x02019;s resistance to associated side effects. Therefore, a more chronic supplementation protocol may be merited to avoid the possibility of these side-effects hindering performance; supplementation over a period of several days has been shown to result in increased blood parameters even 48 hours after cessation [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], meaning acute supplementation immediately prior to competition is unnecessary.</p><p>The CCT<sub>110%</sub> has previously been shown to have a CV of ~5% for TWD using recreationally active males [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], indicating it to be a reliable exercise capacity test for untrained individuals. The CV between placebo trials in this study was slightly higher at 6.2%. However, this is likely due to the different study aims; this study investigated the ergogenic effect of a supplement, which may have contributed to an increased expectancy [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The CV for SB trials was 7.4% across all individuals; this is higher than the 2.1% shown with 2000 m rowing in well-trained rowers [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The discrepancy between these two studies may be due to the exercise protocol employed or the different sample populations [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although performance was not improved with SB in the study by Carr et al. [<xref rid="pone.0143086.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], trained individuals may be better able to consistently take advantage of an increased buffering capacity; the present study appears to indicate that recreationally active individuals are unable to consistently take advantage of an increased extracellular buffering capacity. Future research should investigate the effect of repeated SB trials with athletes who are likely to exhibit a lower CV for a chosen test.</p><p>In conclusion, the mechanism for improved exercise with SB was consistently in place prior to every trial, although this only translated into a likely improved exercise capacity on one occasion. These results suggest that SB may not always improve exercise in the same individual, meaning caution should be taken when interpreting the results from a single trial. In light of these data, practitioners should trial SB on multiple occasions in order to categorise individuals into non-responders and potential responders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143086.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143086.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143086.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Data file.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143086.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143086.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>pH, lactate, bicarbonate and base excess at Baseline, Pre-exercise, Post-exercise and 5-min post-exercise in all trials.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143086.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143086.s004"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Ethics application Portuguese.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143086.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143086.s005"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Ethics application English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143086.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the Laborat&#x000f3;rio de Determinantes Energ&#x000e9;ticos de Desempenho Esportivo (LADESP) for access to the cycle ergometer used in this study and the volunteers for their efforts.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0143086.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
