The other factors such as systolic pressure loss &#x0003c;80 mm/mercury, block level more than the fifth thoracic segment, the addition of materials such as vascular retractor, neostigmine, and opioids to the anesthetic agent are the most common factors that increase the chance of nausea and vomiting. Hypotension leads into brainstem ischemia, which results into the stimulation of the vomiting center in the brain stem. In addition, hypotension is related to bowels ischemia and the release of nausea-causing substances such as serotonin. Totally, in regional anesthesia, a single mechanism is not the reason for nausea and vomiting and multiple mechanisms are involved in the same time.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The process of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) have some side effects in common such as &#x0201c;pneumonia aspiration, dehydration, delay in discharge from the recovery room or hospital, electrolyte imbalance, increased postoperative hemorrhage, increased intracranial pressure.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Other study also mentions that PONV could lead to increasing heart rate and systematic blood pressure and the risk of myocardial ischemia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Gabapentin or Neurontin (commercially) is a structural analog of gamma amino butyric acid has multiple actions such as anticonvulsant, anti-nociceptive, and psychoactive.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Gabapentin are commonly used in various diseases such as chronic pain syndrome, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and diabetic neuropathy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is also effective against a vast spectrum of pains such as neuropathy pain, neuralgia, and acute preoperative pains.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The results of a recent study showed that 300 mg gabapentin 1 h before surgery will decrease nausea and vomiting and 600 mg gabapentin could decrease in nausea and vomiting severity. Therefore, gabapentin administration is recommended in laparoscopic cholecystectomy for controlling the nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moreover, other study revealed that gabapentin administration could decrease nausea and vomiting after abdominal hysterectomy and need to meperidine injection was reduced.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, in this study we attempt to use 600 mg gabapentin administration 1 h before caesarian surgery in order to decrease postoperative vomiting and nausea. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of gabapentin in preventing nausea and vomiting after spinal anesthesia in cesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Between 2009 and 2010, a total of 200 patients who were candidates for cesarean section and referred to our hospital were assessed to enter the study.

The study protocol was approved by Ethical Committee of the hospital.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 and 2, no cardiovascular, gastrointestinal middle ear, vertigo, motion diseases, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol consumption, no history of nausea and vomiting before the surgery and fever or the infection diseases. The candidate patients for this study have not been eating for about 6&#x02013;8 h before surgery and the surgery must be done under the spinal anesthesia. Moreover, only cesarean must be done on them except the other surgery on them (before) and the duration of anesthesia and bleeding must not be unusually very high. In addition, the quantity of hemoglobin must not be &#x0003c;10 mg/day and they did not receive the other drugs except antibiotics and sedative medicines until 6 h after surgery. In this study, the numeric scale visual analog scale (VAS) was used as a visual tool in order to measure the severity of nausea (rank 0&#x02013;10).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design and outcome assessment</title><p>For all patients, a combination of anesthesia and spinal anesthesia was used. At first, by the 1<sup>st</sup> researcher who was not involved in collecting data, gabapentin capsule, and placebo were given to the patients about 1 h before the surgery. By the 2<sup>nd</sup> researcher, the incidence of nausea, vomiting and their severity, according to the standard tool VAS during surgery and up to 4 h after surgery, were recorded in the recovery room and also in the related department in the page of information record.
