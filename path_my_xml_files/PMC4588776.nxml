Unlike dental caries and periodontal disease, it is one of the most painful and least successfully treated chronic problems of the teeth. It has been reported that 8-30%<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of the adult are affected by dentin hypersensitivity with the greatest incidence being documented between 20 and 40-year-old groups.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Most dentin hypersensitivity is a result of abrasion, attrition, erosion, abfraction, gingival recession, and improper brushing habits and the teeth most common affected are the canines and premolars.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Numerous theories have been put forth to explain the mechanism of hypersensitivity, which include the direct stimulation theory, odontoblastic transducer mechanism, gate control theory, and the hydrodynamic theory. The later is the most accepted and according to this rapid shift in the fluid flow within the dentinal tubules appears to be responsible for causing odontoblastic pain.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Several treatment methods have been tried to reduce dentinal hypersensitivity, ranging from home-use, over the counter products such as desensitizing mouthwashes, dentifrices or tray application forms to in-office application products such as varnishes, liners, restorative material, dentinal adhesives, iontophoresis procedures, and more recently, laser.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Among these desensitizing dentifrices have established themselves as principal agents in the routine management of hypersensitivity, owing to the fact they are widely available, cost-effective, simple to use and the habit of tooth brushing being almost universal.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Many of these dentifrices contain potassium nitrate,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> stannous fluoride,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and strontium chloride<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> as an active ingredient and have proven to be effective leading it to be a frequent choice among both patients and dentists for the treatment of sensitive teeth.</p><p>Recently, research into the use of the mineral components of the inorganic portion of the tooth structure (i.e., calcium and phosphate) has gained considerable attention<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and has inspired the preparation of hydroxyapatite (HAP) for occlusion of dentinal tubules.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Different forms of HAP have been tested in both <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> and have been found to effective in tubule occlusion.</p><p>However, particles of nano-HAP incorporated into dentifrices are the newer products available in the market. Since literature search revealed a paucity of studies conducted with this regard, the aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the effect of nano-HAP dentifrice with another standard product NovaMin, which has been widely used in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical trial. The protocols for the study were developed as per the guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials on dentinal hypersensitivity and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Prior to the start of the study patients were given both verbal and written information about the process and an appropriate signed informed consent form was obtained. The duration of the study was for 4 weeks.</p><p>This study was carried out on 36 patients (20 males and 16 females) between the age group of 18 and 60 years, visiting the outpatient department of Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, Chennai, during the period of March to July 2013.</p><p>Prior to the start of the study, ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee, Saveetha University. The participants for the study were selected according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: History of dentin hypersensitivity to hot or cold or sour stimuli, no history of any periodontal therapy in the past 1-year; and patient&#x02019;s willingness to participate in the study.</p><p>Patients with active cervical caries or attrited teeth with caries or chipped teeth; patients with history of chronic use of anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication and who have undergone periodontal surgery in the preceding 6 months; patients with any denture or bridge work that would interfere with the evaluation of hypersensitivity and pregnant and lactating women were all excluded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Evaluation of hypersensitivity</title><p>The reported hypersensitive teeth in the subjects were verified by light strokes of dental explorer along the cervical areas of all teeth present. This study was explained to the subjects and signed informed consent was obtained.</p><p>Sensitivity was measured using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) score, with the score of 0 being a no-pain response and a score of 10 being extreme pain or discomfort. The clinical examinations and sensitivity tests were carried out by a single examiner.</p><p>The enrolled patients were evaluated for three measures/tests of sensitivity; tactile test, air blast, and cold water. The adjacent teeth were isolated with cotton rolls before applying the stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Tactile examination</title><p>An explorer was gently run across the affected area, perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. The test was repeated thrice before scoring by using VAS and then the reading was noted.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Air blast test</title><p>For the air method, a blast of air at a pressure of 45-60 psi from a three-way dental syringe was directed toward the sensitive portion of the tooth perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth for a duration of 1 s at a distance of about 1 cm. The patient&#x02019;s response to the intensity of pain was recorded on a 10 cm VAS.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Cold water test</title><p>The cold water test was performed using 1 ml of freshly melted ice cold water, which was applied immediately to the buccal cervical region with the help of a disposable syringe (0.2 ml).<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>All the three tests were applied in the ascending order of discomfort, i.e., tactile test (least disturbing) then air blast test and at last cold water test (most disturbing).<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The stimuli were applied in the same order, at a time interval of 5 min each.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Dentifrices tested</title><p>Two toothpastes containing following two components respectively as an active ingredient were used:</p><p>

</p><p>After the collection of baseline data, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 18 subjects each. Each group was provided with one of the either dentifrices. The present study employed a double blinding procedure to eliminate subjective bias. The identity of each dentifrice was masked by providing it in plain tubes. Each patient was provided with an adult soft bristled toothbrush and was advised to apply the dentifrice in an amount equal to about half the length of the bristle head, were also instructed to brush for two minutes and no more than a total of 2 times/day. They were recalled at 4<sup>th</sup> week for measurement of tooth sensitivity.</p><p>Data was entered in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS software (version 18). For test, a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 is to be considered statistically significant.

There have been two basic approaches in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity, one is to seal and occlude the dentin tubules, thereby blocking the hydrodynamic mechanism; the other is to block neural transmission at the pulp level.</p><p>Most hypersensitive teeth are sensitive to more than one stimulus, and not all teeth respond to the same stimulus.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Based on the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Dentinal Hypersensitivity (1986)<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and American Dental Association, Council of Dental Therapeutics (1989),<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> three different stimuli-tactile, air, and cold water were used to assess hypersensitivity in this study.</p><p>The sensitivity level of this study was determined by translating the subjective feedback scale into objective data using VAS scale.
