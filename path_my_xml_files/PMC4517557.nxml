Self-management can be effective in improving a range of outcomes and is cost effective, but is underutilised as a treatment strategy. Supporting optimum self-management using digital technology shows promise, but how best to do this is not clear. We aimed to develop an evidence based, theory informed, online resource to support self-management in adults with asthma, called &#x02018;Living well with Asthma&#x02019;, as part of the RAISIN (Randomized Trial of an Asthma Internet Self-Management Intervention) study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We developed Living well with Asthma in two phases.</p><p>Phase 1: A low fidelity prototype (paper-based) version of the website was developed iteratively through input from a multidisciplinary expert panel, empirical evidence from the literature, and potential end users via focus groups (adults with asthma and practice nurses). Implementation and behaviour change theories informed this process.</p><p>Phase 2: The paper-based designs were converted to a website through an iterative user centred process. Adults with asthma (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) took part in think aloud studies, discussing the paper based version, then the web-based version. Participants considered contents, layout, and navigation. Development was agile using feedback from the think aloud sessions immediately to inform design and subsequent think aloud sessions. Think aloud transcripts were also thematically analysed, further informing resource development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The website asked users to aim to be symptom free. Key behaviours targeted to achieve this include: optimising medication use (including inhaler technique); attending primary care asthma reviews; using asthma action plans; increasing physical activity levels; and stopping smoking. The website had 11 sections, plus email reminders, which promoted these behaviours. Feedback on the contents of the resource was mainly positive with most changes focussing on clarification of language, order of pages and usability issues mainly relating to navigation difficulties.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our multifaceted approach to online intervention development underpinned by theory, using evidence from the literature, co-designed with end users and a multidisciplinary panel has resulted in a resource which end users find relevant to their needs and easy to use. Living well with Asthma is undergoing evaluation within a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12911-015-0177-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Adherence</kwd><kwd>E-health</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Complex intervention</kwd><kwd>Inhaled corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Behaviour change</kwd><kwd>Lifeguide</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is common, affecting 300 million people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing; an estimated additional 100 million people will have asthma by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite increasing costs associated with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], care remains suboptimal, with many patients tolerating symptoms and lifestyle limitations unnecessarily, due to suboptimal use of proven available therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Supporting optimum self-management by providing relevant self-management education including how to use an asthma action plan (AAP), regular health professional review, and optimal use of medications has been shown to have positive effects on a range of asthma outcomes such as improved quality of life, lower rates of healthcare contacts, and fewer days off work and school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Promoting self-management is a recommendation in worldwide asthma guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite this, self-management as a treatment strategy remains underused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Recently, new information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been proposed as a means to improve asthma self-management uptake. We conducted a meta-review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] which showed that online interactive resources to support self-management of asthma can be safe and effective at improving some outcomes such as markers of self-care, activity limitation, quality of life and medication use. However, interventions were poorly described and it was impossible to extract generalisable lessons about the key &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of interventions. This challenge has previously been recognised by Michie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] who in response have developed a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) which they propose researchers can use to describe interventions, in order to overcome the lack of a systematic way of determining the &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of a complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, development of online interventions has been resource intensive with each intervention requiring to be programmed individually by a team of programmers from scratch&#x02014;a barrier to internet based interventions being cost-effective when compared to face-to-face or paper alternatives. A team in Southampton who have recognised the increasing potential for delivering health care online have developed an open access software package called LifeGuide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. LifeGuide aims to allow researchers from a non-computer programming background to more easily and flexibly create and modify internet-delivered interventions. It has been used successfully in a number of health related interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A key design feature of LifeGuide is that it allows researchers to easily test parts of an intervention and immediately modify and improve it based on the findings, and to trial it in the development phase.</p><p>Here we describe the development and optimisation of the Living well with Asthma website which we developed using the LifeGuide open access software package guided by the updated MRC guidance for the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Living well with Asthma website is currently undergoing evaluation in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) called RAISIN (Randomized Trial of an Asthma Internet Self-Management Intervention) (ISRCTN 78556552) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To develop the Living Well with Asthma website we followed the steps outlined in the updated MRC guidance which recommends that intervention development should be systematic, include review of the evidence, be theory based, and incorporate feasibility or user testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this section we describe the two phases of work we undertook to incorporate these steps. Ethical approval was granted from the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (12/WS/0068), and all participants provided informed consent.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Phase 1: intervention planning</title><p>Phase 1 describes the process of developing a &#x02018;first draft&#x02019; of the website. This phase consisted of three main work packages (WP), all overseen by a multidisciplinary &#x02018;expert panel&#x02019; made up of 3 general practitioners, a respiratory physician, a health psychologist, a social scientist, and a human-computer-interaction researcher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Work package 1&#x02014;understanding the evidence &#x00026; incorporating theory (scoping review and expert panel)</title><p>Campbell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] describe 5 key tasks involved in defining and understanding the &#x02018;problem&#x02019; that your intervention is aiming to solve, namely: 1) defining and quantifying the problem; 2) identifying who is mostly likely to benefit; 3) understanding the pathways which contribute to the problem; 4) consideration of whether (and how) these pathways are amenable to change; 5) and attempting to quantify the potential for improvement. We did a brief scoping review of the literature and used the experience of our expert panel to work through these tasks. We identified a list of features that a resource should have, incorporating recommended behaviour change concepts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Work package 2&#x02014;getting user perspectives on a web resource (focus groups)</title><p>In order to investigate the plausibility of this list with potential end users we convened 2 focus groups, consisting in total of 9 adults with asthma (6 female, 3 male), and 4 practice nurses who undertake asthma reviews. Recruitment was undertaken using a range of sources: primary care, Asthma UK Research and Policy volunteers, Chest Heart Stroke Scotland volunteers and a secondary care asthma clinic. Adults aged 18 and over were eligible provided they had a diagnosis of asthma and could provide informed consent. There was no upper age limit on participation. Participants could agree to participate in a focus group, up to two think aloud studies (described in phase 2), or both. Focus groups were held at the Department of General Practice &#x00026; Primary Care, University of Glasgow, and were audio recorded and transcribed. We used the implementation theory Normalization Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to inform the topic guide for these focus groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This theory was used as it is being increasingly advocated as a means to understand implementation processes and enhance the implementability of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Discussion focused on the perceived barriers and facilitators to sustained use of an online resource to support self-management. This consideration of implementation issues at such as early stage is a key message from the MRC guidance. Our list of potential features derived from WP 1 was explored using questions generated from our topic guide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and we sought suggestions for additional features. The focus groups were transcribed and any statements which were barriers or facilitators to self-management were extracted, along with any suggestions for features to include in our website.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Focus group topic guide (NPT informed)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2015_177_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Work package 3&#x02014;developing a draft version of the website (expert panel)</title><p>Using information gathered from WP 1 and 2, the list of suggested features to include in the website was reviewed and refined iteratively. As low fidelity prototype pages were generated (initially using Microsoft Word or PowerPoint) (also referred to as draft pages) they were reviewed initially by those in the panel with a clinical background to ensure the content was factually correct. Subsequently the pages were shown to members of the expert panel with specific expertise in behaviour change theory to ensure maximum opportunity for promoting behaviour change was incorporated into each page or section, using the behaviour change concepts agreed on from WP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. From this a draft version of each potential webpage was finalised, ready for think aloud study evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Phase 2: iterative refinement of the resource contents of the website (think aloud studies and expert panel)</title><p>Draft pages developed at the end of Phase 1 were gradually translated into interactive webpages with input from potential end users in the form of think aloud studies, and review by the expert panel. While LifeGuide can be used by researchers with no computing science background, due to time constraints, a programmer transferred the majority of the draft pages into LifeGuide initially. Think aloud studies were undertaken by the first author at either the participant&#x02019;s home, or the Department of General Practice &#x00026; Primary Care, University of Glasgow, depending on individual participant preference. Participants were recruited from the same pool as the focus groups, and they could participate in a maximum of two think aloud studies. There were two waves of think aloud studies: the first 4 used draft webpages still on paper or PowerPoint slide, the latter 6 were undertaken completely using the prototype webpages on LifeGuide. Participants were asked to say whatever they thought or felt about what they were seeing, with prompts and questions used to elaborate on responses. The participants were then encouraged to voice any additional suggestions or opinions to improve the resource, for example what they liked and disliked, what was intuitive and what was not, and how they envisaged using such a website in real life in the future. The majority of the findings from the think aloud studies were acted upon immediately after the session by the researcher doing the think aloud studies, in order to progress the resource ready for the subsequent think aloud study. We also thematically analysed the transcriptions of the think aloud studies with the aim of providing information for further development of the resource following the pilot RCT. Thematic analysis was undertaken using a coding frame developed by DM. Both DM and SW independently coded the first 2 transcripts, and results compared, after which DM coded the remaining transcripts. Comments were noted to be either a positive comment, where the user liked or identified with what they saw, or a negative comment where the user disliked or disagreed with what they saw, or where the user suggested an improvement or alternative way of presenting the data. The final version of the Living well with Asthma website was formally mapped to Michie and colleagues latest BCT taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in order to describe which BCTs were present. Every page of the website was reviewed by the first author (DM), and where relevant a BCT was assigned. These were subsequently reviewed by SW. We did this to provide a reliable record of the content of this behaviour change intervention, and to confirm that we included a range of BCTs as planned.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This results section describes the key steps in our website development.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Phase 1: initial planning stages</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Work package 1&#x02014;understanding the evidence &#x00026; incorporating theory (scoping review and expert panel)</title><p>The planning stage focussed on the 5 key tasks outlined by Campbell et al.

The expert panel felt that evidence and personal experience suggested that use of diary tools was rarely sustained except by a few very motivated individuals. Instead regular prompts to think about current asthma symptoms based on the &#x02018;Royal College Physicians 3 Questions&#x02019; (RCP 3Q) screening tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was incorporated throughout the resource and in the automated emails. This asks the user about difficulty sleeping because of asthma, asthma symptoms during the day, and interference with usual activities. If users answer yes to even one question then further assessment of asthma control is indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Action plans work best when personalised to the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the IT requirements of a truly tailored action plan was considered beyond the scope of this project. Instead a section was dedicated to promoting the use of action plans, and encouraging individuals to visit their health professional to agree one if they didn&#x02019;t have one. Rather than a dedicated family and friends section the importance of positively involving family and friends was discussed in general terms.</p><p>By the end of Phase 1 we had developed paper based versions of the web pages ready for consideration by the expert panel and for use in think aloud studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Phase 2: iterative refinement of the resource contents of the website (think aloud studies and expert panel)</title><p>Eleven think aloud studies (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for participant details) were conducted although one study (TA 08) was not completed as the website was not compatible with her type of computer which converted website text into braille (BrailleNote).

It initially took the form of 6 pages users worked through with sideway steps for more information about different treatments.</td></tr><tr><td>Section changed to have:</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; its own homepage (i.e. spoke and wheel layout) which allowed users to go directly to a treatment type without having to work through potentially irrelevant pages.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; a visual representation of the asthma treatment ladder adapted from the BTS/Sign guidelines.</td></tr><tr><td>We were unable to meet requests to have pictures of individual inhalers.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">4 (21 pages)</td><td rowspan="4">Asthma Reviews</td><td>&#x02022; Focused on modifying the language used and simplifying messages.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Altering layout of both individual pages and order of pages.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Main message was to &#x0201c;aim for no symptoms&#x0201d; and this was very well received by users.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Included a quiz covering what put people at risk of attacks&#x02014;this was streamlined and made optional.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5 (5 pages)</td><td rowspan="2">Action Plans</td><td>&#x02022; Altered layout and clarity of wording, and quotes added to dilute the very factual nature of the information provided.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Added a template to a blank action plan that users could print out and take to their health professional.</td></tr><tr><td>6 (17 pages)</td><td>Physical Activity</td><td>&#x02022; Initially one generic section with the aim of promoting physical activity but was altered to become tailored to the individual&#x02019;s activity status.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">7 (18 pages)</td><td rowspan="3">Common concerns and queries</td><td>&#x02022; Originally had 8 concerns and queries, and a further 7 were added addressing topics originally not included as were felt to be covered elsewhere, or had seemed &#x02018;too basic&#x02019;.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Reviewing this section served as a reminder that people quickly forget (or have never been told) even basic information about their asthma, and that having it here for those who need it was essential.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Another major change was the wording of questions. One user commented that questions were just statements and didn&#x02019;t make it clear than scenarios were amenable to change. So for example &#x02018;I don&#x02019;t exercise because of my asthma&#x02019; was changed to &#x02018;I don&#x02019;t exercise because of my asthma. Could I?&#x02019;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">8 (5 pages)</td><td rowspan="2">Stress &#x00026; Anxiety</td><td>&#x02022; Received mainly positive feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Links to online resources aimed at reducing stress and anxiety (e.g. online CBT) added.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">9 (8 pages)</td><td rowspan="4">Take the 4&#x000a0;week Challenge</td><td>&#x02022; This section was specifically for users who had chosen option 1 or 2 during the &#x02018;My Asthma&#x02019; section.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Initially much confusion about the nature of the challenge with some users misunderstanding it completely. Thus pages were modified and more explanation added.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; Layout of pages were altered, in particular, to make it clear that there were 4 steps to work through, and it was made clearer how you were progressing through them (e.g. colour strip across the top, which illustrated progress).</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02022; One of the steps to the four week challenge was to anticipate barriers to taking preventer medication regularly and consider some solutions. Template barriers and solutions were provided, and these were added to by the think aloud participants.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Like to stop smoking?</td><td>&#x02022; This section was a link to an external site called &#x02018;StopAdvisor&#x02019;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and therefore not covered during the think aloud studies.</td></tr><tr><td>11 (1 page)</td><td>Useful info and links</td><td>&#x02022; Expanded during the think aloud to include more links to online mental health resources and information about the GP exercise referral scheme.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

We have been guided by the MRC Framework on developing and evaluating complex interventions, and as a result directed much effort to the key, yet often overlooked, planning stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We undertook recommended key tasks to guide our development methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, through: synthesis of empirical evidence, using expert knowledge and experience, and incorporating theoretical concepts with end user input, to produce an evidence based behaviour change website. Our evidence synthesis highlighted that self-management of asthma is an underused, yet proven, treatment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and that people with asthma frequently do not use therapies optimally, tolerate high levels of symptom burden, and do not attend asthma reviews or make use of asthma action plans. This underestimation of symptoms and overestimation of control is a barrier to making use of available therapies. Those who do recognise they are experiencing asthma symptoms often do not adhere to therapies, often due to perceived misunderstandings around medication side-effects, or lack of perceived benefits to using asthma action plans. This analysis provided us with pathways of how a behaviour change intervention might work, focussing on behaviour change concepts recommended in the literature we developed a list of features which a website should have. This list was iteratively modified with input from end users and an expert panel, until a draft of proposed web pages had been developed. These were then gradually converted to working interactive webpages and refined over 10 think aloud studies, to lead to the final website which is being evaluated in the RAISIN trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our BCT mapping exercise demonstrates that the resource makes use of multiple BCTs, a strategy which in some health domains has been associated with increased effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In particular we use goals and planning as a key behavioural technique, which has been shown to be efficacious in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths</title><p>This study followed recommended processes for developing complex evaluations, and was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team with a range of essential skills, knowledge and experience (including behaviour change theory and implementation theory). A key strength of this resource is in its co-design with potential end users, who had opportunity for input both at the early development planning stages in the form of focus groups, and also towards the end where their input via think aloud studies was invaluable in improving the usability of the resource, in line with the Person Based Approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The use of LifeGuide software allowed for a streamlined and iterative process of website development where the researcher taking the think aloud studies could modify the website directly following think aloud studies, or from feedback from the expert panel. Most computer programmers do not have a background in healthcare, and therefore removing the need to communicate user feedback to a programmer by using LifeGuide made the process far more efficient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p>In the focus groups we invited both practice nurses and adults with asthma which could be construed as a limitation. However there are advantages to bringing together a diverse group of participants and we felt this was the case here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This can maximise the exploration of different perspectives, which was pertinent here where differences in health professional and patient opinion is a recognised barrier to optimal uptake of self-management practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The adults with asthma participating in the focus groups and think aloud studies had more severe asthma and were on more treatments than typical primary care patients. This is almost certainly because of them being recruited through their participation in asthma advocacy organisations (Asthma UK). We managed this by tempering the suggestions and feedback from these end users with the practical experience of the respiratory physicians and GPs on the expert panel and the practice nurses present in the focus groups. In future studies concentrating recruitment to end users more typical of a primary care population would be worthwhile, although may be difficult.</p><p>The same researcher who developed the website, also undertook the think aloud studies. While this had benefits in terms of speed of modifying the resource, we were concerned that participants in the think aloud studies may not have felt comfortable criticising the resource openly in the presence of the person who was also developing it. In order to counter this it was explained that it was easy to make changes with the LifeGuide software and those critical comments were often the most helpful. Exploring the scope of this limitation by counting negative comments was useful, as the high proportion of negative comments or suggestions for improvements suggests that participants did feel comfortable being critical of the website.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Future considerations</title><p>The ultimate aim of following the updated MRC guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions is to reduce the number of interventions which are developed, but don&#x02019;t translate into everyday use, and avoiding costly large RCTs which due to unforeseen circumstances are unable to answer the research question posed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The iterative methods of development used here should minimise this risk, and the ongoing RAISIN pilot RCT should allow for meaningful estimates of effect sizes and recruitment and retention rates for any future full scale randomised controlled trial. A qualitative evaluation, involving participant interviews and using NPT to guide analysis, is embedded in the RAISIN trial and will provide rich data on the how the intervention can be improved and its future implementability in the real world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have developed a resource which our preliminary usability testing suggests is relevant and usable by its target audience. We have outlined the key steps undertaken which included synthesis of knowledge and experience from our expert panel, with a broad exploration of the literature, overarching use of appropriate theory (behaviour change and implementation) and also with input from potential stakeholders (adults with asthma and practice nurses) from an early planning stage. Such methods are rarely fully detailed in the literature and thus the description of this process should be of interest to the growing cadre of researchers developing digital interventions. This paper demonstrates how data from a wide range of sources can directly and practically influence the contents of such a self-management website.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12911_2015_177_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
