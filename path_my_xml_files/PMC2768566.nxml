This study, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II cell-delivered gene transfer clinical trial, was conducted in 74 HIV-1 infected adults who received a <italic>tat/vpr</italic> specific anti-HIV ribozyme (OZ1) or placebo delivered in autologous CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. There were no OZ1-related adverse events. There was no statistical difference in viral load between the OZ1 and placebo group at the primary end-point (average at weeks 47 and 48) but time weighted areas under the curve from weeks 40-48 and 40-100 were significantly lower in the OZ1 group. Throughout the 100 weeks, CD4+ lymphocyte counts were higher in the OZ1 group. This study provides the first indication that cell-delivered gene transfer is safe and biologically active in HIV patients and can be developed as a conventional therapeutic product.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly improved the prognosis of individuals infected with HIV-1, but is often associated with toxicities, adverse interactions with other drugs and the emergence of viral resistance<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.

Intention-to-treat (all infused participants; ITT) and per-protocol (all participants who entered the analytic treatment interruption; PP) populations were defined prior to data-base lock and unblinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Baseline participant demographics, HIV-1 history, were comparable (Table 1). The dose of G-CSF and the volume of the apheresis collection were similar for the two groups (data not shown). Both treatment groups received an equivalent dose of viable CD34+ cells/kg. The infused cell product in the OZ1 treatment group contained a mean of 54.0% OZ1 gene-marked cells, based on 1 vector copy per cell (Table 1). Data were obtained to week 100 unless participants were lost to follow-up beforehand. Participants in the OZ1 group are now enrolled in a separate long-term follow-up protocol which will continue for at least 15 years. To date, the longest follow-up period from the time of infusion of the first participant is 5 years.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OZ1 gene marking (DNA) and OZ1 expression (RNA)</title><p id="P7">OZ1 gene marking (DNA) and expression (RNA) were assessed to measure the frequency of gene containing cells and the production of active ribozyme, respectively. At week 4 post infusion, OZ1 DNA was detected in PBMC from 94% of the participants in the OZ1 treatment group. This percentage decreased to 12% of participants tested at week 48 and to 7% at week 100. Data from peripheral blood cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+ T cells; B cells; monocytes and granulocytes) showed a similar decline in the percentages over time. OZ1 DNA did not reach the quantifiable range of the assay in any blood cell sample at any time point. Limits of detection and quantification for OZ1 DNA were 0.01% and 0.38% of cells analysed, respectively.</p><p id="P8">OZ1 RNA was detected in PBMC (&#x02265; 1 copy/250ng RNA) in all participants in the OZ1 treatment group at week 1. At this time point, expression was quantifiable in five participants (370 to 600 copies/250 ng of total RNA); expression in the other participants was detectable but not quantifiable. OZ1 RNA was detected in 94% of these participants at week 4 and 29% at week 48 but not quantifiable in any sample. Of the 21 participants who remained off HAART beyond week 48 post infusion, OZ1 RNA was detected in 15 participants. At week 100, OZ1 RNA was detected in 5 out of 12 (42%) participants for whom RNA samples were available and who continued in the treatment interruption to week 100, versus 2 of 19 (11%) participants who had resumed HAART.

The number of participants with a TWAUC in the lowest quartile during weeks 40-100 was statistically greater in the OZ1 group (OZ1 n=12; 37.5%, Control n=5; 15.2%, p=0.04). The median times to reach 3, 4 and 5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml viral load during the analytic treatment interruption, in the per-protocol population, were greater in the OZ1 group. However, a statistically significant difference was demonstrated only for the time to reach to 4 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml viral load (Table 2).</p><p id="P11">During the analytic treatment interruption, 17 (45%) participants in the OZ1 group reinitiated HAART compared to 22 (61%) Control participants. For the participants in the Control group, the median time to re-initiation of HAART was 29.4 weeks (n=22, 61%), and for the OZ1 group it was greater than 60 weeks.

The relationship between viral load and CD4+ count was similar for both treatment groups. For the per-protocol population, the CD4+ lymphocyte counts (mean cells/&#x003bc;l and % of T lymphocytes) were 476 and 27% in the OZ1 group compared to 437 and 24% in the Control group at weeks 47/48 and, 490 and 28% (OZ1) and 441 and 25% (Control) at week 100. Analysis of the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, showed higher CD4 and correspondingly lower CD8 in the OZ1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-c</xref>). CD4+ lymphocyte recovery was also examined in participants who recommenced HAART. In both treatment groups, once HAART was recommenced, CD4 + T lymphocytes (percentage) increased towards the baseline to week 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). The median decrease in CD4+ T lymphocyte count from baseline at week 100 was approximately 100 cells/&#x003bc;l.</p><p id="P13">Exploratory analysis of the primary end point at weeks 47/48 was performed in the subset of participants who continued to display OZ1 expression in PBMC at any time point beyond week 48. The median plasma viral load in these OZ1 participants (log 3.81, 95% CI median 3.18-4.23; n=15) was significantly lower than in the Control participants (log 4.57, 95% CI median 4.31-4.83; n=33) (p=0.003). The median TWAUC from week 40-48 in these OZ1 participants (3.44 log copies/ml/day, n=15) was significantly lower than in the Control participants (3.93 log copies/ml/day, n=33) (p=0.03) as was the median TWAUC from week 40-100 (3.97 log copies/ml/day, n=15) in comparison to the Control group (4.53 log copies/ml/day, n=33) (p=0.005).

All 3 participants who experienced a serious adverse event were in the Control group. None of these serious adverse events was assessed as being related to G-CSF, leukapheresis, cell infusion or other study procedures. Most participants (99%) experienced at least one G-CSF associated adverse event such as musculoskeletal pain (92%) or headache (32%). Three participants, 2 of whom were in the OZ1 group, developed transient hepatomegaly associated with G-CSF administration; 69% and 77% of all participants had transient elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase respectively, again associated with G-CSF. One participant in the OZ1 group developed a grade 4 elevation of aspartate aminotransferase at week 40, however, it returned to within the normal range by week 48 of the study.</p><p id="P15">Six participants (OZ1 n=2; Control n=4) experienced asymptomatic grade 3 thrombocytopenia following apheresis. One of the OZ1 participants required a platelet transfusion. Three participants experienced thrombocytopenia associated with the first interruption of HAART. In all 3 cases, platelet counts returned to normal after recommencement of HAART. Three participants (OZ1 n=1; Control n=2) developed grade 3 neutropenia; two recovered to the normal range by the next visit. One participant had two episodes of grade 3 neutropenia (0.62 and 0.65 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>/&#x003bc;l), at week 20 and week 64 post-infusion after which time neutrophil counts returned to baseline levels. Severe adverse events associated with community acquired infections were reported in both groups (OZ1 n=2, 5.3%, Control n=3, 8.3%) and consisted of cases of influenza, oral herpes simplex and tonsillitis. Mild to moderate cases of oral candidiasis (total n=4) and oral hairy leukoplakia (total n=2) developed during periods of antiretroviral interruption equally in participants from both groups. CD4+ lymphocyte counts at the time of these events ranged from 342-467 cells/&#x003bc;l and 19-36% of T lymphocytes.</p><p id="P16">No predominant integration site (LAM-PCR) or replication competent retrovirus was detected at any time point. No hematopoietic cell clonal expansion or other event suggestive of insertional mutagenesis was observed. The OZ1 target sequence in the HIV-1 plasma RNA was assessed over time. Individual variation in nucleotide sequence was detected in 9 of 63 participants where sequence data was available from more than one visit (OZ1 n=5/35, 14.3%; Control n=4/28, 14.3%). None of these changes was a modification at the ribozyme recognition site to prevent cleavage, nor suggested the evolution of resistant virus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P17">The present study is the largest cell-delivered gene therapy trial conducted to dateand the only randomised controlled phase II study of a potential cell-delivered gene therapeutic. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not reached, HIV-1 viral loads were consistently lower in the OZ1 group for all analyses. Statistically significant differences were observed for the number of participants with less than 4 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml viral load at week 47/48, the per-protocol TWAUC week 40-48 and week 40-100, the number of participants in the lowest quartile of TWAUC week 40-100, and time to 4 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml viral load in the analytic treatment interruption. The impact of OZ1 on HIV-1 viral load is further supported by the correlation with OZ1 expression beyond week 48 and the correlation with CD34+ cell dose. The CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte count data were consistent with the HIV-1 viral load differences between the treatment groups. Target site sequencing showed no evidence for the development of resistance to OZ1 during this 100-week study, which could be due to the low percentage of gene-marked cells and/or the production of a less fit virus due to mutation(s) in the highly conserved region targeted by OZ1 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p id="P18">Mathematical modeling undertaken prior to this clinical study (manuscript submitted; GPS, GC Fanning, JLM, LAE, SMP, JMM) predicted that during the analytic treatment interruption, OZ1 recipients would experience an initial increase in HIV-1 viral load followed by the establishment of a lower set point. The model predicted that the establishment of OZ1 CD34+ cells in the bone marrow at 10-20% of total CD34+ cell population could reduce viral load by 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> in one year. In this phase II study, bone marrow aspiration was not performed because it is invasive and would present additional risk, particularly for the control participants; hence the percentage engraftment is not known. Based on the frequency of cells containing OZ1 (0.01% to 0.38%) in the peripheral blood, it can be inferred that engraftment was substantially lower than 10-20%. Previous studies have also shown that in the absence of strong selective pressure, peripheral blood reconstitution with gene-containing cells is limited <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. Given the engraftment and gene expression results in this study, the biological effect of OZ1 was greater than predicted by the modelling. Candidate mechanisms for this additional effect include an impact of OZ1 on cell to cell transmission in the lymphatic system; compartmentalisation such that the number of OZ1-containing cells in the peripheral blood is not representative of the survival of OZ1-containing cells in sequestered discrete foci (eg the bone marrow and lymphatic system, in particular the GALT);and protection of particular cell sub-populations such as antigen-presenting cells (including dendritic cells and macrophages) or HIV-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes</p><p id="P19">Improvements in mobilisation, CD34+ cell collection and transduction compared to the phase I study<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> resulted in a mean transduced CD34+ cell dose of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/kg and an increase in the frequency of OZ1-containing cells in the peripheral blood (approximate 2 log<sub>10</sub>). The peripheral blood lymphodepletion observed here has been described after large volume apheresis<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. As with those studies, the protracted recovery appears to be limited to the T lymphocyte population. This may reflect slow thymic production and/or shortened lifespan of mature T-lymphocytes. The protracted lymphocyte recovery in this study was exacerbated during the antiretroviral treatment interruptions. In the future, modifications would aim to increase the dose, improve homing to the bone marrow, engraftment and differentiation through the myeloid and lymphoid compartments of transduced CD34+ cells and to develop a more potent construct.</p><p id="P20">In this phase II study, as for the phase I studies <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, no safety concerns associated with OZ1 gene transfer were identified. All serious adverse events were unrelated to study procedures or study drug infusion. Importantly, no death, AIDS-defining event, severe infection, clinically significant cardiovascular, renal or hepatic event was reported in randomized participants.</p><p id="P21">The increased morbidity and mortality associated with the cessation of HAART observed during the SMART study became known during the course of this study<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Specific discussions regarding the safety of the treatment interruptions in the OZ1 protocol were conducted with the Data Safety Monitoring Board and the Institutional Review Boards. The strict entry criteria met by all participants, the stringent monitoring and the provision for investigators to reintroduce HAART at any stage, distinguish this OZ1 trial from the SMART study. Future HIV-1 gene therapy trials could be designed to study participants prior to the initiation of HAART, obviating the need for treatment interruptions.</p><p id="P22">This study supports our concept that OZ1 cell-delivered gene therapy is safe, and has efficacy, albeit modest.

The per-protocol population (PP) was defined as all participants who completed the first 4 week treatment interruption, recommenced HAART and entered the analytic treatment interruption. Formal group comparisons of continuous primary and secondary parameters were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with 95% confidence intervals provided for the medians and the difference in the medians (calculated using PROC STATXACT in SAS and the Hodges-Lehman estimate). Binary endpoints were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test, with 95% confidence intervals. Participants for whom data were unavailable, either due to non-compliance with the protocol or withdrawal prior to the analytic treatment interruption, were included in formal comparisons by being ranked as having the joint-worst outcome for continuous endpoints or being categorized as failures for binary endpoints. Participants who recommenced HAART prior to week 48 had an imputed value, the last value recorded, assigned and carried forward to week 48.
