National hospitalization estimates portray GERD as an increasingly common illness, citing a 216% rise in GERD diagnoses between 1998 and 2005 [<xref rid="bibr22-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Encinosa, 2008</xref>]. GERD develops when the lower esophageal sphincter does not close properly, allowing stomach contents to return back up the esophagus, most prominently resulting in symptoms of heartburn, acid regurgitation and erosive esophagitis (EE) [<xref rid="bibr22-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Encinosa, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr9-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al. 2013</xref>]. Current therapies, such as antacids, histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), aim to reduce acid in the stomach, though PPIs are the treatment of choice for relief of GERD symptoms, as well as for healing of EE [<xref rid="bibr9-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al. 2013</xref>]. PPIs inhibit the hydrogen&#x02013;potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (proton pump) at the final step of acid production, suppressing the secretion of proton ions in the stomach and increasing intragastric pH [<xref rid="bibr15-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Kim, 2013</xref>].</p><p>Unlike other PPIs, dexlansoprazole is formulated as a capsule with a dual delayed-release mechanism [<xref rid="bibr19-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Vakily et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>]. Dexlansoprazole is first released 1&#x02013;2 hours following ingestion, followed by a second release within 4&#x02013;5 hours postdose. This dual delayed release extends the duration of drug exposure and maintains pharmacologically active levels of drug over a longer period of time, resulting in prolonged elevation of intragastric pH [<xref rid="bibr19-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Vakily et al. 2009</xref>]. The prolonged acid suppression addresses potential breakthrough heartburn that might occur at night [<xref rid="bibr6-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Fass et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>]. The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and safety profiles of dexlansoprazole capsule following administration of doses of 30 mg and 60 mg have been extensively studied in healthy adults and patients with GERD in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical studies [<xref rid="bibr14-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Peura et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Wittbrodt et al. 2009</xref>]. Both 30 mg and 60 mg strengths of dexlansoprazole capsule have been shown to be superior to placebo in maintaining heartburn-free periods in patients with healed EE or symptomatic nonerosive GERD [<xref rid="bibr6-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Fass et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Metz et al. 2009</xref>].</p><p>The currently available delayed-release PPIs are formulated as capsules or tablets that are meant to be swallowed whole, which may cause problems for patients with difficulty swallowing. Difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia, is a common comorbidity in many disease states and is highly prevalent among patients with stroke, dementia, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Huntington&#x02019;s disease and multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="bibr4-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Daniels, 2006</xref>]. In the general population, heartburn and/or acid regurgitation were significantly associated with comorbid dysphagia [odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.9&#x02013;7.4] [<xref rid="bibr10-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Locke et al. 1997</xref>]. GERD was the most common diagnosis in a population-based survey evaluating prevalence and risk factors for dysphagia, and in another study of dysphagic patients, PPI use was significantly associated with frequent (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.2&#x02013;4.4) and infrequent (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3&#x02013;1.8) dysphagia [<xref rid="bibr3-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al. 2015</xref>].</p><p>Dexlansoprazole 30 mg delayed-release capsules are approved for use in adults for relief of heartburn and maintenance of healed EE for up to 6 months, as well as 4-week therapy for heartburn associated with symptomatic nonerosive GERD [<xref rid="bibr17-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>].

As a follow-on to the dexlansoprazole capsule formulation, a 30 mg orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation of dexlansoprazole was developed and has recently been approved in the United States for the same indications, that is, relief of heartburn, maintenance of healed EE and treatment of heartburn associated with GERD, as the 30 mg dexlansoprazole capsule [<xref rid="bibr17-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., 2016</xref>]. The dexlansoprazole ODT consists of dexlansoprazole dual delayed-release microgranules in an inert, highly water-soluble base. The tablet formulation was designed to disintegrate in the mouth without chewing or swallowing with water as an alternative to the dexlansoprazole capsule. An ODT formulation may be a desirable option for those unable or unwilling to take oral capsules [<xref rid="bibr2-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Carnaby-Mann and Crary, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Pahwa, 2010</xref>].

Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from plasma concentrations measured on days 1 and 5 of each treatment period and were estimated using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.3 software (Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA). For each treatment regimen, descriptive statistics for pharmacokinetic parameters were generated for all evaluable participants. Actual sampling times were used over scheduled sampling times in all relevant computations.

Prior investigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the delayed-release dexlansoprazole capsule have indicated that pharmacodynamic effects, such as change in pH, are related to AUC levels [<xref rid="bibr19-1756283X16670073" ref-type="bibr">Vakily et al. 2009</xref>].

For both ODT and capsule formulations, greater pH control was observed on day 5 than on day 1; the difference may be partly attributed to lower intragastric pH values prior to the beginning of the 24-hour pH-monitoring period on day 1.

Further options that add to the dosing flexibility of the ODT formulation include administering dexlansoprazole ODT granules orally <italic>via</italic> syringe or <italic>via</italic> nasogastric tube after disintegration in water (Kukulka <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of dexlansoprazole 30 mg ODT reported herein suggests that this novel formulation may be used as a substitute for the 30 mg capsule, with added benefits of simpler administration for patients who may have difficulty swallowing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by inVentiv Medical Communications and was funded by Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.
