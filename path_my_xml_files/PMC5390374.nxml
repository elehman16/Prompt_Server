To date, medical and public health interventions have achieved limited success in reducing rates of PTB. Innovative changes in healthcare delivery are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes. One such model is CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care (GPNC), in which individual physical assessments are combined with facilitated group education and social support. Most existing studies in the literature on GPNC are observational. Although the results are promising, they are not powered to detect differences in PTB, do not address the racial disparity in PTB, and do not include measures of hypothesized mediators that are theoretically based and validated. The aims of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) are to compare birth outcomes as well as maternal behavioral and psychosocial outcomes by race among pregnant women who participate in GPNC to their counterparts in individual prenatal care (IPNC) and to investigate whether improving women&#x02019;s behavioral and psychosocial outcomes will explain the potential benefits of GPNC on birth outcomes and racial disparities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a single site RCT study at Greenville Health System in South Carolina. Women are eligible if they are between 14&#x02013;45 years old and enter prenatal care before 20 6/7&#x000a0;weeks of gestational age. Eligible, consenting women will be randomized 1:1 into GPNC group or IPNC group, stratified by race. Women allocated to GPNC will attend 2-h group prenatal care sessions according to the standard curriculum provided by the Centering Healthcare Institute, with other women due to deliver in the same month. Women allocated to IPNC will attend standard, traditional individual prenatal care according to standard clinical guidelines. Patients in both groups will be followed up until 12&#x000a0;weeks postpartum.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings from this project will provide rigorous scientific evidence on the role of GPNC in reducing the rate of PTB, and specifically in reducing racial disparities in PTB. Establishing the improved effect of GPNC on pregnancy and birth outcomes can change the way healthcare is delivered, particularly with populations with higher rates of PTB.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Large racial disparities persist, particularly between White and Black women; the latter had a 13.4% preterm birth rate in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PTB is the leading cause of newborn death and disability. Moreover, the racial disparities in the newborn period have the potential to contribute to disparities in chronic disease, academic achievement and economic opportunity across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, medical and public health interventions have achieved limited success in improving rates of PTB. The causes of poor birth outcomes and health disparities are complex, involving biological, behavioral, psychosocial, socio-demographic, environmental, and medical factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interventions that do not address these factors in a comprehensive way will have limited success.</p><p>Prenatal care has been the foremost strategy to improve pregnancy and birth outcomes in the U.S. Increasing access to individual prenatal care (IPNC) in the last twenty years has marginally improved rates of PTB, but has not made any headway in reducing racial disparities in birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most IPNC appointments are short (10&#x02013;15 min) and focus more on triaging medical risks, with limited time for psychosocial interventions or health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Women are often referred to childbirth education or ancillary services to address these needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Deviation from recommended prenatal care content is associated with PTB and low birth weight (LBW), indicating the importance of prenatal care models that are structured to provide comprehensive content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, psychosocial factors during pregnancy (e.g. stress, anxiety, depression, and coping responses) are gaining increased attention as critical contributing factors to poor birth outcomes; however, the current IPNC model does not adequately consider these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Innovative models in prenatal care that can address not only physical risk assessment, but also women&#x02019;s psychosocial wellbeing are therefore highly desired.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care model</title><p>The CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care (GPNC) model is distinctly different from the traditional practice of IPNC, requiring a paradigm shift in health care delivery for obstetric healthcare providers and fundamental changes to the patient-provider interaction. In this model, developed and trademarked by the Centering Healthcare Institute (CHI) (Boston, MA), groups of 8&#x02013;12 women who are all due to deliver in the same month receive their medical care in a series of ten two-hour group sessions which take place through the second and third trimesters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The group sessions begin with patients measuring their own weight and blood pressure, followed by an individual physical assessment from a credentialed health care provider (either a physician or a nurse practitioner/midwife). Once these assessments are complete, the group meets together for structured discussion and activities that follow the curriculum developed by the CHI. Group sessions also include time for socialization, which encourages group members to develop relationships with one another. Group session topics are organized by relevancy to gestational age (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The model allows the provider to adapt the content according to the needs and priorities of the participants, with deviations from the curriculum noted to be addressed at a later session. Women are encouraged to bring a support person (e.g., boyfriend, husband, friend, family member) for group sessions. CHI has established a site training and annual certification process to assure consistency and quality in implementation for obstetric practices offering GPNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This model has been implemented in several hundred practices in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care (GPNC) curriculum outline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>12&#x02013;16 weeks</td><td>Prenatal testing, nutrition, healthy lifestyle choices</td><td rowspan="2">Exercise</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16&#x02013;20 weeks</td><td>Body changes in pregnancy, common discomforts, oral health</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>20&#x02013;24 weeks</td><td>Relaxation and stress reduction, breastfeeding</td><td>Gestational diabetes</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>24&#x02013;28 weeks</td><td>Family relationships, violence and abuse, family planning, preterm labor</td><td>Breastfeeding</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>26&#x02013;30 weeks</td><td>Labor, birth facility</td><td rowspan="3">Stress management/relaxation</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>28&#x02013;32 weeks</td><td>The birth experience</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>30&#x02013;34 weeks</td><td>Newborn care</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>32&#x02013;36 weeks</td><td>Pregnancy to parenting transition, postpartum emotions, kick counts</td><td>Nutrition</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>34&#x02013;38 weeks</td><td>Newborn safety, putting it all together</td><td rowspan="2">Preterm labor</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>36&#x02013;40 weeks</td><td>Newborn care, growth and development, home and family changes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>There is promising evidence from both obstervational studies and radomized controlled trials (RCT) that suggests participation in GPNC is associated with reductions in preterm birth and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These findings have not been consistently reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The existing literature is limited by the small size of the previously randomized trials, as well as selection bias of the observational studies. Within this context, there is evidence that GPNC may result in reducing the racial disparity in preterm birth for Black women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Racial disparities in health have roots in inequalities in the provision of healthcare at the system level, the provider level, and the patient level. GPNC is designed to begin to address the racial disparities in all three levels. First, GPNC includes more patient-provider interaction time, with an average cumulative patient-provider interaction time of about 20&#x000a0;h throughout the pregnancy in GPNC, compared to 2&#x000a0;h for IPNC. More patient-provider interaction is believed to help develop the patients&#x02019; trust in their provider. Second, GPNC may reduce racial disparities in healthcare arising from unintentional prejudice and discrimination from healthcare providers, by allowing providers to develop a more robust understanding of patients&#x02019; family structures, social networks, employment or school, and physical home environment. Lastly, at the patient level GPNC is designed to promote goal setting and self-care of patients, empowering women to become more engaged in their health care and managers of their health by taking the responsibility for some of their health care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Current research gaps</title><p>Although this GPNC model has been successfully implemented in several hundred practices in the U.S., there are several significant gaps in the current literature. Existing studies are primarily observational studies that vary widely in quality, many of which are limited by self-selection bias and potential confounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. At the time we developed this proposal, only three RCTs had been published, but with mixed results. A secondary analysis of a study that was designed to examine GPNC&#x02019;s impact on HIV risk behaviors and sexually transmitted infection demonstrated a 33% reduction in the odds of PTB in the GPNC group as compared with the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The women in this study were younger than 25&#x000a0;years of age. A small trial in military settings did not find any significant difference in PTB or other birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The third trial in Iran also did not find any significant difference in PTB or LBW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. None of these studies were adequately powered to determine differences in rates of PTB, or the racial disparities in PTB in medically low risk women across all reproductive ages.</p><p>The mechanism by which GPNC may improve birth outcomes is unknown, but existing research suggests that GPNC contributes to positive psychosocial and/or behavioral changes in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Participation in GPNC has been associated with higher rates of adequate prenatal care, breastfeeding initiation, less excessive gestational weight gain, greater likelihood of using vitamin supplements during pregnancy, improved food security, and more knowledge for prenatal care and more prepared for labor and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Qualitative research indicates women generally find GPNC to be a positive experience, meeting many of their preferences for care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although these results are promising, no studies have evaluated whether improving these psychosocial and/or behavioral factors will explain the potential benefits of GPNC on racial disparities in birth outcomes.</p><p>The current study addresses the most significant gaps in the current GPNC literature: the lack of a rigorously designed clinical trial to assess the impact for GPNC on PTB and the racial disparity in preterm birth. This study will also measure GPNC&#x02019;s effects on patient activation, engagement, stress, and health behaviors as they relate to birth outcomes and answer whether improving these maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors will explain the potential benefits of GPNC on birth outcomes or on racial disparities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preliminary research</title><p>In 2012, we published a retrospective study of 316 women who participated in GPNC compared with 3,767 women in IPNC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The adjusted odds ratio for PTB for women in GPNC care was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.81) as compared to women in the IPNC. The racial disparity in PTB between Black women and White women was also diminished for women in GPNC: the Black-White difference of PTB was 1.0% in the GPNC and 2.4% in the IPNC group. In 2012&#x02013;2013, we conducted a mixed methods prospective cohort study comparing the effectiveness of GPNC to IPNC on women&#x02019;s psychosocial health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We recruited 248 women, retaining 89% of participants through pregnancy and 84% into the postpartum period. Women completed surveys at two points during pregnancy and once in the post-partum period. Among women with inadequate initial social support, GPNC participants scored 3.16 points lower (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) on a scale of prenatal distress in late pregnancy. Among women with high initial prenatal distress, GPNC participants scored 7.96 points higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008) on a measurement of planning and preparation coping in late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Preliminary data from our retrospective and prospective studies demonstrate the potential for GPNC not only to reduce PTB, but also to reduce racial disparities in PTB. Our preliminary data also indicates that GPNC improves women&#x02019;s psychosocial outcomes as well, particularly for those reporting high levels of stress in early pregnancy. By using a RCT design, this proposed study will reduce the possibility of selection bias and influences from potential confounding, and have adequate power to conclusively assess the efficacy of GPNC compared with IPNC on rates of PTB and racial disparities in birth and other outcomes among White and Black women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Specific aims and hypotheses</title><p>The proposed study will employ a RCT design adequately powered to detect difference in PTB by intervention and race.

Eligible women will be recruited at the time of entry to prenatal care, and will be followed through delivery and for 12&#x000a0;weeks postpartum. All research activities will be conducted at the Greenville Health System (GHS) Obstetrics (OB) Center and ultrasound unit, located in Greenville, SC. Greenville is part of a metropolitan area with a population of approximately 640,000 people, and is approximately 80% urban and 20% rural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The practice has been serving women in the area for more than 40&#x000a0;years, with an annual delivery volume of approximately 2,750 women. The GHS OB Center first began offering GPNC in 2008, and has maintained annual site approval from the CHI since that time. To date, 3,633 patients have attended Centering groups at this practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Patient population</title><p>The target population consists of medically low-risk pregnant women of different races/ethnicities. In our retrospective cohort study published in 2012, our study population in the comparison group included 45.8% non-Hispanic White, 25.5% non-Hispanic Black, 22.2% Hispanic and 6.5% &#x0201c;Other&#x0201d; race/ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We expect that our current study population will be similar.</p><p>To be eligible for this study, women will 1) be between 14&#x02013;45 years of age, and 2) enter prenatal care before their 20<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. Study exclusion criteria include 1) medical complications of pregnancy which would preclude prenatal care provision by nurse practitioners or participation in group care (e.g. pre-gestational diabetes, severe chronic hypertension, active pulmonary tuberculosis, massive morbid obesity or severe psychiatric illness), 2) multiple gestation, 3) lethal fetal anomalies, and 4) low literacy. The exclusion criteria were set to limit the study participants as low-risk patients, which is consistent with both the GPNC model design and the scope of medical practice of nurse practitioners/nurse midwives who provide GPNC. Women who have participated in this study in a previous pregnancy will also be excluded, in order to maintain independence. Based on our preliminary data, application of these criteria will result in an estimated exclusion of 10% of women for late entry to care and 8% for pre-existing medical complications. The exclusion criteria will be applied to all women before randomization. We will track demographic characteristics and reasons for exclusion for women who are ineligible for the study as well as for those who are eligible but decline participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Participant recruitment and screening</title><p>We propose to recruit and follow 3,160 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,580 in each group) pregnant women (see section for sample size calculations). Approximately 250 women begin prenatal care at the GHS OB Center each month, and 75% of them will be eligible for the proposed study (180 eligible women per month). The provider will screen all new patients presenting to the practice for prenatal care (at the first prenatal visit) for eligibility and to introduce the study to eligible women. Given our previous recruitment rate of 50%, we estimate that the targeted study sample size will be achieved in 3&#x000a0;years. At the time of the nurse education visit at the GHS OB Center, all patients will be screened for study eligibility based on review of medical records and a series of screening questions answered by the GHS intake nurses. The final eligibility screening will take place after the patient is scheduled with a healthcare provider. This may be the same day, or may be a separate day from the nurse education visit. Once the history and physical exam has been completed, the research nurses will approach eligible patients for study enrollment. Patients will be taken to a quiet space to have the study explained. The enrollment process involves a face-to-face interview with one of the study team for verification of study eligibility and counseling regarding study procedures, potential benefits and risks, prior to obtaining written consent. Recruitment began in July 2016 and will be monitored monthly.

During the first 30&#x000a0;min of each group session, women will measure and record their own weight and blood pressure, and then a credentialed healthcare provider (nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, or physician) will conduct a brief physical assessment in a semi-private area of the group space. Following the individual health assessments, the healthcare provider and a co-facilitator will lead the group discussion for the remaining 60&#x02013;90 min of each session. Topics discussed throughout sessions include pregnancy and nutrition, childbirth preparation, exercise, stress management, relationships, and parenting (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Retention begins at the time of recruitment, when our research team establishes a positive rapport with the research subjects. This includes providing information in a friendly manner, being responsive to their concerns, providing women with enough detail to understand the requirements of participation and stressing the importance of the potential research findings. Special efforts that will be taken to minimize the loss to follow-up include: 1) provide reminder text messages (will be made 3&#x000a0;days before each study visit), 2) limit participant burden by having recruitment and survey activities conducted when women are already at the OB Center, 3) provide child care for women attending the longer group care sessions, and 4) provide incentives/compensations. In our previous prospective studies, we have achieved an excellent retention rate: 92% at delivery and 80% at postpartum visits. We were able to accomplish this through extensive follow-up with patients via phone calls and text messages, friendly research staff, and incentives that increased in value as they went through the study. For this study, we are budgeting $75 per patient (in both groups) for incentives. We will offer gift cards at: completion of randomization and the Survey 1 ($25), attending 5 visits in the assigned group treatment and completion of the Survey 2 after 30&#x000a0;weeks gestational age ($50).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data collection</title><p>For this study, data will be collected at the following 3 time points: 1) At the time of Baseline Visit (8&#x02013;23 weeks of gestational age), women will undergo group assignment and complete the baseline data collection (Survey 1); 2) After 30&#x000a0;weeks gestational age, research nurses will meet participants prior to or after their prenatal care appointment to administer the second survey (Survey 2); and 3) Postpartum data collection will be conducted after women attend their postpartum visit and consist of medical chart abstraction, and will not require patient contact.

Additionally, this study will investigate the potential mediating effects of maternal psychosocial and health behavior factors. Findings from this project potentially have two broad areas of action. First, findings will build an understanding of the role of GPNC in reducing the rate of PTB, and specifically in reducing racial disparities in PTB. Second, establishing the superiority of GPNC can change the way healthcare is delivered, particularly to medically underserved populations. Results will support public health efforts and future research opportunities designed to improve the quality and effectiveness of prenatal care services in promoting positive birth outcomes and reducing racial disparities.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CHI</term><def><p>Centering Healthcare Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMR</term><def><p>Electronic medical record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GHS</term><def><p>Greenville Health System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPNC</term><def><p>Group prenatal care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPNC</term><def><p>Individual prenatal care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBW</term><def><p>Low birth weight</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OB</term><def><p>Obstetrics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTB</term><def><p>Preterm birth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>South Carolina</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>U.S.</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge study participants, providers at Greenville Health System OB center, and research nurses, and research assistant for their contributions.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is supported by National Institute of Child Health &#x00026; Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) through a five-year grant (R01HD082311).
