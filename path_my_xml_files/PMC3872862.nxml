Nursing students in clinical environments should make a bridge between theoretical education and clinical function. This study was aimed to survey the effect of guided questioning in peer groups on nursing students&#x02019; self-esteem and clinical learning.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this quasi-experimental study, all nursing students in semester 4 (60) were selected. The autumn semester students (<italic>n</italic> = 28) were chosen as the control group, and the spring semester students (<italic>n</italic> = 32) as the experimental group. The experimental group underwent the course of cardiac medical surgical training by the Guided Reciprocal Peer Questioning. The control group was trained by lecture. After confirmation of the validity and reliability of tools including Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and the researcher-made questionnaire, data were collected and analyzed by SPSS version 17.0.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was no significant difference concerning demographic and educational characteristics between the two groups. Mean score differences of self-esteem and learning were not significant before teaching, while they were significantly promoted after teaching in the experimental (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) groups. Promotion in the experimental group was more considerable than in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>As revealed by the results, inquiry method, due to its more positive impact on self-esteem and students&#x02019; learning, can be applied alone or in combination with the other methods. Conducting this study for other students and for theoretical courses is suggested.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Educational models</kwd><kwd>Iran</kwd><kwd>nursing student</kwd><kwd>questioning</kwd><kwd>self-esteem</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Complicated and stressful nature of nursing profession[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] necessitates nursing students to have an appropriate perception of the learned contents. Students spend most of their educational time in clinical environments,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] and their learning in these environments should be capable of making a bridge between their theoretical education and clinical function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] On the other hand, self-esteem is a characteristic of a normal personality[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and is a value individuals consider for themselves.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>In order to have the highest potentiality, students should have a positive attitude on themselves and their surrounding environment. They should have a high self-esteem in order to succeed in their duties and profession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Therefore, the need for making changes in the process of learning to promote the efficiency of nursing internship is essential.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>One of the helpful methods for better learning is questioning. Question acts as a tool to attract the attention of students to develop a learning situation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Questioning is an active process which individuals can appropriately decide through that.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Guided Reciprocal Peer Questioning (GRPQ) is one of the interactive methods[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] with the goal of learning through social interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Myrick and Yonge have argued that when students ask their questions in the above-mentioned domains, learning can occur.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Researchers have shown that prevailing traditional education in educational centers results in passive students and superficial learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Students who get educated through traditional methods pick up a great load of knowledge and concepts, but are not educated in analysis, prioritization, and organization of knowledge as essential elements of efficient and meaningful learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, an efficient learning is a product of appropriate teaching attained through innovative methods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] So, modification of educational patterns and application of more active learning strategies should be at the top of attention. An interaction in GRPQ promotes students&#x02019; self-confidence as a sub-item of self-esteem and results in students&#x02019; ability to face and cope with any obstacle during education. Excessive emphasis of nursing educators on traditional teaching indirectly imposes a sort of curriculum designed based on students&#x02019; obedience and mere acceptance that suppress their ideas, resulting in their lower self-confidence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, most of the researches have studied the association between self-esteem and educational development and success, but less attention has been paid to the effect of an appropriate educational method in promotion of educational development and success.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Vanaki <italic>et al</italic>., Velde <italic>et al</italic>., and King have already investigated the effect of this method on skills of critical thinking, learning, and self-esteem in other domains and lessons except clinical nursing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] But this study aimed to present the effect of GRPQ in peer groups on nursing students&#x02019; self-esteem and clinical learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>In this quasi-experimental, two-group, pre-test post-test study, the subjects were selected by census sampling, and all nursing students of Tabriz Nursing and Midwifery Faculty (<italic>N</italic> = 60) who were enrolled in Medical Surgical Nursing 3 in 2010-2011 were chosen and required to complete clinical placement in a tertiary care in Shahid Madani Heart Hospital in Tabriz, Iran. The students (<italic>n</italic> = 28) in autumn semester were chosen as the control group to receive the conventional clinical training and those in the spring semester (<italic>n</italic> = 32) were considered as the experimental group to be trained using the GRPQ model. Students in both groups were treated equally except for the learning methods; they had 3 days clinical placement per week for two sequential weeks, and were trained using similar learning objectives. Students who did not give consent to the study were excluded and received the conventional training.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for students were selecting heart clinical course in 2010-2011, giving consent to participate in the study, being physically and mentally prepared to answer the questions, having no participation in similar studies and not being familiar with the questionnaire, not being a guest or transferred student from other universities, and having not more than one class session absence.</p><p>At the beginning of the internship period in both groups, a blind pre-test was taken by a person unaware of the educational method using Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and a researcher-made test. Control group was grouped into six student groups and they were educated by routine educational outline in which deep questioning was not emphasized, and students just presented their daily lectures with no discussion and questioning. In this method, there may be a few questions asked by the educators, and not by the students who act according to the routines (planning nursing care, dressing, taking ECG, inserting angiocatheter, giving medication, taking blood samples, etc.). In this method, students react to new situations passively and never try to be innovative, and think based on detection and fulfillment of educational needs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The experimental group received the clinical education by researcher through guided questioning method in groups of six persons according to the same course plan by means of the questions roots [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. After finishing of clinical education, the post-test was performed again for all students using the same test.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Guided reciprocal peer questions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-18-285-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Approach of guided questioning</title><p>In this approach, each student is asked to suggest two questions by use of root of questions that covers the lesson plan content at the end of teaching program every day. Under the guidance of the researcher, the students are asked to present the answers to the others. The students should find the right answers to the questions of each other. Partners in two are guided of questioning conditions and are trained to generate thought-provoking questions. Thus, the students, during the discussion, practice the strategy of questioning and responding to the debate and discuss about clinical subjects such as nursing care of cardiac patients. The discussion continues with questions and answers until the researcher stops them. It is important in guided questioning that the student cannot turn to the next question before they conduct full discussion on the topic.</p><p>Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and the researcher-made test were used to collect data. This scale is a standard instrument including 10 general phases in which 5 have been expressed by negative words and 5 by positive ones. Each question is rated by Likert-type questions rated from &#x0201c;completely agree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;completely disagree.&#x0201d; They are scored as 0-3, with the highest score of 30. Scores over 25 show high self-esteem, 15-25 average self-esteem, and lower than 15 show low self-esteem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Reliability and validity of the Persian version of self-esteem questionnaire had been confirmed by Alizadeh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] with test &#x02014; retest correlation of 0.82-0.88 and Cronbach's alpha of 0.77-0.88. In the present study, reliability of the questionnaire was rechecked by Cronbach's alpha as 0.86 through conducting a pilot study on 10 nursing students who met the inclusion criteria. The researcher made a test including 20 multiple test questions to investigate the level of students&#x02019; cognitive learning from the taught subjects in relation to evaluation and nursing care of cardiac patients and their cardiac medication. Each item had a correct answer which was given a score of 1 so that scores 0-10 showed weak learning, 11-15 showed moderate learning, and 16-20 showed strong learning. Validity of the test was confirmed by content validity method. The reliability was calculated by internal consistency by a pilot study, from which Cronbach's alpha was obtained as 0.89.</p><p>Data obtained from the study were reviewed and analyzed by descriptive statistical and inferential statistical methods using SPSS software version 17.0 (frequency counts, percentage, means and standard deviations, Chi-square, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).</p><p>For ethical considerations, consents form at top of the questionnaire was signed by participants.

Despite concerning the direct effect of guided questioning on cognitive learning and self-esteem of nursing students, we could not access to more studies about it, but according to Rahmani <italic>et al</italic>., Churarut and Debacker, and Heravi Karimuy <italic>et al</italic>., after active teaching methods such as concept map, questioning, and group discussion, learning mean scores increased.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>Various studies indicated that application of students&#x02019; active participation and collaboration increases students&#x02019; level of learning,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] feeling of responsibility, and motivation of learning, so ultimately prepares them for lifelong learning and constant professional studying during work.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Johson and Mighten believed that active learning methods have higher effects on students&#x02019; learning compared to passive methods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Meanwhile, the findings in Karimi's study for investigating the effect of lecture and group discussion on nursing students&#x02019; learning showed that the level of learning was significantly higher in the lecture method compared to group discussion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] In this regard, Salimi <italic>et al</italic>., in a study to define the effect of two methods of lecture and small group works on the nursing students&#x02019; skills of medication calculation, showed that both methods had equal positive effects on enhancement of this skill.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>Although the study results were a significant indicator of difference in both control and experimental groups, it was not consistent with the findings of Baghayi <italic>et al</italic>. who compared the effect of lecture and problem-based learning among nursing students learning hematology. They reported no significant difference in the level of learning in both the groups, although the obtained mean score was higher in the lecture group compared to the problem-based group,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] which is possibly due to conducting this study with limited number of students in a clinical environment as well as the differences in type of the subjects, length of study, and students&#x02019; semester.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The results of the present study are consistent with those of Quistorff and Aspegren in which teaching was conducted through lecture and questioning methods for medical students. They concluded that students spend more time on studying and are driven toward learning in questioning method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>With regard to self-esteem, students&#x02019; scores in the experimental group were reported to show high self-esteem in a study conducted by Barkhordari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]</p><p>In this regard, based on Bandura's Social Learning Theory, teaching and learning are an active process through which children and adolescents actively learn and develop their social and behavioral skills during interaction with their family, peers, and schoolmates. On the other hand, in questioning, the knowledge is formed in the context of social interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p><p>With regard to the results of the present study, these are not consistent with those of Jalali and Nazari who investigated the effect of social learning on students&#x02019; self-esteem,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] possibly due to the differences in educational level and the employed educational method, sample size, and the clinical environment employed in the present study, compared to the above studies. In fact, educational level is one of the factors influencing self-esteem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In the present study, all the samples were university students, while in latter researches, they were school students.</p><p>Since being self-confident and feeling responsible as well as having self-esteem are essential for nursing students to judge and decide in various clinical situations,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] the academic members in nursing school should provide active learning fields to encourage and make students to have a positive attitude toward their course and profession from the early years of education. They should also deliver the authority to the students in clinical environments and encourage them to apply their already learned knowledge at the time of giving care to the patients in order to make them have enough self-esteem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>]</p><p>Research limitations can also influence the commented results. In the present study, existence of some students who were not respondent to some questions, sample size, usage of the same achievement test to measure cognitive learning, and ultimately, utilizing this test in both pre-test and post-test acted as research limitations which could have affected the results. Further studies should be done with larger sample size, more appropriate sampling method, more sessions, and in the other clinical environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
