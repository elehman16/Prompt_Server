A screening questionnaire for MOH was sent to all 18&#x02013;50 year old patients on these GPs` list. GPs were taught BI, which was applied to MOH patients as follows: Severity of dependence scale (SDS) scores were collected and individual feedback was given of the relationship between the SDS, medication overuse and headache. Finally, advice to reduce medication was given. Patients were invited to a headache interview three months after the BI. Main outcomes were feedback from GPs/patients about the feasibility and logistics of the study design, screening/recruitment process, BI and headache interviews. Efficacy and patient-related outcomes were not focused. The patients reported a high degree of acceptability of the methodology. The GPs reported the BI to be feasible to implement within a busy practice and to represent a new and improved instrument for communication with MOH patients. The BI requires further testing in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in order to provide evidence of efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This feasibility study will be used to improve the BI for MOH and the design of a cluster-RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01078012">NCT01078012</ext-link> (Initially registered as controlled efficacy trial but changed to observational study).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic headache</kwd><kwd>Medication-overuse headache</kwd><kwd>Migraine</kwd><kwd>Brief intervention</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Severity of dependence scale</kwd><kwd>Feasibility study</kwd><kwd>Pilot study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Headache is a frequent symptom in primary care attendees, accounting for 4% of the consultations in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Headache prescription medications only partly account for the total medication use for headache since most patients buy over-the-counter (OTC) drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Between two and five percent of the world&#x02019;s population report chronic headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and approximately 75% have been in contact with their GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a major cause of chronic headache with prevalence in the general population of 1&#x02013;1.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and is probably the most costly headache disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. By definition, MOH is chronic headache (&#x02265;15 days/month) with frequent medication use (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD - II) criteria for medication-overuse headache</bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th colspan="2" align="left"><bold>Medication-overuse headache (MOH)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">A.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Headache present on &#x02265;15 days/month<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">B.<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Regular overuse for &#x0003e;3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">C.</td><td align="left">Headache has developed or markedly worsened during medication overuse</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>For simple analgesics and for combination of acute medications the intake must be 15 days or more per month, for triptans, ergotamins, opioids and combination analgesics,10 days per month is enough to get the diagnosis of MOH.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>There is no consensus on the management of MOH and an obvious need for evidence-based and cost-effective management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, detoxification is generally accepted as the avenue to employ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], since withdrawal of the overused medication(s) leads to an improvement of the headache, after an initial worsening for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>MOH has been suggested to include subgroups of both simple and complex cases, where some of the latter may show &#x0201c;dependency-like&#x0201d; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies from our group have revealed that the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] can detect MOH among subjects with chronic headache in a general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Brief Intervention (BI) is a well-known approach to identify and treat unhealthy alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. BI involves the use of an identification tool followed by feedback to the identified individual as being &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d;. The final step is to give information suggesting cutting down the use of the particular substance to predefined &#x0201c;acceptable&#x0201d; levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Through the Norwegian GP list-patient system, all citizens are listed with a GP whether or not they have a reason to see their GP. A short validated headache screening questionnaire including questions about headache frequency, intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), migraine and medication use was mailed to all 18&#x02013;50 year old patients (N = 3575) on participating GP`s lists. Names and addresses were extracted from GP lists using specially designed software (Mediata Ltd, T&#x000f8;nsberg, Norway). All patients with self-reported headache &#x02265;15 days/month and headache medication utilisation &#x02265;10 days/month were invited to participate. Insufficient language skills and complex pain conditions were the only exclusion criteria. As this was a pilot study, no reminders were sent out. Screening-positive MOH patients invited into the intervention part of the study only received information that this was a study of headache care utilisation and that all participating patients would receive a headache interview and clinical examination by a headache expert. In addition, it was informed that some patients might be invited to a consultation by their GP. Patients were, thus, not informed that the focus was chronic headache and medication use or withdrawal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>Intervention</italic></title><sec><title/><p><bold>Brief Intervention course</bold> A one day course held by two headache specialists (ESK and CL) including lectures about emergency &#x0201c;red flag&#x0201d; headache, migraine and tension-type headache and chronic headaches with focus on MOH were given to the GPs. The content of the BI course was partly based on feedback from a random sample of 30 clinically active GPs at the Department of General Practice at the University of Oslo, regarding which headache-related problems they would like more information on. A two-hour presentation of the BI scheme with practical instructions exemplified by role-play was given. The estimated time for an average BI scheme was expected to be 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;minutes.

The five patients completed all the additional self-reported questionnaires. The time of completion ranged from 17&#x000a0;minutes to 44&#x000a0;minutes. One of the patients thought there were too many questionnaires that explored the same aspects of self-reported quality of life.</p><p>Using direct data entry (Snap Survey, UK) by the interviewer during the interview itself was found to be difficult to adapt to the different ways the patients had of presenting their history.

The main focus was to test methodology and logistics, not patient related headache outcomes.</p><p>The responder rate was low (29%), and we included fewer patients than expected. Before the study, we decided that no reminders should be sent to patients because the main aim of this study was to test methodology, acceptability and practicability. We also decided not to include a control arm in the pilot trial, as this not was an efficacy trial. The low number of MOH participants and lack of control group may of course lead to selection bias and low generalization, which suggests the need for increasing individual responder rate and recruitment in a RCT to secure external validity of our findings. The responder rate found here was lower than in a previous study using the same screening questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The number of reminders used will always be a compromise between cost and gain. In a study focusing on recruiting patients for an intervention, representativity of the sample is important but, providing recruitment is not biased between the study arms in a later study, the percentage responder rate is of less importance than for epidemiological studies. The screening questionnaire was complete in over 98% of received answers, so this seems to have been well understood and accepted. Although the responder rate was low, 24 screening-positive MOH patients were in the range of what we expected. Only 10/24 responded to the invitation into the main study. There was no information in the invitation letter about this being a medication withdrawal study so a possibly negative attitude to this should not have affected the recruitment. We screened all patients on the GPs patient lists instead of relying only on the GPs knowledge of their previous headache patients. Through this screening we expected to reach possible chronic headache patients who might not be known as such by their GP.</p><p>The age range of patients (18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years of age) was chosen in order to target the highest number of patients with chronic headache, as the prevalence is lower in younger people and older people have a higher frequency of co-morbidities. We chose an upper age limit of 50&#x000a0;years since data from the Norwegian prescription database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] indicate that there is an increase in the use of various relevant drugs (notably anti-hypertensive and cardiovascular drugs) from 50&#x000a0;years of age onwards.</p><p>The headache diary and the written instructions were reported to be acceptable from the patients actually returning it, and recent studies using a similar headache diary and written instructions before first consultation found high usefulness, acceptability and comprehensibility of the diary as well as good compliance and completeness of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. There was clear advice from the patients not to use the headache diary for periods over two weeks since this might reduce compliance. This period may seem too short for infrequent forms of headache, but in our sample of chronic sufferers this should not be a problem.</p><p>The evaluation of GPs and patients were not collected in a formal qualitative way, but were given as individual written and spoken feedback after the study was ended. Given the fact that the feedback was quite similar with no major differences regarding the GPs experience of their own patients as being simple or complex, and with no differences between patients managing medication withdrawal or not, we conclude, although few included patients that the BI for MOH seems feasible.</p><p>A Danish study has shown that feasibility, acceptability and implementation of screening and brief intervention programs for alcohol overuse in primary care may cause more problems than they solve for some GPs because it might be problematic to incorporate a in a busy daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The feedback from our pilot group of GPs indicated that the SDS and BI were feasible and considered clinically relevant. Our estimated time of 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;minutes matched the 7&#x02013;12&#x000a0;minutes the GPs used on the BI scheme, and all GPs found this easy to do within normal consultation time, even though two of the GPs didn`t know their MOH patients in advance as these patients had never consulted their GP for headache before. 7&#x02013;12&#x000a0;minutes is well within the normal Norwegian GP consultation time of about 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;minutes, in addition we might expect the GPs using less time when more familiar with the BI scheme.</p><p>There is still much discussion as to whether MOH represents dependency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Being fully aware of this and the potentially problems with stigmatizing these patients, we used the SDS score, not as an attempt to define dependency, but rather as an aid for the GPs to focus on individual risk of medication overuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The GPs did not use the SDS as a universal screening and case finding instrument, it was only used in the BI consultation as an educational tool to give personal feedback. This personal feedback on a risk score is what probably makes the BI scheme more effective than just simple advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. During the BI course, the GPs were anxious about the topic of medication overuse, especially regarding questions on dependency, as possibly being of a very sensitive and thereby provoking nature for the patients. This worry was reduced after the study but suggests the importance of further focus on the experiences of the GPs in the planned RCT with a formal qualitative part.</p><p>We had tested the Snap Survey data collection form many times and in many different settings ahead of this study, but still found new errors during the interviews and when reading the data into SPSS. This was not due to the Snap Survey software itself but was a consequence of how the questions and response alternatives were formulated. Such problems may in many cases not have been detected without a pilot trial.</p><p>The three months follow-up interviews and additional questionnaires were all performed as planned. The patients reported the questionnaires to be acceptable, one patient though there were too many questions about quality of life and headache-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, these instruments have very widespread use and acknowledged validity for assessing quality of life and headache related quality of life and impact and their use is therefore important in order to compare outcomes with other studies.</p><p>The patient data support the importance of performing an RCT to assess efficacy of the BI. Two of the patients had completely terminated medication for two months but relapsed before three months follow-up because none of them had received appropriate information from the BI scheme about the importance of staying medication free until the three months follow up.</p><p>As a consequence of the nature of this feasibility study we will use previous results from a study from Akershus University Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] as the basis for the power calculation and sample size required in the RCT. Another reason is that results of pilot studies can potentially mislead sample size or power calculations in full scale RCTs because results may already be biased because of the limited sample size in most pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. None of the data from this study will be used in the RCT to avoid any bias.</p><p>In summary, findings suggesting changes in the planned method for the RCT were the need for at least one, and probably two reminders for both the screening questionnaire and the invitation into the intervention part of the study. In addition, since our contacts with the GPs in the pilot study suggested that more than three patients per GP would be difficult to achieve for practical reasons, we must increase the number of GPs included in an RCT. The patients need to receive appropriate information about the importance of staying medication free until the three months follow-up.</p><p>We have already published the study protocol with most of these modifications incorporated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], but nevertheless, we regard the specific methods to be of separate interest, and this feasibility study underlines the importance of doing a proper feasibility and/or pilot study to avoid too many unexpected flaws in a full RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this pilot study, BI for MOH seems feasible and acceptable by both patients and GPs. We intend to test the efficacy of BI for MOH in a double-blind pragmatic cluster-RCT since this is a simple intervention with a potential to reach many suffering patients at the lowest effective health care level (GP).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CL had the original idea for the study and together with JS, MBR and ESK planned the overall design.
