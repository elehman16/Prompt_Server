This study intended to provide supportive evidence to complement previous trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A multi-centre randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial was carried out in the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> endemic districts of North-Western Uganda to compare the efficacy and safety of NECT (200&#x000a0;mg/kg eflornithine infusions every 12&#x000a0;h for 7&#x000a0;days and 8 hourly oral nifurtimox at 5&#x000a0;mg/kg for 10&#x000a0;days) to the standard eflornithine regimen (6 hourly at 100&#x000a0;mg/kg for 14&#x000a0;days). The primary endpoint was the cure rate, determined as the proportion of patients alive and without laboratory signs of infection at 18&#x000a0;months post-treatment, with no demonstrated trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood or lymph node aspirates, and CSF white blood cell count &#x0003c;&#x02009;20 /&#x003bc;l. The non-inferiority margin was set at 10%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">One hundred and nine patients were enrolled; all contributed to the intent-to-treat (ITT), modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and safety populations, while 105 constituted the per-protocol population (PP). The cure rate was 90.9% for NECT and 88.9% for eflornithine in the ITT and mITT populations; the same was 90.6 and 88.5%, respectively in the PP population. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for NECT in all populations: differences in cure rates were 0.02 (95% CI: -0.07&#x02013;0.11) and 0.02 (95% CI: -0.08&#x02013;0.12) respectively. Two patients died while on treatment (1 in each arm), and 3 more during follow-up in the NECT arm. No difference was found between the two arms for the secondary efficacy and safety parameters. A meta-analysis involving several studies demonstrated non-inferiority of NECT to eflornithine monotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These results confirm findings of earlier trials and support implementation of NECT as first-line treatment for late stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> HAT. The overall risk difference for cure between NECT and eflornithine between this and two previous randomised controlled trials is 0.03 (95% CI: -0.02&#x02013;0.08). The NECT regimen is simpler, safer, shorter and less expensive than single-agent DFMO.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">ISRCTN <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN03148609">ISRCTN03148609</ext-link> (registered 18 April 2008).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13071-018-2634-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)</kwd><kwd>Meningo-encephalitic stage</kwd><kwd>Second-stage HAT</kwd><kwd>Nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment (NECT)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par31">Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) remains an important public health problem in tsetse fly infested endemic zones of rural sub-Saharan Africa. Past epidemics were fuelled by civil unrest and political upheavals, which typically disrupted health operations leading to re-appearance of historical foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It was previously reported that national control programmes cover only a proportion of the population living in endemic regions, implying gross under-estimation of prevalence. More recent estimates put 70 million people across sub-Saharan Africa at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] although the incidence continues to decline, thanks to concerted efforts by the World Health Organization (WHO), several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national control programs.</p><p id="Par32"><italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> HAT manifests in two stages: the early haemolymphatic phase is effectively treated with pentamidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], rendering early diagnosis essential for effective control and compliance to this relatively safe treatment regimen. Noteworthy is that pentamidin is only used for early stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> HAT. The late or meningo-encephalitic stage of the disease, when the parasites invade the central nervous system, is invariably fatal in absence of intervention and more difficult to treat.</p><p id="Par33">There have been two major advances in the treatment of late stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> HAT. The first was the availability of eflornithine (DFMO), replacing melarsoprol, which caused life-threatening side-effects and had become increasingly ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, unlimited access to the life-saving drug eflornithine was threatened by its complicated application (4 daily infusions over 14&#x000a0;days), which puts a very high nursing demand on already understaffed rural clinics where HAT is typically prevalent. Besides, eflornithine monotherapy could not have been be a long-term solution because of its trypanostatic mode of action whose success requires a competent immune system to clear the arrested parasite population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; resistance was presumably bound to emerge faster than usual. The second major advance was combining parenteral eflornithine with oral nifurtimox, a drug used against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> American trypanosoniasis. An initial pilot Bi-Therapy Trial (BTT) conducted in Omugo (north-western Uganda) in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was followed by a large-scale nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment (NECT) trials conducted in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This led to its inclusion on the WHO essential drug list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and to-date NECT is only used for treatment of late stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> HAT. We undertook this non-inferiority randomised trial of NECT <italic>versus</italic> eflornithine in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> endemic foci of north-western Uganda, in order to corroborate findings from trials elsewhere supporting the policy change from eflornithine monotherapy to NECT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and sites</title><p id="Par34">The study was conducted at two sites in northern Uganda, one in Omugo Health Centre IV in Arua District and the other in Moyo Hospital in Moyo District. Participants were recruited within a radius of 75&#x000a0;km for the Moyo site or 60&#x000a0;km for the Omugo site, distances that were considered feasible for follow-up. The participants came from the Arua, Maracha, Koboko and Yumbe Districts for the Omugo study arm and the Moyo and Adjumani districts for the Moyo study arm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Uganda showing the sites from which participants were recruited.

For the outcome, we considered the binary endpoint as cure or failure of treatment, after follow-up of at least 6&#x000a0;months.

All patients who did not meet this definition at 6 or 12&#x000a0;months were considered cured.

The confidence interval around the risk difference was set at 90% with a non inferiority margin of 10% (-0.1 on the forest plot X-axis).

(Risk difference, random effects model)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13071_2018_2634_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par69">A previous systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] of randomised clinical trials of HAT treatments was not particularly helpful in the present context, as outcomes from only one NECT <italic>vs</italic> eflornithine trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were considered. In the present meta-analysis, we have included as many studies as possible (not so many are available) although we could not utilize the entire sets for all analyses due to inherent limitations. Nevertheless, NECT was found to exhibit non-inferiority to eflornithine to diminish the number of failures in the treatment of <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> HAT. Indeed, both the primary and the sensitivity analyses resulted in an estimate of the lower limit of the 90% CI above the non-inferiority margin.</p><p id="Par70">While the standard eflornithine regimen requires 6-hourly infusions given its short half-life, this study has demonstrated eflornithine in 12-hourly infusions is highly effective when administered in combination with oral nifurtimox. Given the short half-life of eflornithine, 6-hourly infusions are required to sustain its trypanostatic effect. Our results confirm that 12-hourly eflornithine infusions are highly effective alongside oral nifurtimox.</p><p id="Par71">There are potential limitations to this study. One relates to the use of an open-label design which was unavoidable as a blinded design is unacceptable given the different modes of administration of nifurtimox (oral) and eflornithine (6-hourly for 14&#x000a0;days or 12-hourly for 7&#x000a0;days infusion) would require a double dummy design and thus 42 placebo infusions of 2&#x000a0;h duration in the patients on NECT. The impact of this limitation on the study outcome is, however, minimal as the efficacy outcomes were majorly inferred from laboratory analyses confirmed by two independent readers. The other potential limitation relates to the safety analysis where the duration of hospitalization was different for the two groups due to the different treatment schedules. A longer hospitalization time means a longer period of observation and recording of more adverse events.</p><p id="Par72">The major challenges faced in this trial include failure to recruit the desired number of patients in the calculated sample size, logistical hindrances associated with delivery of internationally procured supplies, high mobility of patients with some moving across international borders thus complicating follow up, and limited infrastructure/research capacity in rural Uganda where the study was located. Despite these challenges the trial achieved over 90% end of follow up assessment at 18&#x000a0;months and the established trial methods remained in firm compliance with GCP guidelines.</p><p id="Par73">In summary, this study confirms earlier findings supporting the recommendations of NECT for first-line treatment of late stage <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> infections. NECT continues to be used in several centres and is generally believed to have improved prognosis of treated patients; the only issue being the above average nursing requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par74">Our study has confirmed findings from earlier clinical trials and support implementation of NECT as first-line treatment for late stage <italic>T. b. gambiese</italic> HAT. The NECT regimen is simpler, safer, shorter and less expensive than single-agent DFMO. It therefore provides a relaible alternative for treatment as the search for new chemotherapeutic agents continues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
