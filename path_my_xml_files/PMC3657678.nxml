Transportation noise has adverse effects on sleep structure, affects the heart rate (HR) during sleep and may be linked to cardiovascular disease. Freight trains also generate vibration and little is known regarding the impact of vibration on human sleep. A laboratory study was conducted to examine how a realistic nocturnal railway traffic scenario influences HR during sleep.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Case&#x02013;control.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Healthy participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>24 healthy volunteers (11 men, 13 women, 19&#x02013;28&#x02005;years) spent six consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>All participants slept during one habituation night, one control and four experimental nights in which train noise and vibration were reproduced. In the experimental nights, 20 or 36 trains with low-vibration or high-vibration characteristics were presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>Polysomnographical data and ECG were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The train exposure led to a significant change of HR within 1&#x02005;min of exposure onset (p=0.002), characterised by an initial and a delayed increase of HR. The high-vibration condition provoked an average increase of at least 3&#x02005;bpm per train in 79% of the participants. Cardiac responses were in general higher in the high-vibration condition than in the low-vibration condition (p=0.006). No significant effect of noise sensitivity and gender was revealed, although there was a tendency for men to exhibit stronger HR acceleration than women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Freight trains provoke HR accelerations during sleep, and the vibration characteristics of the trains are of special importance.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Noise-induced HR changes do not seem to habituate during sleep;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> therefore, they might &#x02018;bear a pathogenic potential for the genesis of cardiovascular disease&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Evidence that long-term traffic exposure can increase the risk for cardiovascular disease comes from field studies. Babisch summarises that traffic exposure enhances the risk for hypertension by a factor of between 1.5 and 3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> An increased risk for myocardial infarction in persons living close to roads and railways has been found in several studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17 R18">15&#x02013;18</xref> although the effect sizes are rather small and the effects seem to be more pronounced in men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> A Dutch study revealed that the number of persons reporting strong difficulties falling asleep due to traffic noise increased from 18% to 23% between 1998 and 2003.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Disturbed sleep might be one factor leading to enhanced cardiovascular risk in persons exposed to traffic. It has been suggested that sleep disturbances contribute to cardiovascular disease through the pathway of enhanced inflammatory processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> or, related to this, through the pathway of enhanced stress reaction affecting the cardiovascular system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In a field study, Carter <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> examined the influence of nocturnal traffic exposure on seven older men with cardiac arrhythmia, who lived close to a busy road. They found an increased likelihood of single ventricular premature contractions (a form of cardiac arrhythmia) after noise peaks.</p><p>Two environmental exposures commonly arising from traffic are noise and vibration. As described, traffic noise disturbs sleep and leads to event-related HR changes, but the effect of traffic vibration is not well understood. Studies investigating annoyance show that (1) traffic vibration causes annoyance, (2) annoyance increases with increasing vibration level and (3) vibration enhances the annoying effect of noise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25 R26 R27">25&#x02013;27</xref> Furthermore, higher vibration amplitude is related to higher reported sleep disturbances in persons exposed to railway traffic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> A study on human fetuses suggests that short experimental external vibration exposure alters sleep stage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Indications that vibration exposure is disadvantageous for cardiovascular function have been found in people exposed to high levels of vibration at work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>

Twenty-three were students and one was in full-time employment, recruited by public advertisements placed around the campus of the University of Gothenburg. Eligible persons were required to be aged between 18 and 30&#x02005;years, in healthy condition, maintain normal sleeping patterns and not use tobacco products. To decrease the probability of subclinical breathing difficulties or apnoea, participants were required to have a body mass index within the normal range 18.5&#x02013;24.99.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Following initial screening, hearing was tested before volunteers were accepted. Manual audiometric testing was conducted using an Entomed SA201<sup>II</sup> according to ISO 8253&#x02013;1. Left and right ears were tested separately at frequencies of 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000&#x02005;Hz with hearing considered to be normal if measured thresholds were not more than a screening level of 20&#x02005;dB HL.</p><p>The participants were instructed to begin attempting to fall asleep at 23:00 each night, were awoken by an alarm call at 07:00 each morning, and were prohibited from sleeping outside of this period. Before attending, they were asked about their noise sensitivity on a 5-point Likert scale. Fourteen participants (8 men and 6 women) rated themselves as being noise insensitive (points 1&#x02013;2) and 10 rated themselves as being noise sensitive (points 3&#x02013;5). For each participant, the study consisted of one habituation night and one control night preceding four experimental nights in which simulated trains passed. The arrangement of the experimental nights was randomised across participants. Gender and noise sensitivity was approximately equally spread around the randomisation table. In two of the four experimental nights, the participants were exposed to 20 trains per night with all trains having high vibration on one night and low vibration on the other night (High20 and Low20, respectively). On the remaining two nights, they were exposed to 36 trains per night, again with either high or low vibrations (High36 and Low36). The acoustic signal for the trains was not varied with vibration amplitude. There were more train passages between the periods of 23:00&#x02013;01:00 and 05:00&#x02013;07:00 to reflect typical real-world scenarios.</p><p>The sleep laboratory consists of three individual rooms isolated from external noise and vibration, furnished to simulate a typical bedroom with a bed, chairs, a desk and a small chest of drawers. Eighty-eight ceiling loudspeakers reproduced the low-frequency content of noise below 125&#x02005;Hz, and higher frequencies were generated by two loudspeaker cabinets in the room corners. Because of the unrealistically low background noise levels in the rooms (&#x0003c;14&#x02005;dBA), for the duration of the trial, artificial ventilation noise was introduced at a level of 25&#x02005;dBA measured at the pillow position on the bed. In addition to the bedrooms, the participants had private access to a shared communal space outfitted with a kitchen, dining area and living area with a&#x000a0; sofa and television. They were free to come and go as they desired during the daytime, being required to arrive by 20:00 each evening to ensure rest prior to bedtime and to allow sufficient time for electrode attachment.</p><p>Vibration and noise exposure were similar to that in another study conducted in our laboratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> and are only summarised here. Five different train passages were synthesised based upon analysis of the accelerometer and sound level measurements performed in the field. Noise signals were low pass filtered to correspond to a fully closed window. The vibration exposure was an amplitude-modulated 10&#x02005;Hz signal applied along the lengthwise horizontal axis of the bed by electrodynamic shakers with a frequency response of 5&#x02013;40&#x02005;Hz mounted to the underside of the bed frame. The vibration began when the train noise signal exceeded an A-weighted equivalent level (L<sub>Aeq</sub>) of 35&#x02005;dB, ensuring masking of any audible mechanical operation noise.

The time resolution of the onset was 4.7&#x000b1;3.4&#x02005;s.</p><p>Cardiac activity was recorded via a modified lead II torso placement ECG at a sampling frequency of 256&#x02005;Hz as per the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> To identify sleep stage, EEG, electrooculogram and submental electromyogram were also recorded using standardised surface electrode placements and sampling and filter frequencies. To ensure good signal quality, following electrode attachment it was checked that the electrical impedance of each contact was &#x02264;5&#x02005;k&#x003a9;. Thirty second epoch sleep staging was performed manually by a trained sleep technician. Additionally, participants wore two effort belts to record breathing rates and a finger pulse oximeter to record blood oxygen saturation, plethysmogram and pulse information, although these data will not be reported here. Owing to a technical fault, ECG was not obtained for one participant (female, noise sensitive) in the High20 night and therefore could not be included in analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Event-related analysis and control condition</title><p>In order to examine event-related changes of HR, data from the four exposure nights were analysed. The continuously recorded ECG (sampling frequency of 256&#x02005;Hz) was converted into HR (in bpm) in 1&#x02005;s intervals through the whole night. EEG and ECG recordings were synchronised with the train exposure events, thus allowing a direct temporal association between the occurrence of a train and the participant's HR reaction and sleep stages. Analysis revealed that 9.9% of the train onsets occurred during wake stage, 8.1% during stage N1, 42% during stage N2, 21.4% during stage N3 and 17.8% during rapid eye movement (REM).</p><p>The procedure of HR analysis is visualised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002655F1">figure 1</xref>. HRs below 35 and above 130&#x02005;bpm were excluded from the analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> This was the case for 4.1% of the events. For analysis of event-related HR change (bpm), only train events where participants were asleep were considered. This approach was chosen because Griefahn <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> showed that HR response to traffic noise differs depending on whether the participants do or do not awake. The relatively few trains per night in our study do not allow additional examination of HR response in the case of awakenings. An event-related awakening has been defined as a sleep stage change to Wake from any other stage in at least one of the two epochs (30&#x02005;s) following the train onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> The first of these was determined by that having at least 15&#x02005;s under influence of the event. Additionally, events for which the participants were awake in the epoch preceding train onset were excluded from the analysis. The whole procedure left 72.4% of the train events in the low-vibration condition and 66.1% of the train events in the high-vibration condition for analysis. In accordance with the literature, the screening interval for cardiac activations was set to 60&#x02005;s after train onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> In order to analyse change of HR, the average cardiac response from the 10&#x02005;s preceding the train event was used as a baseline value for each given event and subsequently subtracted from the cardiac response in each of the 60 1&#x02005;s time intervals following the train onset.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2013002655F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Visualisation of the analytical procedure. For each of the four experimental nights, HR data are taken out for each of the train-events (black lines of the events per night) for each participant.

Fake trains were defined as time intervals of 60&#x02005;s not accompanied by a real train event, distributed at time intervals approximately equally spaced between the actual exposure events. Twenty of these were introduced in the Low20 and High20 nights and 36 in the Low36 and High36 nights. Analysed HR data for these consisted of 70&#x02005;s, where 10&#x02005;s served as baseline for the following 60&#x02005;s. As with the real exposures, data where polysomnographical analysis indicated that participants were awake before onset or awoke during the two epochs following onset were excluded. All event-related 60&#x02005;s periods were subsequently averaged over nights with low or high vibration, respectively.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements was calculated comparing AuC in three factors: event (fake vs real-train), vibration level (low vs high) and number of trains (20 vs 36). The effects of noise sensitivity and gender were also analysed using ANOVA for repeated measurements with the between-subject factor noise sensitivity/gender and the within-subject factor vibration level (low vs high).

HR acceleration with two maxima was observed following train noise and vibration. One rapid and distinct initial HR increase is evident around 9&#x02005;s after train onset and a lengthier delayed increase is observed starting about 17&#x02005;s after train onset. In a similar study dealing with traffic noise alone, Griefahn <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> found an increase of HR matching our initial response but no delayed increase. A similar initial increase of HR has been found for pure tones during sleep.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> We propose that the second plateau is due to the additional vibration exposure, which seems to either act in isolation to result in cardiac response, or alternatively enhance or interact with any delayed effects of rail noise on HR. Supporting this interpretation, we see a significant difference between the low-vibration and high-vibration levels for the delayed, but not for the initial increase. The combined exposure might be a more pronounced alarming signal than noise alone and the HR alterations endure even after cessation of the actual exposure. In accordance with the previous literature on sleep disturbance due to noise exposure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref> the highest alterations of HR were found in REM sleep. This was observed for both the initial and delayed response.</p><p>Cardiac arousals are very likely induced by brain stem activation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> This subcortical activation may present a form of primary arousal in sleep and&#x02014;depending on the strength of activation and on sleep stage&#x02014;lead to cortical activation and arousal. Increased HR indicates subcortical arousal and enhances the probability of a cortical arousal with implications for sleep structure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> However, even HR acceleration without concomitant cortical arousal has been shown to have adverse effects on sleep structure. Guilleminault <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> showed that forced subcortical arousals accompany disturbed sleep and the persons are not necessarily aware of their disturbed sleep the following morning.</p><p>In the short term, arousals have positive effects by ensuring a higher level of behavioural responsiveness in the presence of external stimuli, while sleep is protected as far as possible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> However, in the long term, increased autonomic reaction might be harmful. As Kohler and Stradling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> point out in a review paper, recurrent arousals are one of the mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease in obstructive sleep apnoea. In this manner, the autonomic arousals provoked by passing trains may&#x02014;if continuing over a number of years &#x02014;contribute to the slightly enhanced myocardial infarction risk that has been found in people living in areas with high traffic exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17 R18">15&#x02013;18</xref> The study of Tassi <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> suggests that people living in areas with high railway noise for more than 10&#x02005;years can partly adjust their sleep to this adverse exposure. However, even after such a long-term exposure, significant alterations of HR due to a nocturnal railway traffic scenario have been found. In epidemiological studies, the effects of noise exposure alone are rather small.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17 R18">15&#x02013;18</xref> Our data suggest that the effect of chronic traffic exposure on cardiovascular disease might be higher if vibration is additionally taken into account. As described in the methods of this paper, we excluded events from the analysis where the persons woke up. This approach allows a focused estimation of HR reaction from traffic noise during sleep. However, as HR reactions are usually greater if accompanied by awakenings,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> our results very likely underestimate the effects. We found an average train-related increase of 3&#x02005;bpm in 79% of participants, supporting previously reported data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> It is not possible with the present study design to estimate the clinical relevance of these results. However, an increase of HR in sleep perhaps reflects a higher sympathetic tone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and this may contribute to the enhanced risk for hypertension in long-term traffic exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>Our results are less clear regarding the impact of interindividual differences. Previous epidemiological research has shown that persons who state being sensitive to noise report greater sleeping problems due to traffic than non-sensitive persons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> However, we found no significant effect of self-reported noise sensitivity on HR response towards nocturnal train events. During the day, it has been shown that self-declared highly noise sensitive persons have higher cardiovascular responses towards different ecologically relevant sounds, including traffic noise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> The sample size of sensitive and non-sensitive participants in our study is relatively small, and therefore non-significant results in particular have to be interpreted with caution. The sample size also limits any interpretation of gender effects. In coherence with the study of Griefahn, we found no significant gender differences in the initial HR amplitude.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> We found a tendency for enhanced delayed HR response in men with a rather strong effect size. This corresponds to results from several field studies, where enhanced traffic exposure related cardiovascular diseases were found in men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>We are aware of the limitations of the study: Regarding internal validity, the time resolution of the measurement could potentially lead to a smoothing of the averaged data, underestimating our results. Nevertheless, a clear effect of enhanced HR reaction in high vibration conditions can be seen. We argue that vibration exposure is responsible for the second plateau. However, a vibration-alone condition, that is, in the absence of noise, is needed to confirm this. With respect to external validity, the study is limited to the homogeneous group of young and healthy participants. To generalise the results, a broader age range would be preferable and the study should be replicated in field conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, the combined exposure of freight train noise and vibration influenced HR during sleep, whereby HR amplitudes increase with increasing vibration level. This provoked acceleration may affect cardiovascular functioning in the long term<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> and could be a mechanism explaining the previous findings of cardiovascular disease in persons exposed to traffic in general<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15 R16 R17 R18">14&#x02013;18</xref> and rail traffic in particular.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> To study the specific influence of vibration in contrast to noise, further studies are required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e136" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002655.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e137" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002655.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the volunteers for participation in the study.
