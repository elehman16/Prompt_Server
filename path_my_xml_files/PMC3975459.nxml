Despite many years of clinical experience, the pathophysiology of OHSS is poorly understood and there is no reliable test to predict patients who will subsequently develop severe OHSS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Of notice, that while investigating randomized controlled trials that aimed to prevent of severe OHSS, we found that different studies defined high-risk patients by different estradiol (E2) threshold levels, ranging from 1906 to 6000&#x000a0;pg/ml, most used a level of ~3000&#x000a0;pg/ml
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, when all the predictive variables for severe OHSS were combined, the prevalence of severe OHSS in the ostensibly high risk patients was only about <italic>20%</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] an extremely low value for a good predictive measure (false positive-80%).</p><p>Furthermore, there are no precise methods to completely prevent severe OHSS, except for withholding the ovulation-inducing trigger of hCG, or replacing hCG with GnRH agonist (GnRHa) to trigger ovulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, due to the reported significantly reduced clinical pregnancy and increased first trimester pregnancy loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] using the GnRH antagonist controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocol with GnRHa trigger, efforts have been made to improve reproductive outcome, by manipulating the luteal phase. The three suggested optional strategies aiming to improve outcome are freeze-all policy; fresh transfer and intensive luteal support; and fresh transfer and low-dose HCG supplementation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>One bolus of 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG 35&#x000a0;h after the triggering bolus of GnRHa (on day of oocytes retrieval) was demonstrated to rescue the luteal phase, resulting in a reproductive outcome comparable with that of HCG triggering, and with no increased risk of OHSS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, in a recently published retrospective study, Seyhan et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have challenged the safety of the GnRHa trigger with HCG rescue. They examined whether GnRHa trigger and 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG luteal rescue protocol, completely prevented severe OHSS. Of the 23 patients evaluated, 6 (26%) developed severe OHSS, 5 of whom had severe early OHSS requiring ascites drainage and hospitalization. Figure that is comparable to the aforementioned 20% prevalence of severe OHSS, in high risk patients.</p><p>Since early OHSS occurs 3&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days following hCG trigger for final follicular maturation, it is our policy to withhold the 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG luteal rescue bolus and to follow and re-evaluate these patients for 3&#x000a0;days after oocyte retrieval [day of embryo transfer (ET)] for signs of <italic>early</italic> moderate OHSS. Only those patients with no signs of early OHSS are instructed to inject 1500&#x000a0;IU of HCG. By deferring the hCG bolus by 3&#x000a0;days (5&#x000a0;days following GnRHa trigger), we believe that we are actually offering the hCG to 80% of the <italic>a priori</italic> at risk patients (the aforementioned- detection rate c&#x02019; 80% false positive), who are not supposed to develop severe early OHSS, while avoiding hCG luteal rescue to the &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; 20-26%

In our practice, normal and high-responder patients undergoing their first IVF attempt are offered the COH with a GnRH antagonist
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With this strategy we are able to substitute hCG with the GnRHa to trigger ovulation in those at risk to develop severe OHSS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In those achieving &#x02265;20 oocytes, the freeze all policy with the subsequent frozen-thawed ET, is usually recommended. However, if less than 20 oocytes are retrieved, patients are instructed to start an intensive luteal support with estradiol and progesterone and are evaluated 3&#x000a0;days after oocyte retrieval for signs of <italic>early</italic> moderate OHSS. A bolus of 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG is offered <italic>only</italic> to those with no signs of early moderate OHSS.</p><p>In this small series of 11 patients, we demonstrated that by deferring the hCG bolus by 3&#x000a0;days (5&#x000a0;days following GnRHa trigger, instead of day of oocytes retrieval), we are still able to rescue the corpus luteum, with an observed extremely high midluteal progesterone levels and with no cases of severe OHSS. This observation is in accordance with previous studies, in the human as well as the animal model, that demonstrated corpus luteum rescue after three days of LH deprivation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, in their elegant rhesus monkeys model, Hutchinson and Zeleznik have demonstrated the restoration of gonadotropin secretion following 3-day gonadotropin deprivation period, during the early (days 2&#x02013;5) and mid (days 8&#x02013;11) luteal phase (but not in the late&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;13&#x000a0;days), that resulted in resumption of progesterone secretion which continued for a period of time which effectively completed the typical lifespan of the corpus luteum

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], demonstrating an extremely high prevalence of severe OHSS following 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG bolus on day of oocytes retrieval, it seems that those patients triggered by GnRHa for final oocytes maturation, remain with two treatment options: (a) the freeze-all policy- notwithstanding the recent improvement in live birth rates after replacement frozen-thawed vitrified oocytes/embryos, it should be emphasized, that in most centers, there is still a gap in live birth rates between fresh and frozen/thawed cycles (in favor of fresh cycle); and (b) intensive luteal support of estradiol and progesterone- the data regarding the efficacy of this modality are still inconclusive. While comparing our experience with GnRHa trigger before
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and after modifying our luteal-phase support to the intensive support with E2 and progesterone, we could not demonstrate any differences in peak E2 levels, fertilization rate, number of embryos transferred or implantation and pregnancy rates, between the two luteal support regimens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, in both groups of luteal support following GnRH-a trigger, implantation and pregnancy rates were lower compared to HCG trigger
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the search for an optimal luteal support regimen to patients receiving GnRHa trigger should be continued.</p><p>In the present study, with its inherent limitation due to the small sample size, we offer a new treatment modality that clearly supports the concept of rescuing the corpus luteum, despite the 3&#x000a0;days delay in hCG administration (3&#x000a0;days following oocytes retrieval). This delay offers the ability to differentiate between those who will benefit from hCG without developing severe OHSS (the 80% false positive) and those who will not. Moreover, the observed reasonable pregnancy rate achieved, with no patient developing severe OHSS are promising, and mandate further large prospective randomized studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>COH using GnRH antagonist co-treatment and GnRHa trigger, combined with 1500&#x000a0;IU hCG luteal rescue, is a promising protocol, aiming to reduce (<italic>rather than eliminating</italic>) severe early OHSS, in one hand, and to improve reproductive outcome, in the other. However, according to the present proof of concept study, in the meantime and until further prospective randomized studies elucidating the appropriate dose and timing of HCG administration will appear, we believe that hCG luteal rescue should be offered 3&#x000a0;days after oocytes retrieval only to those patients with no signs of early moderate OHSS
