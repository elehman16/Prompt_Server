Laboratory evaluations were performed at screening, baseline, every two weeks during the initial 24-week study, and every six weeks during the 24-week extension phase.

Each relapse was confirmed by the treating neurologist based on the objective assessment by the examining neurologist (blinded to treatment allocation). The examining neurologist had to document either: a 1-point increase in two or more functional system (FS) functions or a 2-point increase in one or more FS function (excluding bowel/bladder and cerebral); or an increase of &#x02265;0.5 points in the EDSS score (or an increase of &#x02265;1 if the EDSS score was 0) from the previous clinically stable assessment.</p></sec><sec id="sec8-2055217315618687"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The safety population was defined as all randomized patients exposed to study medication; analyses were conducted according to the treatment received and evaluation was based on review of individual values and descriptive statistics. Efficacy analyses were performed on the modified intent-to-treat population defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose of the double-blind study medication; analyses were conducted according to the group to which patients were randomized.

Each permutation sample was analyzed using the analysis of covariance model, adjusting for baseline volume of T1-Gd lesions, treatment, and region.

Both doses of teriflunomide added to GA demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability compared with placebo plus GA during the core study and extension phase. After 48 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients reporting at least one AE was similar among all treatment groups. Few patients experienced SAEs or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Only one patient in each of the 14&#x02009;mg and placebo groups had ALT increases &#x0003e;5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;ULN, and no cases meeting Hy&#x02019;s Law criteria were reported. Although the proportion of patients with AEs related to hematologic parameters (neutrophils &#x0003c;1500 cells/&#x000b5;L) was higher in teriflunomide-treated patients, none of the events led to treatment discontinuation. The nature and incidence of AEs in this study are comparable to findings from teriflunomide monotherapy studies, TEMSO and TOWER,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2055217315618687" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2055217315618687" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> as well as safety observations from a study of teriflunomide as an add-on therapy to IFN-&#x003b2;.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2055217315618687" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Our data support the safety of teriflunomide when added to ongoing GA therapy and, by extension, as a sequential treatment for patients previously treated with GA.</p><p>This study was not sufficiently powered to assess the efficacy of teriflunomide as an add-on therapy to GA; the lack of a teriflunomide-only arm, and the greater baseline MRI disease activity in the 7&#x02009;mg group, further limit interpretation of efficacy outcomes. Nevertheless, we observed a general pattern of lower MRI activity in the teriflunomide groups compared with placebo, indicative of a lack of a negative drug&#x02013;drug interaction between teriflunomide and GA. We also noted a significant reduction in the number of T1-Gd lesions in the 7&#x02009;mg group and a reduction in T1-Gd lesion volume in the 14&#x02009;mg group at 24 and 48 weeks.

There may be a number of possible explanations for this difference; for example, it may relate to differences in the interactions of individual agents, or differences in the study populations. Importantly, comparisons across studies are associated with many other limitations. The positive safety observations from this study provide assurance for the safety of overlapping usage for short duration, and suggest no concern about immediate switching between GA and teriflunomide therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by Genzyme, a Sanofi company.
