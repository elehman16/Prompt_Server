During space flight, weightlessness leads to an increase in height of intervertebral discs (IVDs), resulting in an elongation of the spine up to several centimeters[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Astronauts frequently report moderate to severe lower back pain that seems to be of discogenic origin and probably results from IVD expansion[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This back pain is typically located in the lumbar spine and its intensity usually decreases in the fetal tuck position (bending the knees to the chest)[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether the increase in disc volume is solely caused by water influx or if the amount of other tissue components, such as the protein content, changes in microgravity as well[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Atrophy of the paraspinal muscles has been observed in space flight participants and discussed to contribute to IVD pathologies[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In addition to in-flight back pain, astronauts have an increased risk of nucleus pulposus herniation, particularly in the immediate post-flight period[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the literature, possible changes in IVD morphology such as tissue degeneration are discussed as causative factors. However, the underlying structural or pathophysiological processes within the IVD are currently not entirely understood[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The same type of back pain as experienced by astronauts during spaceflight has been reported in bed-rest studies with 6&#x000b0; head down tilt[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Bed-rest studies have proven to be a good analog to spaceflight in IVD research[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The T2 relaxation time has been shown to correlate with the amount of water, the glycosaminoglycan and collagen content, as well as the stage of degeneration of IVD tissue[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. LeBlanc et al.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] measured T2 relaxation times in the &#x0201c;hydrated portion of disc&#x0201d; in a five-week bed-rest study, and found a decrease in T2-time in L1/2 to L5/S1 throughout horizontal bed-rest. LeBlanc et al. later published data from spaceflight and bed rest that showed an increase in T2 time[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We recently investigated lumbar IVDs in bed-rest with the dGEMRIC-method[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Findings seem to indicate an increase in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout bed-rest, but some results were hard to interpret[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Diurnal variation in the hydration of IVDs has been known for a long time, and some studies have indicated a &#x0201c;redistribution&#x0201d; of fluid shifting between the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus throughout the loading/unloading-cycle[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When the opportunity arose to measure T2 relaxation times in a bed-rest-study conducted by the European Space Agency, and organized as a cross-over trial with two campaigns to test the effects of oral potassium bicarbonate on subjects undergoing bed-rest, we decided to perform measurements of T2 relaxation time to see if we can confirm LeBlanc et al.&#x02019;s results. In addition we were interested in the effect of the oral potassium bicarbonate supplementation on IVD composition. To our knowledge it is currently unknown whether oral potassium bicarbonate supplementation has an effect on IVD physiology. In theory, the alkaline characteristics of the supplement might affect the pH environment and possibly lead to an outward water shift from the IVD tissue. We therefore hypothesized a decrease in T2-time to occur with the supplement[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and an increase in T2-time through bed-rest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study setting</title><p>The &#x0201c;NUC&#x0201d;-study was funded by the European Space Agency and took place in the Institute of Aerospace Medicine of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, Germany.

The entire bed-rest-study included two campaigns for each subject, with a wash-out period of 154 days in between. The aim was to investigate a nutritional countermeasure for bone loss (oral application of potassium bicarbonate 30mmol/tablet three times a day) in a cross-over design[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The measurements presented here were conducted in both campaigns (schedule of the measurement times in each campaign: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For organisational reasons, the measurements pre-bed-rest (BDC-2) and 5 days after bed-rest (R+5) were taken in the afternoon while the measurement one day after bed-rest (R+1) was performed in the morning that follows the day subjects got up again.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study schedule and measurements.

Reambulation from bed-rest took place in the morning of R+0. Throughout bed-rest, participants remained in bed 24h/day with at least one shoulder on the mattress at any time. All hygienic procedures, food intake and experiments took place in this position without exception. Compliance with the protocol was ensured by video surveillance and by staff. Subjects did not undergo exercise or training. Psychologists gave psychological support and medical doctors looked after the subjects in daily ward rounds. Weighing all ingredients, food items and beverages for each test subject to prevent changes in bodyweight strictly controlled the dietary intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Subject selection</title><p>Only male subjects were recruited for this study because the European Space Agency expected hormonal variations in female subjects to mimic effects in some of the experiments.

While the R+1 and R+5 measurements of this subject are missing, the acquired data was used for the present analysis. All measurements of the other seven subjects with an average age of 27.6 (SD 3.3) years and an average body mass of 78.6 (SD 6.4) kg were collected and analyzed successfully. There were no adverse events in connection with the MRI measurements.</p><p>The main finding was a significant increase in T2-time within the IVDs Th12/L1 to L5/S1 throughout 21 d of 6&#x000b0;HDT bed rest (p&#x0003c;0.001). T2-time (averaged over all IVDs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) increased significantly between BDC-2 and R+1 (p&#x0003c;0.001). Between R+1 and R+5, T2-time in turn decreased significantly (p&#x0003c;0.001), but still remained above baseline levels even at R+5 (p=0.001). Similar changes in T2-time were observed in all investigated IVDs (Th12/L1 to L5/S1). Overall, T2-time was longer in the more cranial IVDs, shortening towards the more caudal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). Within the IVDs (segmentation according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>), T2-time was longest in segment 3 that consists of nucleus pulposus tissue, shorter in segments 2 and 4 that contain both partially nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus, and shortest in segments 1 and 5 representing anulus fibrosus tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Differences between segments were significant (p&#x0003c;0.001). The bed-rest-effect on T2-time was more pronounced in the nucleus pulposus than in the anulus fibrosus (p&#x0003c;0.001). The average Pfirrmann-grade was 2.0 (SD 0.95). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref> shows the Pfirrmann-grade plotted against T2-time. Intervertebral discs with a Pfirrmann-grade &#x0003e;2 were excluded from the analysis because there was only one case each. T2-time significantly differed between Pfirrmann-grades (p&#x0003c;0.001).

T2-values were significantly higher prior to the intervention in the intervention group compared to the group without intervention (BDC-2, p&#x0003c;0.001).

Furthermore, the effect of an intervention with oral potassium bicarbonate on T2-time in the lumbar IVDs was approached in a cross-over design.</p><p>Results of the present study showed a significant increase in T2-time after bed-rest in Th12/L1 to L5/S1, and a partial decrease after four days reambulation, but no effect of oral potassium bicarbonate supplementation on the T2-time measured in IVD tissue. The hypothesis that T2-time increases in lumbar IVDs throughout bed rest could not be rejected. The second hypothesis that T2-time decreases through oral supplementation of potassium bicarbonate was rejected.</p><p>The strengths of the study were its well-controlled test environment in the bed-rest facility, including standardized nutrition and enforcement of strict bed-rest, a very high standard in subject selection including medical and psychological parameters, and good quality of the acquired data. A weakness was the low number of subjects due to the complex nature of bed-rest studies.</p><p>T2- relaxation time has been shown to correlate with the amount of water and the glycosaminoglycan content of IVD tissue[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Detiger et al. demonstrated a linear decrease in T2-time with increasing IVD degeneration[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Marinelli et al.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that T2 relaxation times correlate strongly with the IVD water content and weakly with proteoglycan content. In addition, T2 relaxation times in lumbar IVDs correlate with the stage of degeneration and with patient age[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The increase in T2-time throughout bed-rest may be interpreted as an increase in the amount of free water within the IVDs. This finding is in accordance with other studies where an increase in lumbar IVD height was found[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], including LeBlanc et al.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] We could not confirm the findings of LeBlanc et al. from 1988[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who measured a decrease in T2-time and interpreted it as a loss of water of IVD tissue, but our results are in line with later findings of LeBlanc et al.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The intervention with oral potassium bicarbonate did not show an effect on IVD T2-time. Buehlmeier et al.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that oral potassium bicarbonate can influence bone and protein physiology in terms of a reduction of bone loss and protein catabolism during bed-rest.</p><p>The present results showed significant differences in T2-times between different Pfirrmann-grades. A correlation that can be expressed as a function, however, could not be found. We can therefore not confirm the results of Detiger et al.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who found a linear decrease in T2 relaxation time with increasing Pfirrmann grade. The reason is probably the low number of participants in our study.</p><p>Summarizing the study results, an increase in T2-relaxation time was found after bedrest. This increase may be interpreted as an increase in free water and/or glycosaminoglycans/collagen within the IVDs tissue. In case an increase in glycosaminoglycans throughout bed-rest can be confirmed with other methods, controlled bed-rest schemes (not necessarily en-bloc, but possibly for a few hours per day) might be considered a treatment option in IVD pathologies, under consideration of comorbidities such as coagulopathy and cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Future research should not only consider further methods, but also focus on the thoracic and cervical spine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic>We would like to express our gratitude towards the subjects for their willingness to participate in the NUC-study.
