Whether part of this protective effect could be mediated through local up-regulation of PTX3 in vascular endothelial cells remains to be clarified.

The patients were assigned to medical therapy (251), PCI (197), or CABG (52) based on the clinical judgment of their cardiologists who were blinded to the results of the SYNTAX score. Data on age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol levels, as well as on echocardiographically determined ejection fraction were obtained from patients' hospital records.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>We certified that all applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers were followed during this research.

Analyses were performed using Cusabio kits (Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China) for hs-CRP. Plasma PTX3 concentration was measured by using a commercially available Human PTX3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (CUSABIO BIOTECH CO., Ltd., Wuhan, China). Details of the assay have been described elsewhere.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29)</xref> Briefly, the microtiter plates provided in the kit were pre-coated with an antibody specific to PTX3. Standards or samples were then added to the appropriate microtiter plate wells with a biotin-conjugated antibody preparation specific for PTX3, and Avidin conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase was added to each micro-plate well and incubated. Then, the TMB (3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine) substrate solution was added to each well. The enzyme-substrate reaction was terminated by the addition of sulphuric acid solution and the color change was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450&#x000b1;2 nm. A Selectra 2 auto-analyzer (Vital Scientific, Spankeren, Netherlands) was used to analyze the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic angiographic examinations</title><p>Diagnostic angiography was performed in all of the participants within 24 hours of the diagnosis of MI or unstable angina and in participants with chronic stable angina who had at least one positive noninvasive test result {e.g., positive stress tolerance treadmill electrocardiogram (ECG)}. Angiographies were done by Judkins right and left catheters, all through femoral artery and by Germany's Siemens Axiom Artis DFC ZEE floor-mounted device. Interpretation of angiographs was performed by two expert cardiologists who were blinded to the blood tests results (femoral artery PTX3 levels). The quantification analysis of obstructions after calibration of the catheter was performed by moving the cursor from the proximal through the distal of each vessel for revealing the length and severity of the obstruction. All three coronary arteries (right CA, left CA, and lateral circumflex). Quantitative coronary angiography was performed in biplane views. The measurement of SYNTAX score was retrospectively performed on baseline angiograms. The SYNTAX score was calculated using Calculator 2.11 (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.syntaxscore.com">http://www.syntaxscore.com</ext-link>). The SYNTAX score was calculated in accordance with the algorithm, which is the sequential morphological evaluation of dominance; number of lesions; segments involved per lesion; and presence of total occlusion, trifurcation, bifurcation, aorto-ostial lesion, severe tortuosity, length &#x0003e;20 mm, heavy calcification, thrombus, and diffuse/small vessels in lesions for each patient.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref> The score was independently analyzed by the cardiologist. To decrease interobserver variation, the scores were measured by the same cardiologist. A low SYNTAX score was defined as values &#x0003c;23 since the 3-year SYNTAX results suggest that CABG remains the standard of care for patients with complex disease (intermediate i.e., 23-33 or high SYNTAX scores i.e., &#x0003e;33) and that PCI may be an acceptable alternative revascularization method to CABG when treating patients with less complex (lower SYNTAX Score) disease.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref> As such, we ascertained complex coronary artery stenosis among participants with a SYNTAX score &#x02265;23.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling for determining pentraxin 3 and high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations</title><p>Before angiography, a blood sample was taken from the femoral artery.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, systemic arterial levels of PTX3 were associated with SYNTAX scores in a curvilinear fashion. The association curve was hyperbolic with three critical values. The minimum value of the SYNTAX score corresponded to the systemic arterial PTX3 level of 0.15 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup>, the maximum value to 0.45 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup>, and the point of inflection to 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup>. When we examined the diagnostic value of the systemic arterial PTX3 at the cutpoint of 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup>, which corresponded to the SYNTAX score of 23, we observed that the sensitivity was 0.66 (95% CIs 0.57-0.74), the specificity was 0.94 (95% CIs 0.91-0.96), the positive predictive value was 0.79 (95% CIs 0.70-0.87), and the negative predictive value was 0.89 (95% CIs 0.85-0.92).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, the predictive performance of the basic model incorporating traditional CAD risk factors was significantly improved when systemic arterial PTX3 levels were also introduced into the basic model.

The discriminatory power of systemic arterial levels of PTX3 for a high SYNTAX score was outstanding.</p><p>Herein, we have extended our previous finding of the predictability of PTX3 for the presence/absence of coronary artery stenosis to the angiographic complexity of coronary artery stenosis. This finding provides a basis upon which longitudinal studies can be designed and performed to evaluate how PTX3, as a stand-alone or in combination with the SYNTAX score, predicts post-MI adverse effects. Our observations will be practically appealing when seen in light of the fact that when using the SYNTAX score, physicians are still challenged with a labor-intensive calculation and conflicting results from validation studies.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref> When we examined the diagnostic value of the systemic arterial PTX3 at the cutpoint of 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>1</sup>, which corresponded to the SYNTAX score of 23, we observed that the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 0.66, 0.94, 0.79, and 0.89, respectively. These findings provide clear evidence that before information from angiographic examinations is available, if the PTX3 cutpoint of 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup> is applied, 89% of the patients with a low PTX3 level will not need CABG as indicated by the high SYNTAX score; meanwhile only 6% of the patients with a low SYNTAX score had a high PTX3 level. This indicates that the systemic arterial PTX3 level of 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup> was highly specific for diagnosing complex coronary artery stenosis.</p><p>The SYNTAX score is increasingly attracting attention as an anatomically-based tool that helps cardiologists to objectively determine the complexity of CAD and to guide in decision-making between CABG surgery and PCI. External validity of the clinical usefulness of the SYNTAX score for identifying higher-risk patients and for aiding in decision-making between CABG and PCI has been confirmed by numerous studies and in a broad range of patients.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref> Experienced angiographic core laboratory technicians have been reported to quickly achieve highly reproducible SYNTAX score measurements. In contrast, agreement among the interventional cardiologists after the basic tutorial has been reported to be initially poor but to improve considerably after further training with the angiographic core laboratory technicians. These findings have important implications for adoption of the SYNTAX score methodology in routine practice and future clinical trials.<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref></p><p>We have previously quantified the improvement in estimating pretest probability of CAD offered by systemic arterial PTX3 over the traditional CAD risk factors. Systemic arterial PTX3 helped to more accurately reclassify patients with intermediate-risk chronic stable angina. After allowing for the effect of systemic arterial PTX3, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) did no longer confer any protective effect, suggesting that the atheroprotective effect of HDL-C was mediated by PTX3. This finding shows that PTX3 might be a marker of CAD, the level of which increases to regulate the inflammation.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref> Most recently it has been shown that among patients with chronic stable angina, PTX3 is more tightly associated with the complexity and severity of CAD than hs-CRP and it was found to be an independent predictor for high SYNTAX score.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref></p><p>Experienced cardiologists' gestalt is useful in estimating the pretest probability for adverse outcomes and is complementary to diagnostic testing, such as stress tolerance treadmill ECG. However, it is unclear whether the recently developed prediction rule, using explicit features of angiographic examination, is comparable with cardiologists' gestalt. If it is so, the SYNTAX score would be powerful tool because it could be used by less-experienced cardiologists to simplify the prognostication of MACEs. The important finding of our study was the near perfect concordance between the decisions made by the cardiologists based on their clinical judgment and the SYNTAX score. The clinical judgment of experienced cardiologists and the SYNTAX score that can be used by the cardiologists having varying experience showed similar accuracy in discriminating patients who need CABG from those who need PCI.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study lie in its design, setting, and appropriate statistical approach. We recruited patients who were assigned to varying treatment methods including PCI and CABG. Our findings, however, need to be interpreted in light of its limitations. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the current study we were not able to compare the prognostic significance of PTX3 with that of the SYNTAX score for MACEs. We did not have data on PTX3 concentration in the vein, which might be more easily available. However, we have previously shown that systemic arterial levels of PTX3 have a good correlation with coronary sinus levels of PTX3, which can represent the venous blood concentration of PTX3.</p><p>If PTX3 is confirmed to be predictive of MACEs by prospective studies in the future, it can supplement the prognostic power of SYNTAX score in predicting post-MI adverse outcomes.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the predictive ability of the systemic arterial levels of PTX3 for the angiographic complexity of CAD as measured by the SYNTAX score and observed that the systemic arterial levels of PTX3 were associated with the SYNTAX score in an almost hyperbolic fashion. The discriminatory power of the systemic arterial levels of PTX3 for high SYNTAX score was excellent. The systemic arterial PTX3 level of 0.29 ng &#x000b7; dL<sup>-1</sup> was highly specific for diagnosing complex coronary artery stenosis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
