If structured sequence processing supports language, then it may be possible to improve language function by enhancing this foundational learning ability. The goal of the present study was to use a novel computerized training task as a means to better understand the relationship between structured sequence processing and language function. Participants first were assessed on pre-training tasks to provide baseline behavioral measures of structured sequence processing and language abilities. Participants were then quasi-randomly assigned to either a treatment group involving adaptive structured visuospatial sequence training, a treatment group involving adaptive non-structured visuospatial sequence training, or a control group. Following four days of sequence training, all participants were assessed with the same pre-training measures. Overall comparison of the post-training means revealed no group differences. However, in order to examine the potential relations between sequence training, structured sequence processing, and language ability, we used a mediation analysis that showed two competing effects. In the indirect effect, adaptive sequence training with structural regularities had a positive impact on structured sequence processing performance, which in turn had a positive impact on language processing. This finding not only identifies a potential novel intervention to treat language impairments but also may be the first demonstration that structured sequence processing can be improved and that this, in turn, has an impact on language processing. However, in the direct effect, adaptive sequence training with structural regularities had a direct negative impact on language processing. This unexpected finding suggests that adaptive training with structural regularities might potentially interfere with language processing. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of pursuing designs that promote a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying training-related changes, so that regimens can be developed that help reduce these types of negative effects while simultaneously maximizing the benefits to outcome measures of interest.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Data collection and manuscript preparation was supported by the following grants from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: T32DC000012, R01DC000111, and R01DC012037.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The acquisition of natural language may be one of the more formidable tasks facing human beings, and yet we are exceptionally proficient at it. Understanding the core mechanisms responsible for the ability to learn language has been a particular challenge in cognitive neuroscience. One long-standing, prominent argument has been that humans have dedicated domain-specific neural mechanisms that evolved specifically for language acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An alternative hypothesis is that language acquisition may rely heavily on domain-general learning and processing abilities that allow the learner to utilize the structure inherent in language [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One such domain-general mechanism that may support language acquisition has been referred to as structured sequence processing (SSP), or the ability to extract, encode, and represent structured patterns occurring in a temporal sequence [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. If SSP supports language, then it may be possible to improve language function by enhancing this basic learning ability, similar to the way that computerized working memory (WM) training has been demonstrated to transfer to non-trained tasks of executive function, attention, and other aspects of cognition [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The possibility of improving SSP through adaptive training, with improvements generalizing to aspects of language processing, has both clinical and theoretical ramifications as it would not only identify a novel intervention to treat language impairments but would also identify a more direct relationship between SSP and language.</p><p>In this paper, we will first review recent evidence that SSP may underlie language learning, underscoring the scarcity of literature using experimental manipulations to investigate the two processes. We will then review relevant findings from the WM training literature, which served as inspiration for the structure-based sequence training regimen used in the present study. This background will then lead to a description of our study using a novel computerized sequence training task and a mediational analysis to explore the relationship between SSP and language function.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Previous Evidence Linking SSP to Language</title><p>SSP, sometimes referred to as sequential learning or statistical learning, allows people to learn about structured patterns of information in the environment in a relatively automatic and unconscious fashion [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Importantly, SSP abilities may be especially crucial for the development of social and linguistic knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SSP allows the language learner to detect and to utilize the structure inherent in phonology [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], syntax [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and word order [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, impairments in SSP may contribute to a number of communication disorders, including dyslexia [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], specific language impairment [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and language delays observed in hearing impairment [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Research findings have indicated that individual differences in performance on non-linguistic sequential learning tasks are significantly correlated with how healthy typically-developing adults perform on a degraded speech perception task, in which participants must use preceding context to predict upcoming units of speech [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], see also [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, Christiansen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] provided a within-subject comparison of the neural mechanisms supporting visual sequence learning and language processing using event-related potentials (ERPs). The key finding was that sequences containing structural irregularities in the SSP task elicited a P600-like component that was statistically identical to the P600 elicited by syntactic violations in the natural language task. This outcome suggests that the same neural mechanisms may be recruited for both SSP and language processing, a finding that is also substantiated by other neuroimaging studies showing that Broca&#x02019;s area is active in both language and non-language SSP tasks e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; for reviews, see [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Although these studies are highly promising, more direct evidence of a link between SSP and language is needed. One particularly striking void in the type of approach used thus far is the pursuit of designs that incorporate experimental manipulations designed to improve SSP, as a way to help demonstrate an underlying link between SSP and language. Even a first step in this direction could have potential implications for how to improve language functioning in typical and atypical development.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Cognitive Training</title><p>If language development relies, at least in part, on SSP, then it may be beneficial to improve language function by enhancing SSP itself. One strategy for this might be to stimulate neural regions, such as Broca&#x02019;s area, that are thought to underlie SSP using magnetic or electrical stimulation e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Another possibility would be to use computerized neurocognitive training techniques to improve SSP. One cognitive domain that has received much interest in the cognitive training literature and may be relevant to the current endeavor is WM. WM refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of information necessary for complex cognitive tasks [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While the training tasks and populations have varied, the general goal of a number of recent studies has been to determine whether WM training tasks could improve WM capacity and show transfer to non-trained tasks of spatial and verbal WM, attention, and other cognitive functions. Sometimes this distinction is referred to as &#x0201c;near transfer&#x0201d; (transfer effects to constructs closely related to the training technique itself) and &#x0201c;far transfer&#x0201d; (transfer effects to other constructs thought to have a theoretical link with what is being trained). For example, Klingberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used a WM training task (Cogmed Systems, Stockholm, Sweden) with children with ADHD. The children performed visuospatial and/or verbal WM tasks over a period of 5 weeks. The visuospatial task involved remembering the position of objects on a 4 x 4 grid, and the verbal task involved remembering phonemes, letters or digits [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, difficulty level of the tasks was adjusted to match each child&#x02019;s WM ability by changing the number of elements that had to be recalled. A control group performed the same tasks except the length of items to recall stayed fixed rather than being adaptively adjusted. At post training sessions both 5 to 6 weeks and 3 months following the pre measures, children showed significant improvement to performance on WM and executive functions (as measured by a visuospatial Span board task, digit span, Stroop task, and Raven&#x02019;s matrices) compared to a control group.</p><p>Overall, the results from a number of recent WM training studies suggest that WM can be improved through adaptive training [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, training on an adaptive visuospatial task can also transfer in a domain-general manner to nontrained tasks of WM (demonstrating near transfer) but also to other cognitive functions such as inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], attention [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and verbal WM [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (demonstrating far transfer).</p><p>Although there have been some questions about the effectiveness of WM training [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and especially in relation to the far transfer results, these findings raise the possibility that WM and other aspects of cognition, perhaps even SSP, can be modifiable by intensive training. The difference between the standard WM task and SSP is that WM involves recalling a series of stimuli that have no structural relationship to each other; that is, the stimuli are presented in a random order. On the other hand, many of our interactions with the world involve encoding, storing, and processing structural regularities, in which SSP is recruited. For this reason, we propose that to target and train SSP it is necessary to embed structured rather than random sequences into the training protocol.</p><p>To summarize, the previous evidence suggests that language functions may rely, at least in part, on SSP. Furthermore, recent findings from the WM training literature are promising because they offer the possibility that SSP could be improved, which if successful, could possibly lead to improvements to language processing. Finally, it may be beneficial to use the results from this type of intervention design in conjunction with process modeling techniques to provide more insight about the putative underlying relations among the constructs. We will now describe the present study, which combines all of these elements to specifically test whether adaptive training with structural regularities has a contributory impact on language via the mediation of SSP.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The Present Study</title><p>The goal of the present study was to investigate the putative underlying relationship between domain-general structure-based learning mechanisms (i.e., SSP) and language functions by exploring the effect of adaptive sequence training with structural regularities (SSP training) versus adaptive sequence training without structural regularities (WM training), relative to a control or reference group. Participants in the SSP training group engaged in a 4-day computerized sequence training regimen that involved viewing and then reproducing visual-spatial structured sequences. This type of training is similar to previous WM training studies; however, our novel manipulation for this group was the introduction of sequences containing structural regularities. Thus, rather than having those participants trained with random sequences (as in the case of all previous WM training studies), they were trained with non-random, structured patterns. For the second group, which we refer to as the WM training group, these participants engaged in the same computerized sequence training task but instead of using structured sequences, the sequences contained no structure, consistent with all other previous WM training studies.</p><p>Participants received a battery of cognitive tests on the first day, then four days of either the SSP training condition, the WM training condition, or the control condition (which, similar to the control groups used in previous WM training studies, consisted of a non-adaptive computerized training that is not expected to result in cognitive improvements). On the sixth day participants received the same battery of cognitive tests that were administered on the first day in order to measure changes to non-trained tasks. The group of participants engaging in the adaptive sequence training with structural regularities (SSP training, Group 1) and the group of participants engaging in the adaptive sequence training without structural regularities (WM training, Group 2) were both compared to a control group that engaged in nonadaptive, unstructured sequences (Group 3).
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Thus, the first hypothesis for this study was simply that only the SSP training would result in improvements to both a non-trained SSP task and a language processing task. This hypothesis was examined through the use of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) comparing group means of SSP and language processing.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>However, regardless as to the results of the MANOVA, there is a second and perhaps more useful way to analyze these data. Whereas all of the previous WM training studies used as their primary analyses a comparison of the means on non-trained task from pre- to post-training, the present study also used a mediation model. This analysis approach has the ability to explore the core mechanisms or processes underlying any such relation between cognitive training and language processing by investigating whether there exists a mediating relationship among the variables. It can also help tease apart the separate influences relating to near and far transfer effects, and help explain why one or the other might be present. With the mediation model technique, we may be better able to understand the effects of cognitive training on SSP and language processing. A MANOVA or other regression technique does not allow for the identification of mediating variables and, thus, is unable to help clarify the nature of the relations among training, SSP, and language processing.</p><p>A mediation analysis allows one to explain the mechanism by which one variable influences, or has an effect, on another [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both &#x0201c;direct&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;indirect&#x0201d; effects can be tested [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Direct effects are when the independent variable (IV) directly impacts the dependent variable (DV). Indirect effects are when the IV impacts the DV through the mediation of a third variable, called the mediator (M). Hayes and Preacher [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] introduced a technique for conducting a mediation analysis when the IV is multicategorical, as in the case of the present study comparing two experimental groups to a control group. Since the effects of being in one of the experimental groups are in comparison to the effects of being in a reference group, they suggest using the terms &#x0201c;relative direct effects&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;relative indirect effects&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, the IV is training type [i.e., whether participants receive SSP training (Group 1), or WM training (Group 2), with both compared to the control participants (Group 3]. The DV is language processing (measured at post-training). The M is SSP ability (also measured at post-training). Thus, our aim is to test the relative direct and indirect effects through which cognitive training might affect language processing. Specifically, does cognitive training have a relative direct impact on language processing? And, does cognitive training have a relative indirect effect on language processing by impacting SSP ability?</p><p>The untested model is presented in <xref rid="pone.0127148.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. For both experimental training groups (i.e., Group 1 and Group 2), path <italic>a</italic> x <italic>b</italic> represents the relative indirect effect of the IV (training type) on the DV (language) via the mediator, M (SSP) (relative to the reference group, Group 3). Path <italic>a</italic> represents the effect of the IV on M, whereas path <italic>b</italic> represents the effect of M on the DV. On the other hand, path <italic>c'</italic> represents the relative direct effect of the IV on the DV (relative to the reference group, Group 3). The relative total effect (path <italic>c</italic>, not depicted in the untested model) would represent the sum of the direct and indirect effects (compared to the reference group). Again, our focus was testing, for Group 1 and Group 2, the relative indirect and relative direct effects, represented by path <italic>a</italic> x <italic>b</italic> and path <italic>c'</italic>, respectively. Additionally for both groups, we tested the individual components of the relative indirect effect, represented by path <italic>a</italic> and path <italic>b</italic>. We did not make an <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis about the relative total effect for both groups, represented by path <italic>c</italic>.</p><fig id="pone.0127148.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127148.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Untested mediation model.</title><p>The untested model predicting a significant indirect effect (patch <italic>a</italic>

The participants were not told that this was a test phase or that there were different types of sequences used in the experiment.

A score was given for each correctly reproduced sequence based on its length (i.e., a correctly reproduced sequence of length 5 was given a score of 5). As in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] a learning score was then obtained by subtracting the total score for the ungrammatical sequences in the test phase from the grammatical sequences in the test phase.

The sentences varied in terms of the final word&#x02019;s predictability: high-predictability sentences (N = 25) had a final word that was highly predictable given the sentence context (e.g., &#x0201c;<italic>Greet the heroes with loud</italic>
<underline><italic>cheers</italic></underline>&#x0201d;); whereas anomalous sentences (N = 25) had a final word that was not predictable given the sentence context (e.g., &#x0201c;<italic>The burglar was parked by an</italic>
<underline><italic>ox</italic></underline>&#x0201d;). Sentences were presented in random order using a self-paced format.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Scoring</title><p>Responses were scored based on the number of correct final words for each of the two sentence types (high-predictability and anomalous). As in Conway et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a difference score was computed as the number of final words identified in high-predictability sentences minus the number of final words in anomalous sentences. This difference score reflects how well a participant is able to use sentence context to help perceive the final word in the sentence, a form of top-down language processing that has been argued to depend on how well one is able to track statistics in language [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For this reason, we expected that any improvements to SSP might carry over to improvements in how well participants are able to use sentence context to perceive words under poor listening conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Sequence training task</title><p>The training task began in a separate session (on a different day) after the completion of the pre-training assessments. The sequence training task consisted of several blocks of sequence-reproduction trials that either adaptively increased in length as participants&#x02019; performance improved (Groups 1 and 2) or were non-adaptive (Group 3). On each trial, participants saw a series of green circles light up on the touchscreen monitor and were asked to reproduce the sequence they had just seen (see <xref rid="pone.0127148.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Sixteen circles were arranged on a 4x4 grid, inspired by the type of computerized training programs used by Klingberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individual circles on the 4x4 grid were illuminated for 250ms and were off for 250ms between elements in the sequence. The participants&#x02019; task was to reproduce each sequence immediately following presentation by touching the green circles displayed on the touch-sensitive monitor in the correct order. As participants made their responses, each circle they pressed stayed illuminated for 250ms. At the end of the presentation of a sequence if the participant did not make a response within 2 seconds a new sequence was presented. Each session of the training task consisted of 3 blocks of 50 trials.</p><fig id="pone.0127148.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0127148.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Training task.</title><p>Touch screen of 16 circles arranged in a 4 x 4 display for visuospatial sequence training task.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0127148.g002"/></fig><p>The order that the circles lit up either was dependent upon embedded structural regularities (Group 1) or was pseudorandom and did not follow structural regularities (Groups 2 and 3). The sequences with underlying structural regularities were generated so that each element in the sequence could be followed by 3 others in the set with equal likelihood. The sequences without underlying structural regularities were generated so that each element in the sequence could be followed by any other in the set with equal likelihood (that is, any of the 15 other elements). The underlying sequences themselves were the same for all participants (within each group). However, the actual mapping between each sequence element and each circle on the screen was randomly determined for each participant. Thus, while the underlying sequences were the same for each participant (within the same group), the spatial representation was different between participants. Moreover, mapping was re-randomized for each participant at the onset of each new daily training session in order to encourage generalizability.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 received adaptive training using sequences with underlying structural regularities. Group 2 received adaptive training on sequences without underlying structural regularities. Group 3 received non-adaptive training on sequences without underlying structural regularities. For Groups 1 and 2, sequence lengths in the adaptive conditions were based on a 2 up 2 down staircase procedure. For example, if a participant started at sequence length 4 and correctly reproduced all items in that sequence then their next trial would be a sequence of length 4. If the participant correctly reproduced all elements in the second sequence of length 4 then they would move up to a sequence of length 5 in the next trial. If they incorrectly reproduced this sequence of length 5 then their next trial would be of a sequence of length 5. If they responded incorrectly to this sequence as well, then their next sequence would be moved down to length 4.</p><p>Whereas both Groups 1 and 2 incorporated the 2-up 2-down adaptive training staircase procedure, only Group 1 received sequences with structural regularities. Group 2 instead received adaptive training on sequences without any underlying structural regularities. In other words, this condition used the same 2 up 2 down staircase procedure as previously described; however, the sequences themselves were pseudo-randomly determined on each trial and were, therefore, without underlying structural regularities.</p><p>Finally, participants in Group 3 received training that did not adapt to their performance level. At each trial, the sequence lengths were determined randomly (varying in length from 4 to 16 elements). Like Group 2, the sequences in Group 3 were pseudo-randomly determined on each trial and, therefore, did not contain any underlying structural regularities.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Post-training measures</title><p>The post-training measures were identical to the pre-training measures.

For the MANOVA, a given participant&#x02019;s data was excluded if it was missing for either the pre or the post measure.

The DV was language processing (Language), defined as the correct number of degraded spoken target words for high-predictability sentences (H) minus the correct number of target words for anomalous sentences (A) at post-measure. The mediator (M) was structured sequence processing (SSP) defined as the span score for the grammatical sequences minus the span score for the ungrammatical sequences in the sequence learning task test phase at post-measure.</p><p>The process of dummy coding was used in order to enter the multicategorical, group-membership based IV (Group) into the model. Two dummy coded variables labeled D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> were created from observations in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The reference group was Group 3. No transformations were done on the continuous variables SSP and Language prior to entering them into the model. Variables were uncentered, and the data contained no outliers beyond +/- 3 standard deviations. Six subjects were excluded from the analysis due to missing data pertaining to the variables in the model.

Potential implications of this unpredicted finding will be addressed in the Discussion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the comparison of group means (using MANOVA) did not support our first hypothesis. That is, adaptive sequence training with structural regularities did not lead to a significant improvement to SSP or language processing. There are a number of reasons why a non-significant result might have been obtained. For instance, it is possible that the training regimen was not strong or consistent enough to lead to significant improvements overall, even if the training itself has the potential to have a causal effect on SSP and language. Thus, even though the MANOVA resulted in non-significant effects of SSP training, using the mediation model allows us to better understand the potential underlying relationships among the variables of interest.</p><p>Along these lines, the results of the mediation model did show that there was a significant relative indirect effect of adaptive sequence training with structural regularities on language via SSP, compared with the control condition, supporting Hypothesis #2. This relative indirect path shows that SSP training has an underlying impact on language&#x02013;&#x02013;specifically, the ability to use knowledge of word order statistics to improve speech recognition in noise&#x02013;&#x02013;through the mediator SSP. Previous research using an individual differences approach has established an empirical association between SSP and language ability [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that language impairments are associated with impairments to SSP, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the present findings are the first results that we know of that demonstrate a more direct connection between SSP and an aspect of language processing as revealed through experimental manipulation of SSP training itself. Likewise, these are also the first findings demonstrating that cognitive training techniques can potentially modify SSP.</p><p>The mediation model demonstrates that adaptive sequence training with structural regularities has the potential to generalize to improvements on a non-trained statistical-sequential learning task, as shown in path <italic>a</italic>
<sub>1</sub>. This finding itself has remarkable implications about the plasticity of SSP and statistical learning processes and the potential for using such sequence training tasks to improve fundamental learning (and language) abilities. Thus, even though an examination of the group means revealed no significant effects of SSP training, the mediation model suggests that underlying relationships among these variables exist, providing the basis to further develop such training techniques to improve SSP and language.</p><p>In terms of Hypothesis #3, the significant indirect effect of <italic>a</italic>
<sub>1</sub> x <italic>b</italic> was accompanied by a significant&#x02013;&#x02013;and opposite, or competing&#x02013;&#x02013;direct effect (path <italic>c'</italic>
<sub>1</sub>). Thus, Hypothesis #3 was not supported. According Zhao, Lynch, and Chen [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], our model is one of competitive mediation, in which the total effect <italic>c</italic>
<sub>1</sub> is negative (-0,91, p = .22, see <xref rid="pone.0127148.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), [given the formula for the total effect is <italic>c</italic> = (<italic>a</italic> x <italic>b</italic>)+ <italic>c'</italic>)] [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is possible that there is an unexplained mediator(s) in the direct path, thereby contributing to a negative relationship between SSP training and language. Although this is a valid possibility, it is also possible that SSP training directly negatively impacts language (through some as yet unexplained mechanism), and is thereby responsible for the negative total effect <italic>c</italic>
<sub>1</sub>. This second possibility would not require an additional mediator, only an additional explanatory construct to explain how the variables already in the model behave on each of the different paths.</p><p>Why does SSP training have a positive underlying relationship with language performance via the indirect effect through the mediator SSP, but overall a negative underlying relationship with language performance via the direct effect? One intriguing possibility is that training on visual structural regularities&#x02013;&#x02013;apart from any effect it has on SSP&#x02013;&#x02013;might actually interfere with one&#x02019;s knowledge or use of the structural regularities in spoken language. Recall that the measure of language was derived from a difference score: performance with high-predictability sentences (containing language regularities) minus performance with anomalous sentences (containing fewer regularities). An examination of the means on the high-predictability and anomalous sentences suggests that only in Group 1 does performance on the highly-predictable sentences get substantially worse from pre- to post-training. Performance on the anomalous sentences on the other hand does not worsen for any of the three groups. Thus, knowledge (or expression of) language regularities as measured by the highly-predictable sentences appears to be attenuated following sequence training with structural regularities. A similar type of interference was recently observed when participants engaged in a non-linguistic visual-motor SSP task concurrent with a sentence comprehension task [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This interference between the processing of visual structural regularities (contained in the sequence training task) and processing spoken language regularities (contained in the highly-predictable sentences) could be the mechanism driving the negative direct effect of path <italic>c'</italic>
<sub>1</sub>. With these two competing pathways&#x02013;&#x02013;an indirect benefit to language processing by strengthening SSP, but a simultaneous direct negative effect on language due to interference&#x02013;&#x02013;the final effect in our case is an overall negative total effect or decrease in language processing. Theoretically, this is quite enlightening, and furthermore underscores the complex relationship between SSP and the processing of language regularities and sheds light upon why in some cases a near transfer effect but not a far transfer effect might be observed. In this case, the near transfer effect (improvement to SSP) would normally result in a far transfer effect (improvement to language), but because the training regimen itself has a negative direct effect on language, it cancels out the potential beneficial improvement to language.</p><p>As the above discussion helps illustrate, these findings accentuate the importance of pursuing designs that allow one to better understand the mechanisms underlying training-related changes to outcome measures. Some recent literature has been more critical of computerized WM training studies and has brought into question the generalizability of the findings e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The advantage of our design is that it helps inform the process of change, rather than simply comparing means of the changes to the outcomes themselves; we believe this may help address the concerns pertaining to the effectiveness of cognitive training techniques and possibly provide answers as to why near and far transfer effects are observed. In turn, this can serve to maximize the potential of these interventions. With a growing number of reports claiming the promise of cognitive training techniques, as well as other more recent studies that are more critical of their validity, our findings might offer clarity into the mechanisms of change themselves. For instance, given the present results suggesting the existence of two independent pathways for how sequence training might affect language, it is possible that previous training studies have used protocols that inadvertently emphasize one or the other pathway, leading to very different and inconsistent results across studies. In fact, a given experimental manipulation, such as changing the sensory modality or duration of the training task, may have different effects on the strength of each pathway. Discovering what the key manipulations are and how each affects different mechanisms of change is an important next step. With such knowledge, it may be possible to design a training regimen that better capitalizes on the indirect path in order to yield the greatest chance of demonstrating far transfer, in this case, enhancement to language performance. Importantly, the existence of these two competing paths would not have been known had one relied solely on the MANOVA analyses comparing the group means.</p><p>Likewise, it is possible that there may be ways to modify the training task to alleviate the negative, direct path between training and language performance. For instance, having a longer training regimen could provide an opportunity for participants to adapt to the novel structural regularities that they are exposed to, reducing the interference between the training task and language processing. If this is true, then with additional training trials, the direct (negative) effect of adaptive training with structural regularities on language might decrease, resulting in even stronger enhancements to language. Another possibility might be to modify the type of structural regularities that are present in the training sequences. For example, rather than having only adjacent sequential dependencies as was the case here, incorporating long-distance, non-adjacent dependencies into the training task might prove beneficial for improving the mechanisms that are recruited when processing long-distance dependencies in natural language [<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>],[<xref rid="pone.0127148.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Although the positive underlying relationship between SSP and language (illustrated in path <italic>b</italic> shown in <xref rid="pone.0127148.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), may seem relatively small (<italic>b</italic> = .03), it is still encouraging. It is true that the overall indirect path <italic>a</italic>
<sub>1</sub> x <italic>b</italic> may at first suggest that it takes a substantial improvement to SSP to see a small improvement to language processing; however, a few considerations are important to mention. First, the present design incorporated only 4 training sessions, a small number. It seems highly possible that with more training sessions, or by modifying the training task in some other way, even greater enhancement to SSP might be obtained, which could in turn boost the language score even more. Second, considering the long-term applied goal of how these types of cognitive training regimens might be used to improve language in typical and atypical development, even a small gain could have a major impact, especially if such an intervention was targeted early in development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, using a mediation model analysis, we have demonstrated that adaptive sequence training with structural regularities has an underlying impact on language through the mediator SSP. More concretely, adaptive sequence training with structural regularities has a very large impact on SSP while changes to SSP, in turn, have a more modest impact on language processing. In competition with this indirect effect, our sequence training regimen appeared to have a negative direct effect on language performance as well, resulting in overall a more dampened effect on language ability and no overall improvements to language as assessed by MANOVA. Additional work is currently underway to understand this negative direct effect, with the aim of reducing its impact to improve the efficacy of such sequence training programs.</p><p>These findings have two implications. At a practical level, these findings show how fundamental learning abilities and language processing skills might be improved in typical and atypical development. At a theoretical level, these findings not only highlight the plasticity of statistical-sequential learning and SSP but they also show an underlying link between SSP and language, which in turn lends additional weight to the view that language acquisition is based in large part on domain-general learning mechanisms rather than language-specific modules or neural structures that solely mediate language alone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Data for this project was initially collected as part of A.
