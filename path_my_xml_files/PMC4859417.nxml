By 2030, it is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer death.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Because of the absence of signs and symptoms in the early stage, 80% of the patients are in the terminal stage of pancreatic cancer when diagnosed. One study demonstrated that only 7% of pancreatic cancers are considered as a localized disease at diagnosis.<xref rid="b2-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> During this state, the median survival time is only 3&#x02013;6 months.<xref rid="b3-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The symptoms are nonspecific, such as nausea, anorexia, jaundice, and weight loss and abdominal pain, leading to difficulties and misleading in the diagnosis.<xref rid="b4-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The only curative management option for pancreatic cancers is surgical resection. However, only 15%&#x02013;25% of patients have a surgically resectable tumor at diagnosis.<xref rid="b5-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy has been used to treat several diseases, such as symptomatic uterine fibroids<xref rid="b6-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and adenomyosis.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Thus, in order to improve the patients&#x02019; general condition and the survival rate, we use HIFU surgery combined with gemcitabine chemotherapy to treat the pancreatic cancer that cannot be surgically resected. Our study provides an effective and safe way to treat the unresectable pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of Second Artillery General Hospital. All the patients provided informed consent and agreed to take part in the study. We randomly selected 45 patients with pancreatic cancer, which could not be surgically resected at the Second Artillery General Hospital from March 2008 to January 2011. There were 28 males and 17 females aged from 26 years to 71 years. The median age was 59.3 years, and there were 22 cases of pancreatic head carcinomas, and 23 cases of carcinomas of pancreatic body and tail. From the abdomen computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the smallest tumor was 2.6 cm &#x000d7;2.5 cm &#x000d7;1.8 cm and the largest tumor was 8.1 cm &#x000d7;7.5 cm &#x000d7;5.8 cm. The Union for International Cancer Control staging criteria III period involved 29 cases and criteria IV period 16 cases. The inclusion criteria included the following: 1) confirmed by pathological histology or cytology or with typical clinical manifestations combined with imageological examination and tumor marker CA-199 test; 2) patients with the measurable and valuable lesions on the imaging such as abdominal pain and (or) waist pain, loss of appetite, and weight loss (&#x0003e;15%); 3) lost opportunities of surgery contraindications; 4) well physical condition (Karnofsky Performance Status score &#x0003e;70), no obvious ascites and jaundice, and expected survival time &#x0003e;3 months; and 5) normal routine blood and kidney function and no significant differences between the two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Expected observation and the follow-up time were at least 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>HIFU therapy</title><p>The experimental group patients received HIFU treatment, and the equipment was produced by Chongqing Haifu Technology Co., Ltd. This equipment was JC200 type HIFU tumor treatment system. With the help of this equipment, we can identify body surface location and develop a plan of treatment according to the image of the tumor. During the surgery, we can compare the target image and gray value and observe the lesions to identify the coagulation necrosis. Treatment parameters include frequency 0.97 MHz, focus 147 mm, layer number of treatments 20&#x02013;30, treatment layer spacing 5 mm, therapeutic range 80%&#x02013;100%, average total treatment time 1,560 seconds, average power 350 W, and overall average energy 725,000 J. The experimental group patients were expected to accept a single treatment; additional treatment can be added when necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Gemcitabine application</title><p>Gemzar (domestic gemcitabine booster injection from Lilly Suzhou Pharmaceutical Company) is given by infusion through a vein (intravenously) once a week. Three doses were given as a whole treatment cycle. The two groups of patients accepted at least two cycles of chemotherapy. In the experimental group, patients were observed for 3 days after HIFU surgery. If there are no special complications, we continue to apply the gemcitabine chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Disease-related symptom improvement</title><p>Disease-related symptom improvement is a comprehensive assessment of pain, performance status, and weight change. It is the same as clinical benefit response. Evaluation criteria include: 1) the daily decreased dosage of analgesic drugs &#x02265;50%; 2) relieve pain &#x02265;50% (the daily assessment was conducted using Memorial Pain Assessment Card); 3) physical conditions improvement &#x02265;20 scores (the daily assessment was conducted using Karnofsky); and 4) the above three evaluation indicators were stable and weight gain &#x02265;7%. If the patients improved more than one index above for &#x0003e;4 weeks and there is no other deterioration indicator, the patient is a clinical benefit case.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective curative effect of tumor</title><p>According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor curative effect evaluation standard, the objective curative effect of tumor can be divided into complete remission (CR; all tumor lesions disappeared for &#x0003e;4 weeks), partial remission (PR; the max tumor diameter reduced by 30% for &#x0003e;4 weeks), stable disease (SD; changes between PR and progression of disease [PD]), and PD the sum of the single largest diameter increased by 20% or a new lesion).<xref rid="b8-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Disease control rate = CR + PR + SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival time</title><p>Median survival time (MST) is the median time from treatment to death.

In our country, the annual incidence of pancreatic cancer is ~5.1/100,000, which is three times larger than that 20 years ago.<xref rid="b10-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Because of the characteristics of the anatomy, pancreatic cancer is hard to discover in clinical diagnosis. In all, 80% of patients cannot undergo radical resection surgery once diagnosis is confirmed. For now, increased overall survival rate and quality of life are the goals for patients with pancreatic cancer, and pain management is the key point. Gemcitabine as the main drug of chemotherapy cannot relieve pain, and hence, it is not useful to increase patients quality of life. Palliative treatment of pancreatic cancer is an ongoing challenge in patient care.</p><p>The application of ultrasound in tumor treatment has a history of 50 years. Now, it has developed into the ultrasonic surgical technique &#x02013; HIFU.<xref rid="b11-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> HIFU uses penetrability and focusability of ultrasound to produce a heat effect in the tumor area. It causes the target area to reach 65&#x000b0;C&#x02013;100&#x000b0;C immediately and leads to protein denaturation and coagulation necrosis. It leads to irreversible damage.<xref rid="b12-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition to thermal effects, HIFU can also produce mechanical effect and cavitation effect. Because the tumor invades the superior mesenteric vein and portal vein, surgery is high risk, most patients are therefore unable to be treated surgically. According to the research in 2000,<xref rid="b13-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> HIFU will not have large effects on blood vessels with a diameter &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;m, while it will only block the vasa vasorum with a diameter &#x0003c;200 &#x003bc;m. These properties became the foundation of ablation therapy to advanced pancreatic cancer. Severe back pain is thought to be associated with tumor invasion to plexus around abdominal and retroperitoneal.<xref rid="b15-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The mechanism of HIFU relief pain is that HIFU can lead to damage in the pancreas and around solar plexus when treating pancreatic tumors. Early results showed that HIFU can stimulate the body&#x02019;s immune system.<xref rid="b16-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Gemcitabine is a kind of cell cycle drug resistant to metabolism, and it is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. Now, gemcitabine has become the first-line agent to treat pancreatic cancer both in People&#x02019;s Republic of China and abroad.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The criteria III period test shows that there is no difference between the gemcitabine treatment with or without cisplatin.<xref rid="b18-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The efficiency of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer treatment is 20%&#x02013;30%, MST is 4.2 months&#x02013;5.5 months, and 1-year survival rate is &#x0003c;16%&#x02013;19%.<xref rid="b18-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> HIFU as a kind of heat treatment combined with chemotherapy makes it easy for the drugs to enter local tumor cell. Through this, it can improve the drug concentration in the cell and therapeutic efficacy of drugs theoretically. There is a synergy between heat treatment and chemotherapy, and the specific mechanism may be that HIFU in local high temperature changed the tumor cell membrane permeability.<xref rid="b21-tcrm-12-687" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The results of the study show that HIFU ablation combined with gemcitabine static drop after chemotherapy can significantly improve survival rates of 6 months (73.9% vs 40.9%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but not 12 months (13.0% vs 4.5%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05), when compared to the pure gemcitabine chemotherapy, which indicates that combination therapy did not improve the 1-year survival rate. With respect to the disease control rates, the experimental group (78.2%) had higher value than the control group (59.0%), but not statistically different (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05), similar to that reported in the literature, which indicates that combination therapy has no obvious advantage in disease control. The two groups showed significant differences in abdominal pain remission rate, showing that HIFU ablation plays a dominant role in pain relief and is better than that of pure gemcitabine chemotherapy in improving patients&#x02019; quality of life. In terms of safety, the experimental group patients after HIFU ablation just have a felling of warmth but not serious complications besides those affecting the area of skin, and in the two groups, there were no seriously related adverse reactions to chemotherapy, and hence, there was no statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, HIFU combined gemcitabine chemotherapy is better than gemcitabine in inoperable pancreatic cancer. It can improve the quality of life and prolong the survival time. There is no serious adverse reaction, and it is a good palliative treatment. However, there are some problems worth noting. Is it because of heat treatment effect, that the HIFU combined gemcitabine chemotherapy works better than gemcitabine? HIFU can reduce the dose of gemcitabine after surgery in order to relieve the pain in the patients with chemotherapy and the best time to use chemotherapy drugs is after HIFU surgery. It is worthy for clinical attention and carrying out the experiments of further research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of
