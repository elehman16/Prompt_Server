Whole grain has shown potential to lower the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. One possible mechanism behind the benefits of whole grain is the gut fermentation of dietary fiber (DF), e.g. non-starch polysaccharides and resistant starch (RS), in whole grain. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of whole grain rye-based products on glucose- and appetite regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>Twenty-one healthy subjects were provided four rye-based evening test meals in a crossover overnight study design. The test evening meals consisted of either whole grain rye flour bread (RFB) or a 1:1 ratio of whole grain rye flour and rye kernels bread (RFB/RKB), with or without added resistant starch (+RS). White wheat flour bread (WWB) was used as reference evening meal. Blood glucose, insulin, PYY, FFA, IL-6 as well as breath H<sub>2</sub> and subjective rating of appetite were measured the following morning at fasting and repeatedly up to 3.5&#x000a0;h after a standardized breakfast consisting of WWB. <italic>Ad libitum</italic> energy intake was determined at lunch, 14.5&#x000a0;h after evening test and reference meals, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The evening meal with RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS decreased postprandial glucose- and insulin responses (iAUC) (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and increased the gut hormone PYY in plasma the following morning 0&#x02013;120 min after the standardized breakfast, compared to WWB (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01). Moreover, RFB increased subjective satiety and decreased desire to eat, and both RFB and RFB/RKB decreased feeling of hunger (AUC 0&#x02013;210&#x000a0;min). All rye-based evening meals decreased or tended to decrease fasting FFA (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, RFB/RKB: <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057) and increased breath hydrogen concentration (0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). No effects were noted on energy intake at lunch or inflammatory marker IL-6 (0&#x02009;+&#x02009;180&#x000a0;min) after the rye-based evening meals, compared to WWB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whole grain rye bread has the potential to improve cardiometabolic variables in an 11&#x02013;14.5&#x000a0;h perspective in healthy humans. The combination RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS positively affected biomarkers of glucose- and appetite regulation in a semi-acute perspective. Meanwhile, RFB and RFB/RKB improved subjective appetite ratings.

These diseases are lifestyle-related and therefore to a large extent preventable. In this respect, increased intake of whole grain (WG) has shown health benefits. Thus epidemiological data show that WG intake is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and also a decreased risk of obesity and weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. At least parts of the beneficial effects of WG are suggested to emanate from mechanisms originating from gut fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates, i.e. dietary fiber (DF) components such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starch (RS). Previously it was shown that intake of whole kernel barley or rye products improved markers of glucose regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and increased gut hormones involved in appetite- and metabolic regulation (GLP-1 and/or PYY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], 11&#x02013;14 h after ingestion in healthy subjects. The effects were suggested to originate from gut fermentation of the DF components.</p><p>WG flour based products are usually rich in NSP, whereas the RS level is lower in comparison to WG kernel based products, making the total amounts of DF inferior in flour based products. It has previously been suggested that products made from WG flour with a low content of RS did not beneficially affect metabolic variables as oppose to WG kernel based products rich in RS. Consequently, opposite to what was observed after kernel based barley products, it was shown that barley flour porridge did not result in beneficial effects on glucose regulation in a 10.5&#x02013;12.5&#x000a0;h perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The lower concentrations of RS in WG flour may be compensated for e.g. by adding ungelatinized RS (RS2) from high-amylose maize (HAMRS2). RS2 is a fermentable source of DF previously shown to lower acute insulin response (0&#x02013;420&#x000a0;min after intake) in healthy humans when added to a standardized breakfast and lunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, adding RS2 to a barley DF supplemented white wheat bread (WWB) improved glucose tolerance at breakfast, 10.5&#x02013;12.5&#x000a0;h after intake, compared to WWB without supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information regarding the effect of supplementation of RS2 to WG rye products on metabolic parameters in healthy subjects within a short time frame. Rye is a rich source of indigestible carbohydrates mainly in the form of arabinoxylans, fructans, cellulose, &#x003b2;-glucan and lignin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] but depending on the botanical integrity, i.e. proportion of kernels to flour, the RS content may vary.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the potential impact of WG rye products (bread), varying in botanical structure of rye and RS content, on cardiometabolic risk markers and appetite regulation, in a time perspective of 11&#x02013;14.5&#x000a0;h after intake. For this purpose, four WG rye breads with different flour to kernel ratio and supplementation of commercial RS2 were provided to healthy subjects as evening meals. A white wheat bread was included as a reference evening meal. The rye-based test products and the reference product were consumed in the evening, in a randomized crossover study design, and test markers in blood were determined the next morning prior and following a standardized breakfast to measure glucose regulation (glucose and insulin), gut hormones (peptide YY (PYY)), blood lipids (free fatty acids (FFA)) and inflammatory tonus (interleukin 6 (IL-6)). Additionally, breath hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) excretion was measured as a marker of gut fermentation, and subjective appetite ratings (hunger, satiety, and desire to eat) were registered. Finally, <italic>ad libitum</italic> energy intake was registered at a lunch provided 3.5&#x000a0;h after the standardized breakfast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02347293).

After this meal, the test subjects were fasting until the standardized breakfast was served the following morning at the research unit Food for Health Science Centre, Lund University.

They were also instructed to avoid alcohol and excessive physical exercise during the day prior to the experimental day. No antibiotics or probiotics were allowed within 2 weeks before or during the study period. To facilitate the standardization of meal patterns prior to each experimental day during the study period, the test subjects were requested to provide a meal record from the day before each experimental day. The test subjects were in addition given a list of foods rich in DF to simplify the instructions regarding avoidance of DF the day before the experimental day. At the experimental days, the subjects arrived to the research unit at 0730&#x000a0;am. Fasting capillary blood samples were collected, and appetite and breath H<sub>2</sub> excretion were registered before the breakfast. A standardized breakfast was served at 0800&#x000a0;am and finished within 15&#x000a0;min. At time point 210&#x000a0;min after commencement of the breakfast, <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch was served. The test subjects served themselves food from an oven sheet with a surplus of food and were instructed to eat until they felt pleasantly full and to obtain the same degree of induced satiation (i.e. the process that results in termination of eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) at every experimental day. To attain this, they were informed that they were allowed to have a second serving and also to leave food on their plate if necessary. The amount (weight) of lunch consumed was registered. The test subjects were told to sustain a low physical activity during the experimental day (4.5&#x000a0;h).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Chemical analyses of evening meals and standardized breakfast</title><p>The test products and breakfast were analyzed with respect to total starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], RS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], NSP (soluble and insoluble) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], fructans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and arabinoxylans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Information regarding the characterization of carbohydrates in the test and reference meals is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Before analysis of total starch and NSP, the bread products were air dried and milled (IKA A11 basic mixer model A11 B, Germany). RS in all test products were analyzed on products as eaten. The available starch content was calculated by subtracting RS from total starch. The enzymatic/spectrophotometric AOAC method 999.03 was performed to analyze the fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin (in the following referred to as fructans) content, in duplicate, in the test products using the enzyme assay kit K-FRUC (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). To avoid possible interference of raffinose-series oligosaccharides the analysis included treatment with &#x003b1;-galactosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Arabinoxylans were determined by analyzing the monomeric composition in the isolated dietary fiber residue from the test products using the Uppsala method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The amount of arabinoxylan content was calculated from the xylose, galactose and arabinose, and corrected for the amount of arabinogalactan present by assuming ratio 0.69 between arabinose and galactose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Physiological test parameters</title><p>Fasting and postprandial measurements were performed at all five visits. Finger-prick capillary blood samplings were applied for determination of blood glucose (HemoCue&#x000ae;B-glucose, HemoCue AB, &#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden). Additional capillary blood samples were collected to determine serum (s-) insulin, s-FFA, s-IL-6 and plasma (p-) PYY. Breath hydrogen was measured as an indicator of gut fermentation activity, using an EC 60 gastrolyzer (Bedfont EC60 Gastrolyzer, Rochester, England). Pre- and post-breakfast subjective appetite sensations (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) were obtained using a 100&#x000a0;mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Breath H<sub>2</sub> and VAS ratings for subjective appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) were obtained at fasting (time 0&#x000a0;min) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 210&#x000a0;min after commencing the breakfast. Blood glucose was determined on similar times points, excluding 210&#x000a0;min, and s-insulin was collected at all time points except 15 and 210&#x000a0;min. Plasma PYY was determined at time 0&#x000a0;min and at 120&#x000a0;min after breakfast. Serum IL-6 was obtained at time 0&#x000a0;min and at 180&#x000a0;min.

Statistical evaluations involving glucose and insulin concentrations are based on incremental changes from fasting concentrations. The absolute values are used in the statistical calculations of the rest of the test variables. The incremental area- and area under the curve (iAUC and AUC, respectively) were calculated for each subject and evening meal, using the trapezoid model. iAUC or AUC were used in the statistical evaluation of results regarding blood glucose, insulin and parameters for appetite sensations. Incremental peak (iPeak) concentrations were calculated for glucose and insulin as individual maximum postprandial increase from the baseline. GraphPad Prism (version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for graph plotting and calculation of AUC.</p><p>Investigations with respect to significant differences in test variables depending on the different evening meals were assessed with ANOVA (general linear model) followed by Dunnett&#x02019;s multiple comparison procedure, using results after the reference product WWB as a control.

The significance level was set at <italic>P</italic>-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. In the cases of unevenly distributed residuals (tested with Anderson-Darling and considered unevenly distributed when <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), a Box Cox transformation was performed on the data prior to the ANOVA analysis. Differences between the products at different time points during the experimental day were evaluated using a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS release 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) with repeated measures and an autoregressive covariance structure. Randomization of the consumption order of test products was performed using a random number function in Microsoft Excel 2013 (Washington, USA). If a result of a test variable from a test subject was missing for the reference product, the test subject was excluded from the statistical calculations of that specific test variable. If a result of a test variable from a test subject was missing for one of the test products, the test subject&#x02019;s results for the remaining products will be included in the statistical calculations of that specific test variable. For breath H<sub>2</sub>, where the variation in the concentration changed scarcely over time, a weighted mean was produced by calculating a mean for equal time intervals (one mean per hour) over the test period, and then a mean for the different hours was calculated and used in the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Power calculation</title><p>Primary outcome measure was change in blood glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUC) 0&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min after the standardized breakfast.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has previously been shown that certain kernel based cereal products, e.g. barley kernel products, and more recently also rye kernel products, beneficially affected cardiometabolic test variables 11&#x02013;16 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or 10.5&#x02013;13.5&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] after intake, in comparison to a flour based product (WWB). The effects were proposed to emanate from gut fermentation of the mixture of DF in the intact kernels, i.e. NSP and RS. In the present study, it was hypothesized that similar metabolic benefits could be achieved also with bread containing rye flour or rye flour mixed with rye kernels by simulating the DF composition and amount in the intact kernels, through supplementation with commercial RS (HAMRS2) to compensate for the loss of RS (RS1) in the milling process. Previous inclusion of HAMRS2 in the diet was shown to beneficially impact insulin demand up to 7&#x000a0;h after ingestion in healthy humans and to reduce energy intake during 24&#x000a0;h, compared to a low-RS diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. RS has also been shown to stimulate secretion of GLP-1 and PYY in rats fed a RS diet for 10&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The hypothesis was confirmed, with respect to the RFB/RKB product with and without RS supplementation. Consequently, postprandial glucose regulation was improved and plasma PYY levels increased in a time perspective of 11&#x02013;13 h after intake of the RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS, compared to WWB. No such effects were seen after the RFB/RKB without RS supplementation. The results are thus in support of the importance of RS components, and/or the specific mixture of NSP and RS in kernels on metabolic regulation. However, independently of the RS content, all rye-based test products resulted in a decrease in fasting FFA concentrations the following morning compared to the WWB evening meal, with potential benefits on insulin sensitivity. An improved glucose regulation and decreased concentrations of FFA were recently observed in the morning when rye kernel based bread was included as an evening meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Increased levels of FFA have been observed in type 2 diabetes patients compared to those with normal glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and were associated with impaired insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Hence, the present results indicate that rye kernels have beneficial semi-acute effects on glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Previously, intake of rye kernels were shown to increase plasma levels of SCFA 10.5&#x000a0;h after intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and as judged from the increased levels of breath H<sub>2</sub> following the rye-based evening meals, the metabolic benefits seen in the present work are most likely emanating from gut fermentation. Substrate-induced increase in SCFA concentrations in the gut may potentially have beneficial implications on appetite- and metabolic regulation since SCFA has been suggested to stimulate the L-cells to secrete GLP-1 and PYY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and in addition increase the uptake of circulating FFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the present study, plasma levels of SCFA were not determined. However, RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS significantly increased the concentrations of plasma PYY 11 and 13&#x000a0;h after intake. In fact, the other rye-based products also tended to increase the PYY concentrations in plasma. It has previously been shown that intravenous infusion with PYY in lean or obese subjects decreased the food intake with 31% respectively 30%, at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> buffet served after 2&#x000a0;h, compared to infusion with saline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], indicating an anti-obesogenic potential of PYY. A rye kernel based evening meal has previously shown to increase both PYY and GLP-1 the following morning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this context, although GLP-1 concentrations were not measured in this study due to small quantities of plasma via capillary sampling, it might be anticipated that an increase in PYY would indicate a potential increase also in GLP-1 since PYY is co-released together with GLP-1 after a meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These gut hormones have been shown to have anti-diabetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and could partially explain the improved glucose regulation after intake of the rye-based test products.</p><p>Despite the significantly increased PYY levels in the present study, the effects on appetite variables and energy intake at lunch did not reach statistical significance after intake of RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS. Instead, the non-supplement products, i.e. 100% flour based rye bread (RFB) and the RFB/RKB bread, which induced less increased PYY levels compared to RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS, showed the most pronounced beneficial effects on subjective appetite ratings. In accordance, it has been reported that PYY levels do not always correlate with subjective appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, this does not preclude the potential role of PYY in the appetite regulation but that the mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Although no significant effects on energy intake at lunch depending on the previous evening meals could be detected in this study, there was a non-significant decrease in energy intake after RFB/RKB evening meal (&#x02212;7%) in comparison to the WWB. Consequently, this is in accordance with results after boiled rye kernels in a previous study with similar study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A decrease in energy intake (&#x02212;12%) in this time perspective has previously been shown also after intake of barley kernel based products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], indicating potential anti-obesogenic properties of certain fermentable DF. The energy content at the standardized breakfast in the current study, 273&#x000a0;kcal, can be considered to be low (kcal content obtained from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), and it can be speculated that, at least for some of the test subjects, the low energy content at breakfast could have interfered with the possibility to differentiate voluntary energy chosen at the subsequent lunch. The previous over-night studies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), including barley or rye as an evening meal, showed effects on voluntary energy intake at lunch after a more realistic and high caloric breakfast composed of either an <italic>ad libitum</italic> breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or a breakfast with e.g. butter, cheese, jam (and a pastry) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this context it is worth to consider that these breakfasts probably closer resemble the test subjects&#x02019; normal diets compared to the breakfast included in the current study (WWB and water).</p><p>It has previously been shown that an evening meal including WWB supplemented with a mix of RS (similar to the RS product used in the present study) and NSP (from barley) in proportions similar to the composition and content of indigestible carbohydrates in intrinsic barley kernels, significantly lowered the glucose response the following morning. Further it was observed that supplementation of a WWB with RS or DF separately did not improve glucose tolerance the next morning, compared to un-supplemented WWB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This indicates that the combination of RS and NSP is necessary to mediate benefits on glucose tolerance in a time perspective of approximately 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;h, such as from the evening meal to a subsequent standardized breakfast. As expected, based on the chemical analysis it was confirmed that RFB and RFB/RKB contained less RS compared to the RS supplemented products. In the present study the RS supplementation of the RFB/RKB product seems to be important with respect to effects on glucose regulation and release of PYY. However, supplement with RS in the form of HAMRS2 did not improve other test variables included in the study. Probably both the total amounts- and composition of DF components are important. The rye portion in the RFB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS was replaced with 25% HAMRS2 flour (DM), and in the RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS the replacement with HAMRS2 flour was 14%. The HAMRS2 flour product included, in addition to RS (60%), a considerable proportion of available starch (40%). Thus, the lack of benefits with the HAMRS2 supplement to RFB, i.e. RFB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS, can possibly be due to an important loss of rye DF due to dilution of the rye dry matter when replacing rye flour with HAMRS2. A loss of DF was confirmed in the chemical analysis and showed that both RFB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS and RFB/RKB&#x02009;+&#x02009;RS contained lower concentrations of soluble DF, and decreased levels of fructans and arabinoxylans, compared to the breads without RS supplementation. Thus, since the only known difference between the ingredients in rye-based products is the addition of RS, it can be suggested that the comparatively high concentrations of soluble fiber in the un-supplemented RFB and RFB/RKB could have contributed to the beneficial effects observed on appetite ratings after these products. This is to the best of our knowledge the first study that observes significant difference in appetite ratings 11&#x02013;14.5&#x000a0;h after intake of WG rye flour product. These effects have previously only been observed in acute studies when serving WG rye flour bread as breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>A limitation in the study was the small volumes of blood samples obtained, due to capillary blood sampling instead of venous blood sampling. Consequently, it was not possible to investigate additional parameters of inflammatory variables and gut hormones. Another potential study limitation was the relative low number of subjects and the low energy intake at breakfast when investigating subjective appetite sensations during the experimental day and voluntary food intake at lunch. Nevertheless, the appetite ratings and energy registration from the present study indicate that rye-based products, in particular the combination of WG rye flour and rye kernels (RFB/RKB), have the potential to lower energy intake at the subsequent day, but further studies are necessary to confirm this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study showed that addition of RS to a rye bread based on 50% intact kernels and 50% WG flour (DM) beneficially impact metabolic parameters in an 11&#x02013;14 h perspective, as demonstrated by improved postprandial glucose regulation, decreased concentration of FFA at fasting and increased levels of PYY. In addition, it was shown that WG rye flour bread contributed to increased sensation of satiety and that WG rye flour bread solely or combined with rye kernels lowered perceived hunger sensations, 11&#x02013;14.5&#x000a0;h after intake. The findings suggest that WG rye has anti-diabetic and anti-obesogenic potential. More studies are needed to further evaluate the metabolic effects of inclusion of commercially available RS fractions in different food matrices.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b-</term><def><p>Blood-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DF</term><def><p>Dietary fiber</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DM</term><def><p>Dry matter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>f-</term><def><p>Fasting-</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFA</term><def><p>Free fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP-1</term><def><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>Breath hydrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAMRS2</term><def><p>High-amylose maize resistant starch type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iAUC</term><def><p>Incremental area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p>Interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iPeak</term><def><p>Incremental peak</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSP</term><def><p>Non-starch polysaccharides</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PYY</term><def><p>Peptide YY</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFB</term><def><p>Rye flour bread</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RKB</term><def><p>Rye kernel bread</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RS</term><def><p>Resistant starch</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RS2</term><def><p>Resistant starch type 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCFA</term><def><p>Short chain fatty acids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEM</term><def><p>Standard error mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WG</term><def><p>Whole grain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WWB</term><def><p>White wheat bread</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This project has been funded by grants from the VINNOVA Excellence Centre Antidiabetic Food Centre, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.
