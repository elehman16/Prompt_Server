These epidemiological principles and methods have been vital in the study of oral conditions. Current data available for oral conditions relied on descriptive surveys intended to measure disease experience through clinical examinations in field.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>A major issue in these settings is infection control. This is an area where blood or saliva contamination can easily occur. As there is use of small, sharp instruments contaminated with blood or other fluids, there is ample opportunity for transmission of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Dentistry potentially exposes much of the population to blood contact with infected patients. Thus, a wide range of dental equipment may pose an unacceptable risk of cross infection.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In dentistry, re-sterilization of used instruments for reuse on another patient has been a common practice. Although, single-use devices have been promoted as a strategy to prevent cross-infection among patients, re-sterilization of previously used instruments still continues to be a common practice as cost is a significant factor.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The term &#x0201c;disinfection&#x0201d; is defined as a process that kills only vegetative organisms, whereas, sterilization kills spores as well.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sterilizing instruments is a time-consuming process that requires careful attention. If the protocol is not followed strictly, contamination of instruments may result. Interruption of the cycle results in inadequately sterilized instruments that cannot be considered safe.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] After the sterilization cycle, the sterilizer must depressurize, and the packs remain in the sterilizer for drying. The drying phase may take an additional 20-45 min. The unit must only be opened after completion of the drying cycle making it more time consuming in field settings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Improperly sterilized instruments utilized in patient care can result into surgical site infection and pose a serious threat to the patient's safety leading to life-threatening infection or even death.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In general, heat sterilization method is preferred to chemical disinfection. However, with certain instruments that are repeatedly used, frequent chemical disinfection may be necessary since heat sterilization can lead to corrosion.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Further, it is not possible to carry out heat sterilization in field surveys due to time constraints.</p><p>In these situations, the disinfection using chemical disinfectants may be considered an alternate for heat sterilization to reduce the risk of cross contaminations. Glutaraldehyde is a dialdehyde that displays potent bactericidal, fungicidal, mycobactericidal, sporicidal and virucidal activities. Mechanism of its action is based on its interaction with amino groups in proteins and enzymes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Glutaraldehyde is normally used as a 2% solution, which is sufficient to achieve a sporicidal effect.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is used as an as immersion solution for metallic instruments, face masks, heat sensitive plastic rubbers, and fiber optics.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is commonly employed for disinfection, sterilization, and antisepsis and is effective against bacteria, viruses, yeast and spores. It is commercially available in concentrations ranging from 3% to 90%. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is environmental friendly, because it can rapidly degrade into harmless products that is, water and oxygen. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as an oxidant by producing hydroxyl free radicals (&#x02022;OH), which attack cell components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. Proposed mechanism of action is based on its ability to target exposed sulfhydryl groups and double bonds.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Alcohol is an effective skin antiseptic and disinfectant for medical instruments. A number of alcohols have shown effective antimicrobial activity but, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and n-propanol are the most widely used. Alcohols exhibit rapid broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against vegetative bacteria (including mycobacteria), fungi, and viruses but they lack sporicidal activity hence are not recommended for sterilization. In general, the antimicrobial activity of alcohols is optimum in the range of 60-90%, but it becomes significantly lower at concentrations below 50%. The exact mode of action of alcohols is unclear, but it is generally believed that they cause membrane damage leading to cell lysis and result into a rapid denaturation of proteins.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The lack of published literature comparing the effectiveness of various chemical disinfectants has prompted us to undertake this study to evaluate the disinfecting efficacy of three chemical solutions in reducing the contamination of diagnostic instruments that are routinely used in dental screening camps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of the study participants</title><p>This randomized cross over type of trial was conducted among three participants selected from a research laboratory, Bhopal.

</p><p>First, the maxillary teeth were examined starting from the maxillary right second molar (17) to maxillary right first pre molar (14) followed by examination of the maxillary left posterior segment starting from maxillary left second molar (27) to maxillary left second pre molar (24). After the completion of the maxillary arch, the mandibular arch was examined starting with the left posterior segment, followed by the right posterior segment. In each segment, the explorer tip was first passed on the occlusal surfaces, followed by buccal and lingual surfaces. It took approximately 5 min for the investigator to complete the examination of one individual. The time duration was kept constant for the subsequent examinations to ensure uniformity in the sample collection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Group allocation</title><p>The three eligible study participants were assigned a unique subject I.D which was maintained throughout the study.

The diagnostic instruments were gently stirred for 5 min in normal saline in an attempt to obtain the sample of plaque micro-organisms. Later, the instruments were taken back and disinfected using a designated disinfectant for 30 min. The postdisinfection stock solution was prepared using the methodology described earlier. The stock solution was diluted further to obtain 10<sup>&#x02212; 2</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212; 3</sup> serial dilutions. Nutrient agar was used as a media to elicit the growth of micro-organisms. Pour plate technique was employed to uniformly dispense the diluted samples on the Petri plates (Autoclavable petri plates, HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) containing the nutrient agar. These Petri plates were then inoculated and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h. The Petri plates were examined for recording the total viable count following incubation. The number of colony forming units (CFU's) of the viable micro-organisms on the Petri plates was counted using a digital colony counter.

It has successfully gained the international concern and is taking the shape of a global problem. Cross infection in its simplest form can be defined as the transfer of an infectious agent from one individual to another in a clinical environment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] New infectious diseases have been found at a rate of one disease per year over the past 22 years.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Most of the time the dental practitioners are exposed to an environment where exists a real danger of infection not only to themselves, but also to the patients. Dentists, patients, and other dental staff are at high risk to infectious diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Worldwide approximately 300-400 million people are chronic hepatitis B carriers.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hepatitis virus transmission is the major occupational hazards for dental personnel. Furthermore, HIV can be transmitted by transfusions, needle stick injury or contact of mucous membrane with the blood or body fluids of a carrier.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Dentists in particular due to the nature of their work are very prone to such detriments. Keeping this in mind, the Centre for Disease Control issued guidelines that emphasize that every patient should be considered as potentially infectious, and the principles of infection control should be strictly followed.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Based on the ability to transmit infection, the dental instruments can be classified into critical, semi-critical and noncritical. Instruments such as mouth mirrors, mouth props and suction tips are categorized under semi-critical items as they come in contact with the epithelial surface, but do not penetrate the epithelial barrier.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] To ensure protection against cross infection from the instruments contaminated with saliva and blood, the most effective procedure is sterilization. It is a procedure that ensures total destruction of all living organisms, including viruses and spores. Disinfection, on the other hand is an intermediate method used to reduce the number of pathogens through chemical agents.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The present study was undertaken to assess the disinfecting efficacy of three chemical disinfectants on contaminated diagnostic instruments.</p><p>This study was carried out among 25-30 years old adults working at a research laboratory, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Individuals were selected from the research laboratory to avoid difficulties associated with transportation of the sample if were to be collected from their individual houses.</p><p>In the present study, the level of microbial contamination was assessed using the diagnostic instruments of different make. This was undertaken to explore the diagnostic instruments with the least possibility of microbial contamination amongst the ones that are marketed in the recent times. The Standard plane mirrors and Disposable mirrors were found to have less microbial contamination compared to other mirror types.

The disinfecting efficacy was assessed on the basis of reduction in the total viable count.</p><p>Jokar <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in their study compared the efficacy of alcohol isopropyl and ethanol in reducing contamination of medical diagnostic devices. Our study followed the same protocol, except that we estimated the total viable count instead of qualitatively assessing the positive cultures.</p><p>In our study, the maximum reduction in microbial load was observed following disinfection with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Glutaraldehyde, Ethyl Alcohol, Distilled water in descending order.</p><p>Taha <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their study compared the effectiveness of four different disinfectant solutions in rapid decontamination of Gutta-percha cones. In their study, 320 Gutta-percha cones were placed in the bacterial suspensions for 30 min, and then immersed in disinfectant solutions. The results of their study were consistent with the results of our study indicating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to be the most effective disinfecting agent.</p><p>Badrian <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in their study investigated the effect of three different types of disinfecting agents on circular samples of alginate impression material which were deliberately contaminated. Among all the three disinfectants used, Epimax (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> based) showed the highest reduction and was successful in completely eradicating all the tested micro-organisms within 10 min. These results were in contrast to the results of our study where although H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed maximum reduction, it could not completely eliminate viable micro-organisms. These variations in the results could be due to product differences. Furthermore, only selected micro-organisms were tested in this study while we evaluated the total viable count without emphasizing on specific strains.</p><p>Eralp <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] evaluated the effectiveness of various disinfectants on different types of contaminated dental instruments. They found 2% glutaraldehyde to be more effective than other disinfectants, although none of the disinfectants showed complete elimination similar to our findings.</p><p>Pradeep <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] compared sterilizing effect of five disinfectant solutions including ethyl alcohol (95%) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (3%) on Gutta-percha points. They found both disinfectants to accomplish sterilization within 5 min of immersion. Our results were contradictory to these findings. We observed only a partial reduction in total viable count rather than complete sterilization. We used diagnostic instruments while this study assessed disinfecting efficacy on Gutta-percha points. The variations in the results could be attributed this difference.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Summary and Conclusion</title><p>We found a significant reduction in total viable count with all the disinfectants. However, none of the disinfectants succeeded in completely eliminating the microbial contamination following disinfection. This finding challenges the reliability of chemical disinfectants in preventing cross infection as the presence of even smaller percentage of pathogenic micro-organisms can result in cross contamination. The result so obtained favors the recommendation of sterilization using autoclaved instruments rather than relying on chemical disinfection methods.</p><p>The study had some inherent drawbacks:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study was carried out on a small sample size</p></list-item><list-item><p>The participants had relatively good oral hygiene and were free from any major oral disease; hence, they cannot be considered as true representatives in a field setting</p></list-item><list-item><p>The confined laboratory environment wherein the decontamination procedures are meticulously followed might have reduced the contamination of diagnostic instruments, which may not be the case in field setting</p></list-item><list-item><p>We used only diagnostic instruments to assess the disinfecting efficacy. A better evaluation of the disinfecting efficacy could be done using a variety of operative instruments as well</p></list-item><list-item><p>Effect of mechanical cleaning by wiping the instruments prior to disinfection was not considered in our study.</p></list-item></list>
