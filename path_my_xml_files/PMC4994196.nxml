One key barrier to addressing these disparities has been limited engagement of African Americans in the development and evaluation of behavioral interventions for management of OA. Pain Coping Skills Training (CST) is a cognitive-behavioral intervention with shown efficacy to improve OA-related pain and other outcomes. Emerging data indicate pain CST may be a promising intervention for reducing racial disparities in OA symptom severity. However, there are important gaps in this research, including incorporation of stakeholder perspectives (e.g. cultural appropriateness, strategies for implementation into clinical practice) and testing pain CST specifically among African Americans with OA. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally enhanced pain CST program among African Americans with OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial among 248 participants with symptomatic hip or knee OA, with equal allocation to a pain CST group and a wait list (WL) control group.

Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 12&#x000a0;weeks (primary time point), and 36&#x000a0;weeks (to assess maintenance of treatment effects). The primary outcome is the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, pain coping, pain interference, quality of life, depressive symptoms, and global assessment of change. Linear mixed models will be used to compare the pain CST group to the WL control group and explore whether participant characteristics are associated with differential improvement in the pain CST program.

The prevalence of OA is expected to double over the next several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to pain and disability, OA has detrimental effects on depression, anxiety, sleep, fatigue, physical activity, weight gain, work participation, and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The rising prevalence of OA and its significant effects on numerous health outcomes highlight the need for effective intervention strategies.</p><p>African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of osteoarthritis (OA). A number of studies have shown that African Americans not only experience higher prevalence rates of OA than Caucasians, but also more severe pain, functional limitations, and other adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite many years of research highlighting the disproportionate burden of OA and other pain-related conditions among African Americans, very little has been done to address these disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. One review noted that key barriers to moving this research forward have included limited engagement by minority patient groups and a lack of testing of pain management interventions in these groups, including African Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Pain Coping Skills Training (CST) is a cognitive-behavioral intervention with shown efficacy to improve OA-related pain and other outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there has been limited work to obtain perspectives on cultural appropriateness of pain CST among African Americans with OA. Prior research suggests that pain CST may be a promising strategy to address racial disparities in OA-related pain. When compared with Caucasians, African Americans with OA and other chronic pain conditions report greater levels of pain catastrophizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], lower perceived ability to cope with and control pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and greater maladaptive coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These coping patterns can be modified through pain CST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In addition, prior studies indicate that pain coping and other psychological factors are key contributors to racial differences in OA-related pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on this promising research, there is a need for a stronger evidence base for the effectiveness of pain CST among African Americans with OA.</p><p>This manuscript describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a culturally enhanced, telephone-based pain CST program among African Americans with hip or knee OA.

Randomization is stratified according to enrollment site and gender to ensure that the groups are balanced in these respects.

The first involves posting of advertisements at study sites and the surrounding communities, inviting patients to self-refer to the study. Second, health care providers at study sites are able to refer patients to the study team directly, with patients&#x02019; permission. Providers may also give study brochures to participants. Third, potentially eligible patients are being actively identified from UNC and Durham VAMC medical records, based on OA diagnosis codes; these patients are mailed letters inviting participation, followed by a telephone call. All potential participants are screened for eligibility criteria via telephone. Individuals who meet eligibility criteria and are interested in participating are asked to meet with a study team member to complete consent, HIPAA authorization, and baseline assessments. We are using an enhanced informed consent process that includes education about the research process, participant bill of rights, and perspectives from African Americans who have participated in research. Specifically, participants are mailed the &#x0201c;You&#x02019;ve Got the Power!&#x0201d; booklet prior to their enrollment visit and shown the &#x0201c;What You Should Know About Clinical Trials&#x0201d; video at the beginning of the enrollment visit. Both of these materials were developed and are distributed by the National Medical Association as a part of Project IMPACT &#x02013; Increase Minority Participation and Awareness of Clinical Trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Following baseline assessments, participants are given their randomization assignment over the telephone by a study team member not blinded to group assignment. Participants randomized to the WL group are informed that they will begin the CST program after their follow-up assessments are complete. Randomization is a stratified block randomization with block sizes &#x0003c;10 maintained by the project statistician. The randomization scheme is contained in the study database and study team members who are blinded to treatment group do not have access to this section in the database.</p><p>Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they develop any new health problems or other events that would either make participation in the study intervention or measures unsafe or confound study outcomes. These largely mirror study exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pain CST program</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pain CST program development</title><p>The pain CST program was based on prior clinical trials among patients with various chronic pain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, previous work with the CST program incorporated perspectives of African American men with prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Building on that work, the CST program was refined in a small, single-arm pilot study among African American Veterans with OA. Then as part of this project, we worked with a broader group of stakeholders to further enhance the program with attention to issues of cultural relevance and future dissemination potential. These stakeholders included African Americans with OA, public health representatives in the field of arthritis, patient advocates, and health care providers. During the course of proposal development, we met with patients and other stakeholders who reviewed several aspects of the project, including the intervention content and dissemination plans. In the first phase of this project, we presented the CST program modules to a group of African American patients with OA, via telephone, and incorporated their input into the program. Following presentation of each module, we asked these stakeholders a series of questions regarding aspects of the program they liked, components or ideas that were difficult to understand, ways in which each skill related or did not relate to their cultural, spiritual, religious or other values, and barriers they may face to incorporating each skill into their normal daily lives. We also sought their input on the intervention handbook. Other members of the study stakeholder panel also provided input on the CST program and handbook. We describe below the enhancements that have been made to enrich cultural sensitivity for each topic and skill as a result of previous related work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the early work on this project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Overview of the pain CST program</title><p>The CST program involves 11 weekly sessions, approximately 30&#x02013;45&#x000a0;min each, delivered via telephone by a trained counselor. Participants are provided with handouts to facilitate each session, along with an audio recording to guide progressive muscle relaxation. A counselor provides instruction in cognitive and behavioral pain coping strategies and also leads participants in guided rehearsals of these skills. Specific skills are described below. Participants are asked to engage in home-based practice of the skills to enhance their application in pain-related situations. During each session, the counselor reviews participants&#x02019; home practice, including successes and barriers, encourages problem solving, and works to set goals for application of skills.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>CST session topics and skills</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Session 1 &#x02013; Introduction, Rationale for Pain Coping Skills, Progressive Muscle Relaxation</title><p><disp-quote><p><bold>Introduction.</bold> Participants are provided with a brief overview of the session formats, as well as the CST participant manual. The importance of regular practice of the coping skills is emphasized. Feedback from patient stakeholders contributed to a decision to frame the CST program as an educational intervention instead of &#x0201c;treatment&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;therapy.&#x0201d;</p><p><bold>Education in the Rationale for CST.</bold> Participants are provided with a brief rationale for the CST intervention, including components of gate control theory. This helps participants to understand how their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can influence pain, as well as how coping skills can enhance their ability to control pain.</p><p><bold>Progressive Muscle Relaxation.</bold> Participants are also introduced to progressive muscle relaxation in this session. This technique enhances one&#x02019;s ability to identify and decrease tension throughout the body. This skill involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups, from the feet to the forehead, while also maintaining deep relaxed breathing. After a description of the technique and a review of its benefits, the CST counselor guides participants through a 15&#x000a0;min relaxation session.</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Session 2 &#x02013; Mini Relaxation Practices and Communicating with Significant Others about Pain and Coping</title><p><disp-quote><p><bold>Mini-Relaxation Practices.</bold> Mini-relaxation is a form of applied relaxation that provides a means to decrease tension and pain when it is not feasible to do a full progressive muscle relaxation session. During this session, the CST counselor guides participants through a mini-relaxation practice that lasts about 30&#x000a0;s. Participants are instructed to take a long breath in, exhale slowly while saying the word &#x0201c;relax&#x0201d; to themselves, and concentrate on the sensations of relaxation flowing throughout the body. Participants are then coached on strategies for applying mini-relaxation practices using both internal cues (e.g., increase in mood or tension) and external cues (e.g., before eating a meal). They are also taught how to use mini-relaxation exercise during activities of daily living that are potentially painful (e.g. prolonged standing, transferring from sitting to standing, and stair climbing).</p><p><bold>Communication with Significant Others about Pain and Coping.</bold> One enhancement we made to the CST program, based on input from our stakeholders and previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], is increased attention to the role of significant others (e.g. spouse, family members, co-workers) in dealing with chronic pain. Specifically, we added a module that provides guidance in speaking and listening strategies, as well as expressive versus decision-making conversations. These are applied to communicating with significant others about pain. Following discussion of these topics, the counselor leads participants in a process of planning effective expressive and decision-making conversations, using examples of relevance to them.</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Sessions 3 and 4 &#x02013; Managing Unhelpful Mood</title><p>Cognitive restructuring (described as &#x0201c;managing unhelpful mood&#x0201d; for participants in this program), involves teaching participants to recognize relationships between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Participants are first taught to identify overly negative, maladaptive thoughts regarding pain and then to replace those with alternative, more realistic and helpful coping thoughts that enhance pain control. Cultural enhancements for this skill have involved regular encouragement for participants to incorporate spiritual or other cultural values into thoughts about pain and pain management.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Session 5 &#x02013; Activity Pacing</title><p>In this session, participants are first taught how to recognize the over-activity cycle, which is a common approach to dealing with pain. In this cycle, individuals tend to overdo an activity, require an extended period of rest or recovery, then overdo the activity again or choose to avoid the activity altogether. The over-activity cycle can lead to negative consequences such as increased pain, avoidance of activity, and increased tension. As an alternative to this maladaptive cycle, participants are taught an activity-rest cycling strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Participants are asked to identify activities in which they tend to overexert themselves, develop a plan for breaking up those activities into periods of activity and rest (i.e., 20&#x000a0;min of housework followed by 10&#x000a0;min of rest), and gradually increase their activity level and decrease resting periods. One cultural enhancement for this skill has involved emphasizing the role of rest in completing tasks, e.g., taking breaks actually can help individuals to accomplish tasks more easily and effectively. This enhancement was in response to findings of Campbell and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (and confirmed among our patient stakeholders) that particularly among African American men, task completion and contributing to the larger community is a common value. In addition, in this session, participants are encouraged to use their communication skills (Session 2) to explain to others why activity pacing will help them accomplish tasks.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Session 6 &#x02013; Pleasant Activities</title><p>Chronic pain can lead to social withdrawal and lowered activity levels. To address this issue, this session teaches participants strategies for remaining engaged in valued activities. The counselor asks participants to brainstorm activities they enjoy or that give them a sense of accomplishment. Participants are also given a list of example pleasant activities based on activities participants have focused on in prior studies. Participants are asked to set weekly goals for scheduling pleasant activities they choose, with a focus on increasing the level and range of these activities over time. Time is devoted to helping participants develop specific plans for integrating appropriate pleasant activities into their daily routine, despite time constraints such as multiple caregiving roles.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Session 7 &#x02013; Pleasant Imagery and Other Distraction Techniques</title><p>Participants are trained in four attention diversion methods that can enhance pain control: pleasant imagery, focal point, auditory stimuli, and challenging mental tasks. Pleasant imagery involves shifting attention from an unpleasant situation (e.g., increase in pain) to a pleasant and relaxing scene; this can be used as an adjunct to relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Focal point distraction involves intentionally focusing on a point or object in the environment for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;min. Similarly, auditory stimuli distraction involves focusing on a noise in the environment for 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;min. Challenging mental tasks may include counting backwards in increments of any number or thinking of a type of food that starts with every letter in the alphabet.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Session 8 &#x02013; Physical Activity and Osteoarthritis; Session 9 &#x02013; Weight Management and Osteoarthritis</title><p>The CST counselor works with participants to place pain CST in the broader context of OA management. Physical activity and weight management are particularly important lifestyle strategies for managing OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although pain CST is the focus of this intervention, we also support participants&#x02019; engagement in these other lifestyle approaches, using low literacy materials and intervention scripts we developed in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These materials take a behavioral, goal-setting approach to weight management and physical activity. This order was selected strategically, since each of the pain coping skills will have been introduced by session 8; this allows the counselor to work with participants to integrate those skills in their efforts to change physical activity and dietary patterns. For example, activity-rest cycling is important for helping patients to improve overall physical activity without a significant pain exacerbation. Cognitive restructuring is also important for helping patients to address unhelpful thoughts that link pain to these other behaviors. For example, some individuals respond to pain with unhealthy eating patterns; uncovering and addressing unhelpful pain-related thoughts is a key strategy in changing these patterns.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Session 10 &#x02013; Skills Review and Problem Solving</title><p>Different coping skills may be particularly helpful for specific challenging pain-related problem situations (e.g. an unexpected weekend visit from relatives or having to take a long plane trip that involves extensive and prolonged sitting). To facilitate patients&#x02019; ability to deal with these situations, the CST counselor reviews all of the skills taught in the program and then teaches participants a 3-step problem solving technique. This technique involves 1) describing the situation, 2) identifying likely difficulties associated with the situation, and 3) identifying a skill or combination of skills that may be best suited for the context.</p></sec><sec id="FPar9"><title>Session 11 &#x02013; Relapse Prevention and Maintenance</title><p><disp-quote><p><bold>Relapse Prevention.</bold> Consistent and continued practice of pain coping skills is an integral part of effective pain control.

The cLDA model is comparable to an ANCOVA model, equivalent when there is no missing data.

First, to our knowledge, it is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally enhanced, telephone-based pain coping skills training program for African Americans with knee or hip OA. Pilot study results suggest that our pain CST program, with cultural tailoring, may be particularly beneficial for African Americans with OA, but this larger clinical trial is needed to rigorously examine its effectiveness. Second, this study takes a pragmatic approach, including participants who experience the spectrum of OA symptom severity and incorporating minimal exclusion criteria. This is important for generalizability of the findings to real-world settings and a large variety of patients. Third, we are collaborating with a diverse stakeholder panel, comprised of African American patients with knee or hip OA, clinicians, community partners and organizations that seek to improve health outcomes among African Americans and other racial/ethnic minority groups, and representatives of national organizations seeking to improve outcomes for people with OA. This group has made key contributions to the development of the pain CST program and study design and will continue to provide feedback on the intervention and ongoing clinical trial.</p><p>We recognize there are limitations to this study. For ethical reasons, study participants in each group are permitted to receive usual OA treatments during the study period, and this could impact pain and other outcomes. However, we are purposefully enrolling patients who are currently under care for OA in one of two health care systems. Therefore, we are examining whether the pain CST program results in improvements in outcomes beyond usual OA care. For logistical reasons, we are not obtaining radiographs from study participants at baseline, and we therefore cannot characterize participants with respect to radiographic stage of OA. However, we are selecting participants on the basis of a diagnosis of OA in the medical record, along with self-report of physician diagnosis of OA.</p><p>In summary, results of this study will provide important information regarding the potential for pain CST programs to reduce racial disparities in OA-related pain. If this culturally enhanced CST program is confirmed to result in clinically meaningful changes among African Americans with OA, incorporation into clinical settings could have a substantial impact. This is particularly important given the high rates of OA and greater symptom burden among African Americans who suffer from this condition.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSQ</term><def><p>Coping strategies questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CST</term><def><p>Coping skills training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV</term><def><p>Diagnostic and statistics manual fourth edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLMM</term><def><p>General linear mixed model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p>Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTE</term><def><p>Heterogeneity of treatment effects</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICMJE</term><def><p>International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional review board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p>Pain catastrophizing scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRIME-MD</term><def><p>Primary care evaluation of mental disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STC</term><def><p>Starting the conversation: diet</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNC</term><def><p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAMC</term><def><p>Veterans affairs medical center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WL</term><def><p>Wait list</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WOMAC</term><def><p>Western Ontario and McMasters Universities osteoarthritis index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study team expresses gratitude to the stakeholder panel for this project, without whom this work would not be possible: Ms. Mae Karim, Ms. Sandy Walker, LPN (Chapel Hill Children&#x02019;s Clinic), Mr. Ralph Brown, Dr. Yashika Watkins, PhD, MPH (Movement is Life / University of Illinois at Chicago), Dr. John McKellar, PhD (Bay Area Pain and Wellness Center, Los Gatos, CA), Dr. Teresa J.
