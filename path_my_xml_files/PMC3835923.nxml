Patients were randomized (1:1) to an optimized daily dose of LDX (30, 50 or 70&#x000a0;mg) or ATX (patients &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;kg, 0.5&#x02013;1.2&#x000a0;mg/kg with total daily dose not to exceed 1.4&#x000a0;mg/kg; patients &#x02265;70&#x000a0;kg, 40, 80 or 100&#x000a0;mg). The primary efficacy outcome was time (days) to first clinical response. Clinical response was defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Secondary efficacy outcomes included the proportion of responders at each study visit and the change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) and CGI-Severity scores. Tolerability and safety were assessed by monitoring treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), height and weight, vital signs and electrocardiogram parameters. Endpoint was defined as the last post-baseline, on-treatment visit with a valid assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 267 patients randomized (LDX, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;133; ATX, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;134), 200 (74.9&#x000a0;%) completed the study. The median time to first clinical response [95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI)] was significantly shorter for patients receiving LDX [12.0&#x000a0;days (8.0&#x02013;16.0)] than for those receiving ATX [21.0&#x000a0;days (15.0&#x02013;23.0)] (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). By week 9, 81.7&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 75.0&#x02013;88.5) of patients receiving LDX had responded to treatment compared with 63.6&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 55.4&#x02013;71.8) of those receiving ATX (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001).

There are considerable differences in the worldwide availability of medications for ADHD. In North America, methylphenidate (MPH)- and amfetamine-based psychostimulants are considered first-line ADHD therapies, and a variety of short- and long-acting formulations are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Europe, short- and long-acting MPH formulations are widely available, and MPH is generally considered to be the first-line medication for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Until recently, only short-acting formulations of amfetamine have been approved in Europe, and only in some countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of non-stimulant ADHD medications, the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine (ATX) is approved in North America and several European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine are licensed in the USA but not Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a long-acting prodrug treatment for patients with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown LDX to be an effective treatment for children, adolescents and adults with ADHD, with a tolerability and safety profile consistent with the known effects of psychostimulant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. LDX is approved as a first-line treatment for ADHD in the USA, Canada and Brazil. In early 2013, LDX became the first long-acting, amfetamine-based medication to be approved in Europe, where it is licensed in several countries for the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD who have had a clinically inadequate response to MPH. Here, we present results from a head-to-head, 9-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, phase IIIb study (SPD489-317; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01106430). This study was designed to provide a direct comparison of the efficacy and safety of LDX and ATX in children and adolescents with ADHD who had experienced an inadequate response to previous MPH therapy. These results will aid clinicians when developing individualized treatment plans for the management of patients with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group study was approved by an independent ethics committee/institutional review board and regulatory agency in each centre (as appropriate).

Dosing began on the morning after the baseline visit and continued for 9&#x000a0;weeks, starting with a 4-week, stepwise, dose-optimization stage. Randomization of patients was stratified by country, and an automated interactive response system was used to generate the random (concealed) allocation sequence and assign participants to study treatments; patients, caregivers and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation.

Only one dose reduction was permitted during the optimization phase and, following dose reduction, further increases were not allowed. Dose adjustments were not permitted beyond visit 3, and patients who were unable to tolerate the study drug were withdrawn from the study.</p><p>LDX was provided in a single capsule of 30, 50 or 70&#x000a0;mg, with patients initially receiving a 30-mg dose. ATX was available in 10-, 18-, 25-, 40- and 60-mg capsules. All patients in the ATX group who weighed less than 70&#x000a0;kg were started on a daily dose of approximately 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight, the final target daily dose being 1.2&#x000a0;mg/kg, with a maximum permitted daily dose of 1.4&#x000a0;mg/kg. Patients who weighed 70&#x000a0;kg or more initially received 40&#x000a0;mg and, if required, were titrated to 80&#x000a0;mg and then to 100&#x000a0;mg daily. Some patients treated with ATX would need two capsules to achieve the required dose (e.g. 80 and 100&#x000a0;mg were achieved using two capsules). Therefore, all patients weighing more than 64.5&#x000a0;kg who were titrated to a higher dose were instructed to take two capsules (the second capsule could be either active drug or placebo, as appropriate) to maintain the double-blind study design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Efficacy</title><p>The primary efficacy measure was the time to first clinical response (days) after the initiation of treatment, as assessed by CGI-I scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The CGI scale provides a global assessment of a patient&#x02019;s severity of illness; CGI-I scores, which were reported at each post-baseline visit, rate the change in a patient&#x02019;s condition from baseline on a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Clinical &#x02018;response&#x02019; was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved). The number of days to first clinical response was calculated as the date of response minus the date of first dose, plus 1&#x000a0;day.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcomes included the proportion of CGI-I responders at each study visit, the proportion of patients who had a decrease of at least one CGI-Severity (CGI-S) category from baseline (assessed at visit 4 and at visit 9), and the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total and subscale scores at each study visit. CGI-S scores, which rate the severity of a patient&#x02019;s condition on a scale of 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill), were assessed at baseline, visit 4 and visit 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The ADHD-RS-IV scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], designed to reflect current ADHD symptoms, assesses 18 items on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms), with a total score ranging from 0 to 54. CGI and ADHD-RS-IV assessments were performed by a medical practitioner or psychologist experienced in the evaluation of children and adolescents with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Tolerability and Safety</title><p>Tolerability and safety assessments included the monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory evaluations, physical examination (including weight), and monitoring of vital signs and ECG parameters. TEAEs were defined as adverse events that first occurred or worsened during the time between the first dose of study drug and the third day following cessation of treatment (inclusive). All TEAEs were coded using <italic>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</italic> (MedDRA) (version 14.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A serious TEAE was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital abnormality/birth defect; or was an Important Medical Event. Important Medical Events may have been considered as serious TEAEs when, based upon medical judgement, they may have jeopardized the patient and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The sponsor required any new onset of seizures, syncope or loss of consciousness to be reported as a serious TEAE. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention percentile growth charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], BMI was categorized into five groups based on BMI percentiles: underweight (&#x0003c;5&#x000a0;%), healthy weight (low; &#x02265;5 to &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;%), healthy weight (high; &#x02265;25 to &#x0003c;85&#x000a0;%), at risk of being overweight (&#x02265;85 to &#x0003c;95&#x000a0;%) and overweight (&#x02265;95&#x000a0;%). ECG parameters were assessed at screening and visit 4. However, the visit 4 ECG was added as a result of a protocol amendment requested by the French Central Ethics Committee and therefore was not obtained for all patients. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRS-C), the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and the Udvalg for Kliniske Unders&#x000f8;gelser Side Effect Rating Scale-Clinician (UKU-SERS-Clin) were also used to monitor patient tolerability and safety plus the suitability of individuals to remain in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Safety/tolerability assessments were performed using the safety population, defined as all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. Efficacy data were analysed using the full analysis set (FAS), also defined as all patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. One patient was randomized to ATX but received LDX owing to a drug dispensing error. Based on the intent-to-treat principle, this patient was included in the ATX treatment group in the FAS, but was counted in the LDX treatment group in the safety population. Endpoint was defined as the last on-treatment, post-baseline visit with a valid assessment.</p><p>Time to first clinical response (days) was calculated using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates and analysed using a Peto&#x02013;Peto&#x02013;Prentice&#x02013;Wilcoxon (PPPW) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], stratified by country and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). The null hypothesis stated that there was no difference in the time to first clinical response between patients receiving LDX and those taking ATX, with the two-sided alternative of a non-zero difference between the groups. Allowing for a 20&#x000a0;% discontinuation rate, approximately 262 patients (131 in each treatment group) were required to detect a difference in time to first clinical response between the treatment groups with a power of 85&#x000a0;%. Patients who prematurely discontinued from the study without responding, and patients who completed the study up to visit 9 without meeting response criteria, were censored at visit 9 in the primary analysis of time to response, and classified as non-responders in the analysis of responders.</p><p>The proportion of responders (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) at each study visit and the proportion of patients who had a decrease of at least one CGI-S category by visit 9 were assessed using the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach and analysed using a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by country. At each study visit, the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV scores, using LOCF, was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment group (effect of interest), country (blocking factor) and the corresponding baseline score (covariate).

However, the efficacy of LDX was significantly faster to onset and greater than that of ATX. Both therapies displayed safety profiles consistent with findings from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These results support previous placebo-controlled trials of LDX, which have demonstrated a robust treatment response in a range of patient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, patients were required to have experienced an inadequate response to previous MPH therapy. In most cases, this was due to a lack of efficacy of MPH (LDX, 75.6&#x000a0;%; ATX, 78.5&#x000a0;%). Despite this, the majority of patients receiving LDX (81.7&#x000a0;%) and ATX (63.6&#x000a0;%) were classified as treatment responders by visit 9, according to CGI-I criteria. These results are of particular relevance to the recent approval of LDX in Europe for the treatment of children and adolescents whose response to previous MPH treatment is considered clinically inadequate. The observation of a robust LDX treatment response in patients previously treated with MPH is supported by a post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, US-based study in 290 children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. That study reported no difference in response to LDX between the overall study population and the subgroup of patients who were receiving MPH at study entry but were not considered well controlled. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that, although the overall response to MPH and amfetamine is similar, the response to each varies among individual patients, and non-response to one class of psychostimulant does not predict non-response to a second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>A subgroup analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 125 children with ADHD concluded that the effects of ATX treatment were largely independent of previous exposure to psychostimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Based on ADHD-RS-IV total scores, effect sizes relative to placebo were 0.75 in pre-treated patients and 0.97 in patients who had not received previous psychostimulant treatment (interaction with treatment, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.607) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In support of this conclusion, a meta-analysis including six randomized controlled trials found that previous treatment with psychostimulants did not influence clinical response to ATX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In contrast, one large (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;516), double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study found that the proportions of stimulant-na&#x000ef;ve children with ADHD who responded to osmotic-release oral system MPH (OROS-MPH) and ATX (64 and 57&#x000a0;%, respectively; effect sizes relative to placebo based on ADHD-RS-IV total score, 1.0 and 0.9) were higher than among those who had previously been treated with a psychostimulant (51 and 37&#x000a0;%, respectively; effect sizes 0.8 and 0.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is unclear why there are discrepancies between studies with respect to the impact of previous psychostimulant treatment on ATX response, but potential differences in the baseline severity of symptoms between previously treated and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients may confound outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Overall, these data support the importance of alternative treatment options for patients who have not improved satisfactorily on their current ADHD medication.</p><p>The observed shorter time to first clinical response (CGI-I of 1 or 2) for LDX relative to ATX was not unexpected as psychostimulants are generally recognized to produce immediate treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In contrast, estimates of the time required for ATX to reach its maximum effect generally range from 4 to 6&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], although, one study suggests that it may take as long as 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The mechanism that underlies this delay in onset of action of ATX is not known. The dose-optimized design of this study is likely to have had some influence on the time to first clinical response in both treatment arms. Importantly, however, as the dose-titration schedules for both treatments followed current clinical guidelines, the times to treatment response observed in this study are relevant to clinical practice.</p><p>In addition to a faster onset of efficacy, the proportions of patients who responded to treatment (CGI-I of 1 or 2) or improved by at least one CGI-S category, and the improvements in mean ADHD-RS-IV total and subscale scores, all indicated that there was a greater reduction of symptoms in patients receiving LDX than ATX by visit 9. A meta-analysis of 32 clinical trials and a total of 15 ADHD medications supports these observations, concluding that both short- and long-acting psychostimulants were significantly more effective than non-stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that ATX, dosed once daily in the present study, may require twice-daily dosing to achieve its maximum beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>A similar proportion of patients in both treatment groups reported TEAEs; most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The proportions of patients who withdrew from the study as a result of a TEAE were also similar. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the LDX treatment group (decreased appetite, decreased weight, headache, nausea and insomnia) and in patients receiving ATX (headache, nausea, somnolence, decreased appetite and fatigue) are consistent with findings from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There was a greater decrease in mean weight in patients receiving LDX than ATX, and more patients receiving LDX than ATX met the outlier criterion for weight loss (&#x02265;7&#x000a0;% reduction from baseline). In addition, more patients receiving LDX (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) than ATX (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) moved into the underweight BMI category, all of whom were in the healthy weight (low) category at baseline. These results are consistent with previously reported evidence that psychostimulants are associated with loss of appetite and weight loss. One systematic review reported that children treated with psychostimulants showed a height deficit of approximately 1&#x000a0;cm/year during the first 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and clinical guidelines recommend that patients receiving ADHD medication are monitored for weight, height, BMI and appetite every 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. High calorific snacks, late evening meals, dosing after meals, drug holidays, or switching to a different class or formulation of medication may be beneficial in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The mean increases in blood pressure and pulse rate observed in both treatment arms in this study were relatively modest. It is recognized, however, that some patients receiving ADHD medications may experience blood pressure and pulse rate above the 95th percentile, and clinical guidelines recommend that patients are assessed for heart disease or symptoms suggesting significant cardiovascular disease, and family history of sudden unexpected death before commencing treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Once on medication, patients&#x02019; blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored at least every 6 months and, if measurements are above the 95th percentile, it is recommended that patients have a dose-reduction or drug holiday, or are referred to a cardiologist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the present study, a higher proportion of patients receiving ATX than LDX met the outlier criterion for high pulse rate. With the exception of weight and pulse rate, changes in mean vital sign and ECG parameters, and in the frequency of outliers and PCI observations, were similar between treatment groups.</p><p>The strengths of this study include its head-to-head, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-optimized design, and the large number of patients enrolled from multiple countries. These results are particularly relevant to the recent approval of LDX in Europe for the treatment of children and adolescents whose previous MPH treatment is considered clinically inadequate. However, it is unclear whether this patient population, who met detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria specifically related to prior MPH response, would have favoured a response in one treatment arm over the other. Also, as noted earlier, certain elements of the study design (the 9-week duration and once-daily dosing regimen) may not have elicited the maximum potential treatment benefit of ATX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A clinically relevant difference in efficacy was observed between LDX and ATX, with LDX associated with a significantly faster, and more robust, treatment response in children and adolescents with ADHD of at least moderate severity and a previous inadequate response to MPH therapy.

These findings will aid clinicians when developing treatment plans for patients who have achieved unsatisfactory improvements on MPH therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01106430.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by funding from Shire.
