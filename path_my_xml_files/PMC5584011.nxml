It is a nationwide open-label multicentre randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a superiority design and will be accompanied by an economic analysis. Pregnant women undergoing the routine anomaly scan will be offered cervical length measurement between 18 and 22&#x000a0;weeks in a singleton and at 16&#x02013;22&#x000a0;weeks in a multiple pregnancy. Women with a short cervix, defined as less than, or equal to 35&#x000a0;mm in a singleton and less than 38&#x000a0;mm in a multiple pregnancy, will be invited to participate in the study.</p><p id="Par3">Eligible women will be randomly allocated to receive either progesterone or a cervical pessary. Following randomization, the silicone cervical pessary will be placed during vaginal examination or 200&#x000a0;mg progesterone capsules will be daily self-administered vaginally. Both interventions will be continued until 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation or until delivery, whichever comes first.</p><p id="Par4">Primary outcome will be composite adverse perinatal outcome of perinatal mortality and perinatal morbidity including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage grade III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia higher than grade I, necrotizing enterocolitis higher than stage I, Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) or culture proven sepsis. These outcomes will be measured up until 10&#x000a0;weeks after the expected due date. Secondary outcomes will be, among others, time to delivery, preterm birth rate before 28, 32, 34 and 37&#x000a0;weeks, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, maternal morbidity, maternal admission days for threatened preterm labour and costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par5">This trial will provide evidence on whether vaginal progesterone or a cervical pessary is more effective in decreasing adverse perinatal outcome in both singletons and multiples.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">Trial registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=4414">NTR 4414</ext-link>.

PTB affects over 12,000 pregnancies per year in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and is the most important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity, and subsequent neurodevelopmental sequelae. Similarly, neonatal morbidity is strongly increased in case of preterm birth. A follow up study among a cohort of Dutch children born prior to 32&#x000a0;weeks showed that the prevalence of a severe handicap among surviving children was 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In women with a singleton pregnancy, the spontaneous preterm birth rate in The Netherlands is around 5%. It results in a perinatal mortality rate in 0.8% and a severe disability rate in 0.7%, while 2% of the children suffer from moderate disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Women with a multiple pregnancy have a much higher risk of preterm delivery. The incidence of preterm delivery in women with a twin pregnancy is almost 50%, with 1.8, 7 and 14% delivering before 28, 32 and 34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation respectively. As a consequence, women with a twin pregnancy have an 8% perinatal mortality, 7% severely disabled children and 20% moderately disabled children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is known that a short cervix, bacterial vaginosis, bacteriuria and maternal factors such as maternal periodontal disease, low socio-economic status, smoking and both high and low maternal BMI increase risk of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Until a decade ago, there were no effective interventions for the prevention of preterm birth in low-risk pregnancies. However, in the last decade two potentially important breakthroughs have been established: progesterone and pessary. In 2014, an updated Cochrane systematic review reported on the effectiveness of progesterone in the prevention of preterm birth (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39&#x02013;0.98) in women with threatened or established preterm labour, the author&#x02019;s concluded that due to the low number of included trials, there was insufficient evidence to justify progestational agents as a tocolytic agent for women presenting with preterm labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However a recent meta-analysis of individual patient data indicated that in asymptomatic women with singleton or multiple pregnancies and a short cervix, progesterone generated lower rates of preterm delivery (26% vs. 36%; OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25&#x02013;0.80) and lower rates of perinatal mortality, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (15% vs. 17%; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.38&#x02013;1.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">An individual patient data meta-analysis on 13 trials (7536 children) in multiple pregnancies using progestogens (intramuscular 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17Pc) or vaginal progesterone) showed no overall effect of progestogens on adverse perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.97&#x02013;1.4 for 17Pc and RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77&#x02013;1.2 for vaginal progesterone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, vaginal progesterone showed a reduction in adverse perinatal outcome among women with a cervical length equal or below 25&#x000a0;mm (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47&#x02013;0.70 and RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.42&#x02013;0.75, respectively). The recently published OPPTIMUM trial showed no statistically significant impact on the reduction of spontaneous PTB&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;34&#x000a0;weeks or fetal death (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.39&#x02013;1.20) or composite adverse neonatal outcome (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.25&#x02013;1.16) in the asymptomatic short cervix subgroup. However neonatal death occurred less frequent in the progesterone group (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06&#x02013;0.49). Furthermore, no harm of progesterone was detected when cognitive scores at 2&#x000a0;years of age were compared (&#x02212;0.48; 95% CI -2.77-1.81) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">A second potential breakthrough in the prevention of preterm birth is the use of a cervical pessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The PECEP trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that a cervical pessary reduced preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks in women with a singleton pregnancy and short cervical length (&#x0003c;25&#x000a0;mm) (6% versus 27%). The composite neonatal morbidity did not differ between both groups (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.27&#x02013;1.5). Two other RCT&#x02019;s by Hui et al. and Nicolaides et al. couldn&#x02019;t reproduce these results. Nicolaides et al. randomized 935 women with a singleton pregnancy to either a cervical pessary or expectant management. The authors found no difference in preterm birth rates before 34&#x000a0;weeks (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75&#x02013;1.69) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The mean gestational age at randomisation was higher in this trial (GA 23&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5) compared to the trial by Goya et al. (GA 22&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;3) and this might have influenced the effect of the pessary. Within the smaller, prematurely ended, Chinese trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;108) birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks occurred in 9.4% and 5.5% in the pessary and expectant management group respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.46) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Due to slow recruitment and new published results of the PECEP-group, the researchers decided to stop recruitment and report the results of their interim analysis.</p><p id="Par32">In twin pregnancies several studies assessed the effect of pessaries. Within the Dutch Consortium for Healthcare Evaluation and Research in Obstetrics and Gynaecology - NVOG Consortium 2.0, the ProTwin trial was finished, which studied the effectiveness of pessary in unselected twin pregnancies in reducing spontaneous preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes. Although there was no overall treatment effect of the pessary, the pessary significantly reduced preterm delivery rates before 32&#x000a0;weeks in a subgroup of women with a cervix less than the 25th percentile (38&#x000a0;mm) (11% vs. 25%, RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.20&#x02013;0.98). More importantly, within this subgroup, adverse perinatal outcome rate was substantially lower in the pessary group as compared to no intervention (7% vs. 30%, RR 0.23 95% CI; 0.09&#x02013;0.60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Long-term follow-up of this study is expected to be published shortly. A more recent trial in women with a twin gestation and a short cervix by Goya et al. revealed a significant reduction of spontaneous preterm birth &#x0003c;34&#x000a0;weeks in the group that received a cervical pessary (RR 0.41 (95% CI 0.22&#x02013;0.76)). No difference in composite perinatal morbidity and mortality was observed between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The recent trial, by Nicolaides et al., in which 1180 women with a twin pregnancy without a specific cervical length cut-off were allocated to a pessary or expectant management, found no effect of a cervical pessary on preterm birth rates &#x0003c;34&#x000a0;weeks (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.79&#x02013;1.4) and adverse neonatal outcome (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.85&#x02013;1.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The subgroup analysis of 214 women with a cervical length below 25&#x000a0;mm also indicated no differences.</p><p id="Par33">In view of the studies mentioned above, two conclusions can be drawn. First, a short cervix measured at the beginning of the second trimester identifies women at risk for preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Second, both progestogens and cervical pessary have shown conflicting but promising results for women who are at increased risk for preterm birth due to a short cervix. Both interventions are likely to be introduced in clinical practice since they are non-invasive and potentially cause a cost-reduction.</p><p id="Par34">Until now, no study has directly compared progesterone administration with cervical pessary in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Therefore, we propose to perform an RCT to compare the efficacy of vaginal progesterone and cervical pessary in the prevention of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with preterm birth in women with a short cervix.

It is in the patient&#x02019;s interest that the pessary is placed by an experienced caregiver to ensure careful placement. In case of complaints, (vaginal) examination is recommended to inspect the cervix and reposition or replace the pessary with another size if necessary. In case of regular contractions, persistent or recurrent vaginal blood loss or premature rupture of the membranes, during treatment with a pessary, the pessary should be removed.</p><p id="Par45">Vaginal progesterone capsules 200&#x000a0;mg will be taken from time of randomisation onwards up to 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestation or delivery, whatever comes first.

The proportion of adverse perinatal outcome of 5% in the vaginal progesterone is based on the Triple P study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] which was performed in a comparable population. The frequency of adverse perinatal outcome of 1% in the pessary group is based on the PECEP trial where a 3% poor perinatal outcome was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However the PECEP trial included women with a cervix below 25&#x000a0;mm only. Since we include women with a cervix below or equal 35&#x000a0;mm, we expect a lower frequency of adverse perinatal outcome in our study population. Using a two-sided test with a type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% and a loss to follow-up of 10%, we calculated that we would need a sample size of 628 women (314 per group).</p><p id="Par56">For multiple pregnancies we expected frequencies of adverse perinatal outcome of 24% per pregnancy in the vaginal progesterone group and 12% in the pessary group. In the IPD meta-analysis of Schuit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] adverse perinatal outcome was 25% in the progesterone-group, in a population with a shorter cervix (&#x0003c; 25&#x000a0;mm). In the ProTwin trial adverse perinatal outcome was 12% in a comparable population with a similar cervical length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We expect a 50% reduction of adverse perinatal outcome in the pessary group. Since multiple gestations are followed up in the hospital, less patients being lost to follow up were expected. Using a two-sided test with a type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% and a loss to follow-up of 5%, a sample size of 332 women (166 per group) would be needed to be able to detect a significant difference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par57">All analyses will be performed for singleton and multiple pregnancies separately and will be according to the intention to treat principle. The primary outcome, that is adverse perinatal outcome, will be assessed by calculating and comparing rates in the two groups, using a random intercept fixed effects binomial model with a log link function, resulting in a relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. The random intercept is used to account for the stratified randomization by centre. In multiple pregnancies the clustering of children within one mother will be taken into account in the analysis using generalised estimating equations instead of a log-binomial model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Numbers needed to treat will be calculated when appropriate.</p><p id="Par58">To evaluate the potential of each of the strategies, we will also perform a per protocol analysis, taking into account only those cases that were treated according to protocol.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Secondary study parameter(s)</title><p id="Par59">Time to delivery will be evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimates, with account for different durations of gestation at entry, and will be tested with the log rank test.

Pooling data of these trials can hopefully help to conclude which intervention is most efficacious in preterm birth prevention. Ongoing (prospective) individual participant meta-analysis on progesterone and pessaries (PROMPT) in singletons and multiples will hopefully give new answers on how to prevent spontaneous preterm deliveries.
