They were divided into top two groups. Thirty-one of the total were treated with primary valve fulguration (Group 1) and 23 were treated with vesicostomy (Group 2). One-year-creatinine level and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured. Also, they were taken ultrasonography detecting hydronephrosis.

A vesicostomy is a surgical method in which the urine is allowed to drain and also to decompress the urinary system.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Despite tremendous studies done in this field, controversies exist in order to select the best method for a better outcome. So, we decided to compare early neonatal valve ablation with vesicostomy in a patient with PUV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>From 2011 to 2013, 54 male infants 2 days to 7 days old with PUV were participated in this study. All had written consent from the patients&#x02019; parents and the study was approved by Ethic Committee. Pre-term infants, infants with low birth weight (LBW) and severe hydronephrosis and infants aged 1-month and lower were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were divided into two groups. Twenty-three of the total in Group 1 was treated with vesicostomy and 31 in Group 2 were treated with valve ablation.</p><p>Valve ablation is done while the baby is stable concerning medical issue. A dose of antibiotic is given intravenously (ampicilin 30 mg/kg) before the procedure. A diagnostic cystoscopy using 0&#x000b0;6/8 Fr (stroz/germany) neonatal cystoscope is needed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Eleven Fr resectoscope is with either the cold/sickle blade or bugbee electrode and valve resection should be available for performance at the 5, 7, and 12 o&#x02019;clock[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and vesicostomy is done by communicating channel between the bladder and lower abdominal wall when urethral size precludes safe valve ablation can be created to provide bladder drainage in this procedure [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>VCUG before vesicostomy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJPS-12-270-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>VCUG after vesicostomy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AJPS-12-270-g002"/></fig><p>The patients were undertaken ultrasonography in order to evaluate hydronephrosis and also they were followed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 1-year creatinine (Cr) level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Analysis</title><p>Data were collected and analysed with IBMM SPSS 21Version and also Chi-square test was used <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Total 54 boys met the inclusion study criteria. Mean age of patients in Group 1 was 3.8 &#x000b1; 1.48 days and in Group 2 was 4.7 &#x000b1; 1.8 days. One-year &#x02014; Cr level as one of the prognostic parameter was measured in two groups.

Godbole <italic>et al</italic>. in the study comparing primary valve ablation with primary vesicostomy, found no significant difference in serum Cr and GFR at 1-year of age between the two groups.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The findings of this study are in consistant with our results.</p><p>Also Lukong <italic>et al</italic>. showed vesicostomy as a useful temporizing modality of treatment in neonates and infants with PUV while valve ablation is not possible.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Also in a study of mini-vesicostomy in the management of PUV after valve ablation, Nanda <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the mini-vesicostomy significantly improved upper urinary tract drainage, and it is a simple and suitable method to enhance long-term outcomes in PUV.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In developing countries endoscopic treatment is limited in neonates and infants due to lack of access to suitable sized instruments. Vesicostomy allows the bladder to decompress and to be in contact with urinary growth factors. Management of vesicostomy is easy concerning care needed and protection of the upper urinary tracts from further dysfunctions[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also Soliman in his study showed that use of a small Fogarty catheter guided through a neonatal cystoscope is a safe, simple and effective substitute for valve ablation in LBW neonates.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Prognosis of renal function in PUV has been directly linked to age at presentation, GFR, prenatal diagnosis, renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, renal scarring, Cr level during 1<sup>st</sup> year of life, upper tract obstruction, bladder dysfunction and urinary tract infection.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In a study conducted by Divya Bhadoo, serum Cr level was considered an important prognostic factor for final renal outcome. When initial serum Cr was &#x02264;1 mg/dl the incidence of chronic renal failure was 23%, while if it was above 1 mg/dl, the incidence increased to 72%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In our study, 1-year GFR and Cr level were measured. However, the difference was not significant in both groups.</p><p>Also, we have measured GFR, prognostic factor. Previous studies show mean GFR in patients who finally developed renal failure, was significantly lower than those without renal failure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] These findings support our management regarding evaluating GFR and Cr level in this study two methods were performed, and complication were assessed. No significant difference was found. However, a complication such as hydronephrosis in groups treated with vesicostomy was lower than the other group.</p><p>Since in our community endoscopic treatment is limited in neonates and infants due to lack of access to appropriate sized instruments and advantages of vesicostomy mentioned, vesicostomy might be a better choice in PUV. However, the decision is based on the surgeon and conditions of the infants. For instance, prematurity, LBW, electrolyte imbalance, and systemic disease are the effective factors that have effect in decision making.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both methods improved urinary tract drainage. However, no significant difference was found in both groups, there was more tendency for performing vesicostomy in the management of PUV in our community.
