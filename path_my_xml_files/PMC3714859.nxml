It is a synthetic opioid agonist that exhibits a potent antagonist effect on glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Methadone is highly bound to proteins (alfa-1-acid-glycoprotein), highly lipophilic and metabolized by the liver (mainly by the cytochrome P450 CYP 3A3/4 isoenzyme); it has no known active metabolites. Methadone has a high intestinal absorption, and its bioavailability is approximately 80%, with much less inter-individual variability compared to other opioids, such as oral morphine. One unique feature of methadone is that is has a robust distribution phase with a short lasting (alpha) half-life of approximately 3 hours, followed by an extended elimination phase (beta) ranging from 12 to 60 hours; it also displays large inter-individual variability. This elimination phase may result in toxicity and drug accumulation. Most of the drug is excreted in feces with no significant accumulation in patients with renal impairment. Despite its long term use in drug addiction and in cancer pain patients, there is a great paucity of studies on methadone in neuropathic pain syndromes. Neuropathic pain is present in 7% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cln_68p1057">1</xref>) and may represent up to 60% of patients with cancer-related pain. Opioids are effective for neuropathic pain and are used as second and third line treatments in this population. However, most of the available evidence concerns the use of tramadol and extended release oxycodone. Other opioids, such as hydromorphone and methadone, were seldom evaluated for this pain syndrome. Methadone is an inexpensive and widely available drug in many countries, but it is also a potent NMDA inhibitor, which could potentially increase its analgesic effects in neuropathic pain patients. The aim of this pilot proof-of-principle study was to evaluate the use of low-dose methadone in refractory post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) patients who remained refractory after undergoing first and second line treatments and had indications for adding an opioid to their current drug regimen. The main outcome measurement was pain intensity reduction, and the secondary outcomes were patient safety, changes in pain interference in daily life and the different effects of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The aim of this pilot proof-of-concept study was to assess the safety and efficacy of methadone in PHN patients. Patients with chronic (&#x0003e;6 months) symptomatic PHN with visual analogical scale (VAS) scores &#x0003e;40/100 mm despite using first and second line treatment drugs (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine and gabapentinoids) were recruited from the Pain Center of the Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. All patients were opioid na&#x000ef;ve. The PHN diagnosis was based on current diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-cln_68p1057">2</xref>) for defined neuropathic pain. Pain was located in the cervical, dorsal or trigeminal areas.</p><p>The study was approved by our local institutional review board and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (0078/11 and NCT01752699, respectively). All patients provided written informed consent before being included in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>In this crossover, double-blind, randomized trial, all participants received either methadone 5 mg or placebo (bid) for three weeks, followed by a 3-week washout period and then another three-week treatment period with methadone and placebo, according to the randomized treatment sequence.

This controlled study is one of the few to study methadone's effect on neuropathic pain and the only one to evaluate a specific patient group, such as PHN patients.</p><p>There is a great paucity of randomized controlled studies of methadone in chronic pain. Note, there are no placebo-controlled studies on the use of this drug in cancer patients, which is understandable because of ethical issues. Case series have suggested that methadone could be used long term in neuropathic pain patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cln_68p1057">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln_68p1057">12</xref>). Until now, only one placebo controlled study evaluated its efficacy in a small sample of heterogeneous neuropathic pain syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cln_68p1057">13</xref>). In this study, methadone was used in a rather peculiar regimen, taken on alternate days at 10 and 20 mg/day doses. It was found that methadone at 20 mg/day had a significant effect over placebo in each 20-day trial duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cln_68p1057">7</xref>). An open-label study evaluated the analgesic effect of methadone against morphine in cancer pain patients. The analgesic effects were similar, but methadone was associated with less frequent dry mouth and more frequent headaches, and while the morphine dose had to be significantly titrated during the 14-day trial, the methadone dose remained the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cln_68p1057">14</xref>). Similar results were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cln_68p1057">15</xref>) in a parallel trial comparing methadone and morphine in cancer pain patients. In a more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln_68p1057">16</xref>), the authors suggested that methadone would be as effective as morphine in cancer pain patients with or without neuropathic pain. However, the external validity of this study remained limited because of the extremely high drop-out rate observed, which was most likely caused by the high dose conversion ratio from morphine to methadone (2:1) and the fixed dose regimen chosen, which would force patients in the methadone group to receive relatively more drug than the morphine arm, with no possibility to decrease it without leaving the study.</p><p>The latest study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-cln_68p1057">17</xref>) included cancer pain patients in an open-label parallel design trial to receive either methadone, sustained release morphine or transdermal fentanyl. The authors found no difference in pain relief or in the negative impacts of quality of life or adverse events. However, methadone was associated with a substantially lower treatment cost than the other treatments.</p><p>Excitatory amino acids have been implicated in the occurrence of neuropathic pain, specifically through NMDA receptors, which have been implicated in the occurrence of opioid tolerance and are considered to play a major role in the central sensitization seen in neuropathic pain patients. Because methadone is a potent opioid agonist and an NMDA antagonist, it has been suggested that it would have efficacy in neuropathic pain. Methadone has been shown to attenuate mechanical and cold allodynia in experimental models of both peripheral and central neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-cln_68p1057">18</xref>), exhibiting anti-allodynic affects superior to oxycodone and morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-cln_68p1057">19</xref>). It has also been shown that the blockade of NMDA receptors plays an important role in the analgesic effects observed in experimental models of peripheral neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cln_68p1057">20</xref>), which may also be related to its norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blocker properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cln_68p1057">21</xref>). The preferential effect of methadone in dynamic mechanical allodynia found in the present study and its correlation with sleep improvement is an original finding and confirms the findings from experimental studies. Larger controlled trials of the use of methadone in neuropathic pain must be performed because it is an inexpensive opioid that has pharmacological particularities, such as long half-life and NMDA antagonism that make it an attractive option to opioids currently available for this pain syndrome. Placebo use in pain patients frequently raises ethical concerns. Despite the possible analgesic effect of methadone to treat PHN a priori, it is not currently approved as a treatment option for neuropathic pain, and it is not widely available in Europe or in many Latin American countries for this indication mainly because of the lack of clinical evidence attesting to its efficacy, such as this brief pilot study. Methadone and placebo were added to the current analgesic regimen of patients who were already receiving the best pharmacological treatment available at our institution at the time of the study. Thus, a more effective neuropathic pain treatment was not withheld because of participating in this study protocol; both methadone and placebo were used as an &#x0201c;add-on&#x0201d; treatment. As part of our current ethical recommendations, all patients who improved while taking methadone were offered the medication on a long-term treatment basis after the study ended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-cln_68p1057"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
