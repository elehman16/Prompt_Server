repetitive sit-to-stand training methods that feature a step-foot position to the
paretic-side foot of hemiplegic patients; it sought also to provide the information needed
to apply weight-bearing and balance training to hemiplegic patients. [Subjects and
Methods] The subjects were divided into two groups: a spontaneous group and a step group.
They all performed repetitive sit-to-stand training five times per week for a total of six
weeks. The Biodex Balance System, TUG, and 5XSST were used to measure the static and
dynamic standing balance of each patient. A foot mat system was used to measure foot
pressure. [Results] In the balance measurements, differences in the Overall index,
Ant-post index, Med-lat index, Fall risk index, TUG, and 5XSST after training was
significantly different between the two study groups. In evaluating foot pressure
measurements, we found that the COP (Ant-post), Peak pressure: hind foot, and Contact
area: hind foot measurements significantly differed between the groups after the training.
[Conclusion] Repetitive sit-to-stand training that involves positioning the non-paretic
leg upward can be considered a significant form of training that improves the symmetric
posture adjustment and balance of hemiplegic patients following a stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Step-foot position</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Foot pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The most common mobility problem among stroke patients is muscular weakness contralateral
to the injury side<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Persons with
hemiparesis scarcely use their affected foot for weight-bearing while executing trunk
movement and reaching tasks<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>; this may
lead to difficulties in performing daily activities, such as rising from a chair without
assistance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients use their weight on their non-paretic side when moving their hip or trying
to stand up, by positioning the non-paretic side of their foot to the rear instead of the
paretic side of their foot, or by using an arm to compensate for the unsuitable sit-to-stand
position<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. If this compensatory
mechanism becomes habitual, it will exacerbate the non-use of the paretic-side leg<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the results of previous
studies, even the learned non-use of the paretic side in chronic stroke patients who
repetitively used the paretic side of their limbs has been reported to improve the use and
function of the paretic limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and these
repetitive training tasks have been found to improve the ability to assume the sit-to-stand
position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shumway-Cook et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> recommend that stroke patients perform their
tasks in fast-moving training and in a variety of environments, along with sit-to-stand
training. According to other studies that focused on seat height<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, results from the use of foot placement<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and stepping on
the non-paretic-side leg<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> suggest that
even the weight-bearing ratio of the non-paretic side leg of chronic stroke patients can
vary, depending on their sit-to-stand position. The results of applying a lateral step to
the elderly population and patients with hip disorders or balance problems may enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dysfunctions in postural control<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most changes in the measured
parameters have been evaluated in the absence of an intervention period. The most prevalent
characteristic among hemiplegic patients due to stroke is imbalance between their paretic
and non-paretic legs, which limits their daily activities. Thus, hemiplegic patients must
perform sit-to-stand training in order to do independent walking and return to their daily
lives. In this study, we look for ways to improve the asymmetrical weight-bearing ratio by
applying different repetitive sit-to-stand training to the non-paretic-side foot of
hemiplegic patients, and provide the information needed to offer balance training to
hemiplegic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 23 subjects participated in the study, with 12 subjects in the experimental
group and 11 in the control group. There was no significant difference among them in terms
of height, weight, age, time since stroke, and the like. The mean (&#x000b1;standard deviation) &#x000b1;
height, weight, age, and time since stroke in the spontaneous (SPO) control group were
161.43 &#x000b1; 8.49&#x02005;cm, 61.21 &#x000b1; 13.10&#x02005;kg, 61.29 &#x000b1; 10.76&#x02005;years, and 33.36 &#x000b1; 21.09 months,
respectively; those figures in the step (STP) experimental group were 164.67 &#x000b1; 9.54&#x02005;cm,
61.53 &#x000b1; 9.45&#x02005;kg, 57.47 &#x000b1; 9.47&#x02005;years, and 26.6 &#x000b1; 14.61 months, respectively.</p><p>The subject inclusion criteria were more than six months having passed since their injury,
the ability to walk 10&#x02005;m independently and without aid, and the ability to rise from a chair
without the use of the hands and with the non-paretic lower limb supported on a step. All
the patients had a modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score of below grade 2 spasticity and a
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher. Individuals were excluded if
they had less than 15-degree passive ankle dorsiflexion, any orthopedic disorder that might
interfere with the experiment, neglect of space on the affected side, or any other
neurological disease or auditory or visual deficit that could prevent data collection. The
University Research Ethics Board approved the study protocol, and all subjects gave informed
consent. The experiment subjects underwent neurological physical therapy five times per week
under the guidance of a physical therapist with more than three years of experience, and
they were divided into two groups&#x02014;namely, the SPO group and the STP group. Additionally, all
subjects underwent repetitive sit-to-stand training five times per week for a total of six
weeks.</p><p>For the evaluation of the balance position, the Biodex balance system SD (Biodex Medical
System, Inc., USA) was used. The test was run for 20&#x02005;s, and the test application levels of
the mat were 1&#x02013;8, wherein 1 was the most common movement, and 8, the least common movement.
Because this study targeted patients with central nervous system injuries, the test was
conducted at the lowest level, 8, which represents the least amount of movement and the
lowest risk factor. Balance ability was captured as a balance index value, and the better an
individual&#x02019;s balance ability was, the lower the balance index would be. As part of the
assessment program, we also undertook the postural stability test (PST) and the limits of
the stability test (LST). Before the test, the patient stood on a fixed mat on his or her
two feet and exercised three times to adjust to the equipment, after which time the test was
started. The subjects were measured at the position at which their feet were comfortably
opened and both their hands were on the equipment. Three measurements were taken and their
results were averaged.</p><p>The timed up and go test (TUG) is a simple way of assessing a patient&#x02019;s standing ability
and movement ability. The patient sits on a chair that features arm rests, and the length of
time is measured from when the tester signals the patient and the patient stands up and
walks for 3 m, passes the predetermined turning point, and returns to the chair. The
intraclass correlation was 0.99, and the interclass correlation was 0.98; these values have
been reported with high levels of confidence<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, this method has been used to evaluate the balance
ability and functional movement of the elderly and fragile elderly, and of stroke,
Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, and arthritic disease patients, to predict their risk of a fall<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To measure leg strength, we used the five times sit-to-stand test (5XSST). This test
measures the time required to assume the sit-to-stand position on a stool five times without
using a hand. The interclass correlation was 0.87<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The pressure measurement system evaluates the pressure applied to the sole of the foot
during the standing position, using the mat form of a resistance-type pressure sensor called
F-Mat (Tekscan Inc., USA). The size of the pressure sensor is 8,382&#x02005;mm &#x000d7; 8,382&#x02005;mm, and it is
composed of 44 horizontal sensors and 52 vertical sensors. The pressure distribution was
used with a commercial Tekscan program (Ver. 5.83) and analyzed by collecting the data at 30
frames/s. The foot pressure measurement equipment was used to measure, from the stationary
state, the distribution of foot pressure on the mat equipped with a pressure sensor; it also
measures the pressure in real time, so as to analyze the symmetry and asymmetry weight
distribution and any selection bias. The subjects assumed the static standing position on
the mat and maintained it for 30&#x02005;s; we then analyzed the middle 5-s interval. The foot
pressure measurement was taken three times, and the results were averaged.</p><p>Sit-to-stand training was performed as per Roy (2007) and Rocha Ade et al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was divided into the following two
conditions, while taking into account the conditions of use and patient fatigue.</p><p>(1) SPO group: No instructions were given regarding the initial foot position.</p><p>(2) STP group: The non-paretic foot was constrained by supporting it on a step, and the
paretic foot was kept at ground level. Both feet had 10-degree ankle dorsiflexion (step
height: 25% of the knee height).</p><p>The configuration of the training was as follows:</p><p>(1) Move the cup from the non-paretic side to the paretic side 10 times, while sitting.</p><p>(2) Carry out the sit-to-stand position 10 times by aligning the body center while looking
in the mirror in front.</p><p>(3) Carry out the sit-to-stand position 10 times while picking up the goods in front of the
paretic foot with the non-paretic hand.</p><p>(4) Carry out the sit-to-stand position 10 times and put the weight on the paretic side,
with the aid of a therapist.</p><p>(5) Carry out the sit-to-stand position 10 times as directed by the therapist, without
looking in the mirror. A 1-min rest was allowed after each set, across all training sets.
Considering the intensity of the training, 12-times sit-to-stand training was conducted at
weeks 3&#x02013;4, and 15 times at weeks 5&#x02013;6.</p><p>The descriptive statistics and the results of tests for normality (i.e., Shapiro-Wilk) and
homogeneity of variance were calculated as outcome variables, using the SPSS 20.0 for
Windows software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). An independent two-sample t-test was
used, given the homogenous nature of the subject; the difference before and after training
was calculated and comparisons were made using an independent two-sample t-test. The
statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the balance measurement, the changes to the Overall index, Ant-post index, Med-lat

easily through the use of his or her own dynamic balance ability and a symmetrical weight
support on either side of the leg in the standing position. Stroke patients, however, are
more likely to stand by using more weight support on their non-paretic leg and less weight
support on their paretic leg. This creates a tendency wherein the patient may fall upon
movement, and thus it restricts daily activities, making it difficult to return to
independent living. To increase weight support on the paretic leg, the effects of foot
pressure and balance in stroke patients were examined by conducting repetitive sit-to-stand
training with the non-paretic foot on the mat. In the current study, a statistically
significant and dynamic reduction in balance ability appeared among those patients in the
group training that made use of the mat. Leroux et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> report that a stroke patient showed a significant increase in
balance, mobility, and stability in his posed body upon undertaking a task-oriented program.
Tung et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, in their study of 32
stroke patients, applied 30&#x02005;min of general physical therapy in their control and
experimental groups three times per week for four weeks, and additional repetitive
sit-to-stand training in the experimental group, which improved the dynamic balance ability
and the extension muscle ability of the patients therein. In this study, the group that used
the mat showed improved balance ability and foot pressure; this enabled them to elevate
their non-paretic leg and shift the center of gravity in their non-paretic leg to that in
their paretic leg, and to move more slowly. It might also have brought about quick recovery
in their position adjustment by reducing their learned non-use of the paretic leg. There was
a significance decrease in COP (Ant-post) in the foot pressure test, and the peak pressure
of the hind foot and the contact surface of the hind foot each showed significant increases.
Cheng et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> report that after
repetitive sit-to-stand training with a symmetrical foot posture, the total distance from
the center of pressure in every direction&#x02014;front and rear, and left and right&#x02014;in the static
standing position decreased after training. In the current study, the total distance from
the center of pressure in the front and rear decreased.</p><p>Chaudhuri and Aruin<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> report that
elevating the non-paretic-side foot forcibly loads more weight on the paretic leg, improves
the weight support symmetrically while increasing muscle activity in the paretic leg,
provides strong stimulation, and finally, increases the weight load on the paretic leg.
Laufer et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> report that in their
study of hemiplegic patients while using steps of various heights (10&#x02005;cm and 17&#x02005;cm) on the
non-paretic side of the leg and forced weight-bearing induction on the paretic side, the
weight support on the paretic leg increased. However, there was no significant difference in
the weight distribution of the paretic-side leg between the 10-cm and 17-cm steps. Rodriguez
and Aruin<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when they used
varying degrees on the outer apparatus and varying mat heights on the non-paretic-side leg
to increase weight-bearing on the paretic side, there was a symmetrical improvement in the
standing position. In particular, the use of a 5-degree outer apparatus and a 9 &#x000d7; 12-mm mat
derived the greatest improvement in the symmetry of the position.</p><p>The benefits of sit-to-stand training that features greater loading on the affected limb
may include increased muscle strength in the affected limb&#x02014;something that is made possible
by maximizing joint compression and augmenting the sensory awareness of the limb. Increased
muscle strength and confidence-placing weight through the affected limb may reduce fall risk
during sit-to-stand activities. Greater use of the affected limb through the use of CIM
strategies may provide a functional training method for muscle strength and joint position
sense, and may reverse the effect of learned non-use<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In hemiplegic patients, due to the reduction of feedback through the soles of the foot,
foot pressure transfer through the lateral mid-foot to the fore foot and toe area has been
reported<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is caused by reduced
weight-bearing on the paretic side, inadequate mobilization of the paretic leg upon
balancing, and imbalance of the foot and ankle muscles. These findings were relatively less
prevalent among stroke patients than the normal group in the pressure and the contact area
of the hind foot<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study,
in the STP group, the maximum pressure of the hind foot increased the contact area of the
rear foot, as it continuously provided pressure on the ankle and the paretic-side leg during
repetitive sit-to-stand training. Thus, it increased body cognition and weight-bearing, and
was thought to have activated the extension muscle on the paretic side. Moreover, the
increase in the surface area of the hind foot contact area supports the surface and
increases the weight-bearing ability on the paretic side. This intervention can be
especially useful for individuals with ankle range-of-motion limitations who could
experience difficulties in positioning their paretic foot backward<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Based on the results of previous studies and those of this study on measured posture
symmetry and balance, repetitive sit-to-stand training that positions the non-paretic leg
upward can be considered a significant form of training that helps improve symmetric posture
adjustment and balance in hemiplegic patients following a stroke. One should bear in mind,
however, that as this study did target only partially hemiplegic patients, its results have
limited generalizability with regard to all hemiplegic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name><name><surname>Bohannon</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Short-term recovery of limb muscle strength after acute
