Genomic DNA copy number profiles were generated for a subgroup of 20 patients before and after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 108 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 118 for toxicity. The objective response rate determined by clinical palpation was 58.9&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=45.0&#x02013;71.9) in the anastrozole arm and 53.8&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=39.5&#x02013;67.8) in the fulvestrant arm. The breast-conserving surgery rate was 58.9&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=45.0&#x02013;71.9) in the anastrozole arm and 50.0&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=35.8&#x02013;64.2) in the fulvestrant arm. Pathological responses &#x0003e;50&#x00025; occurred in 24 patients (42.9&#x00025;) in the anastrozole arm and 13 (25.0&#x00025;) in the fulvestrant arm. The Ki-67 score fell after treatment but there was no significant difference between the reduction in the two arms (anastrozole 16.7&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=13.3&#x02013;21.0) before, 3.2&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=1.9&#x02013;5.5) after, <italic>n</italic>=43; fulvestrant 17.1&#x00025; (95&#x00025;CI=13.1&#x02013;22.5) before, 3.2&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=1.8&#x02013;5.7) after, <italic>n</italic>=38) or between the reduction in Ki-67 in clinical responders and non-responders.

Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, where drug treatment is given before surgery, is commonly given to elderly patients with large operable or locally advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer because it has a favourable toxicity profile and permits breast-conserving surgery in 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of patients who would otherwise have required mastectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Semiglazov <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathew <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Debled <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). In this setting, treatment with aromatase inhibitors is considered as a standard in post-menopausal patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eiermann <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Fulvestrant is an oestrogen receptor downregulator with a different mechanism of action. Several trials have assessed fulvestrant in women with metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), but in the neoadjuvant setting, there are only a few small studies comparing 500&#x02009;mg fulvestrant to an aromatase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Massarweh <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Resistance to hormonal therapy can arise through multiple mechanisms (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Coombes, 2002</xref>). Mutation of the oestrogen receptor can confer estradiol-independent activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weis <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>) and has been identified in metastatic breast cancers treated with hormonal therapy (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Segal and Dowsett, 2014</xref>). Activation of growth factor signalling pathways, leading to phosphorylation of ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> on serines 118 and 167 in the ligand-independent transactivation domain, activates ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in the absence of estradiol (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Coombes, 2002</xref>). Increased expression of coactivators, in particular amplification of the <italic>NCOA3</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> genes, and decreased expression of corepressors, are additional mechanisms of resistance to hormonal therapy (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Coombes, 2002</xref>). Finally, conversion to a progenitor or stem-like state in which <italic>ESR1</italic> is not required for growth, for example, through expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalyuga <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) or <italic>SOX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Piva <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>), confers oestrogen independence. Given the wide range of mechanisms, it is possible that resistance to fulvestrant and aromatase inhibitors could arise through different mechanisms. An important difference between the drugs is that aromatase inhibitors deprive the cell of oestrogen but do not induce degradation of the receptor, whereas fulvestrant induces ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> degradation. An increase in ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> level, for example, by amplification of the gene, might offset a reduced availability of ligand, leading to resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Resistance to fulvestrant seems unlikely to arise through this mechanism. Instead, mutations interfering with ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> degradation or activating the pathway downstream of the receptor might be favoured with fulvestrant. Endocrine therapy typically causes tumours to regress over a period of several months, during which time clonal selection may gradually occur. Unlike chemotherapy, hormonal therapy is not clastogenic or mutagenic, so genetic changes arising during treatment are unlikely to be secondary events provoked by iatrogenic DNA damage. Hence, hormonal therapy given in a neoadjuvant trial provides an ideal opportunity to study resistance to endocrine therapy arising <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Given the lack of clinical data on fulvestrant in patients with large operable or locally advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, and the potential to identify differences in the mechanism of resistance using the neoadjuvant model, we decided to perform a multicentre randomised phase II clinical trial of anastrozole and fulvestrant. This manuscript reports both the clinical findings of this trial and the genomic changes arising during endocrine therapy in the subgroup of patients for whom the tumour cell content was at least 50&#x00025; in the samples taken before and after treatment.</p><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Protocol approval</title><p>The study was approved by the South-West France and Overseas Departments, Committee for Protection of Research Subjects (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes, Sud-Ouest et Outre-Mer III, 2007/57) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, EU clinical trials directives (2001/20/CE) and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The clinicaltrials.gov registry number is NCT0087858. Patients gave signed informed consent to participate in the study and to allow the use of their tumour samples for research including genomic analysis. Samples from the trial were stored in the Bergonie Institute Tumour Bank in compliance with French laws on tumour banks (authorisation no. AC-2008&#x02013;812). The translational study was approved by the French authorities (authorisation no. M70674&#x02013;4201). The funders had no role in the study design, data analysis or manuscript drafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a non-comparative multicentre randomised phase II study in which patients from three French centres were randomly assigned in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to receive either 1&#x02009;mg per day anastrozole administered orally for 6 months (control arm) or 500&#x02009;mg of fulvestrant administered as an intramuscular infusion every 4 weeks for 6 months with a loading dose in the first month (experimental arm). Anastrozole (ARIMIDEX, Astra Zeneca, London, UK) was provided as 1&#x02009;mg film-coated tablets. Fulvestrant (FASLODEX, Astra Zeneca) was provided as a 250&#x02009;mg/5&#x02009;ml solution. Before starting treatment, three trucut biopsies were taken for research purposes; two were frozen and one was fixed in Molecular Fixative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hostein <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Follow-up was carried out at 2, 4 and 6 months to assess the clinical response and tolerance. Drug treatment was continued until the day before surgery. Surgery at 6 months was proposed to all patients. The decision for breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy at the end of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment was assessed by a multidisciplinary board comprising a medical oncologist, a surgeon and a radiation oncologist. After 6 months of treatment, residual tumour was resected surgically, and frozen and formalin-fixed samples were again taken for research purposes. Adjuvant treatments were decided according to each centre's policy.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><p>Patients were eligible if they met the following criteria: post-menopausal woman; histologically confirmed non-metastatic T2-T3-T4 invasive breast cancer; grade I or II; oestrogen and/or progesterone-receptor-positive; clinically measurable disease at baseline; not eligible for breast-conserving surgery at baseline; HER2 positive or negative. Women with grade III tumours were eligible only if they were aged 65 years or over. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer, N2 disease, a history of cancer within the past 5 years, or a contra-indication to hormonal therapy were not eligible.</p></sec><sec><title>End points</title><p>The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 months determined by clinical palpation, defined as the rate of complete and partial responses (CR&#x0002b;PR) according to RECIST Criteria (Version 1.0). The same doctor was responsible for clinical assessment initially and at 6 months. Secondary end points included: ORR determined by ultrasound and mammography at 6 months based on RECIST Criteria; rate of breast-conserving surgery at 6 months; pathological response using the Sataloff classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sataloff <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>); and safety profile examination using common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE, version 3.0, DCTD, NCI, NIH; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctep.cancer.gov">http://ctep.cancer.gov</ext-link>). Exploratory analyses were carried out for the preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI score; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellis <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) and changes in the fraction of tumour nuclei expressing Ki-67. Follow-up was planned for 5 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The sample size for this non-comparative phase II trial was based on the primary end point, ORR. According to the Fleming one-step method, for a null hypothesis of 40&#x00025; ORR and an alternative hypothesis of 60&#x00025; ORR, 52 assessable patients needed to be treated in each treatment arm (104 in total), with a one-sided alpha of 5&#x00025; and a power of 90&#x00025;. The experimental arm was deemed interesting for further research if at least 27 clinical responses out of 52 treated eligible patients were observed. This decision rule corresponded to rejecting the null hypothesis. After adjusting the sample size by 15&#x00025; to allow for non-evaluable patients, 120 patients were required. The randomisation was stratified by centre. Two analysis populations were considered: (i) the safety population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the allocated study medication (a dose of anastrozole or an injection of fulvestrant), and (ii) the efficacy population (primary endpoint), defined as all eligible (no major eligibility deviations) and evaluable patients who started the allocated treatment and who were evaluated at 6 months. Patients discontinuing treatment due to progression or death from any cause were considered as treatment failures. Patients who missed the evaluation at 6 months due to treatment discontinuation for toxicity, refusal to participate or lost to follow-up were excluded from the efficacy population.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathological assessment</title><p>Ki-67 was scored centrally by a pathologist (GMG) in a blinded manner according to the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic> (2011)</xref> by counting at least 1000 tumour nuclei per sample after staining with mib1 antibody. Ki-67 was scored before treatment on the core biopsy and after treatment on the surgical resection specimen. Tumours were defined as hormone-receptor positive or negative by local pathologists with a 10&#x00025; cutoff for scoring as positive. To evaluate the pathological response, the Sataloff classification was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sataloff <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). The PEPI score was calculated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellis <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic study</title><p>Only samples with at least 50&#x00025; tumour cells after treatment were selected for the genomic substudy (the tumour cell content was frequently below this cutoff after treatment). DNA was purified from frozen samples and analysed on a GAIIx DNA sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Low-depth whole-genome sequencing data were converted to DNA copy number plots with the CNAnorm package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gusnanto <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) in R statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">R Core Team, 2013</xref>) as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wood <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).

Two patients withdrew their consent. Ten patients were not assessable for the efficacy analysis: four in the standard arm and six in the experimental arm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for details). A total of 118 patients and 108 patients were assessable for the safety and efficacy analyses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Patient and tumour characteristics are summarised in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms, but there were more T2 N0 Grade 1 tumours in the anastrozole arm and more lobular carcinomas in the fulvestrant arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical response and surgery</title><p>Of the 56 patients eligible and evaluable for efficacy in the anastrozole arm, 7 achieved a CR and 26 a PR, giving an ORR of 58.9&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=45.0&#x02013;71.9). Of the 52 patients eligible and evaluable for efficacy in the fulvestrant arm, 6 achieved a CR and 22 achieved a PR, giving an ORR of 53.8&#x00025; (95&#x00025; CI=39.5&#x02013;67.8; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Analysis including all eligible patients gave very similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Eight tumours progressed under therapy: six in the fulvestrant arm and two in the anastrozole arm. Five patients were HER2-positive at inclusion, of whom one progressed and four had stable disease. In the anastrozole arm, 33 patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (58.9&#x00025;, 95&#x00025; CI=45.0&#x02013;71.9).

The main criterion for including patients in the translational study was the availability of material, in particular, the presence of at least 50&#x00025; tumour cells in the post-treatment sample. In five cases, two independent biopsies were tested before treatment and in four cases two different parts of the surgical specimen were tested after treatment. In the remaining cases, single samples were tested before and after treatment. Next-generation sequencing was performed at low depth and reads were counted in moving windows to estimate DNA copy number. Hierarchical clustering was used to detect broad patterns in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; the Treeview data files are provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> to permit examination of the heatmap at high resolution). As expected for ER&#x0002b; breast cancer, many tumours had minimally rearranged &#x02018;simplex' copy number profiles with gains of 1q/16p and loss of 16q. Apart from H06 and H13, all samples from the same tumour clustered together. Overall, the clustering shows that the differences between tumours were in general much greater than the differences before and after treatment of the same tumour.</p></sec><sec><title>Focal differences in tumour profiles before and after treatment</title><p>Eight tumours contained classic amplicons previously reported in ER&#x0002b; breast tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Most amplicons were present before and after treatment but three tumours (H09, H14 and H15) showed focal changes in the copy number profile after treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the copy number profiles for tumour H09. Potential driver genes in six amplicons are highlighted with arrows. The ratio of copy number before and after treatment for these genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (the blue dots are for H09, the other tumours are given black dots). The ratios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> confirm the impression from the profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> that new amplicons containing <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic> appeared after treatment. FISH was used to confirm the presence of the <italic>ESR1</italic> amplicon. The gene was highly amplified after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, green dots), but, unexpectedly, it was also amplified before treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The green dots are more diffuse before treatment because an organic fixative was used instead of formaldehyde, which precludes precise quantification of the difference. There was no increase in ER staining by IHC after treatment in H09, perhaps because the signal was already so strong (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Progesterone receptor was undetectable by IHC in H09 both before and after treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), as commonly occurs in luminal B tumours. Tumour H14 showed focal changes after treatment, including a copy number increase after treatment on chr14q in a region containing the <italic>FOXA1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Both H09 and H14 were in the anastrozole arm. In summary, copy number profiles showed the presence of focal differences in three tumours after treatment, including two showing changes affecting genes implicated in oestrogenic signalling (<italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>FOXA1</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Large-scale differences in tumour profiles before and after treatment</title><p>We corrected for differences in normal tissue contamination then calculated a <italic>Z</italic> score for the presence of large-scale differences between samples, as described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods file</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>. Seven pairs of tumours stood out as being significantly different (H08, H09, H10, H13, H14, H15 and H19; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Intriguingly, the commonest change after treatment was not the appearance of new changes but the disappearance of old ones. Specifically, in four tumours the profile became simpler through the disappearance of gains and losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms. We can exclude dilution of the signal by normal tissue because the 1q gain was still clearly visible in all the affected tumours. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows tumour H13 in which a gain of chr7 and losses of chr4, 6, 11, 12, 17 and 18 disappeared, leaving only the changes on chr1 and 16. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows tumour H08 in which changes on chr2, 7 and 15 became more normal; the overall profile shows many other rearrangements that persisted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows tumour H10 in which changes on chr3, 13 and 18 disappeared, loss of chr10 and 15 appeared, whereas changes on chr1, 7, 11, 16 and 22 remained. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows tumour H19 in which changes on chr3 and 10 disappeared, 20q was gained and changes on many other chromosomes remained. The differences after treatment of tumour H06 did not reach significance in our <italic>Z</italic> test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), probably because of the low tumour cell content after treatment, but if chr1 is used as the reference chromosome in the linear model, chr3, 7, 8, 10, 13 and 18 appear to have reverted to a more normal profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Three of the tumours that became simpler showed stable disease and two a PR; three were in the fulvestrant arm and two were in the anastrozole arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). In summary, genomic profiles showed differences after treatment in one-third of cases, and the commonest change was a simplification of the profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The main conclusion from this study is that anastrozole and fulvestrant are effective neoadjuvant treatments for post-menopausal patients with large operable or locally advanced ER&#x0002b; breast cancers. Both drugs made breast-conserving surgery a viable option for some women who were not eligible for it initially. The main conclusion from the genomic study is that breast tumours undergoing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy show clonal variation that could be explained by clonal selection.</p><p>The primary clinical end point, the ORR, was 58.9&#x00025; in the anastrozole arm and 53.8&#x00025; in the fulvestrant arm. These figures are consistent with rates around 50&#x00025; observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eiermann <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathew <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The percentage of women receiving breast-conserving surgery (58.9&#x00025; for anastrozole and 50&#x00025; for fulvestrant) was also similar to that previously reported after letrozole, anastrozole or tamoxifen (40 and 50&#x00025;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eiermann <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In conclusion, our results are at least as good as those with 3&#x02013;4 months of aromatase inhibitors and therefore are consistent with longer therapy (e.g., 6 months) being better than shorter.</p><p>We chose to compare anastrozole with fulvestrant because the literature does not provide clear guidance on their use in the neoadjuvant setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howell <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Massarweh <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuter <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ciruelos <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Comparative studies have demonstrated that both treatments are effective in the metastatic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mauriac <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Aside from the question of efficacy, parenteral administration of fulvestrant has potential clinical advantages in patients with swallowing problems or neurological problems, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our decision to treat for 6 months was based on our previous study in elderly or frail women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mauriac <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). It is longer than was initially recommended, but other groups have now reported favourable outcomes after neoadjuvant endocrine treatment for up to 7.5 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dixon <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carpenter <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The trend towards prolonging adjuvant hormonal therapy out to 10 years means there is considerable interest in using neoadjuvant therapy to provide early evidence of drug efficacy. Reassessment of drug efficacy after 6 months of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy provides reassurance that a therapeutic opportunity is not being lost and could potentially save many lives. In our study, more tumours had a pathological response over 50&#x00025; in the anastrozole arm (43&#x00025;) than in the fulvestrant arm (25&#x00025;) but the size of the study and the slight imbalance between the arms in tumour size, node status and grade at enrolment mean differences of this size could easily arise by chance. Moreover, the Sataloff grading system was not originally designed to assess pathological response to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and may not be a good surrogate marker for long-term survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chia <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). In contrast, changes in Ki67 expression have been widely studied to evaluate the response to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Censi <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonat and Arnold, 2011</xref>). Most tumours in both arms of our study showed a fall in Ki-67 after therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and the magnitude of the changes was similar to that associated with favourable outcomes in previous studies. The similarity of the PEPI scores in the two arms likewise suggests that patients in the two treatment arms may have similar long-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowsett <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellis <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, this requires confirmation, especially in the light of recent data from the FIRST trial, indicating a PFS and OS advantage for fulvestrant in the metastatic setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Currently, the risk of relapse based on Ki-67 expression or the PEPI score strongly influences the decision whether to start adjuvant chemotherapy, but they will become less important if the ASTER study provides clear-cut evidence that patients over 70 years with high-grade tumours benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy.</p><p>The most intriguing result from the genomic study was the simplification of copy number profiles after treatment. It is possible that these changes were simply a consequence of sampling from different sites within a clonally heterogeneous tumour. To rule this out would require high-depth analysis of samples taken from multiple sites within the surgical specimen. The alternative, and much more interesting, possibility is that the differences reflect clonal selection by the treatment. As it is not possible for a tumour to correct large-scale rearrangements, the most plausible explanation under the clonal-selection hypothesis is that rearranged clones were eliminated by the treatment, leading to expansion of an ancestral clone with a related, but simpler, profile. Residual tumour after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy has previously been noted to show histological evidence of increased differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Samarnthai <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Transformation is accompanied by subtle changes in the spectrum of target genes regulated by ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, leading to a shift from transcription of tumour-suppressive, differentiation-linked genes towards the expression of oncogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ross-Innes <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). A possible interpretation of our results is that cells cope with a reduction in ER-dependent survival signals by reducing the transcriptional stress associated with chromosomal imbalances. Clones emerging from such a selection would be more normal: better able to enter G<sub>0</sub>, better able to differentiate and more responsive to oestrogen. This builds on so-called &#x02018;intrinsic tumour suppression', a concept that has been extensively characterised in model systems, in particular in studies on the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lowe <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). This model is also compatible with the increase in copy number of ESR1 in H09, which could be viewed as an adaptive response to offset the reduced availability of oestrogen in anastrozole-treated cells. That said, the clinical data point rather to a tumour that is indifferent to oestrogen: there was no change in tumour size, grade or Ki-67, and PR started at zero and stayed there. The numbers are too small to meaningfully correlate the genomic changes we observed with response to therapy, but they provide no immediate support for the idea that genomic simplification of heterogeneous tumours is a major resistance mechanism. In contrast with the variability of chromosomal arm copy numbers, the classic amplicons known to harbour driver oncogenes in breast cancer were almost invariably present both before and after treatment, consistent with the widely accepted view that breast tumours are addicted to the oncogenes on these amplicons. Amplification of <italic>ESR1</italic> has a chequered history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holst <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Given the importance of oestrogen in the biology of breast cancer cells, <italic>ESR1</italic> is an obvious candidate for amplification, but decades of research point instead to lineage choice as the main factor leading to ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression in breast cancer. Our FISH results indicate that the appearance of the <italic>ESR1</italic> amplicon in the copy number profile after treatment reflects clonal variation rather than <italic>de novo</italic> amplification. This clonal variation could be due to clonal selection by the treatment or sampling from different regions within a heterogeneous tumour (a &#x02018;needle placement artefact'), but whatever the mechanism, we can exclude <italic>ESR1</italic> amplification as the initiating oncogenic event responsible for the ER<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> positivity of this tumour.</p><p>In conclusion, the good response rates and low toxicity observed in this study show that both anastrozole and fulvestrant are effective and well-tolerated neoadjuvant hormonal treatments for post-menopausal women with large operable or locally advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The results of the genomic study point to the re-emergence of tumour clones with less rearranged genomes as a potential new mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy, but, given the potential for sampling effects, larger studies testing multiple biopsies from each tumour will be required to clarify whether this a reproducible, clinically important phenomenon.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jone Iriondo and Pippa McKelvie-Sebileau of the Institut Bergoni&#x000e9; for editorial assistance.
