We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model time to severe bacterial infection, which was defined as a composite endpoint of bacterial pneumonia (confirmed by the endpoint review committee), pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, or any bacterial infectious disorder of grade 4 severity, that required unscheduled hospital admissions, or caused death.

The data cutoff for follow-up was May 26, 2015. Of 4685 HIV-positive people enrolled, 120 had severe bacterial infections (immediate-initiation group n=34, deferred-initiation group n=86; median 2&#x000b7;8 years of follow-up). Immediate ART was associated with a reduced risk of severe bacterial infection compared with deferred ART (hazard ratio [HR] 0&#x000b7;39, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;26&#x02013;0&#x000b7;57, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). In the immediate-initiation group, average neutrophil count over follow-up was 321 cells per &#x003bc;L higher, and average CD4 cell count 194 cells per &#x003bc;L higher than the deferred-initiation group (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). In univariable analysis, higher time-updated CD4 cell count (0&#x000b7;78, 0&#x000b7;71&#x02013;0&#x000b7;85, p=0&#x000b7;0001) was associated with reduced risk of severe bacterial infection. Time-updated neutrophil count was not associated with severe bacterial infection. After adjustment for time-updated factors in multivariable analysis, particularly the CD4 cell count, the HR for immediate-initiation group moved closer to 1 (HR 0&#x000b7;84, 0&#x000b7;50&#x02013;1&#x000b7;41, p=0&#x000b7;52). These results were consistent when subgroups of the severe bacterial infection composite were analysed separately.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Immediate ART reduces the risk of several severe bacterial infections in HIV-positive people with high CD4 cell count.

Neutrophils play a key part in the innate immune response to bacterial infection.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Known as the hallmark of inflammation, neutrophils are the first of the white blood cells to migrate towards a site of bacterial infection to begin killing the invading microbes.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Neutrophils recruit and activate monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and are also responsible for confining the pathogen to the local site, thus preventing systemic spread of bacterial disease.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We therefore hypothesised that ART increases the number of neutrophils, which might mediate the association between ART and reduced risk of severe bacterial infection.

The analysis of the effect of treatment group on incidence of severe bacterial infection as a secondary outcome was preplanned, but the choice of the composite definition of severe bacterial infection and the analysis of the extent to which the effect might be mediated by changes in biomarkers was not preplanned.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The START study was a multicontinental, randomised trial designed to investigate the risks and benefits of immediate initiation of ART in asymptomatic HIV-positive people. Participants with CD4 cell counts above 500 cells per &#x003bc;L were randomly assigned either to start ART immediately or to defer ART until their CD4 cell counts dropped to 350 cells per &#x003bc;L, or until the development of an AIDS-defining event or another condition (eg, pregnancy) that required treatment with ART. Enrolment began on April 15, 2009, and ended on Dec 23, 2013. 4685 HIV-positive people were enrolled (immediate-initiation group, n=2326; deferred-initiation group, n=2359) at 215 clinical sites caring for people living with HIV in 35 countries (the full list of countries has been reported previously<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>).

A severe bacterial infection consisted of any of bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (as reviewed by the INSIGHT endpoint review committee and confirmed or designated as probable), or any bacterial infectious disorder (as reported previously<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>) that met at least one of the three criteria: grade 4 severity, requiring unscheduled hospital admission, or causing death. Follow-up was censored at the time of the severe bacterial infection event, the date of the last study visit, the date of death, or the withdrawal date for participants who withdrew from the study (censoring date for the analysis). The trial protocol has been published previously.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We calculated summary statistics of baseline and time-updated characteristics for all participants. We calculated time-updated summary statistics by taking the mean value of the characteristic for each person over the observed follow-up period (until the censoring date) and summarising the mean of all individuals.</p><p>We plotted the change in neutrophil count, total lymphocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, albumin concentration, and CD4 cell count over time at annual timepoints, on the basis of values taken at annual visits. We fitted a longitudinal mixed model with PROC MIXED in SAS (version 9.4) to assess the difference in the mean change in laboratory markers from study entry between the treatment groups. We fitted a separate mixed model for each of the laboratory markers with change since study entry as the dependent variable. We adjusted models for the baseline value of the laboratory marker and the visit number. A variance components covariance structure was specified to model the potential correlation between repeated laboratory measures collected at different visits for the same person.</p><p>We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model the time to severe bacterial infection. We estimated univariable and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs to assess the association between severe bacterial infection and several covariates.</p><p>Baseline categorical covariates investigated include treatment group (immediate-initiation, deferred-initiation), sex, mode of HIV acquisition (men who have sex with men; sex with person of the opposite sex; injection drug use, blood products, other, or unknown) and race or ethnicity (Asian, black, white, Latino or Hispanic, other). Time-updated categorical covariates investigated include body-mass index (BMI; &#x0003c;18&#x000b7;5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 18&#x000b7;5&#x02013;24&#x000b7;9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 25&#x000b7;0&#x02013;34&#x000b7;9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, &#x02265;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and smoking status. Baseline continuous covariates investigated were age and time since HIV diagnosis. Time-updated continuous covariates investigated include CD4 cell count, HIV RNA viral load (log<sub>10</sub>), neutrophil count, total lymphocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and albumin concentration. We stratified all models by a six-category variable describing the geographic region of residence (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Israel, North America, South America and Mexico). We assessed whether the effect of treatment group was consistent across several predefined subgroups that were defined according to characteristics at study entry, by including terms for interactions between treatment and subgroup variables in expanded Cox models. We also assessed the proportional hazards assumption for the treatment effect by fitting the interaction with log time.</p><p>We did several additional analyses to separately analyse some components of the severe bacterial infection endpoint where numbers were sufficient. Analyses were done with SAS software (version 9.4). All tests of significance were two-sided and used p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05 as the threshold of statistical significance.

During follow-up, the change in biomarker values since study entry was significantly higher in the immediate-initiation group than in the deferred-initiation group, for all biomarkers investigated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In univariable analysis, immediate initiation of ART was associated with a reduced risk of severe bacterial infection (HR 0&#x000b7;39, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;26&#x02013;0&#x000b7;57, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001; no evidence of lack of proportionality in hazards, p=0&#x000b7;97; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). 43 severe bacterial infection events occurred before ART initiation (41 of which occurred in the deferred-initiation group) in 5195 person-years at risk (incidence of 0&#x000b7;79 per 100 person-years of follow-up) and 77 occurred after ART initiation (45 of which occurred in the deferred-initiation group) in 8659 person-years at risk (incidence of 0&#x000b7;89 per 100 person-years of follow-up).</p><p>Of 120 people who developed a severe bacterial infection, 50 had a bacterial infectious disorder (immediate-initiation group n=14, deferred-initiation group n=36), 48 developed bacterial pneumonia (immediate-initiation group n=14, deferred-initiation group n=34), and 26 developed tuberculosis (immediate-initiation group n=6, deferred-initiation group n=20; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). These components of severe bacterial infection do not total 120 because some people had more than one condition.</p><p>Univariable and multivariable HRs for a selection of factors that were included in the Cox model are presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>. In multivariable analysis (after adjustment for all covariates listed in the methods including time-updated variables), the HR (immediate-initiation <italic>vs</italic> deferred-initiation) was no longer significantly below 1 (multivariable HR 0&#x000b7;84, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;50&#x02013;1&#x000b7;41, p=0&#x000b7;52; univariable 0&#x000b7;39; 0&#x000b7;26&#x02013;0&#x000b7;57, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p><p>In multivariable analysis, a BMI above 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with an increased risk of severe bacterial infection when compared with a reference group of a BMI between 18&#x000b7;5 and 24&#x000b7;9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR 2&#x000b7;17, 95% CI 1&#x000b7;19&#x02013;3&#x000b7;95, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Higher time-updated CD4 cell count was associated with a reduced risk of severe bacterial infection (0&#x000b7;78, 0&#x000b7;71&#x02013;0&#x000b7;85, p=0&#x000b7;0001). The time-updated CD4 cell count remained strongly associated with a reduced risk of severe bacterial infection (0&#x000b7;84, 0&#x000b7;76&#x02013;0&#x000b7;93, p=0&#x000b7;0006) when time-updated values were delayed by 6 months. Adjustment for time-updated CD4 cell count in the multivariable model was responsible for the attenuation of the HR for treatment group. Time-updated neutrophil count was not associated with risk of severe bacterial infection (HR [multivariable model] 1&#x000b7;00, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;88&#x02013;1&#x000b7;14, p=0&#x000b7;98); which was also the case when neutrophil count was fitted as a categorical variable. Other factors that were included in the multivariable model, but were not associated with severe bacterial infection, were age (p=0&#x000b7;44), sex (p=0&#x000b7;07; trend towards females having lower risk), race/ethnicity (p=0&#x000b7;22), time-updated smoking status (p=0&#x000b7;09; trend towards smokers having higher risk), mode of HIV infection (p=0&#x000b7;88), time since HIV diagnosis (p=0&#x000b7;89), hepatitis B (p=0&#x000b7;67) and hepatitis C status (p=0&#x000b7;43), time-updated HIV RNA viral load (p=0&#x000b7;07; trend towards higher levels being associated with higher risk), time-updated total lymphocyte count (p=0&#x000b7;10), time-updated haemoglobin concentration (p=0&#x000b7;20), time-updated platelet count (p=0&#x000b7;70), and time-updated albumin concentration (p=0&#x000b7;11). The tests for interaction between the treatment group and several predefined subgroups that were determined by characteristics upon study entry were non-significant.</p><p>Given that the beneficial effect of immediate ART on risk of severe bacterial infection seems to be partly mediated by induced rises in CD4 cell count, we considered whether the effect would be lower in people with baseline CD4 cell counts above the median of 651 cells per &#x003bc;L than people with baseline CD4 cell counts below the median, but the univariable effect of immediate ART was similar to the overall effect (HR 0&#x000b7;43; 95% CI 0&#x000b7;24&#x02013;0&#x000b7;80, p=0&#x000b7;007).</p><p>We did four sensitivity analyses to explore how sensitive the results of our study were to variations in the definition of severe bacterial infection. In one analysis, we excluded tuberculosis from the definition of severe bacterial infection (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). In a second analysis, additionally, all syphilis events were ignored and follow-up for people who experienced a syphilis event was censored at the last visit date, death, or withdrawal (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). Two further sensitivity analyses were done in which bacterial pneumonia and bacterial infectious disorder were treated as separate endpoints. Results of all these analyses are broadly similar to the primary analysis whereby adjustment for time-updated CD4 cell count reduces the HR for treatment group, and high CD4 cell count predicted these endpoints. High BMI was more strongly associated with excess risk of bacterial pneumonia than with bacterial infectious disorders (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Discussion</title><p>Immediate ART initiation reduced the risk of severe bacterial infections in asymptomatic HIV-positive people with high CD4 cell counts by 61%. The benefit of immediate ART was attenuated in statistical models after adjustment for time-updated CD4 cell count, suggesting that the effect of immediate ART is partly mediated by the increase in CD4 cell count in the immediate ART group and hence this increase in itself or some linked immunological pathway is an important mechanism by which ART reduces risk of severe bacterial infections. By contrast, we found no evidence that the effect was mediated by the increases seen in neutrophil count with early ART, as we initially hypothesised.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those from previous studies, which show the efficacy of early ART in reducing the risk of bacterial diseases.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In a randomised controlled trial that compared immediate initiation of ART with deferred ART (according to the most recent WHO criteria, which changed during the course of the study) in HIV-positive people with CD4 cell count greater than 200 cells per &#x003bc;L in C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire, early ART was associated with a 77% reduced risk of invasive bacterial disease.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Another randomised controlled trial, done in Haiti in 2010, compared early ART (initiation of ART within 2 weeks of enrolment into the study) in people with CD4 counts greater than 200 cells per &#x003bc;L and less than 350 cells per &#x003bc;L, with no history of an AIDS-defining illness. The study used the 2010 WHO criteria for starting treatment, which involved initiation of ART at a CD4 count less than 200 cells per &#x003bc;L or after development of an AIDS-defining event.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Early ART in this study was associated with a 75% reduced risk of death, where ten of 29 deaths that occurred during the study were caused by a bacterial infection.

In our study, we investigated the effect of adjusting our model for time-updated diabetes to establish whether BMI was acting as a proxy for excess risk of diabetes. We found that diabetes did not attenuate the HR for BMI.</p><p>The relationship between BMI and risk of bacterial pneumonia was investigated in a 2013 meta-analysis,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> which concluded that the relationship between BMI and pneumonia in the 25 studies included in the meta-analysis was significantly heterogeneous (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Results of the meta-analysis showed a J-shaped relationship between BMI and community-acquired pneumonia, in which people who were underweight had an 80% increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia, being overweight was found to be protective of community-acquired pneumonia, and people who were obese had a 3% increased, but non-significant, risk of community-acquired pneumonia.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>Our findings provide further evidence of a clinical benefit of early initiation of ART. Biomarkers in untreated HIV infection tend to decline even in people with high CD4 cell counts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Control of viral replication with ART, with consequent benefits on immunological function, at early stages of HIV infection reverses these trends and is important for the prevention of a range of bacterial infections. The benefits of immediate ART were consistent across different subgroups and this beneficial effect of early ART did not differ according to age, sex, race or ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, CD4 cell count, or time since HIV diagnosis. Early ART provides public health benefits by way of a reduced risk of transmission;<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> in this study we show individual-level health benefits in addition to those presented in the START primary publication.

All serious events and deaths were reviewed by an endpoint review committee, who were blind to the treatment group, using pre-established INSIGHT criteria.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Endpoints including death from any cause, grade 4 events, and unscheduled hospital admissions for reasons other than AIDS were collected and categorised according to codes used in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meddra.org" id="interrefs50">Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</ext-link> (version 18.0). Additionally, collation of longitudinal follow-up data from 35 countries with standardised data collection methods provided a large, ethnically, geographically, and socially diverse cohort of HIV-positive people. Furthermore, rich data collection allowed for adjustment of several participant and HIV-related covariates that enabled us to assess potential association of these covariates with severe bacterial infection.</p><p>One limitation of this study is that only the bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis components of our endpoint were reported to and reviewed by the endpoints review committee. Other bacterial infections were identified only if they were classified as grade 4 events and required unscheduled hospital admission or led to death. Extrapolation of our findings to less severe bacterial infections, for which data were absent, should be done with caution. Furthermore, hospital admission might be more likely in some settings than others for a given infection. Indeed, the incidence of severe bacterial infections was notably highest in Australia whereas we might have expected higher rates in Africa, South America, and Asia. Furthermore, our analyses involved few events (n=120), which limits the study power. Additionally, although CD4 cell count and HIV RNA were measured more frequently, all other laboratory markers were measured at randomisation and annually thereafter. Therefore, for severe bacterial infection events that occurred in the first year after randomisation (n=37; eight in immediate ART group and 29 in the deferred ART arm), there would be no follow-up measurement of these laboratory markers. This might have resulted in overestimation of the importance of CD4 cell count in explaining the treatment effect, relative to the other laboratory markers.</p><p>In summary, the results of our study show the protective effect of immediate ART in reducing the risk of a broad spectrum of severe bacterial infections in HIV-positive people. The effect of immediate ART appears to be mediated in part by ART-induced increases in CD4 cell count, but not by the ART-induced increases in neutrophil count.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lundgren</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Babiker</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordin</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Initiation of antiretroviral therapy in early asymptomatic HIV Infection</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>373</volume><year>2015</year><fpage>795</fpage><lpage>807</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26192873</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>British HIV Association</collab></person-group><article-title>British HIV Association guidelines for the treatment of HIV-1-positive adults with antiretroviral therapy</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bhiva.org/documents/Guidelines/Treatment/2015/2015-treatment-guidelines.pdf" id="interrefs70">http://www.bhiva.org/documents/Guidelines/Treatment/2015/2015-treatment-guidelines.pdf</ext-link><year>2015</year><comment>(accessed Nov 3, 2015).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>European AIDS Clinical Society</collab></person-group><article-title>Guidelines version 8.0.
