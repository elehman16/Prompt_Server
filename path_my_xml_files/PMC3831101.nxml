<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> but translating such interventions to effective, routine delivery remains challenging. Early translational diabetes prevention studies conducted in Finland, Germany and the US assessed weight loss as an intermediate health outcome, thus assuming that weight loss, achieved through these interventions delivered to high-risk individuals, would predict reduced T2D incidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> More recently, a translational trial delivered to adults at high risk in a primary care setting, with a 4.2-year median follow-up and T2D incidence as the primary outcome, demonstrated 36.5% relative risk reduction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005) in T2D incidence in the lifestyle intervention group compared to a usual care control group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> This risk reduction is less than the 57% risk reduction achieved in some efficacy trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> The authors of this primary care trial acknowledge the difficulties in translating evidence for effective implementation and suggest that &#x0201c;the feasibility and effectiveness of lifestyle interventions need to be validated within the population in which they are intended to be used.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for preventing T2D in high-risk individuals identified evidence gaps relating to risk identification of those suitable for lifestyle-change programmes and the need for translation of research evidence to UK practice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> A report commissioned by NICE highlighted the increased prevalence of T2D in low socioeconomic status groups and acknowledged that engaging people from these groups in preventive interventions is challenging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>Translational T2D prevention studies have generally used classroom-based behavioural counselling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> and this approach is advocated in the development and implementation of a European Guideline and Training Standard for Diabetes Prevention (IMAGE) guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Similarly, the Good Ageing in Lahti region (GOAL) before-and-after implementation study for T2D prevention used a structured counselling programme that drew on social cognitive and self-regulation theories of behaviour change.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> However, the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and American Diabetes Prevention Programme (DPP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> trials (which provided efficacy evidence for T2D prevention) both included group delivered physical activity (PA) sessions. Experiential learning theory emphasises the central role that a &#x02018;here-and-now&#x02019; concrete experience, along with observation and reflection, plays in promoting subsequent higher order purposeful action.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> In this experiential approach, performing an action in a specific instance and considering its effects is precedent to generalisation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> We therefore developed an alternative approach to intervention delivery that included group delivered PA sessions to provide immediate experience of different exercise activities, facilitate peer interaction and accommodate different learning styles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> We have drawn on experiential learning theory as well as behaviour change theories and techniques in intervention development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18 R19">17&#x02013;19</xref></p><p>We report on the feasibility, acceptability and behavioural and health-related outcomes at a 12&#x02005;month follow-up of a novel community-based intervention called &#x02018;New life, New you&#x02019; (NLNY), directed at adults at risk of T2D.

Inclusion criteria were: age 45&#x02013;65&#x02005;years, living in central Middlesbrough UK, and with elevated risk of T2D. Individualised 10&#x02005;year risk of T2D was determined at baseline using the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC), a prospective risk assessment tool that uses simple, non-invasive measures, including height, weight and waist circumference, as well as questions about family history and lifestyle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> To give an indication of socioeconomic status, we used home post codes to assign the English Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), an ecological, composite measure based on routinely available data in seven categories of deprivation (income, employment, health and disability, education skills and training, barriers to housing and other services, crime and living environment) at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA: a small administrative area with a population of about 1500) level to each participant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> Previous diagnoses of T2D or inability to participate in moderate PA were exclusion criteria. Details of the target population, and recruitment strategies have been reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> Participants completed the standard local authority leisure services questionnaire, which included questions regarding medication, diagnosed medical conditions and any other condition that might prevent people from participating in PA. The leisure services standard protocol for reporting injury or other adverse side effects was used. Following a brief screening (self-report of: age, area of domicile and history of T2D), potential participants were invited to attend an individual assessment that was conducted by one of the NLNY health and fitness trainers in a convenient community location. The consultation incorporated motivational interviewing techniques to promote engagement in the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> After their baseline assessment, those with FINDRISC 11&#x02013;20 who wished to participate were allocated to the intervention programme. Those with FINDRISC&#x0003e;20 were advised to see their general practitioner (GP) and were able to join the programme with their GP's permission (providing there was no diagnosis of T2D). The trainers conducted further assessments at 6 and 12 months in one-to-one consultations.</p><p>To assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, we recorded recruitment and retention through the programme and follow-up. We conducted qualitative interviews with participants at 6 and 12&#x02005;months of postprogramme. The interview topic guide was developed from our previous research in this area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Interviewees were purposively selected for success in PA increase at 6 or 12&#x02005;months of follow-up. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. As part of the qualitative evaluation, we sought to elicit participants&#x02019; views on acceptability of the intervention and research procedures.

Participant preferences, for example for a single-sex activity group or for particular PAs, were accommodated where possible. Each NLNY session comprised a supervised PA or, on two or three occasions within each 10-week programme, a cookery session, followed by a reflective discussion that covered PA, nutrition, weight management and strategies for behaviour change. Monthly NLNY newsletters with information, advice and recipes were available to participants, mostly online. PAs centred on the interests of each participant group, with flexibility to repeat popular activities. Sessions were leisure centre based, but also included trainer-led walks. The supported cookery sessions were designed to encourage healthy eating and to demonstrate the ease with which healthy food could be prepared. Nutritional information incorporated the importance of reading food labels with advice based on the Eat-well plate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> including reduction in fat and increase in fibre intake, in line with the DPS protocol and NICE guidance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Weight reduction was advised for those overweight, who were the majority. The trainers introduced behaviour change strategies (including goal setting, action planning, barrier identification, social support, self-monitoring, advance planning for relapse prevention and contingent rewards), as the need arose, with regular repetition during the supported sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>At the end of the 10-week programme, participants who had completed &#x02265;80% attendance received an &#x02018;access to leisure&#x02019; card that enabled free leisure service use for 12&#x02005;months. After the programme, ongoing support with regular mobile phone text message and email reminders, &#x02018;drop-in&#x02019; activity sessions and encouragement to join in local events such as organised walks and runs continued up to the assessment at 12&#x02005;months of follow-up.

High retention and further recruitment by word-of-mouth recommendation, along with positive comments in the qualitative interviews, suggest high levels of acceptability of the intervention. Positive outcomes at 12&#x02005;months, including increased PA, weight loss, reduction in waist circumference and FINDRISC, and increase in the consumption of fruit and vegetables, are encouraging indications of the likely effectiveness of the intervention. Intervention delivery, by fitness trainers in leisure and community settings incorporating robust outcome data collection for monitoring purposes, provides a viable model for service provision in the UK.</p><p>Almost all NLNY participants were overweight or obese at baseline, with elevated risk of developing T2D. Just over half (53%) of the participants were living in areas located in the lowest, and 65% in the lowest two, quintiles of deprivation based on 2010 IMD ranks for all England. Recruitment and retention of people from this population in a preventive intervention is challenging and the retention rate of 61% at 12&#x02005;months, with many participants recruited by word of mouth, demonstrates intervention acceptability. Mean beneficial change was demonstrated in measures of PA and in objective measures of weight and waist circumference, resulting in reduction in FINDRISC for many participants. The main areas of PA increase were gym-based and sports activities (including badminton) as well as popular &#x02018;aqua-fit&#x02019; sessions (which were provided separately for men and women). Walking, hobbies and swimming activities were fairly consistent across the study time period, which suggests that the new activities were additions rather than replacements.</p><p>The dietary assessment was limited by resources and a perceived need to minimise respondent burden. Of interest was the increase in reported portions of fruit and vegetables consumed per day. There were only modest beneficial changes in other food groups. Refinement of dietary advice to promote wholemeal (rather than brown) bread and skimmed (rather than semiskimmed) milk should be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>Recruitment and retention</title><p>Intervention development was strengthened by drawing on social marketing (profiling a target population, pretesting intervention design through stakeholder consultations and positioning in community settings) and modelling (using behavioural and intermediate health outcomes) strategies to ensure an appropriate, engaging and pragmatic intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> The promotional campaign, led by the fitness trainers, was time consuming and &#x02018;signposting&#x02019; from the National Health Services (NHS) Health Checks programme within primary care might be a more efficient long-term option for recruitment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> However, we cannot be sure whether this different recruitment strategy would affect retention and outcomes.</p><p>More women than men were recruited, in common with previous diabetes prevention studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> and this remains a concern, especially in view of the greater prevalence of T2D in men.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Our social marketing approach to intervention development led us to provide single-sex PA classes. However, further gender-sensitive strategies need to be developed to attract men to participate in T2D prevention interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></p><p>Themes from the interview study suggest a high degree of acceptability. However, these interviews were conducted with participants who remained in the study and may not reflect the perspectives of those who dropped out. Those who left the study early tended not to respond to contacts. Participants were recruited from the community and although the early recruitment strategy involved advertising the programme, later participants were mainly recruited through word of mouth. We suggest that as later recruits only became interested in this opportunity through those already participating, they were not a population subfraction with prior interest in supervised PA training.</p><p>We did not exclude ethnic minorities from taking part in the programme, but as only two people from these groups became involved we identified this as a design limitation, considering the potentially raised prevalence of T2D within the UK South Asian and African communities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> We are currently developing an adaptation of the programme,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> specifically to target local ethnic minority communities, which also includes provision for younger age participants from these groups in line with NICE guidance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> This adaptation will be similarly assessed for feasibility, acceptability and outcomes at 12&#x02005;months.</p><p>Recruitment to this study relied on a self-reported FINDRISC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> We agreed on some flexibility for inclusion in this feasibility study because the FINDRISC algorithm includes a heavily weighted family history question and validity is compromised where data on family history are unavailable.

Seven of those recruited to NLNY who did not report family history at baseline did so at 6&#x02005;months, and we know that some of this difference was due to new T2D diagnoses in family members. The participants with baseline FINDRISC&#x0003c;11 were all overweight and inactive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> However, this flexibility in recruitment introduces a design limitation and highlights the difficulty that the trainers experienced in &#x02018;turning away&#x02019; people who were keen to participate in the programme. This difficulty was an important finding from the feasibility evaluation and an alternative strategy will be needed for a definitive trial. A risk score and confirmatory blood test, as advised in NICE guidance, would ensure more precise inclusion criteria. In this context, point of care glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be convenient. HbA1C cut-points to identify high-risk individuals are recommended in NICE guidance, but these do not identify a population with IGT and the appropriate HbA1c cut-points for the purpose of preventive interventions are untested.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Data administration</title><p>In this pilot study, we asked the fitness trainers to undertake risk assessment and collect all data. This strategy was designed to reflect the likely future practice, with inbuilt potential for robust monitoring and quality assurance measures for service provision. However, data collection involved new procedures for the fitness trainers and some baseline data were not recorded. We have subsequently improved the data administration procedures. However, in a definitive trial, trial data collection will need to be independent of intervention delivery.</p><p>Respondent burden was a key consideration for this participant group and the data collection procedures were designed to minimise this. Nevertheless, the dietary assessment method was weak. We have subsequently used the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education (DINE) questionnaire as advised by the National Obesity Observatory for weight management interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> In a definitive trial, the need for a more robust, objective measurement of PA and better dietary assessment will need to be balanced against increased respondent burden.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>Intervention delivery and capacity</title><p>The intervention design was strengthened by the incorporation of individual and group-based delivery. The one-to-one risk assessment consultations provided opportunities to introduce topics that facilitated motivational interviewing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> The group-based PA and cookery sessions encouraged social support with mutual encouragement. Group-based sessions are likely to reduce cost and potentially improve the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> Positioning the intervention within leisure services helped to avoid &#x02018;medicalising&#x02019; the problem and enabled a variety of PAs to be provided. The trainers were accessible to the participants on a casual basis, both during the 10-week programme and after its completion, as they were regularly present in the leisure centres with other groups. The trainers encouraged participants to make independent use of leisure centre facilities and join mainstream activity classes. New mainstream classes were introduced in response to the requirements of NLNY participants, some of whom invested in their own access to leisure service cards after completing follow-up at 12&#x02005;months. The local leisure centre continued to provide a meeting point for participants post follow-up. The standard (Register of Exercise Professionals) training programmes for fitness trainers provided a good foundation for intervention delivery, which we enhanced with extra training in motivational interviewing and good clinical practice. Similar delivery capacity would be available in other areas of the UK by utilising staff trained to deliver fitness programmes, such as within local authority leisure services.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Intervention cost</title><p>In this study, we focused on developing an engaging intervention and sustainable administration procedures. Group sessions were used to maximise efficiency. Funding provision was appropriate for a developmental project and further cost savings are being explored in refining the service model. Economic evaluation of the NLNY service model will be undertaken as part of a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4b5"><title>Sample size</title><p>This feasibility study has provided data that will inform sample size estimation for a definitive trial and show how the NLNY intervention performs in comparison to interventions used in previous trials: for example, in NLNY, 21% of participants lost &#x02265;5% of their body weight at 12&#x02005;months of follow-up; the equivalent value in EDIPS was 38%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> A comparison of reductions in the waist circumference will also be informative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies</title><p>In planning the NLNY intervention, we were able to draw on the experience of EDIPS-Newcastle as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> The efficacy evidence for lifestyle, diet and PA interventions to prevent T2D has been tested in research settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Although it is difficult to compare across studies with different participant gender distributions and baseline levels for the outcome variables of interest, it appears that weight loss observed at 12&#x02005;months in this pilot study (mean 5.7&#x02005;kg men, 2.8&#x02005;kg women and 4.3&#x02005;kg overall) was comparable to that achieved in the Finnish DPS (mean 4.2&#x02005;kg) and more than in EDIPS-Newcastle (mean 2.3&#x02005;kg). Similarly, it appears that the reduction in waist circumference (mean 7.2&#x02005;cm men, 6&#x02005;cm women and 6.6&#x02005;cm overall) was more than in the Finnish DPS (mean 4.4&#x02005;cm) and EDIPS-Newcastle (mean 1.7&#x02005;cm).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> In the International Day for the Evaluation of Abdominal Obesity (IDEA) study, waist circumference was shown to be a better predictor than BMI of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></p><p>Some countries have already implemented large-scale diabetes prevention programmes for high-risk groups. Finnish national diabetes prevention program (FIN-D2D) and GOAL were both conducted in Finland,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47 R48 R49">47&#x02013;49</xref> and a state-wide primary prevention programme has been implemented in Saxony in Germany.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The Australian &#x02018;Life!&#x02019; Study in Victoria State was developed with a direct recruitment strategy, underpinned by social marketing and developed from the Greater Green Triangle Translational study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> These programmes did not achieve the same degree of weight change as the DPP and DPS. The DPP and DPS included supervised group PA sessions within their protocols, but service provision models have relied mainly on classroom-based counselling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> The alternative approach used here may be more effective, especially for hard-to-reach groups. Provision of the 12&#x02005;month free access to leisure card increased the cost of the intervention and this may make the NLNY intervention inefficient or difficult to afford. The commissioners are considering alternatives such as subsidised service access for continued implementation.</p><p>Recruitment in previous diabetes prevention trials has relied on assessment of IGT using an oral glucose tolerance test. This is not practical for service provision<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> and large-scale prevention programmes have used risk scoring methods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> Blood testing is required to exclude undiagnosed T2D, but was not included in the NLNY pilot. Addressing this limitation will be important prior to a definitive trial. The most convenient procedure would be a risk score screening together with a simple blood test (such as point of care HbA1c followed by venous blood testing for those with high risk to exclude T2D).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Importance of the study: possible mechanisms and implications for clinicians or policymakers</title><p>The NLNY feasibility study has demonstrated successful recruitment and retention, the feasibility of collecting individual level outcome data within a service model, and likely effectiveness to change behavioural and intermediate health outcomes.</p><p>The NHS Health Checks programme in England offers simple tests including BMI and, where appropriate, HbA1c to adults aged between 40 and 74&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> NICE guidance advocates lifestyle intervention for T2D prevention linked to NHS Health Checks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Delivery capacity is a major consideration in planning service provision for diabetes prevention. By citing the NLNY intervention within local authority leisure services, we have utilised appropriate and available facilities together with the expertise of existing trained staff.
