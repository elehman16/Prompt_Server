Nevirapine is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which metabolizes artemether and lumefantrine. To address the concern that the antiretroviral nevirapine impacts the antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine pharmacokinetics, a prospective non-randomized controlled study in children presenting with uncomplicated malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa was carried out.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants received artemether-lumefantrine (20/120 mg weight-based BID) for 3 days during nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) co-administration (158&#x02013;266 mg/m<sup>2</sup> QD). HIV positive participants who were not yet on ART drugs were also enrolled as the control group. The target enrollment was children aged 3&#x02013;12 years (n = 24 in each group). Intensive pharmacokinetics after the last artemether-lumefantrine dose was assessed for artemether, its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine. Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), maximum concentration and day 7 lumefantrine concentrations) were estimated using non-compartmental methods and compared to controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Nineteen children (16 on nevirapine and three not on ART) enrolled. Fifteen of the 16 (aged 4 to 11 years) on nevirapine-based ART were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Due to evolving WHO HIV treatment guidelines, insufficient children were enrolled in the control group (n = 3), so the pharmacokinetic data were compared to a historical control group of 20 HIV-uninfected children 5&#x02013;12 years of age who also presented with malaria and underwent identical study procedures. Decreases of pharmacokinetic exposure [as estimated by AUC (AUC<sub>0-8hr</sub>)] were marginally significant for artemether (by -46%, p = 0.08) and dihydroartemisinin (-22%, p = 0.06) in the children on nevirapine-based ART, compared to when artemether-lumefantrine was administered alone. Similarly, peak concentration was decreased by 50% (p = 0.07) for artemether and 36% (p = 0.01) for dihydroartemisinin. In contrast, exposure to lumefantrine increased significantly in the context of nevirapine [AUC<sub>0-120hr</sub>:123% (p&#x0003c;0.001); C<sub>day7</sub>:116% (p&#x0003c;0.001), C<sub>max</sub>: 95% (p&#x0003c;0.001)].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nevirapine-based ART increases the exposure to lumefantrine in pre-pubescent children with a trend toward diminished artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure. These findings contrast with other studies indicating NVP reduces or results in no change in exposure of antimalarial drugs, and may be specific to this age group (4&#x02013;12 years). Considering the excellent safety profile of artemether-lumefantrine, the increase in lumefantrine is not of concern.

On the other hand, there are nearly 40 million people living with HIV. Among them there are 1.8 million children &#x0003c; 15 years with over 50% of cases in Africa. [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The bulk of HIV and malaria co-infection resides in sub-Saharan African. With the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria expanded in Africa, drug-drug interactions between ART and ACT must be considered among people co-infected with HIV and malaria.</p><p>ACT is recommended by the WHO as first-line for uncomplicated <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is a widely used ACT in Africa and is the only ACT approved in the United States[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For HIV positive children &#x02265;3 years, the WHO recommended efavirenz or nevirapine (NVP)-based ART as the first-line treatment when this study was initiated[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although now the efavirenz-based ART is the preferred 1<sup>st</sup> line treatment and NVP-based ART is one of the alternative 1<sup>st</sup> line regimens for children &#x02265; 3 years[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in resource-limited settings, including sub-Saharan Africa, AL is commonly used in HIV co-infected patients treated with NVP-based ART.

Two groups of HIV-infected children were enrolled; the first stabilized on NVP-based ART and the second not yet initiating ART. Due to expanded coverage under evolving WHO HIV treatment guidelines, few children were identified that were HIV-infected and not yet on ART, and the study closed to enrollment before reaching its accrual targets. Thus, PK results for the HIV-infected children on NVP-based ART were compared to a previously studied group of HIV-uninfected children who were evaluated using the identical treatment and PK study design, to determine the impact of NVP-based ART on AL PK disposition[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The sample size was calculated to detect 30% difference in mean AUC with 80% power and a 5% two-sided Type I error, assuming a coefficient of variation (CV) of 35%. Participants were enrolled at two sites in Malawi (Lilongwe and Blantyre) and one site in Kampala, Uganda. Children were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (a) age 3&#x02013;12 years, with HIV-1 positive results tested from two time points; (b) presenting with non-severe malaria indicated by positive smear of malaria parasites along with clinical evidence of infection (fever or history of fever in the past 24 hr); (c) receiving either NVP-based ART or no ART for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry; (d) &#x02264;3 doses of AL (constituting up to 3 of 6 total doses) at study entry or to be treated with AL; and (e) demonstrated ability to swallow study medications and parental/legal guardian consent.

Compared to a group of HIV-uninfected children (previously reported) with a similar age range (5.0&#x02013;12.0 years for controls versus 4.1&#x02013;11.3 years for children on NVP-based ART), HIV-infected children on NVP had reductions in the exposure of ARM and DHA but increased exposure to LR. The findings in this study are consistent with results reported by Kredo et al.[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Maganda et al.[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but different from two other studies in Nigerian and Ugandan adults [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Differences in ARM, DHA, and LR exposure in these studies are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0186589.t003">Table 3</xref>. Geometric mean changes are quite different from median changes for LR in our study, but since four other published studies reported medians, we also reported median differences. Specifically, there were statistically significant lower median peak concentrations for DHA (38%, p = 0.01), and significantly higher median peak concentrations (106%, p&#x0003c;0.001), AUC<sub>0-120h</sub> (206%, p&#x0003c;0.001), and C<sub>day7</sub> (116%, p&#x0003c;0.001) for LR. There were also trends toward decreases in AUC for ARM (48%, p = 0.08) and DHA (18%, p = 0.06). The study by Kredo et al. used a similar design but in HIV-infected adults with intensive PK sampling starting post-1<sup>st</sup> AL dose. Between 60-68hr (after the 6<sup>th</sup> AL dose), corresponding to 0-8hr in our study, the NVP-treated group had a reduction in ARM C<sub>max</sub> (56%, p&#x0003c;0.015) and AUC (55%, p = 0.12). DHA exposure was reduced to a lesser extent (C<sub>max</sub> 14%, p = 0.08, AUC 25%, p = 0.01). Consistent with our current study, LR exposure was also increased with NVP by 85% for day 7 concentration (median day 7 LR concentration of 622 ng/mL with NVP vs 336 ng/mL in those not on NVP, p&#x0003c;0.001) and 56% for AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub> (693 hr.&#x003bc;g/mL with NVP vs 445 hr.&#x003bc;g/mL in those not on NVP, p = 0.001). Likewise, Maganda et al. studied adults and also reported an increased exposure of day 7 LR concentrations (1125 versus 970 ng/mL, p = 0.063)[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, Byakika-Kibwika et al reported reduced exposure to all drug components for AL in adults. NVP led to significantly reduced exposure of ARM and DHA including peak concentration and AUC, where median AUC was reduced by 72% and 37%, respectively, but where the reduction in LR exposure was not significant [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recently reported study in HIV-infected Nigerian adults also compared to a historical control group, NVP reduced exposure of ARM and LR significantly, but not DHA exposure [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study LR samples were only collected up to 96hr, and drugs were measured with less sensitive methods[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186589.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Lastly, our group has recently evaluated this interaction in younger children (6 months to 6 years of age) in Tororo Uganda, a region highly endemic for malaria. NVP reduced AUC<sub>0-8hr</sub> for both ARM and DHA by 68% (p&#x0003c;0.0001), and 28% (p = 0.02), respectively, but only led to a small trend toward increased LR exposure of 18% (p = 0.8) based on median AUC, the geometric mean AUC changes are -70%, -35%, and +3% for ARM, DHA, and LR, respectively[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="pone.0186589.t003"

discrepancies on LR exposure between studies are unclear, but could be attributed to differences in study design. This study along with the other two studies by Kredo et al and Maganda et al used parallel designs, while Byakika-Kibwika et al used a cross-over design. Although there was a 50-day washout period between the 2 periods of AL administration in the cross-over study, the effect of artemisinin induced CYP enzymes change on LR metabolism is unclear. Parikh et al. used less PK sampling points (up to 96hr only) and a historical control. We also relied on historical control data in HIV-1 uninfected children, which used a nearly identical design in that intensive PK was collected around the last dose of a 6 dose regimen. However, when comparing results for the NVP-treated children to the three HIV-1 infected children enrolled into P1079 not on ART, the same patterns were evident, with a trend towards reduced exposure for ARM and DHA and increased exposure for LR (70 vs 66 hr.ng/mL for ARM AUC, 265 vs 261 hr.ng/mL for DHA AUC, 383 vs 435hr.&#x003bc;g/mL for LR AUC, 528 vs 697 for LR C<sub>day7</sub> for the no ART vs NVP groups respectively, supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0186589.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Differences in median AUCs were larger: 106 vs 64.5 for ARM, 381 vs 279 for DHA, and 368 vs 549 for LR).</p><p>NVP is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and in addition to inductive effects, it can serve as a competitive inhibitor of these enzymes in the presence of other substrate drugs[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We speculate impact from CYP enzyme induction will be dominant for fast metabolizing drugs like artemisinins, as artemisinins are better substrates than NVP. But for the slow metabolizing drug LR, NVP will competitively bind to CYP3A4 to inhibit metabolism of LR, which explains the decreased exposure of ARM and DHA, and increased exposure of LR in the context of NVP. Moreover clinically, NVP has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism, e.g. a 1.5-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> of maraviroc, also a CYP3A4 substrate[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was observed in participants on NVP-based ART compared to historical controls receiving maraviroc monotherapy[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>AL has been proved to be safe with minimal side effects[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study we evaluated safety of AL in the context of NVP. The proportion of participants experiencing grade &#x02265;3 safety events in the HIV-infected children on NVP was 44% (n = 16) compared to 0% (n = 3) for those not on ART, but with the small sample sizes, there was inadequate power to detect other than very large differences.</p><p>This study has limitations, including a small sample size, use of a historical control group of HIV-uninfected children who were somewhat older and heavier than the NVP-based ART group in this report, and children with only uncomplicated malaria. HIV infection itself might impact AL PK, and there could have been other differences between the cohorts. Because of the small sample size, we could not conduct analyses adjusted for other factors. Assessing adherence to study drugs is also a challenge. Although we observed dosing before PK sampling, we relied on patients&#x02019; log for some doses of AL and ART. More advanced techniques are available to improve adherence, such as high-tech pill bottles, which can count number of times bottle opened. Although the study protocol required AL was taken with whole milk, milk may not be available in some resource-limited communities, alternative fatty food such as oil-fortified porridge might be used without compromising drug absorption[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, in this study we did not measure the NVP concentrations, which would be helpful to verify these children had therapeutic NVP levels.</p><p>Most recent WHO guidelines recommend the use of LPV/r -based ART in children under 3 years of age and efavirenz-based ART in those above 3 years of age, with NVP-based ART as an alternate regimen[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, due to delayed uptake and availability, NVP use in Africa remains high[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0186589.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus it remains important to ensure the proper use of antimalarials in the context of NVP treatment. Increase in LR exposure in this study may not be a concern. Increased exposure of LR with LPV/r ART has also been reported with much more extensive increases in exposure [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to the excellent safety profile of AL, dosage adjustment even with these increases, has not been recommended [<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the reductions in the artemisinins with NVP as reported here may of concern and warrant further study to determine the correct dose in young children. Alteration of AL exposure may alter clinical outcomes[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis found a higher ARM dose was associated with a lower gametocyte presence within 14 days of treatment and authors suggested a higher AL dose should be accessed in young children[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Suboptimum dosing of AL in children will contribute selection of resistance to this drug. Considering reports of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia[<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0186589.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it is important to optimize AL dose in children.</p><p>In summary, in this study we showed that NVP use in children 4&#x02013;12 years of age was associated with trends of reduced exposure of both ARM and DHA and significantly increased exposure of LR when compared to HIV-1 uninfected controls. Considering the excellent safety profile of AL, the increase in LR is not of concern. However, the reduction in artemisinin exposure may warrant further study, and suggests that dosage adjustment of AL with NVP based ART in children is likely warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186589.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>TREND checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186589.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186589.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>P1079 protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186589.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186589.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>PK parameters compared to the 3 control participants from P1079.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186589.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0186589.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of P1079 participants at study entry.</title><p>(RTF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0186589.s004.rtf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Other members of P1079 team include: Paul Sato, George K Siberry, Kimberly R.
