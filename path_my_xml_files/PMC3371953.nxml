Considering limits of supply, it seems that there is a need to run productive management in offering health services to prevent wasting of supplies and facilities. This study compares the complications caused by hemorrhoidectomy in outpatient and inpatient operations.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>In a cross-sectional study during 1.5 years, 208 patients without any background disease were enrolled. They were randomly allocated into two groups (inpatient and outpatient) and interviewed within two weeks after surgical operations. The data were collected through a questionnaire and physical examination. The complications in the two groups of operating theater of hospital and clinic were then compared regarding sex, occupation, education and etc.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>One week after the surgical operation, the patients in the hospital operating theater showed significantly a better healing recovery of their wound. Other complications such as pain, hemorrhage, infection, inflammation, involuntary emission of feces and gas indicated no significant difference between the two groups. After 2 weeks, more pain was noticed in patients in the operating theaters of the hospital and in clinics, there was more infection visible. The hemorrhage, inflammation, wound healing, involuntary emission of feces and gas did not indicate a significant difference between the operating theater of hospital and the clinic. There was no significant difference regarding the patients' satisfaction in the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We recommend that for optimized use of supplies and equipments in operating theaters and to lower the cost and shorten queue of patients, grade 2 hemorrhoids are performed in the operating theater of clinics considering sterilization and safety procedures.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Complications</kwd><kwd>Hemorrhoidectomy</kwd><kwd>Hospitalization</kwd><kwd>Outpatient</kwd><kwd>Inpatient</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Today, performing outpatient operation has become very popular worldwide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] In United States, over 60% of non-emergency surgical operations are performed in an outpatient method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] Outpatient surgical operations in health economy are associated with a lower cost and have other advantages such as decrease in hospital infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] Furthermore, it has advantages for patients and medical personnel tool.

They were randomly allocated into two groups undergoing operation in a hospital and clinic. The data the patients were recorded during surgical operation and one or two weeks after attending the physician&#x02019;s office. They were all examined and interviewed. Hemorrhoidectomy was performed in two types of cases with sphincteratomy and without cutting sphincter in grade 2, 3, and 4 hemorrhoid patients who did not respond to outpatient treatment. Internal and external hemorrhoids were both considered. All patients in the clinic were surgically operated with local anesthesia and only 14/6% of those in the operating theater of the hospital were operated with local anesthetic and the remaining were operated with general anesthesia. The level of pain, amount of hemorrhage, infection, inflammation, involuntary emission of feces and gas, healing of wound and level of satisfaction from the operation were determined. The severity of these complications were evaluated and scored on the Likert scale of very much, much, average, little and none levels. The score of one indicated highest and five indicated the least amount of severity. The patients were evaluated by filling out a questionnaire, one week and two weeks after the surgical operation. T test was used to analyze quantitative and Chi-Square test for qualitative variables. One-way Analysis of Variance was also performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and three patients were operated in the operating theater of hospital and 105 patients in the clinic.

Hemorrhoidectomy was performed for 54.4% of patients in the operating theater of hospital and 51.4% of the clinic by cutting the sphincter. Twenty three percent of patients had undergone hemorrhoidectomy before (13% in the operating theater of hospital and 10% in the clinic).No significant difference was noticed between the level of satisfaction among the patients of the operating theater of hospital and the clinic.

(2007), none of the patients needed hemorrhoidectomy for the second time and only 3.7% of the patients needed to be hospitalized.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] In a research by Khoshkalam et al. (2004), the most important reason for re-hospitalization was the side effect after the operation for 72% of patients, infection after the operation for 19.5% and relapse of disease in 8.5%. Considering the high risk of re-hospitalization resulting from the complications and infection after the operation about 91.5%, more precise studies are required in quality management of surgical operations and sterilization of the operating theater of the hospital and related units[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p>Among patients of the operating theater of the hospital, 51.5% reported a grade 3 hemorrhoid and 63.8% of them in the clinic had a grade 2 hemorrhoid. Therefore, patients with hemorrhoid of higher grades are preferred to be treated in the operating theater of hospital due to seriousness of the disease as under general anesthesia, patients take relaxant medicines and are not conscious which is more suitable for the surgeon. Some studies indicated that an unconscious patient has no movement and reflex and the surgeon is highly satisfied with general anesthesia while the satisfaction of patients undergoing local anesthesia is also favorable as it is an easy method without any nausea and vomiting and systematic effects are scarce too.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] Ninety one percent of patients in operating theater of the hospital were not able to do their routine works in about one week after the operation while this rate was 78% in the clinic and the patients operated in the clinics returned to their normal life faster.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] Ghobadi et al.

This comparison showed that waiting period for hemorrhoidectomy in the operating theater of the hospital was more than the clinic; the ability to return to daily activities in both periods (one week and two weeks after the surgical operation) for the patients of clinic was faster than those of the operating theater of the hospital. Several studies compared the complications and pain after the operation with general anesthesia and local anesthesia, and most of these studies have shown less pain and lower systematic complications in the group of local anesthesia,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] but the rest could not indicate such benefits.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] In the study by Krioluck et al.
