Trial evidence supports the effectiveness of the CRT model, but research suggests that the anticipated reductions in inpatient admissions and increased user satisfaction with acute care have been less than hoped for following the scaling up of CRTs nationally in England, as mandated by the National Health Service (NHS) Plan in 2000. The organisation and service delivery of the CRTs vary substantially. This may reflect the lack of a fully specified CRT model and the resources to enhance team model fidelity and to improve service quality. We will evaluate the impact of a CRT service improvement programme over a 1-year period on the service users&#x02019; experiences of care, service use, staff well-being, and team model fidelity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Twenty-five CRTs from eight NHS Trusts across England will be recruited to this cluster-randomised trial: 15 CRTs will be randomised to receive the service improvement programme over a 1-year period, and ten CRTs will not receive the programme. Data will be collected from 15 service users and all clinical staff from each participating CRT at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Service use data will be collected from the services&#x02019; electronic records systems for two 6-month periods: the period preceding and the period during months 7-12 of the intervention. The study&#x02019;s primary outcome is service user satisfaction with CRT care, measured using a client satisfaction questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include the following: perceived continuity of care, hospital admission rates and bed use, rates of readmission to acute care following CRT support, staff morale, job satisfaction, and general health. The adherence of the services to a model of best practice will be assessed at baseline and follow-up. Outcomes will be compared between the intervention and control teams, adjusting for baseline differences and participant characteristics using linear random effects modelling. Qualitative investigations with participating CRT managers and staff and programme facilitators will explore the experiences of the service improvement programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our trial will show whether a theoretically underpinned and clearly defined package of resources are effective in supporting service improvement and improving outcomes for mental health crisis resolution teams.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN47185233">ISRCTN47185233</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1283-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Crisis resolution teams</kwd><kwd>Acute care</kwd><kwd>Service improvement</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-PG_0109-10078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Crisis resolution teams (CRTs) &#x02013; otherwise referred to as home treatment or crisis assessment teams &#x02013; provide rapid assessment in mental health crises and offer intensive home treatment as an alternative to acute admission if feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The introduction of CRTs, mandated by the National Health Service (NHS) Plan in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], has been an extensive change in the English mental health care system. In 2000, few areas had such teams, but at the time of writing, CRTs are available in every Trust in the country, and several thousand mental health professionals have migrated into them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. UK government guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] recommended that CRTs should provide an easy access, rapid response, 24-hour service; should be multi-disciplinary and able to provide medical, psychological, and social interventions; and should help facilitate early discharge and adopt a &#x02018;gatekeeping&#x02019; function of assessing all service users before admission to acute wards to ensure home treatment is presented as an alternative to admission wherever possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When CRTs first became national policy, their evidence base was criticised as limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, some positive findings have now been reported from naturalistic studies and a randomised controlled trial, suggesting that CRTs reduce inpatient admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and increase service user satisfaction with acute care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite indications of the potential effectiveness of CRTs, considerable reservations have emerged about their delivery in routine settings in the UK, most notably in recent reports by Mind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the Schizophrenia Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the Care Quality Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Both CRT and ward managers still view a significant minority of hospital admissions as unnecessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The impact on bed use appears to vary considerably between areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the reductions in bed days tend to be less marked than those in admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Rates of compulsory admissions have continued to rise in England since 2000 despite the national implementation of CRTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and a recent national audit raised concerns about the number of suicides by service users receiving CRT care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Service users and carers, whilst mainly positive about receiving care in their own homes, report important areas of dissatisfaction with CRTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], especially regarding the continuity of care, the quality of relationships with staff, and a narrow range of support on offer, which sometimes focuses principally on medication and short-term symptom control.</p><p>The UK experience, and similar challenges in Norway, where CRTs are also mandated at the national level but with variable implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], illustrates that the national mandate, policy, and guidelines have been insufficient to ensure consistent and complete implementation of this complex intervention. A survey of CRTs in 2005/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and another in 2011/12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] confirmed considerable variation in CRT resources, organisation, and service delivery. One potential reason for inconsistencies in CRT implementation is that the CRT model and its theoretical basis were not highly specified at the outset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], nor has a means of measuring fidelity to a model of good practice been developed and disseminated. Improving acute mental health services is a current UK policy priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], yet available quality improvement resources are lacking for CRTs to promote best practice.</p><p>The US National Implementing Evidence-Based Practices Project (EBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] offers a model for evaluating and promoting quality improvement in complex service-level mental health interventions. Integral elements of the EBP approach are service reviews using a fidelity measure that assesses how far services are achieving a model of good practice and utilisation of a resource kit to support implementation and quality improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Resource kits typically consist of guidance, training materials, and coaching and support for service managers and staff, designed to help services address areas where high model fidelity has not been achieved. Modelling of factors associated with successful implementation of evidence-based practices has helped to theoretically underpin the EBP implementation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Attention to workforce development and training may in itself be insufficient to achieve high fidelity implementation of complex mental health interventions: securing leadership support, organising workflow (service structures and organisation) to support implementation, and providing feedback to reinforce implementation successes are also required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Access to technical assistance that enables understanding of the specific requirements of a complex intervention can also facilitate implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The EBP programme has successfully developed fidelity scales and implementation resources for a range of service-level interventions including supported employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and assertive community treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Previous studies have found correlations between fidelity to an evidence-based practice and better client outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. CRTs are comparable with models in the EBP project because trial evidence exists for their efficacy in the right conditions. A CRT fidelity scale was developed in an earlier part of this programme of research (The CORE Study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This trial will test the effectiveness of the CORE CRT Service Improvement Programme in helping CRTs improve outcomes and achieve high model fidelity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>This trial tests the CORE CRT Service Improvement Programme in a cluster-randomised trial. CRTs randomised to the intervention arm will receive the Service Improvement Programme over a 1-year period, and control CRTs will not receive the intervention. The study aims to investigate whether a CRT Service Improvement Programme can improve service users&#x02019; experience of CRT care, reduce acute service use, and improve CRT staff well-being. The primary outcome is service user satisfaction, measured using The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We will also explore whether the fidelity scores of the CRT teams receiving the Service Improvement Programme rise over the 1-year intervention period and the associations between team fidelity score and service outcomes. Through a qualitative and process evaluation, we will seek to understand stakeholder experience of the CRT Service Improvement Programme, contextual factors constituting barriers and facilitators to its implementation, and any mechanisms by which it may improve team effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This cluster-randomised controlled trial is funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and has received ethical approval from the Camden &#x00026; Islington Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 14/LO/0107). It is registered on the ISRCTN registry (Ref: 47185233). The protocol reported in this paper corresponds to the current, ethically approved, version of the trial protocol: V3_25/06/15.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preliminary work</title><p>The lack of a highly specified model for CRTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] led to the development of a fidelity scale by the CORE study team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Fidelity refers to adherence to the standards defining a specific practice; a fidelity scale is a quantitative measure assessing the degree of adherence. The fidelity scale was developed from qualitative interviews with stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], a systematic review of previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and a national survey of CRT managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The CORE CRT fidelity scale defines 39 fidelity criteria; each item is scored on a scale of 1&#x02013;5, with 5 indicating excellent fidelity and 1 very low fidelity; and a total score is yielded that ranges from 39&#x02013;195. The scale has been piloted and used to survey CRT model fidelity across 75 CRT teams in England in 1-day reviews by three trained external reviewers. Whilst completing the 75 team fidelity surveys, researchers collected best practice resources and case study examples that inform the development of the Service Improvement Programme, which is designed to help CRT services achieve high model fidelity and quality improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Main study</title><p>The CORE Trial involves the collection of data from 25 CRTs at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up. The trial comprises four components: (1) quantitative evaluations of service user experience, (2) quantitative evaluations of service use, 3) quantitative evaluations of staff well-being, and 4) an accompanying qualitative and process evaluation. This protocol paper follows the SPIRIT recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] for trial protocols. A copy of the SPIRIT checklist, detailing where each recommended element of protocol reporting is included in this protocol paper, is provided as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Setting</title><p>Twenty-five CRTs will be recruited to the trial. CRTs will be selected from NHS Trusts in four regions of England (North London, South London and the South-east, the West of England, and the heart of England) to reflect a range of Trusts and urban and more rural areas. We excluded the CRT teams identified by our earlier CORE fidelity survey as already achieving good model fidelity (defined as having a mean item score of 4 or higher). Fifteen CRT teams were included in the intervention arm of the trial to allow a thorough investigation of the implementation of the intervention in a range of contexts. Ten teams were included in the control group, as this was considered sufficient to represent treatment as usual. The number of participants in each outcome is therefore greater in the intervention than the control arm, although it is equal within each cluster for the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The 25 teams will be randomised to either receive the Service Improvement Programme (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) or the control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) after the baseline fidelity reviews have taken place for all participating teams within each NHS Trust. Randomisation of the CRTs will be stratified by the NHS Trust to ensure that within each Trust, some CRTs will receive the intervention and some will act as control teams, to address the potential confounding factor of Trusts&#x02019; macro-level management and service processes. Randomisation will be conducted by a Priment (a University College London Clinical Trials Unit) statistician who is independent of the study. Randomisations will be conducted for all participating teams within each NHS Trust at the same time, once baseline fidelity reviews have been completed at all sites within the Trust. The CORE trial has made no arrangements for blinding: both participating services and researchers will be aware of the team allocation status. Service user participants providing data for the trial&#x02019;s primary outcome are not expected to be informed of their team allocation, and the NHS Informatics Teams providing anonymised patient service-use data will not be aware of the team allocation status.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample</title><p>The four components to this study are presented and described separately.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>1) Service user experience</title><p>At each CRT, 15 service user participants will be recruited at baseline, and 15 service user participants will be recruited who were discharged in months 10&#x02013;12 of the 12-month intervention, providing a total sample of N&#x02009;=&#x02009;375 at each time point. At each service, we will screen and recruit consecutively discharged, eligible, and consenting service users until we reach our target of 15. Eligibility criteria for participants are the use of the CRT service for at least 7&#x000a0;days, ability to read and understand English, capacity to provide informed consent, and do not pose too high a risk to others to participate (including being interviewed on NHS premises or participating by phone, email, or online survey).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>2) Service use</title><p>Anonymised service data for two cohorts of service users will be collected at two time points &#x02013; baseline and follow-up: (1) a cohort of all service users admitted to the CRT during a 1-month period ending 6&#x000a0;months prior to the study baseline date and another cohort of all service users admitted during month 7 of the study intervention period at each Trust and (2) all service users admitted to the acute inpatient services during a 6-month period up to the study baseline date and during months 7&#x02013;12 of the study intervention period at each Trust.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>3) Staff well-being</title><p>At each CRT, all clinical staff will be invited to complete a set of questionnaires at baseline and outcome (months 10&#x02013;12) time points to measure staff morale and psychological health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>4) Qualitative and process evaluation</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Fidelity reviews</title><p>Fidelity reviews will involve individual interviews with CRT managers and a separate focus group with available CRT clinical staff.

Structures and resources included in the Service Improvement Programme are available in the online CRT Resource Pack. They include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Assessment of adherence to current CRT best practice measured by the CORE CRT fidelity scale. Fidelity reviews will be conducted at baseline and at the end of the 12-month study period with control teams and intervention teams. Intervention teams will receive an additional 6-month review, with feedback from the external reviewers being included on the resulting fidelity report to the CRT manager and team. Intervention teams will be offered a meeting with the reviewers to discuss their 6-month report. This will be used to identify targets for service improvement and planning for how to achieve them and to provide positive reinforcement of any implementation successes achieved during the previous 6&#x000a0;months.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Structures to guide service improvement work. A number of structures based on an EBP framework will be utilised to guide service improvement. These structures include a 1-day, whole-team scoping event for each CRT to kick start the Service Improvement Programme and feedback on the fidelity review; service improvement groups (SIGs) of managers and clinical leaders within each CRT meeting regularly to develop service improvement plans (SIPs); and collaboration between CRT managers and staff in teams receiving the intervention, which will be promoted by the research team. Collaboration activities will include an online forum; regular bulletins from the research team about implementation progress at study sites; and at least two meetings/events during the study period to promote sharing of experience, knowledge, and best practice. Evidence suggests that these types of collaborative learning events have the potential to support improvements in the quality of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>A local facilitator. Participating NHS Trusts will fund a local facilitator with dedicated time (0.1 full time equivalent for each intervention team) to help teams implement the Service Improvement Programme by encouraging the use of the resource pack; discussion and coaching of the CRT manager; mentoring, supervision, and training of the CRT staff; and liaison with senior Trust management regarding resources or organisational support required to achieve model fidelity. The local facilitator may either be an employee of the participating NHS Trust or an external consultant identified by the study team, depending on local resources and preferences. The facilitator will typically be a manager or senior clinician with experience of working in or with CRTs. Facilitators will be provided with initial and follow-up group training and individual coaching at least once a month by appropriately experienced members of the research study team (a clinical psychologist with CRT clinical experience and a clinical and academic psychologist with expertise in leadership and change management in mental health service contexts). Facilitators will be invited to regular implementation meetings with the study team to offer feedback on how the intervention is progressing and discuss ways of overcoming barriers to service improvement.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Access to a web-based resource pack manual, including practical resources, guidance, and training materials to support implementation; case studies from high fidelity CRT services outlining strategies for achieving high fidelity; relevant reading; useful links; video and audio clips of service users, carers, and staff involved in clinical CRT work; and service improvement research providing rationale for fidelity scale items and ideas for improving support. An outline of the structures designed to help facilitate service improvement over the 1-year intervention will also be included.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The CORE CRT Service Improvement Programme, with ongoing implementation support from facilitators during the year of the intervention, will thus provide ongoing help to teams during the course of the project in securing leadership support, structuring team workflows to support implementation, and providing expert technical assistance with implementing the CRT model where required, in line with EBP implementation theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Services in the control group will receive a fidelity review and written report at baseline and at the end of the study period but no other implementation support.

Service users&#x02019; experience of care, measured using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], is the primary study outcome. The sample size in the trial is sufficient to detect a medium or large difference in satisfaction between participants in the intervention and control arm teams. The experience of care is inherently important in all health services research, and improving the service users&#x02019; experience is an overarching goal of the CORE CRT Service Improvement Programme. Service users&#x02019; experience of CRT care is especially important to evaluate in our trial, given recent reports of high levels of dissatisfaction with CRT and acute care in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The trial will also investigate the impact of the CORE Service Improvement Programme on other outcomes relevant to the services&#x02019; clinical and cost effectiveness, i.e. local admission rates and service users&#x02019; recovery following CRT care, and will measure any impact of the team-level intervention on CRT staff well-being.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of the study relate to the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Blinding: Due to the need for researchers to have ongoing contact with CRT teams and facilitators throughout the intervention, it will not be possible for researchers to be blinded to team randomisation, and this approach could lead to researcher bias.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contamination: As NHS Trusts often try to ensure their services are operating in a consistent way, a limitation of the study is the potential for contamination between teams receiving the Service Improvement Programme and control teams within the same Trust. To minimise this, researchers will ensure teams are informed that for the clarity of study findings it is beneficial if any CORE-related service improvement work is limited to the intervention teams until the end of the study, and this includes limiting access to the online resource kit. In addition, monitoring of contamination through interviewing control team managers will serve to highlight the extent of this.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Retrospective collection of some data: It will not be feasible to complete all baseline data collection before randomisation. However, all staff data will be collected before the scoping day &#x02013; the kick-off, one-day team meeting in each CRT which is arranged as soon as possible after the start of the intervention year, and service user data will be collected from service users discharged before the scoping day.
