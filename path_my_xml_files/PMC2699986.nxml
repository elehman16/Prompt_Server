Cataract surgery requires a potent motor blockade of the eyeball and eyelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-1-55">Di Donato et al 2006</xref>). Retrobulbar and peribulbar anesthesia were the only techniques used for many years. Rare but serious complications were associated with blind needle insertion such as globe perforation, brainstem anesthesia, retrobulbar hemorrhage, optic nerve injury, postoperative strabismus, intravascular injection, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-1-55">Gunja and Varshnev 2006</xref>). These complications are unfortunately inevitable when needles are placed into orbital cavity without an implicit understanding of orbital anatomy. Even in experienced hands, variations in orbital anatomy, especially the presence of a posterior staphyloma, may lead to inadvertent needle-related injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-1-55">Alwitry et al 2001</xref>).</p><p>Although the use of topical anesthesia was associated with minimal risks, patients may complain of pain or discomfort during manipulation of iris and/or intolerance to microscope light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-1-55">Makulolwa and Dharmarathna 2000</xref>). The use of topical anesthesia may not be preferred by some surgeons for cases of dense cataract with hard nucleus, sub-laxated lens, or in uncooperative patients who cannot self-fixate light during the procedure. Advanced age and language barriers make the cooperation of patients during topical anesthesia rather difficult.</p><p>The use of superficial peribulbar anesthesia may have the advantages of both regional and topical anesthesia while avoiding the complications of both techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate efficacy of superficial peribulbar anesthesia for cataract extraction compared with conventional peribulbar anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This work was carried out in Al Nahdha Hospital (Tertiary Ophthalmic Hospital) and Magraby Eye and Ear Hospital, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman between the period of June 2003 and October 2006. After approval from Al Nahdha Hospital ethical committee, a written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. The patients were subjected to preoperative evaluation, which included history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory investigations. Exclusion criteria included: deafness, dysphasia, psychiatric disorders, dementia, dysfunction ocular motility, coagulation disorders, or allergy to any of the local anesthetic drugs used. Also, patients with previous ocular surgery in the same eye to be operated were excluded from the study. All patients fasted for 8 hours before surgery.</p><p>After oral premedication with midazolam (3.75&#x02013;7.5 mg) 45 minutes before expected time of surgery, intravenous cannula was inserted. In the operating theater, monitoring was done using electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure and pulse oximetry. Intravenous infusion of Ringer&#x02019;s lactate was started in a dose of 6 ml.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. All the patients received continuous nasal oxygen at a rate of 4 L/min.</p><sec><title>Technique of superficial peribulbar anesthesia</title><p>A 25-gauge half-inch needle connected to a syringe containing an equal mixture of 2% lignocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine and 30 IU/ml hyaluronidase was used to perform the block. After instillation of one or two drops of benoxinate hydrochloride (Novesin 0.4%), the surgeon separated the two eyelids by left hand and asked patients to look upwards. Then he directed the needle under vision under the conjunctiva about 5 mm from the limbus inferiorly towards inferior wall of the orbit. If the periosteum was touched, the needle was withdrawn 1&#x02013;2 mm and injection started slowly till the local anesthetic solution (range between 7&#x02013;10 ml) spread all around the perilimbus. No ocular compression but gentle message was applied for 2 min to allow distribution of local anesthetic injected to the peribulbar space.</p></sec><sec><title>Technique of conventional peribulbar anesthesia used</title><p>Skin infiltration with 0.5 ml lidocaine with half-inch 25-gauge needle at the junction of medial two thirds and lateral one third of lower eyelid was done. Then one inch 25-gauge short bevel needle was inserted at the same site in a strictly posterior direction. Depth of insertion of needle was limited to 25 mm. The local anesthetic solution (an equal mixture of 2% lignocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine and 30 IU/ml hyaluronidase) was injected after an aspiration test. The injected volume was not predetermined, but adjusted to each patient. The injection continued until proptosis and lid fullness appeared with sensation of full orbit. Compression was applied for 15 to 20 minutes using Honan&#x02019;s balloon set at 40 mmHg to lower intraocular pressure. If after 15 min, the degree of akinesia was not accepted, a second injection with the same anesthetic mixture was given in a similar way.</p><p>Randomization was done using random allocation software (Dr. Saghaei, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran). Superficial peribulbar anesthesia was done by the same surgeon in all cases, while conventional peribulbar block was done by the same anesthesiologist in all cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Masked observers, unaware of the anesthetic technique used, have taken the following measures.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Testing ocular motility in all direction and testing orbicularis oculi muscle, which determined onset of akinesia.

Five hundred cases were anesthetized using superficial peribulbar anesthesia and four hundred cases were anesthetized using conventional peribulbar anesthesia. The two groups were comparable as regards age, weight, gender, and duration of surgery. The onset of akinesia was significantly faster in superficial peribulbar group P &#x0003c; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-1-55">Table 1</xref>). The total volume of local anesthetic used to perform adequate block was significantly higher in conventional peribulbar block P = 0.0241 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-1-55">Table 1</xref>). The percentage of patients with total akinesia after first injection was significantly higher in superficial peribulbar group (66%) compared with conventional peribulbar group (45%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-1-55">Figure 1</xref>). There were no serious complications in the two groups as regards global perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage or severe pain, which necessitated conversion to general anesthesia. However, the percentage of patients in conventional peribulbar group (18.75%) who required supplementary reinjection of local anesthetic to achieve acceptable akinesia was higher (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and this was the main cause of dissatisfaction in this group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-1-55">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-1-55">Figure 2</xref>). No patient in the superficial peribulbar group required supplementary reinjection, but the cause of dissatisfaction in the superficial peribulbar group was that patients would like to undergo the surgery under general anesthesia to be unaware but this was not related to type of block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-1-55">Figure 2</xref>). There was no significant difference as regards changes in intraocular pressure in superficial peribulbar group at any time of measurement. However, there was significant transient increase in intraocular pressure in the conventional peribulbar group after one minute from block which returned to near preoperative value after 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-1-55">Table 2</xref>). There was an insignificant difference between both groups with regard to pain assessment as a high percentage of patients had no pain during procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-1-55">Figure 3</xref>). The incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage was significantly higher in the superficial peribulbar anesthesia group (18%) compared with the conventional peribulbar block (0.5%; P &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-1-55">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrated that superficial peribulbar anesthesia for cataract surgery provided a more constantly effective block than conventional peribulbar anesthesia, with shorter time to onset of blockade, better akinesia, and no need for supplemental injection. No serious complications occurred with better patient satisfaction compared with conventional peribulbar block.</p><p>The rapid onset of block in superficial peribulbar anesthesia could be explained by diffusion of local anesthetic with the help of hyaluronidase to sub-Tenon&#x02019;s space where the extraocular muscles, sensory and motor nerves of the eye are located. The circumferential distribution of local anesthetic around the limbus helped in homogenous diffusion of local anesthetics to this space and this explains the better akinesia in this group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-1-55">Wong and colleagues (1991)</xref> stated that after peribulbar block, local anesthetic must spread from the extraconal space into intraconal space. Because the corpus adiposum of the orbit is separated into multiple compartments by a small network of septa, this spread of local anesthetics is sometimes heterogeneous and incomplete. This irregular spreading accounted for imperfect blockade (even with experienced hands) in up to 50% of cases in some series or for the need for multiple injections or very high volumes to obtain effective block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-1-55">Ripart et al 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-1-55">2000</xref>). In this study, the percentage of patients in conventional peribulbar block who needed supplementary reinjection was 18.75%. This need of reinjection despite the skills of the experienced anesthesiologist who performed these blocks could be explained by presence of these septa, which interfere with homogenous spread of local anesthetic resulting in partial or no akinesia.</p><p>Subconjunctival hemorrhage was the main side effect of superficial peribulbar anesthesia, which subsided within 3 days to one week after surgery. However, the incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage, which amounted to 18% in this study, was less compared with other studies using subconjunctival anesthesia in cataract extraction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-1-55">Wasee and colleagues (2006)</xref> reported subconjunctival hemorrhage in 23% of the patients, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-1-55">Stan and colleagues (1997)</xref> reported subconjunctival hemorrhage in 56% of cases. The low incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in this study could be explained by selection of site of entry of needle under conjunctiva to be free from apparent vessels with slow rate of injection. In addition, authors observed that the cases that had subconjunctival hemorrhage after the block had relatively more vascularized conjunctiva.</p><p>One of the advantages of the superficial peribulbar anesthesia was absence of significant change in intraocular pressure. The transient increase in intraocular pressure after one minute from performing the conventional peribulbar block was due to injection of local anesthetics in a limited space and returned back to near normal value after 10 minutes by effect of ocular compression using Honan&#x02019;s balloon.</p><p>Patient satisfaction was higher in superficial peribulbar anesthesia. Patient dissatisfaction in this group (4%) was due to the fact that patients would prefer to undergo surgery under general anesthesia to be unaware during surgery. The dissatisfaction was not due to a defect in the technique but due to patient apprehension, which could be avoided by spending more time with the patient preoperatively to explain the procedure to him, in addition to better use of anxiolytic drugs prior to surgery. The percentage of dissatisfaction was higher in conventional peribulbar group (15%). Dissatisfaction was mainly due to repeated injections and needle pricks.</p><p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-1-55">Wong et al 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-1-55">Stan et al 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-opth-1-55">Wood et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-1-55">Makuloluwa and Dharmarathna 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-1-55">Ripart et al 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-1-55">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-1-55">Wasee et al 2006</xref>) failed to have total akinesia with subconjunctival anesthesia. The total or partially acceptable akinesia achieved with superficial peribulbar anesthesia in the present work could be attributed to the large volume of local anesthetic used compared with these studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Superficial peribulbar anesthesia is a safe, simple, quick to perform, and effective method of anesthesia for cataract surgery with better patient satisfaction, better akinesia, and comparable analgesia compared with conventional peribulbar block.
