It represents a growing health burden but remains under-researched, with limited treatment options. Early promising signals of activity relating to both PD-L1- and PD-1-targeted treatment in mesothelioma implicate a dependency of mesothelioma on this immune checkpoint. There is a need to evaluate checkpoint inhibitors in patients with relapsed mesothelioma where treatment options are limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The addition of 12&#x000a0;months of nivolumab (anti-PD1 antibody) to standard practice will be conducted in the UK using a randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial (the Cancer Research UK CONFIRM trial). A total of 336 patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy will be recruited from UK secondary care sites. Patients will be randomised 2:1 (nivolumab:placebo), stratified according to epithelioid/non-epithelioid, to receive either 240&#x000a0;mg nivolumab monotherapy or saline placebo as a 30-min intravenous infusion. Treatment will be for up to 12&#x000a0;months. We will determine whether the use of nivolumab increases overall survival (the primary efficacy endpoint). Secondary endpoints will include progression-free survival, objective response rate, toxicity, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle using a Cox regression analysis for the primary endpoint (and for other time-to-event endpoints).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The outcome of this trial will provide evidence of the potential benefit of the use of nivolumab in the treatment of relapsed mesothelioma.

The majority of patients with mesothelioma present with advanced disease and prognosis is poor, especially with sarcomatoid mesothelioma. Mesothelioma therefore represents a growing health burden, but it remains under-researched and treatment options are limited. Chemotherapy is currently the standard of care in the first-line setting in which two positive, randomised phase III trials have been reported, showing improved survival with the addition of pemetrexed or raltitrexed to cisplatin, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The recent French MAPS trial has shown that the addition of bevacizumab to pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab maintenance, improves survival from 16.1&#x000a0;months within the control arm to 18.8&#x000a0;months with the addition of bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Unfortunately, even following successful first-line therapy, all patients with mesothelioma will subsequently relapse. There is currently no standard second-line therapy; however, it is common practice to re-challenge with the first-line regimen, usually pemetrexed-cisplatin, if there has been a reasonable progression-free interval. In addition to this, vinorelbine is used in some centres, as phase II trials have shown this drug to have promising activity in the second-line treatment of mesothelioma. Currently the Vinorelbine In Mesothelioma study (VIM study: NCT02139904) trial is ongoing to evaluate its efficacy in this setting. Due to the availability of second-line options, either within the VIM trial or off study, the CONFIRM trial aims to evaluate immunotherapy in the third-line setting, a clinical situation in which current standard of care is active symptom control only. Thus, best supportive care has been chosen as the comparator arm in this study.</p><p id="Par41">The landscape of cancer therapy has been recently transformed by the emergence of immunotherapy involving the targeting of immune checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a 55-kDa transmembrane inhibitory immunoreceptor expressed by activated T cells that negatively regulates immune responses required for peripheral self-tolerance. PD-1 interacts with its ligand PD-L1, a member of the <italic>B7</italic> gene family, which is expressed on mesothelioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The expression of PD-L1 (&#x0003e;&#x02009;5% positively stained cells) has been reported in 40% of mesothelioma overall, with a higher rate in sarcomatoid mesotheliomas and is a poor prognostic factor. The PD-1-PD-L1 axis mediates an inhibitory signal to T cells leading to induction of apoptosis via PD-1 activation. Accordingly, PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade de-represses T-cell activation, unleashing a clinical immune response with tumour regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Targeting the PD-1 in mesothelioma has demonstrated promising efficacy. Of 25 patients receiving pembrolizumab in a single-arm phase I/II study (Keynote 28 (KN028)), the objective response rate was 20% in patients with PD-L1-positive malignant pleural mesothelioma (&#x02265;&#x02009;1% PD-L1-positive tumour cells by immunohistochemistry). Additionally, 52% of patients had stable disease, resulting in a disease control rate of 72% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">PD-L1 blockade has also demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with mesothelioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a phase IB study (NCT01772004), 53 patients were treated with avelumab (MSB0010718C, Merck Serono), with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable mesothelioma (pleural or peritoneal) that progressed after a prior platinum-pemetrexed-containing regimen or a platinum-based regimen followed by pemetrexed. Avelumab was administered at a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg as a 1-h infusion every two weeks (q2w) until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criteria for withdrawal occurred. Patients had received a median of 1.5 prior treatments (range, 0&#x02013;7.4). Histology was epithelial (81.1%), mixed (11.3%) or sarcomatoid (3.8%). Objective responses were observed in 5 (9.4%) patients; all were partial responses (PR) and durable. Stable disease (SD) was observed in 9 additional patients (45%). The overall disease control rate (PR plus SD) was 56.6% (30 patients). Median progression-free survival (PFS) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) was 17.1&#x000a0;weeks (95% CI 6.1&#x02013;30.1), and the PFS rate at 24&#x000a0;weeks was 38.4% (95% CI 23.3, 53.4).</p><p id="Par44">Nivolumab is a human IgG4 anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody which blocks the PD-1 receptor on activated T cells, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma unresponsive to other drugs, and relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer, recurrent renal cancer and lymphoma. In a phase IIA clinical trial of nivolumab (3&#x000a0;mg/kg every two weeks (q2w) conducted at NKI, Amsterdam, the disease control rate at 12&#x000a0;weeks was 50% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">In summary, there is a need to find effective, safe, cost-effective interventions for individuals with mesothelioma.

Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to obtain estimates of joint uncertainty over mean costs and QALYs, which will be represented by a scatterplot on the cost-effectiveness plane, and as a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), showing the probability that nivolumab is cost-effective as a function of willingness to pay per QALY (the cost-effectiveness &#x02018;threshold&#x02019;).

Despite a significant number of clinical studies in the second-line setting, no randomised study to date has been positive.</p><p id="Par110">The James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership, funded by the National Institute for Health Research, has identified immunotherapy as the number-one UK research priority. To date there have been no placebo-controlled randomised trials for mesothelioma using PD-L1 or PD-1 checkpoint inhibition. Early promising signals of activity relating to both PD-L1- and PD-1-targeted treatment in mesothelioma implicate a dependency of mesothelioma on this immune checkpoint, and support the development of a randomised phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab.</p><p id="Par111">PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has revolutionised the treatment of melanoma and is expected to become standard of care in NSCLC. It is being assessed rigorously in numerous other cancer sites, making its evaluation in mesothelioma timely in this trial. CONFIRM is the first-ever placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial of a PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibitor in mesothelioma (relapsed and non-relapsed). The outcome of this trial will provide evidence of the potential benefit of the use of nivolumab in the treatment of relapsed mesothelioma. If found to be clinically effective, safe and cost-effective it is likely to become the new standard of care in the UK. A potential limitation of the trial in the future could be the use of overall survival as the primary endpoint if there is any treatment crossover, as either patients on the placebo have access to immunotherapy outside of the trial or new evidence emerges that patients can be effectively re-challenged with new immunotherapy treatment combination on progression. We are currently seeking funding to add a translational component onto the trial to collect and analyse samples taken at progression to decipher mechanisms that lead to acquired resistance, and that might provide a rationale for new interventions following checkpoint-inhibitor failure. Post-progression immunotherapy (or indeed other active agents such as re-challenge pemetrexed-platinum), either by design or patient access outside of the trial, could bias the overall survival analysis. We are mitigating against this by collecting, and reporting to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, any instances of additional treatment received by patients in each arm, and collecting detailed PFS outcome data, which could be used as an appropriate unbiased endpoint to compare the existing arms should a case be put to the funder to include an additional post-progression randomisation during the life of the trial.</p><p id="Par112">Results will be disseminated to patients and clinical teams through peer-reviewed journal publications and by engaging with specialist organisations, such as Mesothelioma UK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par113">This clinical trial was registered in February 2017 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, ID: NCT03063450 and ISRCTN 79814141).

Recruitment is supported by the research nurses and staff within the NIHR Clinical Research Network Cancer in England and equivalents in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The James Lind Alliance, which brings together clinicians, patients and carers to discuss research priorities, identified the number priority in mesothelioma in December 2014 as &#x02018;UNCERTAINTY: does boosting the immune system (using new agents such as PD-1 or PD-L1) improve response and survival rates for mesothelioma patients?&#x02019;. We thank the patients (and their carers) who have identified the need for this trial, and those who have consented to be recruited into it.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par114">This research was funded by the Stand Up to Cancer campaign for Cancer Research UK (C16728/A21400), supported by Cancer Research UK core funding at the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit and investigator-initiated support from Bristol Myers Squibb (CA 209&#x02013;841) for free drug, labeling and distribution and funding for RECIST reporting. Funders will play no role in the execution, analysis, interpretation of data, or study publication.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par115">Pseudo-anonymised Individual Participant Data (IPD) within the clinical trial dataset will be available for sharing via controlled access by authorised Southampton CTU (SCTU) staff (as delegated to SCTU by the trial sponsor) and anonymised IPD within the clinical trial dataset will be available for sharing via open access after the trial is published. Data access can be requested via a SCTU Data Release application form; detailing the specific requirements and the proposed research, statistical analysis, publication plan and evidence of research group qualifications. Data access requests are reviewed against specific eligibility criteria by the SCTU data custodian and key members of the trial team including a statistician and chief investigator or by an external Independent Review Panel. Decisions about requests are made promptly and usually no more than 3&#x000a0;months after receipt of request. Details of all data requests and their outcomes, with clear rationale for any refusals are made swiftly back to the data requester.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>DF is the chief investigator and conceived the idea of the study.
