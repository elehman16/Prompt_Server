pathology. The current study aimed to review the findings and feasibility of the proposed
office-based diagnostic and operative microhysteroscopy in previously diagnosed wom-
en with unexplained infertility and to evaluate the post-microhysteroscopic pregnancy
outcome in a-year follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective controlled study was conducted between
2006 and 2013. Two hundreds women with unexplained infertility were randomized into
two groups: A. study group including 100 women recruited for office micohysteroscopic
session and B. control group including 100 without the proposed microhysteroscopic
intervention. A malleable fiberoptic 2-mm, 0 and 30 degrees angled hysteroscopy along
with an operative channel for grasping forceps, scissors, or coaxial bipolar electrode
were used for both diagnostic and operative indications. The findings, complications, and
patient tolerance were recorded. A-year follow-up of pregnancy outcome for both groups
was also performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy cases (70%) of patients had a normal uterine cavity. Twenty wom-
en (20%) had endometrial polyps. Other pathology included submucous myomas
in 3 cases (3%), intrauterine adhesions in 3 cases (3%), polypoid endometrium in
3 cases (3%), and bicornuate uterus in one case (1%). The pathological findings
were treated in all patients without complication. Also a-year follow-up of the to-
tal developing cumulative pregnancy rate (CPR) was evaluated in groups A and B
(control). Group A revealed the total CPR of 28.5%, among which 25% in women
without pathology, 40% in women with endometrial polyps, 23% in women with
adhesions, 33% in women with polypoid endometrium, and 21% in those with bi-
cornuate uterus. However, A-year follow-up of spontaneous pregnancy outcome in
group B showed a total CPR of 15%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Women tolerance, safety, and feasibility of simultaneous operative correc-

procedure for uterine cavity exploration. Hysteroscopy
is only recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) when clinical or complementary
exams [ultrasound or hysterosalpingogram
(HSG)] suggest intrauterine abnormality or
after <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF). However, many
gynecologists feel that hysteroscopy is a more accurate
tool because of the high false-positive and
false-negative rates of intrauterine abnormality
with HSG. Therefore, many specialists have used
hysteroscopy as their first-line of routine exam for
infertility patients regardless of guidelines (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Hystero-Salpingo-Contrast-Sonography
(HyCoSy), saline infusion sonography (SIS)
and gel infusion sonography (GIS) are inexpensive
and non-invasive techniques, while they have
been shown to be excellent diagnostic tools to
detect subtle intrauterine abnormalities, but they
are still so many missed diagnosis. Office hysteroscopy
has been increasingly recommended as a
routine procedure in the infertility work-up. It has
become easy to perform in an outpatient setting
without anesthesia. Moreover, it offers direct visualization
and enables specialists to diagnose and to
treat intrauterine pathology during the same office
session (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Although hysteroscopy is generally accepted
as the gold standard in diagnosis and treatment
of uterine cavity pathology, many gynecologist
are reluctant to perform hysteroscopy as an initial
test without a high degree of suspicion for pathology
due to the need for anesthesia in an operating
room setting. Therefore, the advent of smaller diameter
instruments makes office-based operative
hysteroscopy as an ideal first-line procedure and
can efficiently treat infertile patients with uterine
abnormalities in the same setting, thus facilitating
a rapid transition from diagnosis to treatment and
subsequent pregnancy (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study was to review officebased
diagnostic and operative microhysteroscopic
findings and treatment in women with unexplained
infertility to evaluate whether microhysteroscopy
should be recommended to these patients who had
the diagnosis of missed uterine abnormalities and to
evaluate the impact of this proposed office procedure
on subsequent pregnancy outcome for those women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Two hundreds infertile women, previously diagnosed
as unexplained infertility, were recruited for
the study between 2006 and 2013. The participants
were randomized using a computer software into

women who were shortlisted for the studied
office microhysteroscopic procedure and B. control
group including 100 women with unexplained
infertility who were followed up without the proposed
office microhysteroscopic intervention. The

using a malleable 0-degree diagnostic and 30-degrees
operative 2-mm fiberoptic microhysteroscope
(Circon, Germany) with an operative channel
for the use of grasping forceps, scissors, or
coaxial bipolar electrode. Instruments were placed
through the built in operative channel when needed
for treatment of pathology after the diagnostic
portion had been completed. Typically, less than
1 liter of normal saline was used as the distention
media for procedures, except with myomectomies
which occasionally required larger volumes.</p><p>Operative procedures including hysteroscopic
resection of endometrial polyps and submucous
myomas, excision of intrauterine septum and postoperative
management plan for bicornuate uterus
were performed, where another conventional operative
session for bicornuate uterus was arranged
by another team. For those longer cases, fluid balance
was monitored by ancillary staff throughout
the procedure. Diagnostic findings, operative outcomes,
complications, and patient tolerance during
the procedure were noted.</p><p>The coaxial bipolar electrode surgical system
(Versapoint, Gynecare, NJ) was used for myomectomies.
Power settings were from 60 W (desiccation)
to 130 W (cutting). Office microhysteroscopies
were performed during the early postmenstrual
period. Patients received oral premedication with
midazolam (Sigma, Egypt), intramuscular analgesia
with diclofenac (Epico, Egypt), and a paracervical
uterine block with 1% lidocaine (Kahira,
Egypt). Five patients requested conscious sedation
with intravenous fentanyl (Cid, Egypt) and midazolam
in place of the above regimen. All women
were discharged immediately after the procedure,
except those who were discharged after 2 hours
due to prolonged operative indications.</p><p>All patients had a transvaginal ultrasound scanning
performed in the office prior to the procedure
to screen for uterine pathology, including uterine
anomalies and intramural or subserosal myomas,
as well as to assess uterine position. Those patients
with an anteverted uterus had a full bladder at the
time of microhysteroscopy to facilitate placement
of the microhysteroscope.</p><p>Women tolerance during the whole procedure,
pain perception scoring, the need for intraoperative
conscious sedation, an extra postoperative analgesia,
and the duration of the postoperative and
lapse period before discharge were recorded to be
analyzed (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>For a 12-month follow-up period, pregnancy
outcome were evaluated after the office microhysteroscopic
procedure in A and B groups, for spontaneous
pregnancy without any intervention, while
each pregnancy developed after the microhysteroscopic
procedure was correlated to each uterine
abnormality diagnosed and treated during the
microhysteroscopic procedure. Early pregnancy
complications were evaluated for both groups, and
some of the successful ongoing pregnancies were
recorded as well.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Chi-square test and students&#x02019; t test were used to
analyze different sub-groups. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression were applied in order
to identify factors that could predict the presence
of unsuspected uterine cavity abnormalities. A
P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
statistical analyses were performed in SPSS version
15.1 (SPSS Inc., IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the different demographic characteristics

of septi was performed in patients with a
known single fundus confirmed by laparoscopy at
a prior time. No procedures were aborted secondary
to patient intolerance.</p><p>Abnormalities included the followings: i. Atypical
polypoid adenomyoma of endometrium in 3
cases (3%), ii. Intrauterin adhesion (IUA) synechiae
in 3 cases (3% of all microhysteroscopies), iii.
A case with uterus bicornis (1% of all microhysteroscopies),

polyps in 20 cases (20% of all microhysteroscopies)
and viii. unique in 10 cases (10% of all

corporeal (14 cases) or cornual (6 cases). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> shows the degree of patient compliance of the
women included for the studied office microhysteroscopic
procedure without general anesthesia.
Most women accepted the procedure with a good
degree of compliance, and none of the procedures
was aborted due to the patient non-compliance.</p><p>The microhysteroscopic images were quite
similar to those following the conventional 5-mm
hysteroscopy, and might be better. Normal microhysteroscopic
image appears as a regular cavity
with reddish glistening endometrial lining with
both ostial openings seen as black spots at 2 and
10 o&#x02019;clock of the uterine cavity. Endometrial
polyps and polypoid endometrium could be easily
diagnosed, although mostly available together.
Intrauterine adhesions could also diagnosed with
a change of the reddish glistening soft endometrium
to become rough non-glistening with areas
of whitish myomas. Submucosal myomas could be
diagnosed with the raised endometrial lining.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the cumulative pregnancy rate
during the postoperative one-year follow-up, following
the office microhysteroscopic procedure,
appears to be 25% in women without pathology
(spontaneous pregnancies without interventions),
40% for endometrial polyps, 35% for adhesions,
33% for polypoid endometrium, and 22% for bicornuate
uterus. The average total ongoing pregnancy
rate is 25% after office microhysteroscopic
procedure in group A versus 15% in group B. In
group A, the best pregnancy rate belonged to after
treated endometrial polyps and worst rate belong
to the abnormal uterine configuration in uterus bicornis
(0%). The total miscarriage rate is not significantly
different in developing pregnancies after

HSG to evaluate the uterine cavity and tubal patency.
However, HSG does not allow for simultaneous
correction of uterine pathology. Moreover
HSG may miss 35% of uterine abnormalities. The
high false-negative rate, the low-positive predictive
value, and the inability to treat abnormal findings
concurrently with the diagnosis have limited
the use of HSG to assess the endometrial cavity
(<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Sonohysterography (SHG) has been proposed as
a better diagnostic test of the uterine cavity. However,
it also suffers from a sensitivity and specificity
inferior to that of hysteroscopy in most studies.
Additionally, it does not allow for correction of
presumed pathology. Perhaps because hysteroscopy
has traditionally required general anesthesia
in an operating room setting, physicians do not
consider hysteroscopy as a first-line test. Additionally,
distention media are typically composed of
low osmolality and electrolyte-free for operative
work, and thus require careful surveillance of fluid
status to minimize complications of hyponatremia
and fluid overload. These requirements have made
many practitioners reluctant to perform operative
hysteroscopy (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Patient tolerance of hysteroscopes 2-5-mm allows
for their use in an office setting where anesthesia
is not required. Additionally, office hysteroscopy
is no more costly than HSG at many
institutions. Moreover using newly advanced microhysteroscope
favors it over other tools. The
professional fees for performing and reading a
hysterosalpingogram (HSG) are 30% higher than
the cost of an office hysteroscopy. Although SHG
may offer a cost reduction, for many patients in
whom pathology is found or suspected, a hysteroscopy
is then indicated adding expense, delay, and
inconvenience (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that up to 20-50% of infertile
patients have uterine abnormalities (30% in
this study), including myomas, polyps, intrauterine
adhesions, and uterine malformations. This
is in agreement with our study that found 30%
of patients undergoing office micohysteroscopy
had uterine pathology. The high incidence of endometrial
polyps in some patients may be related
to prior therapy with gonadotropins due to higher
levels of estrogen. Because pathology is present in
20 to 50% of infertile patients, as mentioned previously,
practitioners should be more inclined to
recommend hysteroscopy as part of the infertility
work-up in conjunction with the routine laparoscopy
and dye test, due to its simultaneous operative
management (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Outpatient hysteroscopy has been shown to be
easily performed with excellent surgical results in
previous studies. Nagele et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and Vercellini
et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) found comparable success rates of 98%
for performing the procedure. In this study, it was quite possible to perform all diagnostic and operative
procedures in the office setting. Grasping forceps
allow for removal of polyps with the ability
to retain a clean specimen for pathologic confirmation.
Scissors can be introduced for adhesions
and septi. Bipolar electrode allows for removing
submucous myomas. Using the cutting mode is
primarily used for preservation of the delicate endometrium,
minimizing the risk of postoperative
adhesions, whereas the desiccation mode is applied
when specific blood vessels are encountered.</p><p>Using saline as uterine distention medium helps
to minimize medium-related complications. Hyponatremia
and cerebral edema are of a concern
when using hypotonic, electrolyte-free media,
such as glycine or sorbitol. However, fluid overload,
pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure
are likely to occur when an excessive volume
of saline is used, especially if patients have underlying
medical conditions predisposing them to
fluid-related complications.</p><p>Air embolism is also considered as a potential
complication. This could be minimized by avoiding
to place the patients in an exaggerated Trendelenburg
positioning, excessive fluid pressure
overflow, prolonged operative times, dilating the
cervix without instruments sealing air entry, and
purging the tubing of air. Post-procedure complications
like endometritis could be reduced by
pre- and post-treatment with prophylactic antibiotics
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and by avoiding operating on patients
with known active vaginal infections (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Patient
tolerance of the electrosurgical equipment
was excellent, confirming what El Toukhy et al.
(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), Lorusso et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) found in their studies on
outpatient hysteroscopy.</p><p>Office-based operative hysteroscopy has also
been found to be extremely safe. In this study, no
complications occurred, and no patients needed
extended monitoring or laboratory studies for fluid
overload. Typical complications associated with
hysteroscopy may be procedure-related, mediarelated,
or post-procedure-related. Procedure-related
complications, such as uterine perforation;
cervical laceration; and damage to tissues including
bowel, bladder, and vagina, could be almost
minimized using the proposed office malleable
2-mm fiberoptic microhysteroscope, which did
not need any cervical dilatation, passing smoothly
within the undilated cervix. Moreover, the images
produced were nearly similar or almost better than
those after using the conventional 5-mm lens system
hysteroscope, leading to minimal degree of
patient&#x02019;s discomfort.</p><p>An increase in pregnancy rates after performing
office microhysteroscopic procedure might be
attributed to the removal of endometrial polyps,
polypoid endometrium, submucous myomas, or
intrauterine synechiae at the time of microhysteroscopy
that resulted in improving implantation in
this population at risk. However, those pregnancies
developed after microhysteroscopic confirmation
of absence of any intrauterine pathology, the irrigation
of the cavity with saline may have a beneficial
effect on implantation and pregnancy rates in
those women, as suggested in previous studies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The explanation of the highest pregnancy
rate after excisions of polyps and myomas is logic,
but the least pregnancy rate that was observed with
uterus bicollis or acutely arcuate uterus might be
due to the abnormal uterine cavity configuration.
Suspected associated non-mechanical factors with
diagnosed adenmyosis may explain the relatively
lower pregnancy outcome developed after the procedure.</p><p>The higher ongoing pregnancy rate after the
managed polyps, polypoid endomtrium, submucous
myoma, and those after exclusion of any
pathology might confirm the causality of those
abnormalities as the main etiology for embryo implanatation,
either mechanically or biochemical;
however, after confirmation of the integrity of the
endometrium and uterine wall, it is suggested to
keep pregnancy safe beyond 20 weeks gestation.
Regardless of whether these adjunctive benefits are
confirmed by further study, office-based operative
microhysteroscopy is definitely hold a great value
as the gold standard of diagnostic procedures for
uterine cavity abnormalities with the ease, safety,
and efficiency of simultaneous therapeutic correction
of abnormalities.</p><p>The spontaneous pregnancy outcome during the
follow-up of group B was within the reported incidence
before, although it was significantly lower
than those following the microhysteroscopic procedure
in group A. Taking into account, using any
of the assisted reproductive techniques (ART)
might increase this lower pregnancy outcome, but
both groups were followed up without using any
of those techniques, as that might interfere with the final pregnancy outcome. Still this spontaneous
pregnancy outcome in group B was developed
with no surgical intervention; no use of any type of
anesthesia, conscious sedation, or analgesia; and
no application of office procedure that was used
for group A.</p><p>So our findings showed that in infertile population
where office microhysteroscopy is performed
routinely prior to the confirmation of un-explained
cases of delayed conception, a significant percentage
of patients are found to have uterine pathology,
which had been missed to be diagnosed by the
routine fertility work-up performed before. Endometrial
polyps were found most frequently, with
smaller numbers of myomas, adhesions, and septi.
These abnormalities may impair the success of future
treatment cycles, so removal of the pathology
was advised. Patient tolerance and the feasibility
of operative management, simultaneous with diagnosis,
would make the proposed office-based operative
microhysteroscopy in conjunction with/or
after the routine laparoscopy as an ideal first-line
procedure with minimal risk to the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Scheduling the office microhysteroscopy as one
of the routine steps in the fertility work-up program
has become mandatory before the final diagnosis
of unexplained infertility. This technique is
considered not only an ideal gold test to diagnose
many intrauterine abnormalities that are undiagnosed
with other routine tools, but also the significant
improvement in the pregnancy outcome
following the microhysteroscopic procedure, supports
the previously mentioned recommendation.
In addition, it is recommended to conduct future
research works to support this recommendation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors have to thank all colleagues in the Fertility
Care Centre, who have greatly supported the
work and helped a lot to complete the work in time.
Our great thanks for all the couples, who agreed to
share in the work with its both arms, especially those
in group B for their kind patience and compliance to
be followed up for a year without looking for another
management tool, so the centre has freely offered
several tools to achieve the dream of those couples
to have a baby through ART trials. The board of the
University Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department
in the El Minya College of Medicine had financially
covered the costs of this research work. None of the
authors had any previous conflict of interest.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
