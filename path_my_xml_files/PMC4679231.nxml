Walking duration began at 15&#x02009;min for the first 2&#x02009;weeks of the program and progressively increased by 5&#x02009;min biweekly until a total of 40&#x02009;min of walking was accomplished during the final 2&#x02009;weeks of the program. Patients walked at a grade equal to 40% of the final workload from the baseline maximal treadmill test to the point of near-maximal claudication pain, at which point they stopped to relieve their leg pain. Patients then repeated the alternating walking and rest periods until the prescribed total number of minutes of exercise was attained for the training session. During each exercise session, patients wore a step activity monitor on the right ankle to quantify the cadence and time of ambulation. Patients in the supervised program were not given advice or instructions to perform additional exercise away from our research center.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although acute bouts of ischemia during walking increase reactive oxygen species at the end of exercise,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> we have found that chronic levels of habitual ambulatory activity have no influence on oxidative stress and are associated with lower levels of inflammation.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Seven patients completed a home-based exercise rehabilitation program that was designed to be as similar to the supervised exercise program as possible and consisted of 12&#x02009;weeks of intermittent walking to near-maximal claudication pain 3&#x02009;days per week at a self-selected pace. Walking duration began at 20&#x02009;min for the first 2&#x02009;weeks and progressively increased 5&#x02009;min biweekly until a total of 45&#x02009;min of walking was accomplished during the final 2&#x02009;weeks of the program. Exercise sessions were rigorously quantified with a step activity monitor (StepWatch3<sup>&#x02122;</sup>; Orthoinnovations, Inc., Oklahoma City, OK, USA) to accurately record the duration and cadence of ambulation, and an exercise logbook was used to record the walking sessions. During follow-up meetings, patients discussed their progress with an exercise physiologist, were given feedback about the data from the step activity monitor, and were given new instructions on changes in exercise duration.

Light resistance training was performed three times per week, without any walking exercise, using a Pro-Form Fusion 6.0 LX weight system. On entry, the resistance that caused fatigue in various muscle groups after 15 repetitions (15-rep maximum) was established and was reassessed each month. The resistance training phase consisted of performing upper extremity exercises that included the bench press, military press, butterfly, biceps curl, triceps press down, and lat pull-down. Lower extremity exercises included the leg press, leg curl, and leg extension. One set of 15 repetitions was performed for each exercise. If the resistance from the exercise machine could not be lifted, resistance bands were used instead. During each exercise session, patients wore a step activity monitor to quantify the total time of their visit, which served as a measure of the amount of exposure they had with the research staff. Patients were encouraged to walk more on their own, but they did not receive specific recommendations about an exercise program during the study. This approach is similar to advice typically given by clinicians during routine follow-up vascular appointments.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> No other risk factor management, lifestyle modification, or educational programming interventions were provided to any of the patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section11-2050312115575938"><title>Primary outcomes: clot strength (MA) and time to clot formation (R)</title><p>Whole blood samples at rest were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study.

associated with baseline and intervention measures. Overall, at the end of the study, 10 patients demonstrated a decrease in MA (and were considered responders), and 13 patients demonstrated no change or had an increase in MA (and were considered non-responders). There were no differences in the number and percentage of responders in the control and the exercise groups (3 (43%) and 7 (44%), respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.95). Overall, responders and non-responders did not differ significantly in terms of their changes in exercise parameters (data not shown). However, non-responders were more likely to report active smoking at baseline (69%) as compared to responders whose MA value decreased (10%) (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0097).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section19-2050312115575938"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our primary finding was that a 3-month-long exercise program does not have a significant impact on clot strength and time to clot formation when compared to an attention control group of PAD patients with intermittent claudication. Therefore, our results suggest that a low-intensity walking program during 12&#x02009;weeks does not modify overall clot formation, but larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and determine whether a different amount or type of exercise may induce a change in clotting in this patient population.</p><p>Activation of the coagulation system depends on both accelerated clot formation (shorter R) and increased clot strength (higher MA), so we evaluated both parameters. Neither clot strength nor time to clot formation changed after the patients completed a well-characterized and effective exercise program that improved their overall ambulatory function, as expressed by the favorable changes in COT, PWT, 6-min walk total distance, and BASIC total score. Based on the negative results, we may infer that the walking programs performed by patients with PAD improve their walking, but do not affect clot formation per se. Therefore, to change these parameters, a different exercise program or other types of treatment (e.g. medication) may be required.</p><p>Even though other studies have evaluated the impact of exercise on the coagulation cascade,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> this is the first to evaluate changes in quantitative clot formation parameters, in particular clot strength, in PAD patients treated with a closely monitored specific exercise program and evaluated with objective measures of ambulatory function. A previous study in PAD showed that treatment of patients with claudication by supervised exercise did not result in significant improvements on the thrombin&#x02013;antithrombin complex and prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (both markers of thrombin generation).<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Thrombin generation is a measure of pro-thrombotic activity, but it does not evaluate other factors that contribute to the formation of the clot, such as platelets. In this study, we measured clot strength, which is a measure of the end result obtained when the coagulation cascade is activated and induces clot formation with the contribution of platelets. In concordance with the previous study, we did not find any effect of exercise training on clot strength. However, further investigations and larger studies may be needed to determine the impact of exercise training in PAD patients on the different levels of the coagulation system.</p><p>Other factors that affect the coagulation system, such as smoking, may have contributed to our negative results. Smokers are more susceptible to thrombosis due to decreased fibrinolytic activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and they have greater clot strength.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050312115575938" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In our study, responders were less likely to report current smoking; among the 10 individuals demonstrating a reduction in clot strength (responder), 1 was a smoker (10%) compared to 9 of 13 non-responders whose MA was unchanged or increased after the intervention (69%). Even though responders and non-responders did not differ significantly in terms of their changes in exercise parameters, current smoking was significantly associated with MA response. This suggests that the effect of smoking on clot formation could have minimized any positive exercise-mediated changes in clot strength. This possibility should be considered and further investigated.</p><p>Our study has inherent limitations. Since it was an ancillary study to explore the effect of a structured exercise program on clot strength in PAD patients, we had a small sample size. Therefore, our results need to be confirmed in larger studies. Our estimated change scores and their variability may be valuable in future studies to help determine required sample sizes to ensure sufficient statistical power. Despite the small sample size, we demonstrated efficacy for improving ambulation times within the exercise group. There is certainty that the patients in our study followed the exercise program correctly, because patients were closely monitored. Thus, the absence of change in clot formation parameters was not associated with deficiencies in the exercise program or problems with exercise compliance. By design, the attention control group performed light resistance training exercise. This may be considered a study limitation because it may have minimized the chance of detecting differences in changes in clot formation with the exercise group. Another study limitation is that the patients in the exercise group had more severe PAD, as reflected by a worse ABI at baseline. This may be due to more patients in the attention control group having a history of lower extremity revascularization when compared to the exercise group, even though this trend was not statistically significant. Additionally, this study is limited to PAD patients who have intermittent claudication, and may not be generalized to patients with less or more severe disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section20-2050312115575938"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A well-structured, low-intensity walking program during 12&#x02009;weeks improves ambulatory function in PAD patients with intermittent claudication, but does not modify clot strength or time to clot formation.
