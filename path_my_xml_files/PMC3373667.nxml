This study aims to characterize predictors of patient preference for treatment assignment in a RCT comparing two doses of yoga for chronic low back pain (CLBP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In an RCT, 95 patients with CLBP were assigned to once or twice weekly yoga classes. Before randomization, we collected data on sociodemographics, low back pain intensity, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), SF-36, preference for once or twice weekly yoga, and expectations regarding the helpfulness of these treatments. Bivariate analyses using chi-square and student&#x02019;s t-test were used to determine factors associated with preference for twice weekly yoga. We used logistic regression to determine independent predictors of patient preference. Variables considered for a multivariable model had p values less than 0.3 on bivariate analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty patients (31.6%) preferred weekly yoga, 63 patients (66.3%) preferred twice weekly yoga, and two patients had no preference. Compared to patients preferring weekly yoga classes, patients who preferred twice weekly yoga had higher RMDQ scores [15.6 (SD 4.9) vs. 12.4 (SD 5.7), p=0.007] and lower SF-36 physical component scores [35.9 (SD 7.2) vs. 40.8 (SD 7.5), p=0.003]. Patients who preferred twice weekly yoga had greater expectation of helpfulness [9.0 (SD 1.5)] than patients who preferred weekly yoga [7.0 (SD 3.2), p=0.003]. SF-36 physical component score (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84, 0.97) and expectation for weekly classes (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50, 0.91) and twice weekly classes (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.38, 2.90) were independently associated with patient preference for twice weekly yoga after adjusting for education, RMDQ, low back pain intensity, and SF-36 mental component score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Decreased physical health is associated with preference for more frequent yoga classes, and patients who prefer more frequent classes have higher expectations for these treatments.</p></sec></body></article>
