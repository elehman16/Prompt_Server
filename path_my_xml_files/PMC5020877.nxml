Independent predictors for subjective return to usual after surgery included preoperative depression, body mass index and postoperative pain scores.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is of particular interest as it is a common procedure from which patients' propensity to fully recover varies substantially between individuals, even with uncomplicated surgery. Moreover, this procedure does not carry the psychological overlay of cancer or chronic disease which could potentially confound. Consequently, this study seeks to determine whether this biological marker is associated with poorer mood, as well as other important psychosocial outcomes (postoperative fatigue, quality of life and pain perception) after this surgical procedure.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and recovery from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An association with psychological outcome might lead to further studies of prophylactic prevention of depression in those at high risk, therefore potentially improving postoperative outcomes and costs in a proportion of patients (around 20% of people with European ancestry are homozygous for the S allele).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This study therefore sought to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Full ethics committee and governance approval was obtained. We followed the STROBE recommendations for observational studies. We recruited participants by obtaining fully informed consent from consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a District Teaching Hospital. Patients under 18 or over 65&#x02005;years of age were excluded as studies show that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is less likely to have an impact in these age ranges.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Patients were also excluded if they had significant cognitive or psychological impairment, or were unable to read or understand written English. Participation in the study was discontinued if patients underwent conversion to an open operation. Demographic and salient medical information was systematically and prospectively collected.</p><p>To assess the &#x02018;participants&#x02019; 5-HTTLPR genotype, a sample of the participants DNA (genetic material) was collected using buccal swab (with four replicates). Samples were refrigerated and analysed at the Biology Department of the University of York. Two of the four buccal mucosal swab replicates were processed for PCR analysis using well-established procedures for this material. Oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically prime PCR amplification for the region of the serotonin transporter gene promoter, which includes the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> was synthesised and tested for unique amplification of the correct human sequences by determination of the correct size PCR product and by DNA sequencing. Control samples from non-study individuals were characterised for the polymorphism and used as standards for the analysis of the polymorphism in the experimental group. Analysis of the polymorphism in the PCR products was conducted using a multichannel DNA sequencing machine, which automatically recorded the sizes of the DNA onto a computer for transfer into the database of the experimental group. High-level quality assurance procedures ensured correct matching of DNA results with the individuals in the database. Where the two replicates did not yield any result or were indeterminate, the further two replicates were analysed.</p><p>Psychosocial assessments were made at preoperative assessment and during clinic attendance 6&#x02005;weeks after surgery using the following instruments.</p><p>The primary outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) short form<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> routinely used in research.

Surgeons recognise that some patients do not recover well after surgery either psychologically or in terms of prompt return to work and usual activities, despite the fact that the procedure has apparently gone well without significant complications. Most patients are not routinely followed up after such surgery, and there is a general expectation that most patients will be back to normal by 6&#x02005;weeks. However, as this study has demonstrated, the proportion of patients recovering fully within 6&#x02005;weeks may be notably lower than might be expected, with more than one-fifth of patients in employment failing to return to work and less than half of patients reporting that they feel fully recovered. Moreover, poorer recovery is associated with preoperative psychological morbidity, in keeping with the findings of other studies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This highlights a clear need to develop a better understanding of the role of psychosocial factors in patient recovery.</p><p>We found no clear evidence that 5-HTTLPR genotype is associated with risk of low mood or poor recovery after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This may be because this operation is now relatively safe and not perceived as a negative life event. Indeed, the fact that it relieves symptoms will be perceived positively in conjunction with low levels of complications. Alternatively, it could be that psychological support throughout the perioperative period mitigates against postoperative problems (ie, that local surgical teams are already very good at it). It is also possible that the role of 5-HTTLPR in relation to psychological outcomes is minimal<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or that the low numbers of people with SS reduced power. In the candidate gene x environment interaction literature, significant results are reported in 96% of initial studies, but only 27% of replication studies.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We observed a mixture of negative findings and some interesting positive ones, but given the number of statistical tests conducted, we cannot be confident that any represent true associations. It has been suggested that the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with anxiety-related traits.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> While we found that preoperative antidepressant use, preoperative neuroticism scores and postoperative anxiety scores were significantly elevated in the SS group, we found that neither preoperative anxiety nor preoperative or postoperative depression scores were related to genotype. Given the relatively small sample size and the number of statistical tests conducted, these results should be treated with caution.</p><p>Preoperative assessment rarely includes psychological evaluation. With the advent of very simple and effective screening instruments that include either the short form BDI (used here) or the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 2<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> or the nine-item PHQ9<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> depression screening questionnaire, this is now readily possible. The finding that someone is suffering from low mood or depression may be useful information in exploring how symptoms are perceived<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and how this impacts on postoperative outcomes including coping.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It may also help in working out what support is necessary for people undergoing operative procedures, both preoperative and particularly postoperative support. Many patients who have laparoscopic cholecystectomy do not receive routine outpatient follow-up, but a minority of vulnerable patients may benefit significantly from the reassurance that this provides, with some needing referral on for psychological therapy. Sound preoperative psychological assessment and selection of patients for appropriate and differentiated postoperative care may be an area worthy of research for improving outcomes postoperatively, psychologically and in terms of quality of life outcomes. Cost-effectiveness research in this area could be productive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the participants and staff involved in the study.
