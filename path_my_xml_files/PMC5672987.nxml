There are no validated pharmacologic treatments for the core symptoms of ASD. The social, medical, and economic burdens of ASD on families and caregivers are profound. We recently showed in a small clinical trial that sulforaphane (SF) from broccoli sprouts could significantly reduce the behavioral symptoms of ASD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>After we completed the intervention phase of the original trial (2011&#x02013;2013), many caregivers used over-the-counter dietary SF supplements in order to attempt to maintain improvements similar to those noted during the intervention. We periodically followed the progress of study participants through the summer of 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Families of 16 of the 26 subjects who received SF as part of the original study responded to requests for further information. Of these subjects, 6 did not continue taking SF supplements after the study. Nine of the 16 subjects are still taking an SF supplement and a 10th planned to. We present the edited testimonials of their caregivers in this case series.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many parents and caregivers articulated the positive effects of SF, both during the intervention phase and in the ensuing 3 years reported herein. These observations may contribute to understanding ASD and to treatments that may alleviate some of its symptoms.

It was like he was stuck.&#x0201d; Before he was 27 months old, &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; was a typically developing child and was easily able to finish telling his favorite knock-knock joke; but after an illness, his social and behavioral development halted, and he was soon diagnosed with autism (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]). ASD is now estimated to affect 1 in 68 children in the United States by age 8 years,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and it exacts major emotional, financial, and social costs on the families of these children throughout their development, which continue into adulthood.</p><p>There is no cure for ASD, and despite advances in clinical therapies, there are no validated pharmacologic treatments for the core symptoms of ASD. Physicians often prescribe atypical antipsychotics to treat irritability and aggression in persons with autism. Aripiprazole (Abilify&#x000ae;) and risperidone (Risperdal&#x000ae;) are the only 2 medications currently approved in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ASD. However, side effects of these drugs include extrapyramidal symptoms and can pose considerable risks such as dyskinesias (disorders in which involuntary tics and tremors occur), gynecomastia, and fatigue; increased appetite resulting in weight gain and obesity; and increased risk for diabetes. Further, due to CYP2D6 polymorphisms and variations in drug metabolism, predicting the frequency and magnitude of these side effects is difficult.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Sulforaphane (SF; 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate) was isolated by Drs Paul Talalay and Yuesheng Zhang in 1992 at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and has since been studied extensively for its ability to prevent or delay the onset of various forms of cancer. SF is the chemoprotective, anti-inflammatory phytochemical that is prepared from broccoli sprouts<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and has been successfully administered in a number of small clinical studies as diverse as cancer prevention, asthma, pulmonary function, alcohol toxicity, cognitive function, gastric colonization with <italic>Helicobacter</italic>, and ASD. SF-rich dietary supplements started to come on the market soon after our 1997 publication,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and they have proliferated in number and form ever since. There are now supplements rich in SF, many that are rich in <italic>glucoraphanin</italic> (GR; the biogenic precursor of SF), or in GR with <italic>myrosinase</italic> (MYR; the enzyme responsible for converting precursor to active moiety) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2164957X17735826">Figure 1</xref>). Some of these supplements were used by subjects following the intervention phase in our clinical trial of SF in ASD (see below) and in relating their observations, we have herein substituted trade names with the phrase &#x0201c;BSE,&#x0201d; an acronym for <italic>broccoli sprout [or seed] extract</italic>.

The enzyme myrosinase rapidly converts glucosinolates to their cognate isothiocyanates upon mastication of the plant tissue by humans. Myrosinase is found in cruciferous vegetables (eg, broccoli, wasabi, mustard, or radish) and also in human gastrointestinal flora. It is this latter source which is of most critical importance when human beings eat cooked broccoli or other cruciferous vegetables since cooking/heating inactivates myrosinase. The effects of sulforaphane on a variety of biochemical and molecular biomarkers and their clinical and preclinical applications have been recently reviewed<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2164957X17735826-fig1"/></fig></p><p>A potential mechanistic connection between ASD symptoms and SF was identified based upon the widespread observations by families that improvement in ASD symptoms can be associated with a febrile illness in about 35% of patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This had been clinically validated by Curran et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Since SF had been previously shown to trigger a cellular heat shock response,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr13-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> similar to the effects of fever, we felt that there might be an effect of SF on ASD symptoms. Thus, between 2011 and 2013, we conducted a small clinical study (NCT01474993) designed to assess whether SF would reduce or ameliorate the behavioral symptoms that are typical of individuals with ASD.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The published study evaluated behavior in 44 young men with ASD between the ages of 13 and 27 years. In this double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study, 26 participants randomized to SF received a weight-adjusted daily dose for 18 weeks, and 14 participants received a placebo. Behavior was monitored using standardized behavioral metrics as described previously<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>: the caregivers or parents completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the physicians completed the Autism Clinical Global Impression Severity (ACGI-S) and Autism Clinical Global Impression Improvement (ACGI-I) scales before the intervention, at the 4th, 10th, and 18th weeks of intervention, and then 4 weeks after discontinuing SF or placebo.</p><p>Of the 26 participants who were taking SF throughout the study, 17 (65%) improved significantly, most of whom returned to baseline levels 4 weeks after terminating the intervention. None of those on placebo had changed significantly. Individuals randomized to take SF showed improvements in aberrant behavior (measured using the ABC scale) and in social responsiveness (measured using the SRS scale), with a significant decrease in irritability, hyperactivity, and stereotypy. Over the course of the 18-week study, there was a significant increase in communication (as measured by the SRS scale) and an overall improvement on the ACGI-I.</p><p>At the conclusion of this study, many parents or caregivers expressed interest in their sons with ASD continuing to receive BSE. We ultimately suggested a small number of commercial nutritional supplements which we had tested to verify that the retail products had levels of active ingredients (SF or its precursor, GR; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2164957X17735826">Figure 1</xref>) close to that which was specified on their labels. Direct comparisons of these products are complicated by the fact that some contain SF and others contain its more stable but biologically inactive precursor, GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2164957X17735826">Figure 1</xref>). Generally, bioavailability of the GR-rich product averages about 10%, that of GR plus MYR averages about 35%, and for SF-rich BSE it is about 70%, but there is considerable person-to-person variability in bioavailability of any and all of these preparations.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-2164957X17735826"><title>Methods</title><p>As reported by parents and caregivers of ASD participants, taking an SF-rich supplement had resulted in improved social responsiveness and communication and had lessened some ASD symptoms such as irritability and motor stereotypies.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2164957X17735826" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This was consistent with anecdotal evidence that we continue to receive from people in the ASD community who are familiar with our study and have used various SF preparations.

On risperidone, R was unable to sleep and became constipated. On aripiprazole, there were improvements in R&#x02019;s sleep pattern, but as soon as he stopped taking it, he began experiencing motor tics.

My husband and I do feel that Z is a little more verbal, but it is hard to measure that.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>P (A nonverbal young adult)&#x02014;&#x0201c;&#x02026; is in a group home and comes home every other weekend. The first weekend home after he started the study I noted a change. He was calmer, seemed happier, less stressed. His focus was improved. His group home manager had the same comments about P. She has worked with him since he was 6 years old. I can best describe it as he gained a level or two and it covered all areas; the house manager was in total agreement.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x0201c;One of the biggest differences before the study was that he would bite and rip off his shirt. And during the study, he stopped that behavior and it started up again when he was off the sulforaphane. When he was on the sulforaphane, he was more calm and more responsive. M&#x02019;s interactions are more intentional than before.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x0201c;He (T) is still on it [BSE]. It&#x02019;s amazing&#x02026; I don&#x02019;t know what it is.

He did not engage in casual conversation. He did not socialize. His verbal ability was considered &#x02018;low&#x02019; for his age. Within the first month, [after starting study] his teachers noted his speech increasing and his willingness to socialize improving. He began to use articles and prepositions which he had not utilized before&#x02026; He verbally engaged with our family more than ever before. He initiated casual conversation for the first time. He asked how we felt, what we were doing, and if we needed help (none of which he had done before the study). He showed interest in others, outside of himself.&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x0201c;R is now happier, has more control over his body, and overall is a positive child with a great attitude.

In addition to looking for changes in the symptoms of ASD, their collaborators at Johns Hopkins University are evaluating biomarkers in blood samples taken before, during, and after this intervention. They will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which SF brings about changes at the cellular level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec6-2164957X17735826"><title>Discussion</title><p>The effects of SF supplementation appear clear and powerful to many caregivers. Their reports are striking. However, as is usually the case with anecdotal reports, they do not carry the same weight as results from randomized controlled trials or other prospective interventional studies. But, such case histories, chart reviews, and field notes can inspire and instruct formal clinical trials. In this case, they have helped to inspire at least 5 follow-on studies of SF in ASD of which we are aware (NCT02561481, NCT02677051, NCT02909959, NCT02654743, and NCT02879110), and 2 related studies on alleviation of symptoms of schizophrenia (NCT02880462 and NCT02810964).</p><p>Commercial sources of the broccoli phytochemicals GR, MYR, and SF are deliberately not mentioned in this article. There are now a large number of products and manufacturers. These manufacturers recommend usage (their label instructions for taking their products) that would theoretically produce a huge range of doses of active ingredient (about 10-fold) if active ingredient content is truly that which is indicated on the labels. We know that between-individual variation in bioavailability (of a known, standardized dose) is also marked. There is no consensus on the appropriate dose for an enhanced healthspan. To the degree that there is any efficacy for specific medical conditions, one can infer an approximate efficacious dose guided by our studies and those of others, but we do not have reliable data on where this dose lies. Our testing of the few products we ultimately recommended to former participants suggests that they do contain what they say they contain, but there are a great many more which we have not tested. There are also many such products that we have tested which do not contain the levels of GR or SF that they claim to contain.</p><p>The emotional and economic burdens on the families and caregivers of children and adults with ASD are enormous. In many respects, these caregivers are also in the best position to evaluate ASD symptoms. Evaluation scales such as the ABC depend upon parents&#x02019; or teachers&#x02019; observations. Thus, regardless of the fact that any anecdotal evidence elicits disagreements among clinicians over the validity of the observations, it is clear that: (a) ASD cannot be diagnosed as definitively as a fractured leg or an arterial stenosis and (b) if caregivers sense a reduction in symptom intensity, there is direct benefit (to them) that may have intrinsic value. We believe that discussions of the role that nutritional or other &#x0201c;supplements,&#x0201d; such as cruciferous vegetables themselves, or the SF-rich and glucoraphanin-rich supplements, can play in the lives of individuals with ASD, is a worthwhile and necessary conversation to have with caregivers. It is also likely that nutritionally based interventions, with demonstrated clinical efficacy, can also contribute to new knowledge about the underlying metabolic pathways that contribute to ASD. We present these case histories in the hope of learning better ways to treat ASD safely and effectively, and stimulating others to do so, thus enhancing the healthspan of the increasing numbers of children that are diagnosed as they progress through life.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained under Protocol # 2011-P-002221/1 (Partners Human Research Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital), IND #113542 (FDA), and NA_00068112 (Johns Hopkins IRB).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are most grateful to our research subjects, their families, caregivers, and loved ones for their participation in our published study, for continuing to discuss their condition with us, and for sharing their observations.</p></ack><sec id="sec11-2164957X17735826"><title>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Zimmerman and Talalay are named inventors on a patent (#8937050) pertaining to the treatment of ASD with sulforaphane, the rights to which they have assigned to The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec12-2164957X17735826"><title>Funding</title><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Partial funding to enable us to continue with patient follow-up was generously provided by The Brassica Foundation for Chemoprotection Research (Baltimore, MD).</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary material is available for this article online.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2164957X17735826"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Baio</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Braun</surname><given-names>KV</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>
