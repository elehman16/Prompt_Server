The lower prevalence of diarrhea/loose bowels, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, and pain/numbness/tingling in hands/feet observed at week 4 was maintained over time. While there were no significant differences between groups in the prevalence of sad/down/depressed and problems with sex at week 4 or week 48, longitudinal models indicated the switch group had a statistically significantly decreased prevalence in both symptoms from week 4 to week 48.

The success of cART is highly dependent on patient adherence to therapy, which may be influenced by a variety of factors, including regimen complexity and treatment tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Experiencing symptoms related to treatment and/or disease increases the risk for undesirable clinical outcomes, including hospitalization, lower health-related quality of life, and shortened survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Guideline-recommended cART regimens differ not only in complexity (number of prescribed pills, frequency of dosing, food requirements) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but also tolerability. One strategy to improve the complexity of cART is regimen simplification, a change in established effective therapy to reduce pill burden and/or dosing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which may also improve treatment tolerability and adherence because of the unique side effect profile of each antiretroviral medication.</p><p>Switching from a multi-tablet regimen to a single-tablet regimen is one type of regimen simplification, and might be a useful option for virologically suppressed patients on a multi-tablet cART regimen. In addition to simplicity, some newer single-tablet regimens may be better tolerated by patients. Switching to a coformulated single-tablet regimen consisting of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF; Stribild<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, STB) has demonstrated non-inferiority efficacy [HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &#x0003c;50 copies/mL] at week 48 compared with continuation of multi-tablet ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor (PI), FTC, and TDF regimen in virologically suppressed adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The symptom experience of patients switching to EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF compared with the symptom experience of those who continue a multi-tablet RTV-boosted PI regimen has not been determined. This analysis describes changes in patient-reported symptoms over 48&#x000a0;weeks in virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults who simplified therapy to EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF versus those who remained on a multi-tablet RTV-boosted PI, FTC, and TDF regimen, as well as a comparison of patient-reported satisfaction between the two regimens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>Details regarding the study design and patient recruitment have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and are summarized here. STRATEGY-PI (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01475838) was an international, open label, randomized study, which evaluated the efficacy (non-inferiority), safety, and tolerability of switching to the single-tablet regimen STB containing EVG 150&#x000a0;mg, COBI 150&#x000a0;mg, FTC 200&#x000a0;mg, and TDF 300&#x000a0;mg, from a regimen consisting of an RTV-boosted PI, FTC, and TDF (PI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RTV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;FTC/TDF) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected subjects. Between December 12, 2011, and December 20, 2012, 433 participants were randomly assigned (2:1) and dosed; 293 switched to the simplified regimen of STB (switch group) and 140 remained on their baseline PI-containing regimen (no-switch group). After exclusions, 290 and 139 participants, respectively, were analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. Post-baseline study visits occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Participants and investigators were not masked to the treatment allocation in this open-label study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Baseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics</title><p>Demographics (gender, age, race, and ethnicity) and clinical characteristics [serious mental illness, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count, asymptomatic status, years since HIV diagnosis, years since first antiretroviral therapy use, on first antiretroviral regimen, PI used at randomization, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index, and Fibrosis (FIB)-4 score] were collected or calculated. Serious mental illness was defined as a diagnostic history of one or more of the following conditions based on medical chart review: major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other psychosis. The VACS Index was calculated to quantify the overall mortality risk associated with HIV. The VACS Index is a summary score based on age, CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, the FIB-4 score, creatinine, and viral hepatitis C infection to predict all-cause and cause-specific mortality and other outcomes in those living with HIV infection and mortality among those without HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The FIB-4 score is computed using age, platelet, aspartate and alanine transaminase values, and provides an estimate of the degree of liver fibrosis in HIV and hepatitis C virus co-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>At the enrollment visit, study subjects were asked to endorse the reason(s) they chose to enroll in the study. Options included (a) &#x0201c;Desire to simplify your current anti-HIV regimen&#x0201d;; (b) &#x0201c;I am not tolerating the current regimen well because of side effects&#x0201d;; (c) &#x0201c;I am concerned about the long-term side effects of my current anti-HIV regimen&#x0201d;; (d) &#x0201c;I am having trouble taking my current regimen on a regular basis&#x0201d;; and (e) &#x0201c;Other.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>HIV Symptom Index (HIV-SI)</title><p>The dependent variable in this study was the HIV Symptom Index (HIV-SI). The HIV-SI is a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument that assesses the symptom burden of 20 common HIV symptoms associated with HIV treatment or disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The instrument was developed on the basis of literature review and clinical and advisory board feedback, is supported by evidence of good construct validity, and has been considered the gold standard in contemporary HIV symptom research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Patients are asked about their experience with each symptom during the past 4&#x000a0;weeks using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Response options and scores are as follows: (0) &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t have this symptom&#x0201d;; (1) &#x0201c;I have this symptom and it doesn&#x02019;t bother me&#x0201d;; (2) &#x0201c;I have this symptom and it bothers me a little&#x0201d;; (3) &#x0201c;I have this symptom and it bothers me&#x0201d;; (4) &#x0201c;I have this symptom and it bothers me a lot.&#x0201d;</p><p>The 20 symptoms comprising the HIV-SI are fatigue/loss of energy, difficulty sleeping, nervous/anxious, diarrhea/loose bowels, changes in body composition, sad/down/depressed, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, muscle aches/joint pain, problems with sex, trouble remembering, headaches, pain/numbness/tingling in hands/feet, skin problems/rash/itching, cough/trouble breathing, fever/chills/sweats, dizzy/lightheadedness, weight loss/wasting, nausea/vomiting, hair loss/changes, and loss of appetite/food taste.</p><p>Consistent with prior analyses by Edelman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], symptoms were dichotomized into a 0 (not present or no bother) or 1 (bothered 2, 3, or 4) scale for individual presentation in order to provide information about symptoms not only present but bothersome and, thus, clinically relevant to treatment decisions. In addition, the overall bothersome symptom count at baseline was generated by counting the number of individual symptoms scored as bothersome and used as a covariate in regression analyses and longitudinal modeling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Descriptive PRO Measures</title><p>A number of PRO instruments were used to provide descriptive information and also served as covariates in regression and longitudinal analyses. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) from the Short Form 36 (SF-36), an instrument supported by extensive evidence of good psychometric properties in a range of therapeutic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], including HIV-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], were used to describe health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Adherence Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], a validated instrument that correlates significantly with Medication Event Monitoring System caps and pharmacy data, was used to assess patient-reported adherence to their antiretroviral regimen using a linear scale (0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;%) to indicate what proportion of medications was taken in the last 30&#x000a0;days; and the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ), a ten-item instrument with five items assessing general treatment satisfaction and five items assessing treatment ease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], was used and is supported by evidence of good internal consistency and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The status form (HIVTSQs) was used at baseline and asks about &#x0201c;now,&#x0201d; and the change form (HIVTSQc), in which items state &#x0201c;compared to before,&#x0201d; was used at week 4 and week 24. For the HIVTSQs form, the response options are anchored at 6 and 0, and for the HIVTSQc form, answers range from values of 3 to &#x02212;3. The total score ranges from 0 to 60 for the status form at baseline and from &#x02212;30 to 30 for the change form, with higher positive scores indicating more/improved satisfaction and higher negative scores indicating greater dissatisfaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Questionnaires were submitted by 96&#x000a0;% of enrolled patients at baseline and 80&#x000a0;% at week 48, the decline due in part to patients that left the study. Of the questionnaires received, there were roughly 140 items with missing values, of a total of 170,000 records (&#x0003c;0.1&#x000a0;%). As in the analyses completed for the STRATEGY-non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], imputation rules were applied to the HIV-SI data. If multiple responses were provided for a single item, the most severe (maximum) of the responses was used (Justice A., personal communication, July 28, 2014). For single items that were left blank, but with other items completed, the missing value was imputed to &#x0201c;I do not have this symptom,&#x0201d; a score of 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and PROs. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses at week 4 and week 48 were performed to evaluate the relationship of treatment with the probability of experiencing HIV-SI items, with and without covariates. Specifically, HIV-SI symptoms were modeled as binary outcomes using a logistic regression model analysis. Each model included treatment as the independent variable and covariates which were selected from a number of potential demographic, clinical, and descriptive variables that were evaluated for multicollinearity.</p><p>Longitudinal modeling was performed using generalized mixed models to show symptom patterns over each of the seven study visits using data from the HIV-SI. The functional form of the change pattern was assessed visually from the observed prevalence in each group. Linear and quadratic patterns were tested to determine optimal fit, ultimately favoring a linear function. As with the STRATEGY-NNRTI trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the decision was made to model the data from weeks 4 through 48 and include baseline as a covariate. To assess the possibility that the effect of treatment may itself vary over time, the models included an interaction between treatment and time in addition to the indicator of a simple treatment group. Continuous variables were mean centered for ease of interpretation and model fit. The fit of the derived models were compared with a simple unadjusted model that included time and treatment, along with a random intercept to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. The comparison was based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Baseline Characteristics</title><p>Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar in the two treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

In the final models, treatment group (switch vs. no-switch) was the independent variable and covariates included age, sex, race (white vs. non-white), baseline bothersome symptom count, VACS Index score, years since HIV diagnosis, years since first antiretroviral therapy use, baseline PI use, serious mental illness, and baseline MCS and PCS scores. Treatment adherence was not considered a covariate because nearly all participants across groups reported nearly perfect levels of adherence.</p><p>The adjusted logistic regression models show that switching to STB was associated with a lower risk of experiencing five bothersome symptoms (diarrhea/loose bowels, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, pain/numbness/tingling in hands/feet, nervous/anxious, and trouble remembering) at week 4 (see ESM Table&#x000a0;1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material). This association, however, was maintained only for diarrhea/loose bowels at week 48. As indicated in unadjusted and adjusted models, the no-switch group did not have a significantly lower prevalence in any symptom at week 4 or week 48 as compared with the switch group.</p><p>The prevalence of bothersome symptoms over time was evaluated using mixed-effects logistic models adjusted for the same covariates as those specified above. In all instances, the BIC of the multivariate model showed a substantial improvement in fit over the simple unadjusted model with treatment only, suggesting that bothersome symptom prevalence was associated with at least some of the predictors included in the model.</p><p>The adjusted longitudinal models revealed a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of five symptoms (diarrhea/loose bowels, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, pain/numbness/tingling in the hands/feet, sad/down/depressed, and problems with sex) between the switch and no-switch groups over time, all favoring the switch group. A complete table showing the coefficients, including findings for main effects and time by treatment interactions (the effect of time depends on whether the subject was in the switch or no-switch group), is provided in ESM Table&#x000a0;2 in the Electronic Supplementary Material. No covariate was significant in all symptom models; however, the presence of the bothersome symptom at baseline, the HIV-SI symptom count at baseline, and SF-36 MCS score at baseline were significant for most symptom models.

The results indicate that switching to STB was associated with more treatment satisfaction, improvements in a number of patient-reported HIV symptoms that were maintained over 48&#x000a0;weeks, and no differences or changes in health-related quality of life.</p><p>Results of the descriptive analyses showed that diarrhea/loose bowels, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, and pain/numbness/tingling in hands and feet were statistically significantly less prevalent for the switch group at week 4. Adjusted logistic regression results were similar, with the addition of lower prevalence for nervous/anxious and trouble remembering. Of these affected symptoms, the lower prevalence of diarrhea/loose bowels for the switch compared with the no-switch group was maintained over the study period from week 4 to week 48. This was the only symptom with this finding&#x02014;both a maintained advantage over the no-switch group and a significantly lower experience in prevalence throughout measurement periods as compared with baseline.</p><p>Drug-induced gastrointestinal (GI) side effects like diarrhea or loose stool, most commonly associated with the use of PIs like RTV, is a nuisance complication of HIV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The mechanisms for PI-associated GI dysfunction include increased calcium-dependent chloride conductance, cellular apoptosis and necrosis, and decreased proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The findings from the present study, a prominent reduction in GI symptoms&#x02014;primarily diarrhea/loose bowels, but also bloating/pain/gas in stomach&#x02014;are consistent with previous studies of GI symptom prevalence in patients treated with a PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, Lalanne et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found the rates of nausea (27 vs. 13&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.024), diarrhea (40 vs. 25&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.042), and abdominal pain or bloating (40 vs. 13&#x000a0;%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) were greater in PI- than non-PI-treated patients.</p><p>While it was clear that the prevalence of diarrhea/loose bowels was consistently lower among patients switching to STB, there were many symptoms that had similar patterns of prevalence across the two groups and also remained unchanged from baseline. In adjusted models, prevalence rates were essentially parallel over time for fatigue, changes in body, muscle aches/joint pain, skin problems/rash/itching, weight loss/wasting, nausea, and hair loss. The importance of the statistically significant associations found among multiple covariates with these bothersome symptoms (e.g., race, baseline VACS Index, years since HIV diagnosis, and years since first antiretroviral therapy) warrants further investigation and could inform clinicians which patients are more susceptible to certain symptoms.</p><p>A strength of the present study is the use of PRO tools, which can provide insight into patient-reported symptoms that may be underreported by clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, the use of longitudinal modeling allows for a greater understanding of the prevalence of HIV symptoms over time after switching antiretroviral therapy. A limitation of this study is generalizability. The majority of the study population was male and white, and findings, therefore, may not be applicable to women and patients of non-white race. Further, study results are more generalizable to a virologically suppressed patient population than a treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patient population because inclusion criteria stipulated that all patients have viral loads at baseline that were undetectable on therapy. Another limitation of our methodology is the use of imputation for missing items and acceptance of the most severe (maximum) response when multiple responses were provided for a single item. It is possible these methods could result in an inaccurate reflection of the true patient experience. Finally, it is possible that given the open-label design, study findings may be confounded by knowledge of treatment assignment. It is possible that patients in the no-switch group were more aware of their symptoms.</p><p>Research has shown that switching virologically suppressed patients to STB from an NNRTI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;FTC/TDF was associated with a reduced prevalence in HIV symptoms as early as 4&#x000a0;weeks after the switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study demonstrated that switching patients to STB from an RTV-boosted PI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;FTC/TDF regimen was associated with reduced prevalence in five HIV symptoms (diarrhea/loose bowels, bloating/pain/gas in stomach, pain/numbness/tingling in hands/feet, nervous/anxious, and trouble remembering) after 4&#x000a0;weeks, with a sustained decrease in diarrhea/loose bowels over 48&#x000a0;weeks. These benefits are important because PI-associated GI side effects may eventually lead to decreased quality of life and treatment interruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40271_2015_137_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 67 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. Gathe contributed to the acquisition of the data and manuscript preparation.
