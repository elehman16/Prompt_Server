                    comprehensive type I error rate simulations and (2) to discuss issues raised
                    during regulatory review, to facilitate future approval of similar designs.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods</italic></bold> In phase II, an early (24-h) outcome and
                    adaptive sequential procedure selected one of three tenecteplase doses for phase
                    III comparison with rt-PA. Decision rules comparing this dose to rt-PA would
                    cause stopping for futility at phase II end, or continuation to phase III. Phase
                    III incorporated two co-primary hypotheses, allowing for a treatment effect at
                    either end of the trichotomized Rankin scale. Assuming no early termination,
                    four interim analyses and one final analysis of 1908 patients provided an
                    experiment-wise type I error rate of &#x0003c;0.05.</p><p><bold><italic>Results</italic></bold> Over 1,000 distribution scenarios, each
                    involving 40,000 replications, the maximum type I error in phase III was 0.038.
                    Inflation from the dose selection was more than offset by the one-half
                    continuity correction in the test statistics. Inflation from repeated interim
                    analyses was more than offset by the reduction from the clinical stopping rules
                    for futility at the first interim analysis.</p><p><bold><italic>Limitations</italic></bold> Design complexity and evolving
                    regulatory requirements lengthened the review process.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> (1) The design was innovative and
                    efficient. Per protocol, type I error was well controlled for the co-primary
                    phase III hypothesis tests, and experiment-wise. (2a) Time must be allowed for
                    communications with regulatory reviewers from first design stages. (2b) Adequate
                    type I error control must be demonstrated. (2c) Greater clarity is needed on (i)
                    whether this includes demonstration of type I error control if the protocol is
                    violated and (ii) whether simulations of type I error control are acceptable.
                    (2d) Regulatory agency concerns that protocols for futility stopping may not be
                    followed may be allayed by submitting interim analysis results to them as these
                    analyses occur.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1740774511410582"><title>Introduction</title><p>The TNK-S2B trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774511410582">1</xref>] was
                an innovative, multi-center, double blind, randomized, seamless phase II/III study
                of intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) <italic>versus</italic> standard-dose intravenous
                alteplase (rt-PA at 0.9 mg/kg) for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke
                within 3 h of onset. A key motivating factor for development of tenecteplase was to
                produce a molecular variant of rt-PA that would reduce the risk of symptomatic
                intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) while retaining clinical efficacy. The phase II
                component employed an adaptive sequential dose selection procedure to choose a
                preferred dose of tenecteplase, using an early (24 h) assessment of <italic>major
                    neurological improvement</italic> (MNI) balanced against occurrence of
                symptomatic ICH. Once a preferred tenecteplase dose was established, it was moved
                forward in the phase III component to compare with standard-dose rt-PA. Decision
                rules comparing the selected tenecteplase dose and rt-PA on safety and efficacy
                outcomes were devised to yield a clear recommendation to either stop the trial for
                futility at the end of phase II, or continue into phase III. The trial was
                prematurely terminated for slow enrollment after 112 patients had been randomized at
                8 clinical centers between 2006 and 2008. At that point, the proposal to include
                patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the trial in the phase III analysis had
                not received regulatory approval because of concerns regarding control of the type I
                error rate.</p><p>Although the trial results were insufficient to establish promise or futility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774511410582">1</xref>], its novel adaptive
                design, with substantial provision for the control of type I error, is nevertheless
                of interest, given current discussion of draft FDA guidelines on adaptive designs
                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774511410582">2</xref>]. This article has
                two goals. The first is to review the key design features of the trial, and the
                design and results of its comprehensive type I error rate simulation studies. The
                second is to discuss issues raised during the regulatory review of the design, which
                focused on the type I error simulations, and their implications for gaining approval
                for use of this type of adaptive design in the future.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1740774511410582"><title>The TNK-S2B Design</title><p>The TNK-S2B trial incorporated three main design features: (1) a <italic>sequential
                    selection procedure</italic> for choosing one tenecteplase dose from among three
                candidate doses (0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 mg/kg), by the <italic>sequential
                    elimination</italic> of inferior dose arms, potentially leading to a dose
                selection decision at an early stage of phase II; (2) at the end of phase II, a
                    <italic>preliminary comparison of the clinical efficacy and safety
                    endpoints</italic> from patients treated with the selected dose of tenecteplase
                to those from patients treated with rt-PA, to determine promise or futility for
                continuing into phase III; and (3) if the results were promising, continuation of
                the study, with additional clinical sites, to compare the selected dose of
                tenecteplase with rt-PA in phase III, treating the decisions at the end of phase II
                as the first interim analysis of phase III. We provide details about each of these
                features.</p><sec id="sec3-1740774511410582"><title>Sequential selection procedure for the best dose of tenecteplase</title><p>The selection procedure was a truncated Levin-Robbins sequential elimination
                    procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774511410582">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774511410582">4</xref>] based on a
                    rapid-response, ordered trichotomous outcome determined within 24 h of
                    randomization. The best category was MNI, defined as a &#x02265;8-point improvement from
                    baseline on the NIH Stroke Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774511410582">5</xref>] or a score of 0 at 24 h after stroke
                    onset. The worst category was symptomatic ICH within 24 h of stroke onset. The
                    intermediate category was <italic>neither</italic> MNI nor ICH (NEI). Patients
                    were randomized in permuted blocks of size 4 matched by clinical site
                    (quadruplets) to rt-PA or one of the three doses of tenecteplase. Although
                    patients were also randomized concurrently to rt-PA to preserve the blinding and
                    to eliminate other possible temporal biases, only the tenecteplase arms were
                    involved in the selection procedure. Once a rapid response was obtained from
                    each of the three patients assigned to the tenecteplase doses in a matched
                    quadruplet, their data were entered into an ongoing <italic>sequential
                        cumulative sum scoring system</italic>. This added the value 2 to the
                    cumulative sum for any dose arm for a rapid-response outcome of MNI, the value 1
                    for a rapid-response outcome of NEI, and the value 0 for a rapid-response
                    outcome of ICH. The first time the cumulative sum for any arm(s) with the
                        <italic>largest</italic> sum was (were) <italic>6 points ahead</italic> of
                    the cumulative sum for any arm(s) with the <italic>smallest</italic> sum, the
                    arm(s) with the smallest sum was (were) to be <italic>eliminated</italic> from
                    the study, meaning that those arms were no longer to be considered candidates
                    for selection and patients were no longer to be randomized to those arms. If one
                    dose arm was eliminated at this time, patients were to be randomized to the
                    remaining arms (and to rt-PA), and the procedure was to proceed with their
                    corresponding cumulative sums continued at their current tallies, until a second
                    and final arm was eliminated. Once the second arm had been eliminated, the
                    procedure was to terminate and the remaining arm was to be selected as the
                    preferred dose of tenecteplase. If initially two arms were eliminated
                    simultaneously, the procedure was to terminate then and select the remaining arm
                    as the preferred dose of tenecteplase. If dose selection occurred after complete
                    observation of the rapid responses from fewer than 100 tenecteplase-matched
                    sets, randomization continued to either the selected dose of tenecteplase or
                    rt-PA until a total of 100 patients on each treatment had been randomized, at
                    which time the clinical assessment for promise or futility was to be conducted.
                    If the dose selection occurred after complete observation of the rapid responses
                    from between 100 and 150 tenecteplase-matched sets, randomization was to stop
                    and the clinical assessment for promise or futility was to take place then. If
                    no dose selection had yet occurred after complete observation of the rapid
                    responses from 150 tenecteplase-matched sets, the procedure was to be truncated,
                    i.e., randomization would stop, and the dose selection was to be completed in
                    conjunction with the clinical assessment for promise or futility as described
                    below. The selection criterion of a lead of 6 was chosen to achieve a
                        <italic>probability of correct selection</italic> of &#x02265;0.8 under the design
                    alternative probabilities of 0.31, 0.21, and 0.21 for the rapid-response outcome
                    of MNI for the three tenecteplase doses, assuming a common probability of ICH of
                    0.06 for each dose. A phase I pilot study of tenecteplase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774511410582">6</xref>] had shown substantially larger
                    differences in the proportion of subjects with MNI between tenecteplase doses:
                    36% of subjects given 0.1 mg/kg had MNI compared with 16% of subjects given 0.4
                    mg/kg. The literature also showed that ICH rates of approximately 6% are typical
                    with rt-PA administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774511410582">7</xref>]. The truncation point was selected small enough to achieve a
                    feasible maximum recruitment, yet sufficiently large to preserve the probability
                    of correct selection.</p><p>The operating characteristics of the selection procedure were estimated by
                    simulation based on 100,000 replications for each scheme, and are presented in
                        <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774511410582">Table 1</xref>.
                        <italic>P</italic>[cs] refers to the probability of correct selection, i.e.
                    reaching a final elimination by the stated criterion with a correct selection of
                    the best dose at or before the 150th matched set. The value for
                        <italic>P</italic>[cs] does not include any correct selections that might
                    also occur at truncation time by clinical decision criteria should a final
                    winner not be declared by 150 matched sets.

                    refers to the expected time of first elimination or 150 triplets,
                    whichever occurs first. This gives the average number of matched triplets until
                    the earlier of the first dose elimination or the end of the phase II trial;
                    multiplying by 3 gives the number of patients randomized to this point in the
                    procedure. <italic>E</italic>[min(<italic>N</italic>,<italic>m</italic>)] refers
                    to the expected time of final elimination or 150 matched sets, whichever occurs
                    first. This gives the average number of matched sets until a dose is selected or
                    150 matched sets have been randomized, whichever occurs first. One cannot
                    multiply this number by 3 to get the total number of patients in the selection
                    phase because of the possibility of early elimination of a dose. We therefore
                    provide another operating characteristic,
                    <italic>E</italic>[<italic>T</italic>], the expected total number of patients
                    randomized in the selection phase. Also, provided are the median and modal
                    numbers of matched sets (approximate to the nearest integer). Finally,
                        <italic>P</italic>[no winner] refers to the probability that truncation time
                    will arrive without achievement of the stated criterion for a final dose
                    selection. In symbols, <italic>P</italic>[no

                    patients were to be randomized in phase III to the selected dose of tenecteplase
                    or rt-PA (954 per group, including the patients studied in these two arms during
                    phase II). The primary endpoint for phase III was the trichotomized Rankin
                    score. Two co-primary null hypotheses were to be tested in phase III: (1) The
                    proportion of <italic>poor</italic> outcomes with tenecteplase at the selected
                    dose did not differ from the proportion of poor outcomes with rt-PA. (2) The

                    dose did not differ from the proportion of good outcomes with rt-PA. Each
                    hypothesis was to be tested using the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel score test, stratified by
                    site, with 1/2-continuity correction. The two hypotheses were to be tested at

                    0.05. The planned sample size of 1,908 (954 per group) would provide 90% power
                    to detect a &#x02265;8% reduction in poor outcome without a reduction in good outcome,
                    or 89% power to detect an 8% increase in good outcome without an increase in
                    poor outcome.</p><p>We formulated the two co-primary hypotheses to allow for a treatment effect at
                    either end of the Rankin scale. This also facilitated identifying the &#x02018;win/lose&#x02019;
                    situations for tenecteplase, as required by regulatory reviewers. For example,
                    if tenecteplase were no better than a placebo, it would reduce the proportion of
                    poor outcomes due to ICH, although it would also have poor efficacy compared to
                    rt-PA. This would not be a &#x02018;win&#x02019; situation.</p><p>The phase III trial was to incorporate four formal interim analyses and one final
                    analysis. The first interim analysis was to take place at the end of phase II
                    after enrollment of between 200 and 300 patients in the two phase III arms
                    (between 100 and 150 patients per arm, and not counting the other arms used in
                    the selection stage). The second, third, and fourth interim analyses were to
                    take place after follow-up was completed for a total of 500, 1,000, and 1,500
                    patients, respectively. The terminal analysis was to take place after a total of

                    particularly when, as here, phase II involves a selection procedure rather than

                        of the trial does not compare each competing dose of tenecteplase with
                        rt-PA; it performs <italic>only one</italic> hypothesis test of the selected
                        dose of tenecteplase <italic>versus</italic> rt-PA (for each of the two
                        co-primary endpoints). The inferior tenecteplase doses are eliminated in
                        phase II by a selection procedure, not a hypothesis test against rt-PA;
                        moreover, the selection procedure uses an outcome different from (although
                        correlated with) that in phase III. Thus, although the hypothesis tested in
                        phase III is determined by the selection procedure, there is only one
                        hypothesis test for each co-primary endpoint. Since no more than a single
                        type I error can be committed, the need for adjustment for multiple testing
                        does not arise.</p></sec><sec id="sec7-1740774511410582"><title>Selection bias</title><p>The selection procedure does slightly inflate the type I error rate. However,
                        we show in a fixed sample size simulation study (see below, and the
                        Appendix) that without stopping for futility or efficacy in interim
                        monitoring, this inflation is more than compensated for by the
                        1/2-continuity correction&#x02019;s reduction in the type I error rate. We also show
                        below, in a group sequential study, that the clinical criteria for futility
                        stopping even with interim monitoring reduce the type I error rate further
                        below nominal levels. Given this, no correction for selection bias resulting
                        from the selection procedure is necessary.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec8-1740774511410582"><title>Design of the type I error rate simulation studies</title><p>Given the complex design of TNK-S2B, simulation studies were required to demonstrate
                that the statistical analysis plan specified above does in fact control the type I
                error rate for the phase III trial at or below nominal levels. We conducted two such
                studies. One, the Group Sequential (GS) study, is presented here. A second, the
                Fixed Sample Size (FSS) study, is included as an Appendix. As argued above, there
                was only one hypothesis test contemplated from the beginning of phase II to the end
                of phase III, that of the selected tenecteplase dose <italic>versus</italic> rt-PA,
                and hence the type I error rate we refer to here is indeed an unconditional,
                experiment-wise error rate and not conditioned on the identity of the dose
                selected.</p><p>The FSS study considers a simplified version of the TNK-S2B trial design in which
                dose selection is possible; there is no examination of clinical outcome data for
                promise or futility; and the trial proceeds to a single final analysis with a total
                of 1,908 patients, 954 in the selected tenecteplase arm and 954 in the rt-PA arm,
                with no stopping for futility or for strong showing of interim efficacy. Its purpose
                is to highlight the simultaneous effects of the dose selection from stage 1 and the
                1/2-continuity correction, which would otherwise be dominated by the larger effect
                of the examination for promise or futility and the effect of interim monitoring. See
                Appendix for details.</p><sec id="sec9-1740774511410582"><title>The GS simulation study</title><p>The purpose of the GS study is to simulate the full TNK-S2B trial, including the
                    dose selection, examination for promise or futility, and phase III interim
                    monitoring features, to estimate their combined impact on the type I error
                    rates. All replications of the GS study are used in the estimation of the error
                    rates. Note that according to the design, if the actual trial stopped at the end
                    of phase II for futility because a selected dose lacked promise, or if there was
                    a failure to select a tenecteplase dose because all competing doses lacked
                    promise at truncation time, there would be no phase III trial and hence no
                    declaration of significance and no type I errors under the null hypothesis
                    (unless a dose had a significantly different probability of poor or good outcome
                    compared to rt-PA at the 0.001 level). Thus, in the GS study, if a particular
                    simulation under a given null hypothesis scheme stops for futility because a
                    selected dose lacks promise (without attaining statistical significance at the
                    two-tailed 0.001 level for either endpoint), we count the simulation as
                    contributing no type I error. If the simulation results in a failure to select a

                    we choose one dose at random to test for statistical significance at the
                    two-tailed 0.001 level for both poor and good outcomes, after which the
                    simulated trial stops. On the other hand, if at any interim analysis the
                    two-tailed 0.001 significance level is attained for either poor or good clinical
                    outcome, or at the terminal analysis the two-tailed 0.025 significance level is
                    attained for either poor or good clinical outcome, we count the simulation as
                    contributing at least one type I error.</p><p>Each simulation study used 40,000 replications under each of 1000 different null

                    would have type I error rates almost identical to that of a simple comparison of
                    pooled proportions, because in this trial the site-stratified randomization
                    procedure rendered the stratification factor orthogonal to the treatment
                    assignment under the null hypothesis. Therefore, for feasibility of the present
                    type I error rate studies, we used only the pooled <italic>z</italic>-score test
                    for the equality of two proportions with 1/2-continuity correction for each
                    primary hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-1740774511410582"><title>Specification of distribution schemes</title><p>The simulation of both rapid-response outcomes and 3-month Rankin outcomes
                    requires specification of the joint distribution of two trichotomous random
                    variables, i.e., a 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 table of joint probabilities, for each treatment arm.
                    We call such a set of four 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 tables a <italic>distribution scheme</italic>;
                    1000 different distribution schemes were used in the simulation studies.
                    Generation of these distribution schemes is described in detail in the Appendix.
                    In the simulation studies, our goal was to produce a set of distributions that
                    would cover a portion of the parameter space that was of direct clinical
                    interest to the TNK-S2B trial, and that the portion covered was sufficiently
                    broad as to represent type I error rates accurately over the entire theoretical
                    parameter space. Let the three-category rapid response be denoted by
                        <italic>X</italic>, taking values of 0 for ICH, 1 for neither MNI nor ICH,
                    and 2 for MNI. Let the trichotomized 3-month Rankin scale for the clinical
                    outcome be denoted by <italic>Y</italic>, taking values of 0 for poor outcome, 1
                    for neither poor nor good outcome, and 2 for good outcome. Let the doses of
                    tenecteplase be labeled A, B, and C, corresponding to 0.1, 0.25, and 0.40 mg/kg,
                    respectively, and let dose D refer to rt-PA. Let <italic>T</italic> denote any
                    of these four treatment arms. It is most convenient to determine the joint
                    distribution of (<italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>) by first specifying
                        <italic>P</italic>[<italic>X</italic>|<italic>T</italic>], and then
                    specifying <italic>P</italic>[<italic>Y</italic>|<italic>X</italic>,
                        <italic>T</italic>]. Once these three-component vectors of probabilities are
                    determined, random realizations of the pair (<italic>X</italic>,
                        <italic>Y</italic>) can be produced by generating a trinomial response
                        <italic>X</italic> following
                        <italic>P</italic>[<italic>X</italic>|<italic>T</italic>], and then by
                    generating another trinomial response <italic>Y</italic> following
                        <italic>P</italic>[<italic>Y</italic>|<italic>X</italic>,
                    <italic>T</italic>]. In the simulation studies, 10 different marginal
                    conditional distributions for <italic>X</italic> given T were selected at random
                    in a manner described in the Appendix; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774511410582">Figure 2(a)</xref> for visualizing these
                    distributions. For each one of these, 10 different marginal distributions for
                        <italic>Y</italic> given <italic>T</italic> (identical for each
                        <italic>T</italic> under the null hypotheses) were generated randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774511410582">Figure 2(b)</xref>); and for each

                        <italic>Y</italic> given <italic>X</italic> and <italic>T</italic> were

                selection and repeated looks at the data in interim analyses is more than offset by
                the reduction in the type I error rate caused by implementing the clinical stopping
                rules for futility at the first interim analysis. In the GS study, selection in the
                phase II component somewhat elevates the probability of declaring the selected dose
                of tenecteplase significantly better than rt-PA with respect to poor outcome, while
                it simultaneously decreases somewhat the probability of declaring the selected dose
                of tenecteplase significantly worse than rt-PA. The average type I error rate in the
                former tail was 0.0069 while that in the latter tail was 0.0022. Analogous results
                were obtained for good outcome. The average type I error rate for declaring the

                dose of tenecteplase significantly worse than rt-PA was 0.0027. Note how the
                asymmetrical allocations of type I error counterbalance each other, such that the
                sum of the error rates in the two tails are within nominal levels. It is entirely
                acceptable for a two-tailed test to employ an asymmetrical allocation of total type
                I error in the two tails, so long as the total type I error rate is within nominal
                levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774511410582">10</xref>]. Similar

                to test tenecteplase <italic>versus</italic> standard-dose rt-PA in the treatment of
                patients with acute ischemic stroke within 3 h of onset. For the phase II part of
                the trial, we chose an adaptive sequential dose selection procedure that employed a
                rapid assessment of MNI at 24 h balanced against occurrence of symptomatic ICH to
                choose among three different doses of tenecteplase.</p><p>Regulatory reviewers questioned three aspects of the control of the type I error
                rate. The first concerned whether or not multiple comparisons techniques were
                required given that the trial began with three doses of tenecteplase, and whether or
                not an adjustment for selection effects was needed. We have addressed those concerns
                above.</p><p>Reviewers were further concerned that the type I error rate would not be controlled
                under schemes which would not occur under the protocol, e.g., if the trial were
                continued into phase III absent clinical criteria for promising efficacy. We
                understand the concern, in that noncompliance with prespecified protocols is a major
                problem when it occurs, as it often has. However, this would have been in violation
                of the clearly specified trial protocol, which stated the futility stopping
                requirements as <italic>rules</italic> rather than <italic>guidelines</italic>. It
                has been accepted in the ongoing dialog between researchers and regulators that
                adaptive designs must be prespecified rather than <italic>ad hoc</italic>. This
                presupposes and requires respect for the prespecified protocol, under which the type
                I error rate is computed. Ultimately, one cannot assure type I error control under
                arbitrary protocol violations. This applies with equal force to traditional as well
                as adaptive trial designs.</p><p>Finally, a reviewer was doubtful whether any amount of simulations could demonstrate
                adequate control of the type I error rate. However, simulations are recognized under
                the FDA draft guidance document [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774511410582">2</xref>], and given the coverage of the parameter space in ours, it seemed to
                us unreasonable to sustain such doubt. Clarification is needed whether control of
                the error rate must be demonstrated by theorems or can be demonstrated by
                simulation. In addition, a sensitive reviewer of this article suggested that the
                regulatory agency&#x02019;s concern might be allayed by a commitment from the trial
                investigators to submit interim analysis results to it as these analyses occur. This
                proposal merits consideration.</p><p>In summary, the TNK-S2B trial design, while complex, was innovative and efficient.
                Its statistical analysis plan had great integrity. Under the protocol, it would have
                controlled the unconditional type I error rate below the nominal 0.05 level for the
                two primary hypothesis tests in phase III, and experiment-wise. The trial provides
                several lessons for adaptive designs. (a) Time must be allowed for iterative
                communications with regulatory reviewers from the first stages of the design and
                planning process, as the recent FDA draft guidance document stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774511410582">2</xref>]. (b) Type I error control
                must be clearly demonstrated. (c) Greater clarity is needed on whether this includes
                demonstration that type I error control will be maintained if the protocol is
                violated, and on whether or not simulations are an acceptable form of demonstration.
                (d) Regulatory agency concerns that the protocol for futility stopping may not be
                followed may be allayed by a commitment to submit all interim analysis results to
                the regulatory agency as these analyses occur. Future trials with similar potential
                to TNK-S2B will have a greater probability of success if these issues can be
                successfully addressed.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec13-1740774511410582"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by grants (R01-NS37666 and R01-NS45170) from the National
