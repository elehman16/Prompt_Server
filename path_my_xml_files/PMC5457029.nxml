Oesophagitis reversal was also comparatively better in group 1 patients. The response to omeprazole alone was lower than those reported in other studies.</p><p>The superiority of omeprazole combined with domperidone as compared with omeprazole alone was proven in a study by Suzanna; the improvement in frequency scale for symptoms of GERD score was higher in a combined group than in omeprazole alone (7.5 &#x000b1; 5.9 vs 4.6 &#x000b1; 3.3; <italic>P</italic> = .02).<xref rid="b10-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In a prospective study, no statistically significant difference was observed in symptomatic responses (69.7% in pantoprazole group vs 89.2% in combined therapy; <italic>P</italic> = .11).

In erosive esophagitis, endoscopic healing of esophagitis occurred equally with either regimen (54.5% vs 70.5% in combined therapy; <italic>P</italic> = .44).<xref rid="b22-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Mosapride addition to pantoprazole conferred a therapeutic benefit in patients with erosive GERD. This could not be compared in our study as we have not done subgroup analysis and enrolled patients belonged to LA grades A and B. Nevertheless, combination therapy led to a greater therapeutic benefit in our study.</p><p>On the contrary, in a retrospective meta-analysis, no added advantage of prokinetic to a PPI was found in terms of symptomatic relief or mucosal healing; however, the combined therapy suggested improved patient&#x02019;s reported symptom score and quality of life.<xref rid="b6-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>To corroborate our finding, further large-scale, randomized controlled trials on prokinetic-PPI combination therapy are warranted.</p><p>Omeprazole used in our study is a good choice; various PPIs used for GERD treatment are comparable regarding symptom relief and overall healing.</p><p>Our study demonstrated a relatively higher usage of antacids drugs when omeprazole was administered alone.</p><p>In 2014, the European Medicines Agency&#x02019;s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has recommended use of domperidone-containing medicines to relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting and reduce dose and duration of treatment as key to minimize its risks, especially in children.<xref rid="b23-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Frequency scale for symptoms of GERD questionnaire had been used earlier to predict the necessity of adding prokinetics to PPI prior to the treatment.<xref rid="b24-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We used GERD-Q questionnaire in our study for screening and assessing the treatment response; it had been validated and could prove to be a better gatekeeper than endoscopy for proper diagnostic workup and medical treatment.<xref rid="b25-10.1177_1179552217709456" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>The reduction in heartburn severity is the most apparent objective tool of measurement for the patients with GERD.

It might also be beneficial in patients in whom on-demand therapy with PPI remains ineffective.</p><p>To conclude, omeprazole-domperidone combined therapy demonstrates significantly greater efficacy (reflux symptoms relief and esophagitis reversal) than omeprazole alone in the treatment of patients with GERD.
