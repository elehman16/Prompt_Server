Group A consisted of subjects who received 40 mg oral prednisolone; Group B consisted of subjects who received 40 mg submucosal injection of prednisolone while Group C consisted of subjects who did not receive prednisolone. Each group had 62 subjects. Measurements for facial width/facial swelling, pain, and mouth opening were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. The postoperative evaluation points were postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. These measurements were compared with the preoperative values both within and among the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Most of the subjects were in their third decade of life. A considerable increase in the mean postoperative values for pain, facial width and trismus was observed. Notably, subjects who did not receive prednisolone showed comparatively higher values for the measured parameters throughout the postoperative evaluation period. Subjects who received submucosal injection of prednisolone showed overall lower values compared to those who received oral prednisolone.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The results of this study indicate that the administration of prednisolone has a significantly beneficial effect in ameliorating the postoperative sequelae of the third molar surgery. In addition, the effect of submucosally injected prednisolone is comparable to the orally administered prednisolone; indeed it shows superiority to the latter in a number of dimensions. Submucosal injection of prednisolone offers a simple, effective, easy, safe, and minimally invasive option to existing therapeutic methods of reducing these postoperative sequelae.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sequelae</kwd><kwd>submucosal</kwd><kwd>third molar</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The extraction of impacted third molars, which may be prophylactic or therapeutic, is one of the most frequently performed operative procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Surgical extraction of impacted third molars inevitably results in trauma to soft and hard tissues; consequently, significant pain, swelling, and trismus may be experienced by patients who undergo such extractions.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Frequently, they experience significant postoperative distress and a decline in quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The undesirable consequences of impacted mandibular third molar surgery on the patients' postoperative QoL have been reported to show a 3-fold increase in patients who experience pain, swelling, or trismus alone or in combinations, compared to those who had none of these symptoms.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Various techniques intended to mitigate the detrimental effects of third molar surgery have been proposed, including the use of mouth washes, drains, specific suture techniques, steroids, ice packs, laser, analgesics, and drains, among others.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The administration of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone considerably reduces the manifestations of inflammation such as swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness that are frequently observed at the operative site.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Steroids may be administered along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and this combination has been found to have a distinct effect in reducing the severity of postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Prednisolone, which is a synthetic analog of cortisol, has a half-life of 2.1&#x02013;3.5 h.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. All subjects were at least 18 years old. All potential subjects with known contraindications to the use of steroids such as hypertension, gastrointestinal tract ulcer, diabetes, glaucoma, active bacterial/fungal/viral infections, history of thromboembolic/cardiovascular events, glaucoma, psychosis, were excluded from the study. In addition, pregnant or lactating females and patients determined to be on anti-inflammatory drugs were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Subjects were allocated into three groups (Groups A, B, and C) using a computer-generated table of random numbers. Subjects in Group A received 40 mg prednisolone per oral, which was administered 30 min preoperatively; Group B consisted of subjects who had submucosal administration of 40 mg prednisolone, which was administered preoperatively 5 min after local anesthesia had been achieved [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The surgical incision was made 2 min after submucosal injection of prednisolone. Subjects in Group C did not receive any prednisolone, and they were the control. All subjects received amoxicillin 500 mg orally 8 hourly for 5 days and metronidazole 200 mg perorally 8 hourly for 5 days after surgery; and ibuprofen 200 mg perorally immediately after the surgery and then 8 hourly for 3 days, regardless of their group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Submucosal prednisolone administration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-57-272-g001"/></fig><p>All subjects were informed about the procedures and objectives of this study, and a written consent was also obtained from each participant. Preoperative data were obtained from the subjects: Demographics (age, sex), indications for extraction, location of the third molar (left or right), type of impaction, and the degree of impaction.</p><p>Preoperative and postoperative assessment for facial width/swelling, trismus, and pain was done for all subjects using the same methods and by the same operator. All the impacted mandibular third molars were classified according to Winter's classification and Pell and Gregory classifications using a standard periapical radiograph. The reasons for extraction and location of impacted tooth were also recorded. Preoperative measurements formed the baseline values for pain, mouth opening, and facial width.</p><p>The preoperative pain was assessed using the linear 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). The subjects were asked to mark on the line with a pen; the point they felt was most representative of their pain perception, with the &#x0201c;worst imaginable pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; represented by either extreme ends of the scale. Subsequently, the VAS score for each subject was decided by measuring in millimeters from the left extreme of the line to the point marked by the subject.</p><p>Facial width was determined preoperatively using the tape measuring method described by Gabka and Matsumura.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Three measurements were made as follows: The tip of the tragus to the soft tissue pogonion ipsilaterally (line A), tip of the tragus to the ipsilateral oral commissure (line B), and lateral canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible ipsilaterally (line C) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The measurements were taken thrice, and the average was recorded in centimeters.

Where the incisors were absent, the occlusal part of the edentulous ridges using the labial frenum as a guide for centrality was used. This measurement was taken with the subject seated upright and the Frankfurt plane parallel to the floor. These measurements were done thrice, and the average was recorded in millimeters.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Inter-incisal mouth opening measurement with Vernier calipers</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NMJ-57-272-g003"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Operative procedures</title><p>All operations were carried out under local anesthesia with 2% lignocaine hydrochloride with 1:80,000 adrenaline. The inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve anesthesia were achieved using the conventional technique, whereas the standard buccal nerve block technique was used to achieve long buccal nerve anesthesia. A three-sided mucoperiosteal flap was raised for access. The buccal guttering technique was used to expose and undermine the tooth under copious irrigation with normal saline. Where necessary, sectioning of the tooth was done, and delivery was done with coupland elevator. Following tooth delivery, copious irrigation of the surgical site with sterile water was done. The flap was repositioned and secured with 3/0 black silk interrupted sutures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Postoperative assessment</title><p>Postoperatively, all subjects were assessed for pain, facial swelling, and maximal inter-incisal distance using an identical method to that used preoperatively. For pain measurement, each subject was given a postoperative pain assessment form/diary (VAS) to be filled each day for 7 consecutive days. Subjects were instructed to fill it at 8:30 pm daily. Postoperative facial width was measured exactly as described previously for the preoperative baseline measurement. The measurements were done and recorded on the postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 7. Postoperative mouth-opening ability was obtained using maximum inter-incisal distance as described for the preoperative measurement using Vernier calipers. The measurements were done and recorded on the PODs 1, 3, and 7.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The prednisolone groups also had lower values for facial swelling measurement on POD7; however, the difference in values obtained was not statistically significant when compared with the control group. A comparison of the difference in facial swelling measurement values on POD1, POD3, and POD7 for the Groups A and B was not statistically significant. This is in agreement with the study by Majid, who evaluated the effect of submucosal dexamethasone in subjects undergoing surgical extraction of the lower third molar.<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Shah <italic>et al</italic>. and Hassan also reported similar findings.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Milles and Desjardins performed a crossover study on 11 patients using 16 mg methylprednisolone orally, the evening before surgery. They reported that the low dose of methylprednisolone reduced swelling by 34% at 48 h postoperatively.<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Warraich <italic>et al</italic>., using a single dose (4 mg) of submucosal dexamethasone preoperatively, reported significantly less swelling in the subjects receiving corticosteroids than the subjects in the control by the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Similar observations were made by Grossi <italic>et al</italic>. and Majid.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In addition, Grossi <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that there was no statistically significant difference in postoperative edema measurements between the corticosteroid and control groups.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, Neupert <italic>et al</italic>. reported no statistically significant reduction in postoperative swelling on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> postoperative days between the corticosteroids and control groups.<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, it was noted that the dosage of the steroid used was subtherapeutic.</p><p>Mouth-opening ability was evaluated by measuring the maximum inter-incisal distance between the corresponding central incisors with the Vernier caliper; this method has been used in numerous researches.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The mean postoperative inter-incisal distance decreased in comparison with the mean preoperative inter-incisal distance in the immediate postoperative period. This difference was statistically significant on POD1, POD3, and POD7.</p><p>The severity of the trismus seen is a direct effect of the degree of inflammatory response.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Subjects in Group A and B had a less severe limitation in mouth opening in the immediate postoperative period compared to those in Group C. This is likely due to the anti-inflammatory effects of prednisolone administered. Subjects in Group B had a slightly higher mean inter-incisal distance compared with those in Group A. This finding is in consonance with reports by Tiigimae-Saar <italic>et al</italic>. and Kang <italic>et al</italic>., who administered 30 mg and 20 mg of prednisolone, respectively in subjects undergoing third molar extraction.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> This is possibly because of the local administration of prednisolone in Group B subjects which is close to and concentrated at the operative site. In addition, it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, thereby increasing the bioavailable fraction of the drug.</p><p>However, Grossi <italic>et al</italic>. in their study noted no statistically significant difference between the study and control groups.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This may have been because of the relatively small sample size of 61 subjects which they randomly divided into three groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study has shown that the administration of prednisolone has a significant impact in reducing postoperative pain, edema, and trismus following third molar surgery. The submucosal route of prednisolone administration is a viable alternative to the other routes. Indeed, it exhibited significant comparative advantages over the oral route of administration. In addition, it offers a safe, simple, cost-effective, and painless method, which produces a high concentration of prednisolone at the operative site, thereby lessening the systemic effects.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
