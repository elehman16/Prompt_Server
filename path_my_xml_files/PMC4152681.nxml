Local anesthetics like lidocaine[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and bupivacaine,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] opioids like morphine,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] alpha2 adrenoceptor agonists like clonidine,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] dexmeditomidine,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and magnesium sulphate[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have all been tried intra-articularly either as sole agents or in combination, to provide effective postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Dexamethasone is potent and highly selective glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid effect. It blocks the nociceptive impulse transmission along the myelinated C fibers.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Studies have shown that dexamethasone increases the duration of regional blocks, when combined with local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, it is expected that such a beneficial effect of dexamethasone can be manifested when it is injected in combination with levobupivacaine to intra-articular spaces.</p><p>This placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective study is designed to assess the efficacy of intra-articular dexamethasone administered as adjuvant to local anesthetic levobupivacaine in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee and informed consent was obtained from every patient. Fifty ASA I-II patients of either sex, aged 18-65 years, undergoing elective knee arthroscopy were randomly assigned to one of the two groups using computer-generated random numbers comprising of 25 patients each. Before performing the study, we hypothesized that the beneficial effect of levobupivacaine alone (in terms of prolonged analgesia) will be evident in at least 25% of the patients, after reviewing related articles and our experience. Considering an absolute improvement in the primary outcome by 40% (by the addition of dexamethasone) in the study group can be considered as clinically relevant and based on a Type I error level of 0.05, Type II error level of 0.2, and a two-sided test, we needed 21 patients in each treatment groups. Therefore, to account for probable drop outs, a number of 25 patients in each group was proposed.</p><p>Surgical procedures mainly consisted of meniscectomy and ligament repair. Patients having history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases, pregnancy, receiving chronic pain treatment, diabetes, and acid peptic disease were excluded from the study. On preoperative rounds, patients were explained regarding the procedure and were also taught to interpret the visual analogue scale (VAS) (graded from 0 = no pain to 10 = maximum pain).</p><p>All patients were given tab. diazepam 10 mg and tab. ranitidine 150 mg orally on the night before surgery and tab. ranitidine was repeated on the day of surgery 2 h before induction with sips of water. On the operation table, routine monitoring (electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure) was started and baseline vital parameters like heart rate (HR), blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. An intravenous line was secured.</p><p>After preoxygenation for 3 min, induction of anesthesia was done by fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.). Trachea was intubated with appropriate size endotracheal tube after muscle relaxation with vecuronium bromide in a dose of 0.08 mg/kg i.v. Anesthesia was maintained with 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide and isoflurane was adjusted to maintain a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.7. Muscle relaxation was maintained by intermittent bolus doses of vecuronium bromide. The patients were mechanically ventilated to keep EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mm Hg. Patients received top-up of i.v. fentanyl (1&#x003bc;g/kg) at 1 hourly interval. HR and mean arterial pressure were maintained within 20% of baseline value by giving additional bolus doss of fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g and propofol 10 mg i.v. Patients were randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomization list into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 25). Prefilled syringes were prepared with either levobupivacaine and saline or levobupivacaine and dexamethasone and kept in number coded sealed envelopes, made sterile by Sterrad Sterilization Machine. The anesthesiologist and surgeon were unaware of the nature of the drug in each syringe. At the end of the surgical procedure, intraarticular solutions were injected into the knee joint through the cannular sheath after withdrawal of camera by the orthopedic surgeon before the arthroscope was removed. In Group L, 18 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine and 2mL isotonic saline [total volume 20 mL] was administered into the knee joint. Similarly Group D patients received 8 mg dexamethasone (2 mL) added to 18 mL 0.25% levobupivacaine (again making a volume of 20 mL).</p><p>At the end of the operation, ondansetron 4 mg was administered i.v. for prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting. Residual neuromuscular paralysis was reversed using intravenous glycopyrrolate and neostigmine and subsequently extubation was done. All patients were observed postoperatively by resident doctors who were unaware of the study group. Patients were transferred to postanesthesia care unit and intensity of pain and vital parameters were assessed after 30 min and then an hourly interval for 24 h. Diclofenac sodium (75 mg) was administered i.v. as analgesic supplement if the recorded VAS pain score was 4 or more and was repeated every 8 h, if required. Tramadol 100 mg i.v. was used as a rescue analgesic, if the patients continued to have pain after diclofenac administration. The time to the first analgesic requirement and the total diclofenac consumption during first 24 h after operation were also recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary outcome variable in the study was the duration of analgesia following the surgery and the secondary outcome variables were total diclofenac consumption and the requirement of rescue analgesic between the study groups.</p><p>The numerical data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Student's t-test was employed to calculate the statistical differences in continuous variables between the groups, categorical variables were compared with chi-square test(or Fisher's exact test; as applicable). A &#x0201c;<italic>P</italic>&#x0201d; value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Steroids have block prolonging effect according to their anti-inflammatory potency.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Local anesthetic agents can provide analgesia for limited period of time when used as single injection.</p><p>As steroids block the transmission of impulse in nociceptive C fibers,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] we were interested in determining whether dexamethasone might prolong the duration of analgesia when administered intra-articularly along with local anesthetic agents. Dexamethasone is a powerful and predominantly anti-inflammatory steroid. So, it prolongs the action of local anesthetics when used together.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Few preliminary studies[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that steroids significantly prolong the duration of analgesia in extremity nerve blocks. Dexamethasone has been reported to result in significant prolongation of supraclavicular brachial plexus block when added as an adjuvant to local anesthetic bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] We assumed the similar probable mechanism regarding dexamethasone and levobupivacaine combination as bupivacaine and levobupivacaine were comparable regarding quality and duration of blockade when used in three-in-one blocks in a study by Urbanek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The dense and prolonged block in the dexamethasone group is due to the synergistic action with local anesthetic levobupivacaine on blockade of nerve fibers.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The block prolonging effect of dexamethasone is due to its local action, not a systemic one.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It has been found that this effect of steroid is mediated via steroid receptors.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] When steroids alone were used in regional blocks, the blockade is not produced. Steroids might bring about this effect by altering the function of potassium channels in excitable cells.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The delay between intr-aarticular injection of levobupivacaine with dexamethasone and supplementary analgesic administration was 10.24 &#x000b1; 2.8 h in our study. We could not find studies using dexamethasone with levobupivaciaine intraarticularly for prolongation of postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery. In a study performed by Paul <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] it was found that time period for first analgesic request for intra-articular bupivacaine and magnesium sulphate combination was 12.32 &#x000b1; 2.8 h, intra-articular bupivacaine and clonidine was 10.16 &#x000b1; 2.4 h. In another study by Paul <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] time for first analgesic request for intra-articular dexmedetomidine in combination with ropivacaine was 10.84 &#x000b1; 2.6 h. It seems that dexamethasone administered as adjuvant to levobupivacaine was able to provide analgesia which was comparable to other intra-articular agents used in previous similar studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Dexamethasone administered intra-articularly as an adjuvant to local anesthetic levobupivacaine improves the
