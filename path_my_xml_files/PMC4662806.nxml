Several studies have suggested that PROs discriminate between treatment effects and physician-reported clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. By using both, a physician should have a more comprehensive assessment of a patient&#x02019;s status. Assessment of PROs in clinical trials is now recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the European Medicines Agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for the evaluation of medications for chronic diseases such as RA. There is interest in how PROs compare to each other, their sensitivity to change, and how they differentiate between treatments in blinded, randomized clinical trials (RCTs).</p><p>Self-reported disease activity questionnaires, such as the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI) and the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3), offer a patient-focused approach to the clinical management of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. RAPID3 is an index of three PRO measures in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Core Data Set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (physical function, pain, and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity [PtGA]), but it does not include formal joint counts. RADAI includes a patient self-assessment of joint tenderness and pain in 16 joint areas, current and past global disease activity, and morning stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Neither index employs a physician joint count or determination of an acute-phase reactant.</p><p>Most clinical trials have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, excluding patients with many of the comorbidities commonly seen in clinical practice and enrolling a more homogeneous and less complicated population than that usually encountered in clinical practice settings. Evaluations of anti&#x02013;tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy in groups more representative of the clinical setting are lacking. The REALISTIC (RA EvALuation In Subjects receiving TNF Inhibitor Certolizumab pegol) study, which was double-blinded and placebo-controlled to week 12 (randomizing patients in a 4:1 fashion [certolizumab pegol:placebo]) and open-label thereafter, had fewer exclusion criteria than most clinical trials. This study demonstrated that the PEGylated Fc-free anti-TNF agent certolizumab pegol (CZP), either as monotherapy or in addition to current treatment, is efficacious on the basis of clinical response criteria in a broad group of patients with active, inadequately controlled RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In this article, we investigate the efficacy of CZP in patients with RA with regard to PROs of physical function, pain, fatigue, sleep, and PtGA in the REALISTIC study and examine the correlations between PROs and clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms, including the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) and formal joint counts. Finally, the relative efficacy of composite PROs (RADAI and RAPID3) and clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms are compared to ascertain their respective sensitivity to therapeutic efficacy in the CZP-treated population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Detailed methods of the REALISTIC study have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the trial enrolled 1063 patients aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with adult-onset RA, as defined by the 1987 ACR criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], of &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration, with an unsatisfactory response to or intolerance of at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide, sulfasalazine, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and gold). Patients were stratified by baseline MTX use, prior anti-TNF use, and disease duration (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;years vs. &#x02265;2&#x000a0;years) and randomized 4:1 to receive, in addition to their existing treatment, either (1) a CZP 400-mg loading dose at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by CZP 200&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;weeks; or (2) placebo injection (control) every 2&#x000a0;weeks for the initial 12-week double-blind RCT. After completing the 12-week RCT, patients could enter the open-label phase and receive CZP 200&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;weeks (following the loading dose for patients originally randomized to placebo). The trial was carried out in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review boards at each participating center. The full details of all institutional review boards are provided at the end of the main text in the Acknowledgments section. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Efficacy evaluations</title><p>PROs were secondary and exploratory endpoints in the REALISTIC study. They included assessments of physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index [HAQ-DI]), arthritis pain, and PtGA. Pain and PtGA were both scored on 100-mm visual analogue scales (VASs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PtGA was scored from 0 (&#x0201c;very good, no symptoms&#x0201d;) to 100 (&#x0201c;very poor, severe symptoms&#x0201d;), and pain was scored from 0 (&#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d;) to 100 (&#x0201c;most severe pain&#x0201d;). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for both has been established as a 10-mm decrease (i.e., improvement) from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The MCID for the HAQ-DI was prespecified as a 0.22-point improvement (i.e., &#x02212;0.22 change), based on previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>RAPID3 is an index composed of three routine PROs assessed on a standard patient questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]: the HAQ-DI, the pain VAS, and the PtGA VAS. It was investigated as a post-hoc analysis. To calculate the RAPID3 score, the raw 0&#x02013;3 score for physical function in the HAQ-DI is multiplied by 3.33 and the pain and PtGA VAS scores are each divided by 10, to give scores of 0&#x02013;10. The HAQ-DI, pain, and PtGA scores are then summed for a raw score of 0&#x02013;30. The MCID for RAPID3 is a 3.6-point decrease from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Exploratory endpoints included assessments of fatigue according to the 10-point Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], sleep quality and quantity as measured by the Sleep Problem Index II domain of the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and disease activity from the patient&#x02019;s perspective as assessed with the RADAI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Fatigue was scored from 0 (&#x0201c;no fatigue&#x0201d;) to 10 (&#x0201c;fatigue as bad as you can imagine&#x0201d;), with MCID defined as a 1-point decrease from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Sleep over the last 4&#x000a0;weeks was assessed using 12 questions relating to the time taken to fall asleep, quality of sleep, amount of waking during the night, and the effect of sleep on daytime functioning. The MCID reported for MOS-SPI is a decrease &#x02265;6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The RADAI is a self-administered, 5-item questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] used to assess the following: (1) global disease activity in the past 6&#x000a0;months, (2) disease activity in terms of tender and swollen joints, (3) arthritis pain, (4) duration of morning stiffness, and (5) tender joints (16-joint count). To calculate the RADAI joint score (RADAI-JS), each joint in the assessment of tender joints (item 5 above, 16-joint count) is scored from 0 to 3, and subsequently these scores are summed (maximal sum score 48) and multiplied by 10/48 to adjust the overall score to a range of 0&#x02013;10. To calculate the RADAI total score (RADAI-TS), the five items are combined into a single index of patient-assessed disease activity with a range of 0&#x02013;10. The MCID for the RADAI-TS is a 1-point decrease from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>All PROs except MOS-SPI were assessed at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, and 28 and at completion of or withdrawal from the trial. MOS-SPI was assessed at all time points except week 2. We report the PRO findings for the 12-week, double-blind phase of the REALISTIC study and for the subsequent open-label phase through week 28.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>PRO analyses were carried out using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients. The results are reported as ITT unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Least squares mean change from baseline (CFB) in HAQ-DI, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, PtGA, RAPID3, and RADAI-TS were obtained using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factors for treatment, baseline MTX status, prior anti-TNF use, disease duration category (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;years vs. &#x02265;2&#x000a0;years), and baseline response as covariates. Missing data were accounted for by using the last observation carried forward.

For exploratory purposes, logistic regression was performed with treatment, baseline MTX status, prior anti-TNF use, disease duration category (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;years vs. &#x02265;2&#x000a0;years), and baseline response as covariates.</p><p>Correlations between PROs and clinical disease activity measures of DAS28 using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]), log(CRP), tender joint count (TJC), and swollen joint count (SJC) at week 12 were analyzed for all patients (ITT population) using Pearson correlations. They were interpreted as &#x0003c;0.3&#x02009;=&#x02009;low correlation, &#x02265;0.3 to &#x0003c;0.5&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate correlation, &#x02265;0.5 to &#x0003c;0.7&#x02009;=&#x02009;high correlation, and &#x02265;0.7 to 1.0&#x02009;=&#x02009;very high correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using Spearman correlations.</p><p>The ability of RAPID3 and RADAI to detect changes in patient-reported disease activity from baseline to week 12 in CZP patients was quantified as effect size (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;mean change/standard deviation [SD] of baseline score) and relative efficiency (RE&#x02009;=&#x02009;ES<sup>2</sup> of parameter <italic>x</italic>/ES<sup>2</sup> of reference parameter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with DAS28[CRP] used as the reference measure.</p><p>Number needed to treat (NNT) was assessed using the following formula: NNT&#x02009;=&#x02009;1/(response in active treatment&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;response in placebo group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

The study included patients not usually enrolled in RA clinical trials due to comorbidities, excluding only those with a history of chronic, serious, or life-threatening infection; patients with any current infection; patients with uncontrolled renal, hepatic, cardiac, or neurological disease; and patients with either concurrent or a history of malignancy. Additionally, patients with either early or late disease and a history of previous DMARD use (including prior anti-TNF, used in 40&#x000a0;% of patients) were permitted to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A range of correlations between PROs and clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms were seen, highlighting the importance of PROs for assessing the full impact of RA on patients. Finally, the responsiveness, as measured by ES and RE, of RADAI and RAPID3 compared with other composite clinical indices of CZP therapeutic efficacy suggests that these PROs can be used to assess treatment outcomes in trial settings.</p><p>The treatment effects of CZP on the PROs assessed demonstrated rapid onset, with clinically important improvements in pain, fatigue, and PtGA observed from the first assessment (week 2). Beneficial effects were also seen in the previously reported clinical observations of CZP therapy in the REALISTIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, these observations are consistent with findings from the RAPID and FAST4WARD studies of CZP in patients with RA, in which clinical benefits were seen as early as week 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The ability to evaluate the clinical significance of observed improvement in parameters important to the patient is fundamental to the interpretation of clinical trials. We investigated this by analyzing whether the proportion of patients reporting MCIDs in PROs could differentiate CZP from placebo, even in a short-term trial. This approach has been validated previously using the internal anchor-based analysis to derive MCIDs. For example, PtGA and pain have been used to differentiate abatacept and placebo in patients with RA in two major RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Those studies demonstrated that MCIDs for activity limitation, fatigue, and sleep problems can be used as benchmarks in clinical trials to assess patient improvement. The results presented in the present report broadly support this conclusion. Although there was a placebo response for patients meeting MCID for PROs, consistent with observations in other randomized trials assessing PROs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], more patients receiving active treatment achieved the MCID. Our results are concordant with the magnitude of change in PROs reported previously after CZP treatment in the RAPID trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as for other anti-TNFs in randomized and controlled studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Improvements in PRO MCID achievement after CZP therapy, compared with control patients participating in the RAPID 1 and RAPID 2 trials, were also linked to improvements in social functioning, as measured by participation in family, social, and leisure activities and productivity at work and at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>We observed marked and rapid improvements from baseline in fatigue in patients who received CZP compared with patients receiving placebo, and these improvements were maintained to week 28. Fatigue is now recognized as an outcome of major importance, being highly prevalent (present in up to 70&#x000a0;% of patients with RA), as severe and frequent as pain, and consistently prioritized by patients themselves as one of their top outcome priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Assessment of this PRO is strongly recommended in clinical trials of RA treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, fatigue is common across all rheumatic diseases, correlates with all measures of distress, and predicts dysfunction at work and overall health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Sleep disturbance is increased in patients with RA, and a prior study of MOS sleep scales in 8676 patients with RA suggested that sleep problems are linked to pain, mood, and RA disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In the present study, sleep improvement was associated with an improvement in fatigue measures. CZP treatment was associated with significant sleep improvement compared with the placebo treatment. TNF-&#x003b1; has been implicated in regulating slow-wave brain function and sleep propensity; consequently, it is thought to play a role in normal sleep cycles as well as the disturbed sleep associated with a number of disease pathologies, including RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, improvement in sleep could be due to improvement in RA signs (inflammation) and symptoms (pain). Other studies have also shown a beneficial effect of anti-TNFs on sleep in patients with RA; however, further research is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Using correlation analysis, we highlighted the value of using PROs to evaluate treatment benefit in patients with RA. Correlations between 0.3 and 0.7 were observed between clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms and the PROs PtGA, pain, and fatigue. We also found correlations between 0.3 and 0.7 for all PROs measured and disability detected by the HAQ-DI. This demonstrated that PROs measure aspects that are related to, but not the same as, clinical outcomes. However, it should be noted that sleep problems correlated poorly with pain and PtGA and also with clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms (e.g., DAS28[CRP], CRP, physician-reported TJC and SJC). This is not surprising, as sleep problems are likely multifactorial, whereas pain may be more closely related to RA disease activity, although it may still reflect damage and other comorbidities.</p><p>The results reported herein suggest that PRO indices may be useful clinical tools, complementary to other measures, for assessing RA disease activity. We found that correlations between DAS28(CRP) and RADAI or RAPID3 were between 0.5 and 0.7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) in the overall RA population, and the effect sizes of these PROs were clinically important. This suggests that these PROs in particular may provide important additional information concerning treatment efficacy. Comparable responsiveness of RADAI and RAPID3 and the clinical measure DAS28(CRP) to CZP treatment was also demonstrated in patients with very active disease, further supporting this conclusion in these patients.</p><p>The NNT to achieve MCID in RADAI-TS and RAPID3 were 4.5 and 5.6 patients, respectively. While these values appear higher than those determined in the CZP RAPID trial, where NNT was 2&#x02013;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], this may be due to the broader patient population represented in the REALISTIC trial, combined with a shorter trial duration.</p><p>The number of &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; patients with RA in this study was large (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1063), especially those randomized to CZP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;851), which is a strength of this study. A possible limitation is the short-term length of the trial, which allowed for detection of early rapid improvements in PROs but excluded analysis of longer-term outcomes. In particular, 12&#x000a0;weeks may have been an insufficient period within which to adequately investigate the association of sleep improvements with other outcomes. HAQ-DI scores have been shown to be predictive of long-term patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Currently, there is limited information available on the predictive value of other PROs on long-term patient outcomes such as disability, mortality, and health resource use. Without this validation, PROs remain indictors of disease symptom severity rather than indicators of long-term patient prognosis. We also noted high rates of improvement greater than or equal to the MCID for PROs in patients randomized to the placebo group. As patients maintained their current treatment regimens, many patients in the placebo group were concurrently receiving MTX. As improvements in PROs observed for this group tended to plateau by week 12, the observed response may have been a consequence of patient expectations of treatment and/or regression to the mean, an effect extensively reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We were also unable to relate PROs to radiographic changes, as radiographs were not evaluated in the REALISTIC study. It should also be noted that all reported <italic>p</italic> values and confidence intervals are nominal and can be interpreted only in an exploratory manner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the rapid changes seen in a range of PROs in a representative RA population following CZP therapy. Improvement in PROs after CZP treatment indicates that the benefits of therapy extend beyond the primary composite clinical efficacy endpoints to outcomes that are more meaningful to patients, with differentiation between active treatment and placebo. RADAI and RAPID3 demonstrated very high correlation with each other and comparative responsiveness to change, which is not surprising as they assess many of the same variables. Correlations between clinical indices of RA signs and symptoms and PROs suggest that PROs can be used in conjunction with clinical outcomes to more comprehensively assess the benefits of treatment on the outcomes that are most highly valued by patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACR</term><def><p>American College of Rheumatology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFB</term><def><p>change from baseline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p>C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CZP</term><def><p>certolizumab pegol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DAS28</term><def><p>Disease Activity Score in 28 joints</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMARD</term><def><p>disease-modifying antirheumatic drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ES</term><def><p>effect size</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESR</term><def><p>erythrocyte sedimentation rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p>Fatigue Assessment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAQ-DI</term><def><p>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JS</term><def><p>joint score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p>minimal clinically important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOS-SPI</term><def><p>Sleep Problem Index II domain of the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MTX</term><def><p>methotrexate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OLE</term><def><p>open-label extension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBO</term><def><p>placebo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRO</term><def><p>patient-reported outcome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PtGA</term><def><p>Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RA</term><def><p>rheumatoid arthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RADAI</term><def><p>Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAPID3</term><def><p>Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized clinical trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE</term><def><p>relative efficiency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REALISTIC</term><def><p>RA EvALuation In Subjects receiving TNF Inhibitor Certolizumab pegol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SJC</term><def><p>swollen joint count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TJC</term><def><p>tender joint count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TS</term><def><p>total score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>UCB Pharma sponsored the study and the development of the manuscript.
