Primary endpoint (&#x02265;20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) criteria at week 14) findings have been reported for all patients in the trial. Reported herein are further assessments of efficacy/safety among patients receiving golimumab+methotrexate (MTX).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among efficacy-evaluable patients who received MTX at baseline, more receiving golimumab+MTX (n=201) than placebo+MTX (n=103) achieved ACR20 (40.8% vs 14.6%), ACR50 (20.9% vs 3.9%), and ACR70 (11.4% vs 2.9%) responses at week 24. Among the 137 patients who had received only one prior TNF inhibitor (adalimumab, n=33; etanercept, n=47; and infliximab, n=57), week 24 ACR20 rates were 30.3%, 46.8% and 50.9%, respectively, and thus lowest among those who previously used adalimumab. ACR20 response rates were 44.5% (61/137), 36.2% (17/47) and 23.5% (4/17) among patients who had received one, two or three TNF inhibitors, respectively. Adverse event (AE) rates were comparable across type/number of prior anti-TNF agents, but appeared somewhat higher among patients who discontinued previous TNF inhibitor(s) due to intolerance (37/49, 75.5%) versus lack of efficacy (LOE, 113/191, 59.2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients with active RA previously treated with &#x02265;1 TNF inhibitor had clinically relevant improvement with golimumab+MTX, which appeared somewhat enhanced among those who received only etanercept or infliximab as their prior TNF inhibitor. Golimumab+MTX safety appeared similar across patients, regardless of TNF inhibitor(s) previously used, with fewer AEs occurring among patients who discontinued prior therapy for LOE.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anti-TNF</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid Arthritis</kwd><kwd>DAS28</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>More than a decade has passed since the initial introduction of tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) inhibitors, which have greatly expanded treatment options for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Given that patients may not always respond to the first TNF inhibitor prescribed and that there is long-term experience with using other TNF inhibitors, it is reasonable to assume that, in line with recent disease management recommendations,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> clinicians will be treating increasing numbers of patients exposed previously to one or more TNF inhibitor(s).</p><p>Results of several small case series, open-label studies and registries have indicated that patients who switched from one TNF inhibitor to another resulting from lack of efficacy or intolerance may respond to a second or even third TNF inhibitor.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;9</xref> Benefits of switching from etanercept to infliximab, and vice versa, have been investigated.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;14</xref> Additionally, the strategy of switching patients with RA who are inadequately responsive to a TNF inhibitor to a biological agent with a different mode of action has been compared with that of switching to another TNF inhibitor in non-randomised observational studies of data from registries.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

We present the findings of post-hoc analyses of data obtained from patients with active RA previously treated with one or more TNF inhibitor and also receiving MTX after 6&#x02005;months of study drug treatment in that trial, as well as hypotheses for assessment in future studies.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Patients</title><p>As detailed previously,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> eligible patients had RA for &#x02265;3&#x02005;months prior to screening and active disease with &#x02265;4 swollen and &#x02265;4 tender joints (mean values: 16.6/66 and 29.8/68, respectively). Patients had received one or more doses of etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab &#x02265;8 (adalimumab, etanercept) or &#x02265;12 (infliximab) weeks prior to receiving the first dose of study agent. Patients must not have had a clinically serious adverse reaction to any of the prior anti-TNF agents. Previous anti-TNF treatment could have been discontinued for any reason, and the reason(s) for discontinuation were documented by the investigator as either lack of efficacy, intolerance or &#x02018;other&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Procedures</title><p>Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous placebo, golimumab 50&#x02005;mg or golimumab 100&#x02005;mg every 4 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site and baseline MTX use (yes/no).

Efficacy data from one North American site were excluded from these analyses because of protocol violations identified during the Sponsor's standard audit processes, yielding 201 efficacy-evaluable patients. Clinical outcomes by prior anti-TNF treatment were summarised using descriptive statistics for randomised patients. The proportions of patients achieving ACR20 and ACR50 responses, DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR responses, DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR each &#x0003c;2.6, and HAQ&#x02013;DI response at week 24 were determined among patients who previously had received only one anti-TNF agent and discontinued the treatment for any reason. Clinical response was similarly assessed among patients who had discontinued prior anti-TNF therapy as a result of lack of efficacy, because of intolerance, or for &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons, as well as among patients based on the number of previous TNF inhibitors received. For patients who escaped early, efficacy data from week 16 were carried forward for analysis at week 24 to ensure that the results were not biased by the increased dose of golimumab that the patient received at week 16 or week 24.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Summaries of AEs include only treated patients (n=204).

However, interpretation of these findings is limited by the small numbers of patients who experienced serious AEs or serious infections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013203435TB4">table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although data derived from several small case series, open-label studies and registries have suggested that patients with RA switched from one to another TNF inhibitor because of lack of efficacy or intolerance may respond to the second or even third agent,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;9</xref> such response patterns have not previously been examined in a randomised, controlled study. Using data from the GO-AFTER trial,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> we evaluated the efficacy and safety of golimumab when switching from another TNF inhibitor among more than 200 patients with active RA who previously received adalimumab, etanercept and/or infliximab and reported MTX use at baseline. Our post-hoc data analyses indicate that among patients taking MTX at baseline, the response rates at week 24 are somewhat higher than those reported previously for all patients at the primary endpoint of week 14.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This is consistent with the generally accepted principle that concomitant use of MTX with a TNF inhibitor results in better clinical and functional outcomes.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> Moreover, patients who switch from adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab to golimumab demonstrate clinically relevant responses at week 24, regardless of whether the prior TNF inhibitor was a monoclonal antibody or a soluble receptor fusion protein.</p><p>Of note and consistent with results of a comparative meta-analysis,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> although it is difficult to compare outcomes across clinical trials due to differences in trial design, week 24 ACR response rates among patients who had discontinued prior anti-TNF therapy and received golimumab+MTX in GO-AFTER are comparable to those observed at the same week 24 time point for other biological agents with different mechanisms of action in combination with MTX. For example, week 24 ACR50 response rates for study agent versus placebo, both with concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, were 27% and 5% for rituximab<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; 29% (8&#x02005;mg/kg), 17% (4&#x02005;mg/kg) and 4% for tocilizumab<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>; and 20% and 4% for abatacept.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The most straightforward approach to assess effects of switching agents is to analyse data derived from patients previously treated with only one prior TNF inhibitor. Despite our previously reported observations of clinically relevant responses to golimumab in the overall trial population,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> patients previously exposed to more than two TNF inhibitors appear to be less likely to demonstrate marked improvement in clinical and functional outcomes. ACR50 response rates were similar among patients who had been treated with one or two prior TNF inhibitors, but were much lower when golimumab was initiated as the fourth TNF inhibitor. Although these findings suggest that such patients might respond better to a biological agent with a different mechanism of action, it should be considered that the rates of response to each of rituximab and abatacept also decrease with previous exposure to increasing numbers of TNF inhibitors.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Future studies employing biomarkers may help to predict which patients are more likely to respond to the different agents, following initial exposure to a TNF inhibitor.</p><p>Because patients were not stratified by prior TNF inhibitor use when randomised to treatment arms, the size of some of the subgroups that were evaluated was small, and our subgroup analyses were performed post-hoc, no formal statistical testing was performed. Despite these limitations, the data reveal numerical trends. For example, ACR20 response rates at week 24 for patients treated with golimumab 50 or 100&#x02005;mg and MTX were numerically higher among those who switched from etanercept (46.8%) or infliximab (50.9%) compared with those who had previously received adalimumab (30.3%), the agent most similar in structure to golimumab.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Conversely, the proportion of patients who were previously treated with adalimumab for more than 24&#x02005;weeks was much lower than that of patients who had previously received treatment with etanercept or infliximab for more than 24 weeks, which could have been due to a larger number of patients with refractory disease among those receiving adalimumab treatment. It is possible that patients previously treated with agents structurally more dissimilar to golimumab developed antibodies to the prior TNF inhibitor that precluded continued response to the previous agent<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>; these antibodies might have been less likely to cross-react with the human golimumab molecule, allowing a better subsequent response to golimumab. The presence of antibodies to prior TNF inhibitor(s) was not assessed in GO-AFTER. However, future studies of switching among TNF inhibitors should include such assessments to better characterise the mechanisms underlying differential responses to subsequent treatment.</p><p>The safety profile of golimumab+MTX was similar to that of placebo+MTX and was consistent among patients who previously received adalimumab, etanercept or infliximab, and among those who had received one, two or three prior TNF inhibitors. When assessed by reason for discontinuation of previous anti-TNF agent(s), however, AEs appeared to be more common among patients who had discontinued prior anti-TNF therapy because of intolerance than because of lack of efficacy or &#x02018;other&#x02019; reasons. The incidences of serious AEs and serious infections were low, but appeared comparable across patient subgroups evaluated, except for a somewhat higher incidence of serious AEs among patients who had received three (18.8%) prior TNF inhibitors, compared with those who previously had received one (2.5%) or two (3.8%) inhibitors. Overall, the safety findings are not unexpected given that TNF inhibitors as a class, regardless of the specific molecular construct, share similar potential safety risks.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref></p><p>This post-hoc subgroup analysis has several limitations. As mentioned above, patient randomisation was not stratified by the specific TNF inhibitor or by the number of TNF inhibitors used previously. Subgroup sample size was small in some of these comparisons. Also, patients enrolled into the GO-AFTER trial could have discontinued their prior TNF inhibitor(s) for any reason; reasons for discontinuation were categorised at the discretion of the study investigator, as no formal definitions were provided.</p><p>In conclusion, patients with active RA who previously received TNF inhibitor therapy and were treated with golimumab and concomitant MTX in the GO-AFTER trial demonstrated clinically relevant improvement in disease activity and physical function after switching to golimumab, regardless of which TNF inhibitor had been taken previously. Of particular note, patients who switched from either etanercept or infliximab appeared to exhibit better subsequent responses to golimumab than those that were observed among patients who previously had received adalimumab which, of the three prior TNF inhibitors, is most structurally similar to golimumab. However, further study is required to confirm the current findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Kirsten Schuck, Michelle Perate, MS, and Mary Whitman, PhD, of Janssen Services, LLC, for their assistance in the development and submission of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was supported by Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC and Merck/Schering-Plough.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> JSS, JK, ELM and RL are research investigators for the GO-AFTER golimumab clinical trial.
