The dose of diclofenac for oral administration has to be twice the intravenous dose because of a 50% first pass elimination of the active ingredient. Patients will be assessed immediately before and 90 min after treatment (this is the average time needed for the intravenous administration of an infusion containing analgesics). The primary endpoint at 90 minutes is pain assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], secondary endpoint is the Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the quality of life score as measured by the short form 36 (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. If patients still have severe pain further intravenous therapy should be given according to the discretion of the treating physician. Patients who refuse randomisation but agree to participate in the patient preference trial will receive the treatment of their choice. Treatment and follow-up will be identical in the randomised and patient preference groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 2 intervention</title><p>After the first step patients are randomised to oral diclofenac (2 &#x000d7; 100 mg per day or 1 &#x000d7; 100 mg per day if bodyweight is &#x0003c;60 kg) and the oral muscle-relaxant tizanidin (Sirdalud<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 3 &#x000d7; 2 mg, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) over 3 days versus oral diclofenac (2 &#x000d7; 100 mg per day or 1 &#x000d7; 100 mg per day if bodyweight is &#x0003c;60 kg) plus oral placebo in a double blind fashion. Patients with a history of gastric pain, suggestive of ulcer or non-ulcer dyspeptic disease will receive a proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection (pantoprazol 1 &#x000d7; 40 mg per day, Pantoloc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Byk Pharma &#x000d6;sterreich).</p><p>As in the first step, patients who refuse randomisation but agree to participate in the patient preference trial will receive the treatment of their choice.

This effect size is an estimate based on the outcome of pain measurement 60 minutes after the oral administration of a non-steroidal analgesic and a COX-2 inhibitor in patients with chronic low back pain.

Data will be analysed in an intention-to-treat fashion if patients receive a treatment other than the allocated treatment For group comparison of continuous data in model 1 (randomised patients only) either a two tailed t-test, and an analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline values in the VAS, or, in case of a non-normal distribution, or ordinal data (RMDQ, SF-36), the Mann-Whitney U-Test will be used. For model 2 (randomised patients and patients with preferred treatment) multiple linear regression will be used to account for baseline differences and the randomisation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Stata version 7 (Stata Corporation, TX, USA) will be used for data analysis. A p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 is assumed to indicate evidence against the null hypothesis.</p><p>We believe that it is not necessary to define stopping rules as the observational period is very short and we do not expect that any treatment, which is already widely used, will result in increased mortality or disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Assignment</title><sec><title>Unit of randomisation and method to generate allocation (for both stages)</title><p>The unit of randomisation is the individual patient. Blockwise randomisation in blocks of 4 is intended to achieve intervention and control groups of equal size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Treatment (oral v intravenous diclofenac) will commence immediately afterwards. For the second stage of the trial patients will be randomised to a centrally active muscle relaxant or placebo. Both groups should receive a long acting non-steroidal analgesic (diclofenac 2 &#x000d7; 100 mg po) and will be evaluated after 4 days. Randomisation and allocation again will be performed as described above with opaque, sealed envelopes.</p></sec><sec><title>Method to separate generator from executor</title><p>The randomisation will be prepared by a person not involved in recruitment, treatment or assessment of patients</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Masking</title><sec><title>Stage 1</title><p>This trial is intended to be double blind. Patients, doctors and outcome assessors are blinded to the nature of the intervention. Each patient is to receive a pre-prepared intravenous administration of 250 ml NaCI 0.9% containing either 75 mg diclofenac or placebo of equal appearance. At the same time patients will receive a capsule containing 150 mg diclofenac or placebo. The placebo capsule contains lactose powder and has the same size, colour and taste as the active drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Stage 2</title><p>The second stage is also intended as a double blind trial. Both groups will receive oral diclofenac (Dolpasse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Fresenius, 2 &#x000d7; 100 mg) for 3 days. Patients are randomised either to placebo 3 &#x000d7; 1 for 3 days or oral tizanidin (Sirdalud<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 3 &#x000d7; 2 mg) 3 &#x000d7; 1 for 3 days. The placebo capsule contains lactose powder and has the same size, colour and taste as the active drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Was blinding successful?</title><p>To assess whether blinding was successful we will ask patients and outcome assessors whether the patient received active enteral or parenteral treatment (Stage 1). The question intended for the patient, and the outcome assessor alike, is: "Do you think the active treatment was the infusion or the capsule?" Possible answers are: "Most likely in the infusion."; "Don't know."; "Most likely in the capsule." For stage 2 we will ask the patient and the outcome assessor: "Do you think you received the active treatment or the inactive treatment?" Possible answers are: "Most likely yes."; "Don't know."; "Most likely no."</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Baseline measurements</title><p>We intend to assess following baseline parameters besides the clinical symptoms leading to inclusion in the study and the outcome parameters: age, gender, highest education.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>For both stages the primary outcome measure is the pain assessed by means of the VAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Patients receive an A4 sheet with a 10 cm bold line in the centre which is has "no pain" above the left end of the line and "pain as bad as you have ever experienced" at the right end of the line. Patients are advised to set a marker at the applicable range with a pencil. The distance of the marker from "no pain" (=0) will be measured and expressed in mm (maximum = 100). For stage one, the visual analogue scale is evaluated immediately before and 90 min after treatment, for stage two, the VAS is evaluated on day 4 (=three days after enrolment). Patients will be advised to fill out the scale at home and return the original sheet by a prepaid return postage envelope.</p><p>For both stages the RMDQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the SF-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] are employed in an adapted form for secondary outcome measurements. The Roland Morris disability questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is used in the cross cultural adapted and validated form for German-speaking patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The questionnaire is a questionnaire with 24 items that reflect varied activities of daily living due to back pain. An item receives a score of 1 if it is checked as applicable by the patient and a score of 0 if not marked. Accordingly scores can vary from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability).</p><p>The SF-36 is used in the cross cultural adapted and validated form for German-speaking patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We selected the items 1 (general health perception), 2 (change in health), 4 (role limitations (physical problems)), 5 (role limitations (emotional problems)), 9 (vitality) and 10 (social functioning). The score will be calculated according to the test-manual</p><p>The RMDQ and the SF 36 is evaluated immediately before treatment (stage 1) by personal interview, then, for stage two, the RMDQ and the SF 36 is evaluated 4 days after enrolment. Patients will be interviewed by telephone using the structured format of the questionnaires of RMDQ and SF-36.</p><p>For patients with persisting pain we will recommend (1) to continue analgesic therapy and (2) to attend their general practitioner for further diagnostic work-up and treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>An adverse event is any event during a clinical study, including intercurrent illness or accident, which impairs the well-being of the subject; it may also take the form of an abnormal laboratory value. The term adverse event does not imply a causal relationship with the study treatment.</p><p>All subjects experiencing adverse events &#x02013; whether considered associated with the use of the study medication or not &#x02013; will be monitored until symptoms subside and any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full pathologist's report will be supplied, if possible. All findings must be reported on an "Adverse event" page in the case record form.</p><p>Adverse events are divided into the categories "serious" (fatal, life-threatening, or permanently disbling) and "nonserious". All adverse events, including intercurrent illnesses, will be reported and documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Data management</title><p>We intend to transfer data from case record forms to the computer database (MS Excel 97) by two investigators in duplicate and independently. Data will be compared and inconsistencies will be sorted out by referring to the original case record form. If there are still range, consistency or plausibility problems, the patient chart will be assessed. If after these measures values are still implausible or missing we intend to treat them as missing data. We do not intend to substitute these data with e.g. average values. We plan to assess whether missing data, particularly core data, may introduce bias by sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Confidentiality</title><p>Upon entry into the trial each patient will receive a unique identifying number. Subsequently only this number will be used in the case record forms and the investigator responsible for data management is not aware of the patients' identity nor treatment allocation.
