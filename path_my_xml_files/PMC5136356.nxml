In the past decade, several new medications have been approved for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer including the antiandrogen enzalutamide. In addition, there has been mounting interest in evaluating health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with cancer including new more detailed recommendations released by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 on how to evaluate patient-related outcomes in clinical trials. A total of four randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials have evaluated patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) randomized to receive enzalutamide vs control or bicalutamide. Each study used validated health-related QoL and pain surveys to evaluate patient-related outcomes. The studies suggest that patients with mCRPC, including those aged 75 years and older, have favorable overall QoL scores taking enzalutamide compared to standard of care. There was short-term improved pain control in patients taking enzalutamide compared to those in the placebo group. Some commonly reported adverse effects included fatigue, back pain, and hot flashes. These studies were limited in their patient attrition in filling out surveys as well as difficulty in comparing them to each other. Future studies examining patients with mCRPC taking enzalutamide will have to rigorously standardize ways patient-reported outcomes are collected and evaluate patients in a more diversified real-world population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>enzalutamide</kwd><kwd>metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>patient-related outcomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The incidence of prostate cancer is about 180,000 new cases per year in the United States and approximately 1.1 million new cases per year globally.<xref rid="b1-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and accounts for about 8% of cancer deaths in the USA.<xref rid="b1-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most of these deaths are from those with metastatic disease.</p><p>The treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has evolved rapidly. After the discovery of the androgen dependence of this cancer in the 1940s followed by the androgen receptor itself in the 1960s, the 1980&#x02013;1990s saw the development of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists and the first oral antiandrogens flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide.<xref rid="b3-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The cornerstone of therapy for advanced prostate cancer continues to be growth inhibition through androgen blockade leading to apoptosis of cancer cells. First-line treatments target a serum testosterone level of &#x0003c;50 ng/dL, termed castration. Trials have continued to explore the benefits of castration therapy vs combined androgen blockade with oral antiandrogens added to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists.<xref rid="b4-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Prostate cancer eventually becomes resistant to castration, and an early marker is a rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) despite serum testosterone levels &#x0003c;50 ng/dL. PSA progression is defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 as a 25% increase and a minimum rise of 2 ng/mL in PSA above the nadir, confirmed with a second value 3 or more weeks later.<xref rid="b6-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Despite being termed castrate resistant, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to be dependent on androgen receptor signaling, which led to the development of new second-generation antiandrogens. Recently approved agents for the metastatic castration resistant setting include enzalutamide and abiraterone, with several ongoing clinical trials for additional agents.<xref rid="b7-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for metastatic CRPC recommend treatment with either hormone therapy, chemotherapy, enzalutamide, or abiraterone with prednisone, or pursue clinical trial.<xref rid="b9-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a second-generation antiandrogen that binds the androgen receptor at its ligand-binding domain, inhibiting its activation, and may be more potent than its first-generation predecessors.<xref rid="b10-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It is dosed at 160 mg oral daily with no hepatic or renal adjustment, although the dosing for a creatinine clearance of &#x0003c;30 mL/min is not defined.<xref rid="b12-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in oncology are increasingly being evaluated for in clinical trials because clinicians have been found to underreport symptoms and PROs have been found to impact disease trajectory.<xref rid="b13-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A single-center randomized study of 776 patients from 2007 to 2011 found that routine assessments of PROs led to improved quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="b14-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In this study, patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced solid tumors were randomized to reporting 12 symptoms via tablets vs usual care.

The primary outcome was a clinically meaningful improvement in the validated EQ-5D survey, with a 6-point decline being clinically meaningful. Patients had similar baseline characteristics. The results showed a median decline of 7.1 points in the usual care group as compared to a 1.4-point decline in the symptom reporting group (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

All four trials evaluated FACT-P scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-rru-8-217">Table 2</xref>). These instruments have been examined for internal consistency, or how well each item measures the same underlying dimension, as expressed by the variable Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. Commonly accepted ranges for Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha are as follows: 0.6&#x02013;0.69 for acceptable, 0.70&#x02013;0.79 for good, and 0.8&#x02013;1.0 for high. FACT-P has an alpha range of 0.87&#x02013;0.89.</p><p>The AFFIRM trial comparing enzalutamide to placebo in patients with mCRPC after chemotherapy collected FACT-P before randomization, on Weeks 13, 17, 21, 25, and every 12 weeks thereafter as long as they remained on their assigned arm of the study.<xref rid="b15-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b20-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> They defined a QoL response as a 10-point improvement on two consecutive measurements at least 3 weeks apart, a commonly accepted value for response in FACT-P. Of the 800 and 399 patients on the enzalutamide and placebo arms, 81% and 64% had FACT-P data included in the analysis, respectively. Mean baseline FACT-P scores were 108.7 in the enzalutamide group and 110.6 in the placebo group.

FACT-P decline was defined as time to a 10-point or greater decline in score, also with no requirement for a consecutive measurement. The trial did not report how often FACT-P was obtained or the percentage of patients who were included in the analysis.

A significant FACT-P change was defined as a 10-point deviation from baseline with no requirement for a repeat measurement. The frequency at which FACT-P was administered or the percentage of patients included in the calculations was not reported. The median time to deterioration was 13.8 months for the enzalutamide group vs 8.5 months for the bicalutamide group.

About 36% of the enzalutamide group and 27% of the placebo group had a clinically meaningful improvement (95% CI: [1.4&#x02013;16.7]). Of the 248 patients on the enzalutamide arm and the 135 patients on the placebo arm, pain progression at Week 25 by the BPI-SF occurred in 30.6% of the patients on enzalutamide and in 35% of the patients on placebo (95% CI: [&#x02212;14.0 to 5.7]). Common AEs in this population included fatigue (37.5% vs 26% for enzalutamide and placebo, respectively), back pain (27.4% vs 19.2%), constipation (23.7% vs 17.5%), arthralgias (19.6% vs 13.4%), decreased appetite (22.1% vs 18.8%), hot flushes (15.5% vs 6.8%), diarrhea (18.6% vs 15.8%), and hypertension (11% vs 3.4%). Falls occurred in 19.2% of patients taking enzalutamide and 7.9% of patients taking placebo. AEs leading to death occurred in 17 patients taking enzalutamide and 23 patients taking placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the new therapies available for patients with advanced prostate cancer, it will be important to know the impact of these medications on PROs. Overall, in regard to enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC, the current studies suggest that they have favorable overall QoL scores compared to standard of care. This finding is also suggested in patients aged 75 years and older. Enzalutamide also seemed to show improved pain progression in the short term compared to placebo. The more frequently reported AEs included fatigue, back pain, and hot flashes. There were also a few patients who had adverse cardiovascular events or seizures.</p><p>There have been significant advances in methods for assessing PROs, and PCWG3 has laid out more specific recommendations for PROs as compared to its predecessor PCWG2.<xref rid="b6-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b27-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The group recommends reporting on clinically meaningful scores using previously validated instruments for outcomes such as time to deterioration of physical function and health-related QoL scores. For each reported outcome (eg, pain palliation), they recommend assessing for a clinically meaningful level (eg, 4 on a 10-point pain scale) at baseline with reassessment every 3&#x02013;4 weeks, at treatment discontinuation, and 2&#x02013;4 weeks later. Patient-reported pain has been studied the most in patients with prostate cancer, with an association with mortality, and PCWG3 additionally recommends serial scores over several days to get an accurate baseline, as pain scores can vary greatly over a week. They also suggest taking into account opioid use and assessment of pain interference with daily activities.<xref rid="b28-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> If patient-reported symptoms from AEs are collected, the National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s patient-centered PRO-CTCAE assessment scale should be used.<xref rid="b29-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The AFFIRM trial had the most rigorous approach to analysis of PROs. The FACT-P deterioration cutoff required two consecutive questionnaires showing the same deterioration, and BPI-SF was obtained on consecutive days for a week to obtain more representative pain scores, consistent with PCWG3 guidelines. However, this also led to a lower survey completion rate compared to other trials. The impact of the 22% of patients who did not fill out the requisite number of FACT-P surveys or the 31% of patients who did not fill out adequate numbers of BPI-SF surveys is unknown. On the other hand, the PREVAIL trial did not require two consecutive surveys to demonstrate a significant QoL improvement or multiple pain surveys over time, which likely decreases the precision of the results. Finally, STRIVE and TERRAIN trials did not report how their QoL surveys were collected, at what intervals, and response rate, making it more challenging to draw conclusions regarding their results. In addition, only the AFFIRM, PREVAIL, and TERRAIN trials exclusively studied the population in question, those who have metastatic CRPC. For overall health-related QoL, AFFIRM, PREVAIL, and TERRAIN trials showed that enzalutamide compared favorably to placebo and low-dose bicalutamide. The STRIVE trial did not show a significant difference in median time to deterioration of the FACT-P. This may be because about one-third of the participants did not have metastatic disease while on the trial and thus may not have been as symptomatic as those with more advanced disease. Studies of patients with CRPC show a significant decline in QoL measurements, with pain being one of the most sensitive markers for deterioration.<xref rid="b30-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This may also explain why PREVAIL found a significant difference in pain progression at Week 13, but not at Week 25. Of the studies that looked at pain progression at Week 13, enzalutamide performed better than placebo.</p><p>Despite the additional recommendations set forth by the PCWG3 for reporting of PROs, there continues to be debate regarding how the data should be collected and analyzed. Systematic reviews of commonly used and validated health-related QoL instruments suggest that a more targeted questionnaire for patients with prostate cancer such as the University of California &#x02013; Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) or the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) may provide more insight.<xref rid="b31-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In addition, there are currently no guidelines on how to report longitudinal changes, and some trials use a time to deterioration analysis, whereas others use a linear mixed model approach.<xref rid="b32-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Another limitation of these surveys is that PROs are secondary end points and all the four trials had a subset of patients who do not complete consecutive surveys, which can introduce attrition bias. Future trials will have to show more consistency in survey selection, frequency, and time points at which PROs are measured to yield more clinically useful information. In addition, these findings will have to be carefully applied to the real-world setting as patients in the community may have more symptomatic disease at baseline.</p><p>A similar agent used in the metastatic castration-resistant setting is the CYP-17 inhibitor and antiandrogen abiraterone.<xref rid="b33-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Currently, there are no completed head-to-head trials comparing enzalutamide with any other agents. In trials of patients with mCRPC with or without prior chemo, abiraterone plus prednisone has been shown to decrease FACT-P degradation compared with prednisone alone.<xref rid="b34-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-rru-8-217" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In the COU-AA-301 trial, patients with mCRPC who had previously received chemotherapy were randomized to abiraterone or placebo, which showed improved OS in a preplanned interim analysis (median OS: 14.8 months vs 10.9 months; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: [0.54&#x02013;0.77]; <italic>p</italic>=0.001). The median time to FACT-P degradation was 13.8 months vs 8.3 months for the abiraterone plus prednisone vs prednisone-alone group, respectively (HR: 0.607, 95% CI: [0.495&#x02013;0.743]; <italic>p</italic>=0.0001). In the COU-AA-302 trial, patients with mCRPC were randomized to abiraterone plus prednisone or prednisone alone prior to chemotherapy, and they also showed improved OS (median OS 34.7 months vs 30.3 months; HR: 0.81, 95% CI: [0.7&#x02013;0.93]; <italic>p</italic>=0.003). In this trial, the median time to FACT-P degradation was 12.7 months in the abiraterone plus prednisone group and 8.3 months in the prednisone only group (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: [0.66&#x02013;0.92]; <italic>p</italic>=0.003). Other agents that are currently being tested in the mCRPC population include the second-generation antiandrogen ODM-201 (NCT02799602), and potentially in the future, antiandrogen apalutamide (ARN-509). There are several studies that will examine enzalutamide compared with combinations including chemotherapy, zoledronic acid, radiation, and ADT that are actively recruiting including NCT00268476 (STAMPEDE), NCT02254785, and NCT02677896.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Julie N Graff has received research funding and an honorarium from Astellas Pharma, Inc.
