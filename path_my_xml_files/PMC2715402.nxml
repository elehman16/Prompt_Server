People addicted to heroin often require prescribed medication when attempting to cease their drug use. The most commonly used detoxification agents in UK prisons are currently buprenorphine and methadone, both are recommended by national clinical guidelines. However, these agents have never been compared for opiate detoxification in the prison estate and there is a general paucity of research evaluating the most effective treatment for opiate detoxification in prisons. This study seeks to address this paucity by evaluating the most routinely used interventions amongst drug users within UK prisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study uses randomised controlled trial methodology to compare the open use of buprenorphine and methadone for opiate detoxification, given in the context of routine care, within three UK prisons. Prisoners who are eligible and give informed consent will be entered into the trial. The primary outcome will be abstinence status eight days after detoxification, as determined by a urine test. Secondary outcomes will be recorded during the detoxification and then at one, three and six months post-detoxification.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN58823759</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the United Kingdom (U.K), there is an extensive market for the sale of heroin, an illicit class 'A' drug. Precise figures of how many people use and are dependent on heroin are difficult to establish as there has never been a national prevalence survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, a 2004 survey found that 67% of people receiving drug treatment (out of a population of 125 545) identified heroin as their main problem drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The link between crime and illicit drug use, specifically heroin use, is well recognised. In 2002, 63% of injecting drug users (IDUs) in contact with specialist drugs services in England and Wales reported having ever been in prison or a young offenders' institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Because of the drug's highly addictive properties, those addicted to illicit opiates such as heroin require medical help in reducing and stopping their use.</p><p>Previously, neither the evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] nor the UK national guidelines on the clinical management of drug misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] stipulated a 'drug of choice' for opiate detoxification in the prison setting. In the absence of an established evidence base, a wide variety of agents have therefore been used, they include methadone, dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, lofexidine and clonidine. Currently, methadone and buprenorphine are recommended by national clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Prior to the mid 2000s, the most commonly used drug for opiate detoxification had been dihydrocodeine. Anecdotally, dihydrocodeine was used because of a reluctance to prescribe methadone following a small number of methadone related deaths in prisons. Dihydrocodeine is attractive to clinicians as it has a shorter half-life than methadone, and seems equally acceptable to users. There was a move away from prescribing dihydrocodeine because of its potential for diversion by prisoners into the prison shadow economy, buprenorphine has been increasingly prescribed. Buprenorphine &#x02013; in the form of sub-lingual tablets &#x02013; has the potential advantage of having a good safety profile, a higher rate of adherence and lower withdrawal severity when compared to methadone, lofexidine or clonidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Its introduction into the prison estate was in line with increasing prescribing in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. An evidence base exists in the community for the effectiveness of methadone in achieving detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In 2004, policy initiatives recommended increasing the provision of methadone programmes within the prison setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Consequently, methadone was re-introduced into the prison estate in accordance with current best practice guidelines for prescription and administration.</p><p>Despite the changes highlighted above regarding recommendations for first-line agents, few clinical trials conducted in the UK prison setting have evaluated medication for opiate detoxification. Whilst one study evaluated the withdrawal severity of methadone and lofexidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the rates of completion were not sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference between the two medications. In 2004, the Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) team conducted the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine for opiate detoxification in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The research team then compared these two agents in a pilot trial in HMP (Her Majesty's Prison) Leeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and recently submitted the results for publication. The LEEDS trial has since expanded to compare the open use of buprenorphine to methadone across healthcare in several prisons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>LEEDS is a pragmatic open label randomised controlled trial.</p><p>Randomisation is by random block size, which CA administers centrally. He prepares opaque consecutively numbered envelopes. If a prisoner is both eligible and agreeable, the next envelope is opened and the intervention allocated. Randomisation controls for confounding variables (e.g. doctor-participant relationships, drugs worker-participant).</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and Recruitment</title><p>The study is taking place in prison healthcare at HMP Leeds and HMP New Hall in West Yorkshire and HMP Durham in County Durham, England. All prisons are category B. (this refers to a prison which is high but not maximum security). HMP Leeds is a local prison, it accepts only adult male prisoners aged 21 and over from West Yorkshire. HMP New Hall, based in a rural location, is a local women's prison for adult females. HMP Durham accepts male prisoners from the North East of England. NB, RH and BR recruit participants from the medical reception area on first arrival into HMP Leeds, where prisoners are routinely offered a detoxification regime. Recruitment began in HMP Leeds in January 2006, HMP Durham in February 2007 and in HMP New Hall in January 2008. Data collection is ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>In the situation of helping people detoxify from heroin, even a small advantage for an intervention could represent a worthwhile benefit. Therefore LEEDS has been planned to detect even a 15% difference in the proportion of opiate-free patients within the detoxification period i.e. percentage already abstinence 35% in one group and 50% in the other group. LEEDS expects to recruit 340 participants. A sample size of 340 people would yield at least an 80% chance (1 - &#x003b2; error or power) of detecting an absolute difference of 15% between the proportion of opiate-free patients in each group, at a two sided 5% level of significance (&#x003b1; error).</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1.

Firstly, once data collection is complete, we hope to show either a statistically significant difference between the efficacy of the two detoxification agents or alternatively, that no statistically significant difference exists (shown by p = &#x0003e; 0.05). We expect that the results will influence national prison healthcare policy and prescribing guidelines if the trial demonstrates one detoxification agent is significantly more efficacious than another.</p><p>Information about the methodological practicalities of conducting a multi centre, randomised controlled trial in the prison setting will be valuable. The research team have previously described the practicalities of conducting a detoxification RCT in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To our knowledge, however, only one British prison RCT comparing detoxification agents exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] aside from our prison pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, conducting this current trial will provide new knowledge about the feasibility, practicality and day to day groundwork and management involved in running a trial in multiple prisons. This information may be important for future research teams. If successful, the trial will demonstrate the feasibility of multi centre trials within this environment.</p><p>Guidelines for substance misuse treatment in prison are not grounded on an established evidence base as there are very few trials conducted in this setting. Consequently, the project team envisage that this trial will provide valuable data about the efficacy of two routinely used detoxification agents which have rarely been studied within the prison environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Approvals process</title><p>The extensive process of obtaining all necessary approvals for this trial and the issues surrounding this have been fully discussed in Sheard et al (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].
