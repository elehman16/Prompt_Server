By 2020, it is projected to reach 70 years.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Women' health concerning issues emphasize on healthy living including dietary modifications, lifestyle changes, exercise, use of supplemental nutrients as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants over and above specific medications for disease comorbidities. This has lead to emergence of new concept of Vitamin D deficiency due to sedentary lifestyle remaining indoor, lack of sunshine, and dietary intake leads to deficiency of Vitamin D.</p><p>The sources of Vitamin D are adequate sunshine exposure, normal dietary intake, and pharmaceutical supplementation. The main source of Vitamin D is its skin synthesis under the influence of solar ultraviolet B radiation which accounts for 80%&#x02013;90% of Vitamin D in humans. In comparison to skin synthesis, the dietary supply of Vitamin D is minor and amounts only to 10%&#x02013;20% of total Vitamin D; however, it can become a significant source of Vitamin D if enriched with supplementation.</p><p>The consequences of Vitamin D deficiency start in the middle age and come to forefront in old age. Thus, elderly are prone to develop Vitamin D deficiency because of various risk factors: decreased dietary intake, diminished sunlight exposure, using sunscreen products, reduced skin thickness, impaired intestinal absorption, and impaired hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys. Furthermore, an increasing epidemic of obesity, which results in sequestration of Vitamin D in adipose tissue, also leads to an increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Although association of Vitamin D deficiency with osteoporosis,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] viral infections,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] tuberculosis,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] HIV,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] cardiovascular diseases,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] diabetes,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] multiple sclerosis,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and mortality[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] has been established by many authors, not much research has been done on the association of Vitamin D deficiency with gynecological (urogenital) disorders.</p><p>Vitamin D is known to be involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of body cells, especially squamous epithelium, present in the vagina.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Therefore, this vitamin could be effective in proliferation and repair of epithelial vaginal tissue.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Vitamin D deficiency is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), and this link may contribute to the strong racial disparity in the prevalence of BV.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Anatomical and physiological changes in the vagina are associated with postmenopausal decline in circulating estrogen levels and aging.

Test group (Group A) comprised 100 patients having gynecological diseases associated with Vitamin D deficiency and control group (Group B) comprised 100 participants (normal participants or having generalized nonspecific complaints). Females aged more than 65 years attending the outpatient department/Indoor of Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Amritsar, were enrolled in this study. Data thus obtained were statistically analyzed. Participants of more than 65 years of age and those having chronic renal disease, already taking calcium and Vitamin D, were excluded from this study.</p><p>An informed written consent of the patient was obtained before inclusion. Clinical history and detailed general physical examination and local pelvic examination were performed as per predetermined parameters. Appropriate laboratory values as per clinical requirement, ultrasound examination for any pelvic pathology, and other relevant investigations related to pelvic floor diseases and tumors were performed.</p><p>Classification of urinary incontinence was based on the &#x0201c;incontinence severity index which is a questionnaire composed of two items which assesses the frequency (four levels) and amount (three levels) of urine leakage. The index value (1&#x02013;12) is reached by multiplying the two items. Women with a score of 3 or higher were considered to be incontinent and those with scores lower than 3 as continent.</p><p>Classification of fecal incontinence was based on the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) which measured the severity of liquid, solid, mucus, or gas incontinence with severity scale varying from &#x0201c;two or more times per day,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;once per day,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;two or more times per week,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;once a week,&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;1&#x02013;3 times per month.&#x0201d; Patient-weighted scores were used to determine severity of symptoms with scores ranging from 0 to 61, where higher scores indicate worse fecal incontinence severity. A FISI score of 0 indicates continence.</p><p>Modified vaginal health index (MVHI) was calculated. Seven parameters are included in MVHI. Each parameter is graded from 1 to 3, and total score ranges from 7 to 21.

Moisture/consistency of the fluid was measured by putting the vaginal fluid on a clean glass slide for grading [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Rugosity and elasticity was assessed by inspection and palpation of vaginal mucosa by the index finger. Length of the vagina was measured by the index finger and Ayre's spatula from the highest point in the vagina till the vulval outlet. The mean of the two measurements was taken as average length. Epithelial integrity was assessed by the presence of petechiae on the vaginal wall by pressure of index finger. Vascularity was assessed by inspection of the color of the vagina.

Treatment of Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in geriatric women could improve pelvic muscle strength, with a possible reduction in the prevalence of PFDs including POP and urinary incontinence and positive impact on vaginal tissues as it improved MVHI. Given the increase in the number of patients with gynecological disorders in geriatric age, further evaluation of the role of Vitamin D as a modifiable causative factor in these diseases is warranted.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Husain</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is health status of elderly worsening in India?
