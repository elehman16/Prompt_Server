The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of supervised physical exercise on depression level of perinatal subjects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Subjects/Intervention:</title><p>60 subjects who fulfill the selection criteria were randomly assigned to exercise (Group-1, n=30) and control group (Group-2, n=30). Participants completed general screening form and Physical health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) before their intervention and again 4 weeks and 8 weeks later. Group-1 underwent aerobic training with 60-65% maximum heart rate and Group-2 was prescribed with handouts for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Statistics:</title><p>Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was use to analyze group differences over time while controlling for baseline differences.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>Demographic and the baseline values show homogenous population (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).

It is associated with profound physical and emotional changes and associated risks for the onset or exacerbation of several mental disorders such as depression.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In addition to its effects on the mother's well-being, perinatal depression is associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Relevant effective interventions are being developed, but their effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries may be limited by various factors.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Exercise can provide a viable treatment options for depressed patients, whether as an alternative treatment strategy to conventional treatments or as a supplemental strategy, either in the short-term or long-term.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Research to date by low numbers to support the use of exercise in some form as a positive treatment option for individuals suffering from depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Perinatal depression subjects from rural sub-district. (Sayla) of Surendranagar district, Gujarat, India were selected. All married women aged 17&#x02013;40 years with low socioeconomic status in their second trimester of pregnancy, who had depression, were considered. Women with a diagnosed medical condition, pregnancy-related illness, significant physical or intellectual disability, post par tumor other form of psychosis, and severe depressions were excluded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>During the pre-intervention assessment, subjects have undergone Kuppuswamy's socioeconomic status scale and the Physical Health Questionnaire-9. Data collectors were blind to the treatment status. Subjects were randomized to one of two subgroups of 30. (i.e. Groups 1 and 2) during January 2012 to December 2012. Both groups were asked to attend post-intervention assessment 4 and 8 weeks following the start of the program to complete the questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exercise group</title><p>Subjects in this group had 4 weeks exercise program, cycle 4 sessions a week for 40&#x02013;60 min/session. The exercise in each session were including: 10 min heating with walking, stretching and flexibility, and three sets of moderate intensity cycling in 6 min with 60&#x02013;65% of maximum heart rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Control group</title><p>Subjects in the control group were given a patient handout which is in Gujarati explaining about the procedures to do as home based program. The hand out consist of five criteria such as stay active, do something that you think is fun each day, spend time with people who help or support you, relaxing and set simple goals. The entire program lasted for 4 weeks.</p><p>Inter group analysis was done using Wilcoxon-Mann&#x02013;Whitney test and intra group analysis was done using one-way ANOVA. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 were accepted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 146 subjects, 80 (55%) met the inclusion criteria and 60 (41%) agreed to enroll. Four subjects were excluded from the analysis in the exercise group (Group 1) and 2 subjects were excluded from analysis in the control group (Group 2).</p><p>No significance differences between groups were found at baseline on outcome variable such as depression level. Analysis of depression level shows significant changes within and between exercise and control group. At baseline, the mean depression score was 15.96 (3.09) and 16.23 (3.38) for the exercise group and the control group, respectively. After the 4-weeks intervention, the mean score fell to 6.10 (2.44) for the exercise group (43.54%) and to 10.60 (2.74) for the control group (21.25%). At the 8 weeks follow-up, the mean score was 1.34 (1.09) for the exercise group (72.81%) and 5.03 (1.50) for the control group (42.50%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Exercise has been shown in a number of studies to prove beneficial in the treatment of depressive symptoms especially in perinatal and post natal conditions. Bartholomew showed that a single incidence of exercise can have a positive effect on mood. Maintaining the intensity and frequency of exercise recommended by most public health agencies were sufficient to provide a significant reduction in major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Exercise causes neurogenesis through the enhancement of four molecules counteracting the impact of MDD. The additional benefits of exercise to individuals suffering from depression include stress reduction, better attitude, improved outlook, self-confidence, and mental well-being.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Our intervention, the &#x0201c;physical exercises&#x0201d; was developed to provide a culturally appropriate, feasible, and evidence-based physical therapy intervention for women living in very poor communities in rural India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>These results suggest that supervised physical exercise provides better improvement in depression status in perinatal subjects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brockington</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postpartum psychiatric disorders</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2004</year><volume>363</volume><fpage>303</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14751705</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Creed</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Outcome of prenatal depression and risk factors associated with persistence in the first postnatal year: Prospective study from Rawalpindi, Pakistan</article-title><source>J Affect Disord</source><year>2007</year><volume>100</volume><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17098291</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Psychiatric Association.
