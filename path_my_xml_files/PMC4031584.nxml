The reasons for the betterment resulted in the introduction of second generation antipsychotics (SGA's), which are supposed to be more patient friendly with lesser extra pyramidal symptoms lesser chances of inducing tardive dyskinesia and better impact on affective, cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The initial enthusiasm about SGA's within 5 years had settled down toward skeptical optimism to control the unwanted and potentially endangering metabolic side-effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Among the newer drugs except for aripiprazole and to some extent ziprasidone all other drugs produce significant weight gain and predispose the individual for hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. The land mark study on antipsychotic efficacy, safety and tolerability namely CATIE study had clearly shown that 74% of patients discontinued the treatment before 18 months of trial.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Intolerability was one of the major reason for the discontinuation, weight gain and metabolic effects with olanzapine was established in phase II, part of the study. However, the trend for metabolic syndrome is also noticed with clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine and to some extent with quetiapine, ziprasidone.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Modafinil is a novel, non-amphetamine psycho-stimulant though it is not a typical sympathomimetic amine and has only weak affinity for dopamine uptake carrier site. It also acts on anterior hypothalamic nucleus and adjacent area. It is currently being promoted for excessive daytime sleepiness that occurs in narcolepsy and also sleep apnea. In 5% of cases it is known to produce anorexia and increase the alertness.</p><p>As this drug also has got anorexia and weight loss as adverse events, it would be worthwhile to see, whether add-on therapy of modafinil with atypical, especially olanzapine, risperidone, clozapine (widely prescribed atypical in India) would in any way influence the metabolic side-effects such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (Summary of Product Characterstics of modafinil).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Primary objective</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate the effect of add on modafinil therapy on fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum cholesterol levels in patients receiving olanzapine, risperidone or clozapine as compared with placebo add-on.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate the tolerability of modafinil.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To study whether modafinil affects the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study sample</title><p>At baseline there were 72 patients, out of that only 63 completed the total study period.

It was proved by the significant improvement of BPRS and CGI-S scores when compared from baseline to week 3 and also at end of the study that was at week 12. There was no significant difference between placebo and modafinil in improving the psychotic features. It clearly proves that modafinil did not have any potential to exacerbate the psychosis. Hence in conclusion, modafinil could be safely administered with atypical antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Common adverse events noted in the study period</title><p>During the total 12 weeks of study period only few adverse effects were noted, which were only mild in intensity and resolved on their own over a period of time. Following were the adverse events noted:</p><p>Headache, disturbed sleep, mild gastro intestinal difficulties, agitation and decreased appetite.</p><p>None of these adverse events required any active intervention. There was only one case of re-emergence of Mania in the study. The blind was broken and when patient was found to be on modafinil, he/she was taken away from the study. Later it was found out that it could have been due to poor compliance and after admission and reinstitution of the anti-psychotic regimen the illness remitted successfully. This finding is unlike what was observed with anti-obesity drugs.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Impact of modafinil on fasting blood sugar and fasting serum cholesterol</title><p>In this study, an attempt was also made to correlate; weight loss achieved with modafinil could be translated into biochemical terms. In fact that FBG does not showed any significant change in both groups. However, FSC showed significant changes in patients with modafinil group. From baseline to week 3, there was a significant raise in FSC and from week 3 to week 12 again there was a fall in FSC. Similar biochemical changes that could be possible due to the direct effect of the modafinil are not available. Hence, modafinil could not be considered a drug for hypercholesterolemia like satins in controlling hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Though topiramate was tried a some of the drugs to control antipsychotic induced obesity, no studies were available, which studied agents controlling hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia associated with antipsychotic usage.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Though fenfluramine, amantadine and robexetene a Nor Epinephrine (NE) specific reuptake inhibitor could be potential candidates there role would be limited as they could either worsen psychotic features and may produce a manic shift in bipolar disorders.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In this study, no attempt was made to measure any cognitive changes with modafinil in comparison to placebo as the population constituted the multiple diagnoses and more than one antipsychotic; already some studies are in progress which is looking at modafinil as a cognitive enhancer in schizophrenia.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that modafinil even at a dosage of 200 mg is efficacious adjuvant treatment in controlling atypical antipsychotic induced weight gain and some of the metabolic parameters. It was found to be well-tolerated without major side-effects. Further clinical research is necessary to prove the fact that modafinil is an effective add on therapy. A higher dose of modafinil should also be explored in those who could tolerate it.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Present study was a randomized, placebo controlled trail, using a double-blind technique. Findings point out the modafinil could be a potential candidate in selected group of patients to decrease some of the unwanted adverse events such as weight gain, daytime drowsiness and metabolic syndrome produced by atypicals. However, as the sample size was small and many atypicals were included and the population studied was not homogeneous for the duration of drug therapy and as the study duration was 12 weeks, this study finding definitely requires future replication.</p><p>In the light of present findings a multi-center randomized study using a good comparator like topiramate, which had proven efficacy in decreasing weight have to be under taken, using a bigger sample.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This was a convenient sample.</p><p>Consented people, at least few of them were more motivated and modafinil might have motivated them to change their food habits and life-style.</p><p>A large sample than this concentrating on one atypical drug would have decisively answered the hypothesis.</p><p>Crossover at the end of 12 weeks from placebo to modafinil and vice versa for the next 12 weeks would have strongly established the role of modafinil as a useful adds on.</p><p>No active comparator was used as a third arm to make sure that changes with modafinil were not apparent.</p><p>The dosage of modafinil was fixed in the study. A flexible dosage ranges higher than 200 mg might have further influenced the outcome of the study.</p><p>The improvement in psychosis, might have contributed as body image changes were not studied between the groups.</p><p>Drug attitude inventory could not be applied - hence acceptability of modafinil as an add-on could not be studied.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The author acknowledged all the help rendered by M/S Sun Pharmaceuticals for their interest and
