result from core muscles instability that can lead to pain and altered dynamic balance.
The objective of this study is to assess the effect of core muscle strengthening on pain
and dynamic balance in female patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty female patients with age ranging from 16 to 40&#x02005;years with patellofemoral
pain syndrome were divided into study (N=10) and control (N=10) groups. Both groups were
given 4 weeks of conventional physical therapy program and an additional core muscle
strengthening for the study group. The tools used to assess the outcome were Visual
Analogue Scale and Star Excursion Balance Test. [Results] The results of the study show
that participants in the study group revealed a significantly greater improvement in the
intensity of pain and dynamic balance as compared to the control group. [Conclusion]
Adding a core muscle-strengthening program to the conventional physical therapy management

which accounts for 20&#x02013;40% of all knee problems in adolescents and active young adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
PFPS is described as retropatellar or anterior knee aching pain without any other specific
pathology and characterized by crepitation in the patellofemoral joint during and after
weight bearing activities, such as squatting, walking up or down stairs and running. The
other characteristic features of PFPS include pain while sitting with the knees flexed,
instability, occasional weakness and locking sensations<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The incidence of PFPS is 22/1,000 persons per year and is the most
common cause of knee pain, with women affected more than men at a ratio of 2:1<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although, PFPS has many possible causative
factors that are usually connected to maladies in biomechanics, the insufficient dynamic
balance of the torso and lower extremity can also contribute to the development of PFPS. The
dynamic balance is important, especially while performing movements that incorporate loading
like climbing the stairs, performing squats and jumps<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The individuals having PFPS
are found to have significant low- pressure pain threshold (local hyperalgesia) than healthy
subjects<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The first line of treatment for PFPS is conservative management, which includes
non-operative interventions consisting of rest, ice, and drugs to manage inflammations,
adjustment of activities, and physical therapy. The physical therapy management includes
specific exercises targeting the knee, such as strengthening exercises for the quadriceps.
Published studies show improvement in pain when subjects performed quadriceps exercises<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are also hip strengthening exercises.
Many studies stated that subjects who have enrolled in a program that targeted the abductors
and external rotators of hip reported a moderate reduction in pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The other
treatment techniques like stretching exercises for the iliotibial band (IT), tensor fascia
latae, hamstrings and the quadriceps, also showed greater benefits among the PFPS
patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patellar taping has gained
widespread acceptance as a management option for PFPS<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Operative intervention could also be considered when conservative
treatments are ineffective<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Nevertheless, many PFPS patients have a positive response when treated non-operatively. The
utilization of exercises in the treatment program is supported by evidence<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The common goal of rehabilitation
management in PFPS patients is to address the pain and thereby improve the physical
function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physical therapists or
clinicians use self- reported assessment of pain and function to check the effectiveness of
various physical therapy interventions. The most common tool used to measure the intensity
of pain in these patients is the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which is a reliable and valid
measure to assess the intensity of pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Dynamic balance refers to the capability of having suitable reactions regarding the motor
system, in order to be able to cope up with the requirements needed for the quick
alterations of position in the torso, while performing activities that add stress on the
knee joint. Operationally, the dynamic stability may be defined as the ability of the body
to maintain position or intended trajectory after external or internal disturbances<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A stable erect body posture, or any specific joint, is controlled by
the neuromuscular system in relation to the shift in the involved parts at the time of
action including the core<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain may also
affect dynamic balance in individuals with PFPS<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Deficiency in the control of the neuromuscular system of the
body&#x02019;s trunk or &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; may affect the dynamic stability of the lower extremity, which can
lead to injury in the tibiofemoral or patellofemoral joints<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The spine, abdominal region, pelvis, hips, and proximal lower extremities, are defined as
the core of the body. This is sometimes defined as a muscular box, with the diaphragm as the
roof, the pelvic floor and hip girdle musculature as the base, abdominals in the front, and
the paraspinal and gluteal muscles in the back<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. These muscles&#x02019; strength allows the system to stabilize the spine
mechanically and then distribute and deliver translational, compressive, and shear forces to
and from the rest of the body<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The core
or the compound of muscles consists of the static and dynamic anatomy at the zone that
serves as the foundation in order to move the extremity<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of core muscle strengthening have been proven as an
effective method of management in various cases<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies states that the knee is the frequently injured
joint in core instability with the decreased hip strength<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though there are
many studies on the management issues of PFPS, so far, there are no studies about the
effectiveness of the core muscle stability program for the improvement of pain and balance
in PFPS patients. The objective of this study is to define the effectiveness of core muscle
strengthening program in improving pain and dynamic balance in females with PFPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a Quasi experimental study that included 20 females diagnosed with PFPS, with the
age between 16 and 40&#x02005;years, who were referred from the Orthopedic department. Subjects were
randomly assigned to either core muscle strengthening exercise group (Exp; N=10) or control
(Con; N=10) group. This age interval has been chosen because the majority of the women are
beyond puberty by 16&#x02005;years of age, and after 40&#x02005;years of age, there is an increased
prevalence of hormonal changes and arthritis development<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The randomization was made by an investigator who was not involved
in the assessment or management of patients. The randomization was done with Microsoft Excel

anterior knee pain for at least 4 weeks that was aggravated by at least 2 of the following
activities: jumping, running, prolonged sitting, stair climbing, kneeling, and squatting;
positive patellar grinding test; must be active for at least 30&#x02005;min a day almost all days of
the week. In addition, they should have an average pain intensity level of 30&#x02005;mm on a 100&#x02005;mm

tendon, or pes anserine tendons, patellar apprehension sign if positive,
Sinding-Larsen-Johanssen syndromes or Osgood-Schlatter disease, evidence of joint effusion,
referred pain from the hip or lumbar region, known case of articular cartilage damage (from
previously obtained imaging), any previous surgery around the knee, any spinal or lower
extremity deformities, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or corticosteroid long use,
pregnancy, athlete type training (a person who participates in a specific sport at least 2&#x02005;h

weeks, in addition to the conventional physical therapy program. The control group was given
only the conventional intervention program during the same time period. All the subjects
were recruited from King Abdul Aziz University Hospital, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Information was given to all subjects about the study procedures and a written, signed
consent form has been obtained from each subject. The study has been approved by the
Institutional Ethical Review Committee.</p><p>The outcome measures used in the current study were: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Star
Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Both these measures were assessed at the start of the study
and at the end of the 4 weeks of intervention. The VAS is a reliable tool used to assess the
level of pain intensity from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates maximum
unbearable pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinically meaningful improvement in the VAS pain score is 20&#x02005;mm.
Any patient who achieves this score is considered to have a successful outcome<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SEBT for the lower quarter is a functional screening tool, commonly used to examine the
balance of the lower extremity. For this test, subjects were asked to adopt a single-leg
stance and it was requested of them to perform a maximal reach with the opposite leg, along
the marked lines, while keeping the weight bearing leg placed at the center, with good
stability, followed by return to the initial upright posture, without losing the balance.
This test was performed in three reach directions: anterior (ANT), posterolateral (PL) and
posteromedial (PM). All participants performed pre-test trials with demonstration and verbal
instructions. Subjects were permitted 3 trials of practice in each direction before the
actual test performance<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. All
participants performed the test on the unaffected leg first and then on the affected leg.
Participants had 15-seconds rest intervals between each test with the same leg and on the
same direction. One minute of rest was given between reaches in the different directions and
when changing feet. A trial was repeated if: (a) the subject was not able to maintain single
leg stance, (b) the heel of the stance foot did not remain in contact with the floor, (c)
weight was shifted onto reach foot, or (d) the subject did not maintain start and return
positions for one full second. Three trials of reach distances for each direction were
averaged and normalized to limb length (% LL, cm). The limb length was measured from the
anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus bilaterally. Overall, 6 different SEBT
scores were calculated: 3 directional scores on the affected (A) leg (SEBTANT-A, SEBTPL-A,
and SEBTPM-A) and 3 directional scores on the unaffected (U) leg (SEBTANT-U, SEBTPL-U, and
SEBTPM-U). Finally, the 6 SEBT was averaged in a single composite SEBT score per participant
(SEBTCOM)<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The core muscle strength training program lasted for 4 weeks and comprised of 3 training
sessions per week, with a total of 12 sessions for the study group. Each session lasted for
30 to 45 minutes, starting with a brief warm-up exercise program consisting of low-intensity
core strength exercises to prepare the neuromuscular system for the training loads and
ending with a cool-down program (i.e., dynamic stretching)<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the main part of the training, the &#x0201c;big 3&#x0201d; exercises as
described byMcGill<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> were conducted.
These include the curl-up, side bridge, and quadruped position.</p><p><italic>Cross curl-ups</italic>: Subjects were made to lie in supine position, hands folded
behind the neck, elbows pointed to the sides, knees in a flexed position, feet rested on a
mat; subjects curled-up until the scapulae left the mat, and rotated to the left and right
at a moderate velocity.</p><p><italic>Side bridge (both sides)</italic>: Subjects were told to assume a side lying
position with knees flexed, the supporting shoulder superior to the respective elbow, the
uninvolved arm held in akimbo, and the supporting forearm flat on the mat; subjects raised
their hips until a straight line is reached from the knees up to the shoulders and they
continuously raised and lowered their hips at a moderate velocity.</p><p><italic>Quadrupedal stance (Birddog exercise)</italic>: Subjects were made to stay in a
quadrupedal stance, with both hands and knees flat on the surface; they lifted a leg and the
contralateral arm in horizontal position at moderate velocity.</p><p>Training intensity was progressively increased over the 4-weeks training program by
modulating lever lengths and repetitions. During training weeks 1&#x02013;2, participants performed
the &#x0201c;big 3&#x0201d; with 20 repetitions and in the weeks 3&#x02013;4, repetitions were increased to 23. Rest
for 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;min was taken between the exercises<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Conventional physical therapy program was designed based on the preliminary studies,
which suggest that eccentric exercises are more effective than concentric exercises, because
the primary function of the knee joint is eccentric<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to that, the quadriceps strengthening was given in the
form of eccentric contraction. The conventional program also included hip abductors and
external rotators strengthening exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isometric exercises for the quadriceps and hip abductors, like
illiotibial band and hamstring stretching exercises were also given as home programs<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. The common targeted impairments during
the physical therapy management are: weakness of muscles, tightness of muscle and soft
tissues, and poor movement quality. Among all these, the quadriceps muscle weakness is the
most commonly addressed issue during physical therapy, because studies show that there is
decreased pain and increased function in patients who received a strengthening program for
quadriceps muscle. However, the weakness of the hip abductors and external rotators muscle
was also addressed by physical therapy, because there are studies to prove that subjects
with PFPS have weakness of these muscles and strengthening of these hip muscles may be
helpful to decrease pain in this population<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data were statistically analyzed by using the statistical package SPSS for Windows

reducing pain and improving dynamic balance in female patients with PFPS. Even though the
effectiveness of core muscle strengthening has been proved by many previous studies in
various other preconditions, there is no published study to analyze the effectiveness of
core muscle strengthening for improving the pain and balance among the PFPS patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this study indicate that female patients with PFPS in
the study group showed a significant difference in terms of reduction in the intensity of
pain. This improvement could be achieved as an immediate effect, because strengthening of
the core muscles must have rectified the improper recruitment of the muscles, in order to
provide proximal stability, since patients with PFPS present a different recruitment
pattern. Rojhani Shirazi Z et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that improvement in core muscles could be an effective strategy in the
rehabilitation of patients with PFPS. Having a sufficient proximal stability would reduce
the stress load over the patellofemoral joint, which could be the other reason for the
significant pain reduction in the study group. Combining core strengthening with the
traditional physical therapy program also could be an effective factor for reduction in the
pain intensity. Earl JE &#x00026; Hoch AZ<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed in their study a significant improvement in terms of pain and function in women with
PFPS who received a proximal strengthening program, which is similar to our findings
regarding the improvement in pain. Another factor that must have contributed to the
reduction of pain might be the change in fear and avoidance beliefs about physical activity,
as this is the strongest predictor of function and pain outcomes<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The other main focus of this study was to test the change in dynamic balance among the PFPS
patients following a core muscle strengthening program and to the best of our knowledge;
this was the first study that has been conducted to analyze the effect of core muscle
strengthening on improving the balance among the PFPS patients. The study findings showed
that there was a significant improvement in the dynamic balance in the study group. The
decrease in pain intensity must have influenced the increased distances in SEBT. The
significant increase in dynamic balance is a confirmation of the proposed hypothesis, which
suggested that strengthening in the core muscles provides a better stability for the lower
limb movements allowing the occurrence of a smooth and stable movement. Strengthening the
core could have resulted in a smaller displacement in the mediolateral center of pressure
and also, in the center of mass. This means that, the motion at the level of the trunk and
hip is properly controlled, resulting in the significant dynamic balance improvement that
has been recorded in the study group. This outcome signifies that amelioration in the
control of body balance may be related to an improved neuromuscular control, which occurs
due to increased postural stability. Therefore, trunk strength and stability programs of the
hip-lumbo-pelvic complex should be considered as a major treatment strategy in the
improvement of the whole body balance<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Core muscle strengthening must have altered the sensory or motor pathways (or both), which
in turn influenced the ability of the patient to maintain the postural control. Moreover,
the reduced pain must have enhanced the magnitude of Vastus Medialis Oblique (VMO)
activation for the stabilization of the knee while performing the SEBT, which may allow the
subjects to maintain their balance in a better way, while attempting to reach far
distances<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Earl
&#x00026;Hertel<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>, in normal healthy
subjects, the activity of VMO was at peak level while doing the anterior reach of the SEBT.
Another explanation for increase in SEBT performance could be the biomechanical corrections
of the other joints in the lower extremity following the core strengthening.</p><p>Even though core muscle strengthening has been included as an intervention method, the
strength of the core muscles was not documented in the present study, as this was not an
objective of this study, but could be considered in the future studies. Some of the
limitations of our study include the relatively small sample size, although appropriate
statistical power was obtained. Studies with larger number of subjects should be performed.
The study has been conducted only in the female population, as it was clear from the
literature that PFPS is more common among the female subjects, as compared to their male
counterparts<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the results of
this study could be considered as a mode of treatment, even in the male population. In
conclusion, the study findings revealed that adding a core muscle strengthening program
along with the conventional physical therapy program can be beneficial for reducing the pain
intensity and improving the dynamic balance in females with PFPS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz
