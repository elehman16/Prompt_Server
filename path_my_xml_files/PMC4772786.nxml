The physical activity sessions were individualized and progressed toward a goal of 30 minutes of walking at moderate intensity, 3-5 minutes of large muscle group flexibility exercises, 10 minutes of primarily lower extremity strength training by means of ankle weights (two sets of 10 repetitions), and 10 minutes of balance training.

Assessment staff were blinded to the intervention. Race and ethnicity were reported by the participants and were collected according to the requirements of the National Institutes of Health. The short physical performance battery was reassessed at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, and physical activity at 6, 12, and 24 months. Self reported physical activity was assessed with the community healthy activities model program for seniors questionnaire (CHAMPS),<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> administered by unblinded staff, and objective physical activity was assessed by accelerometry over seven days (Actigraph; Pensacola, FL).<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>For the purpose of safety monitoring, unblinded staff recorded falls and serious fall injuries occurring during intervention sessions. These events were not included in the outcomes assessment unless ascertained by blinded staff.</p><sec><title>Outcomes assessment</title><p>We defined serious fall injury as a fall resulting in a clinical, non-vertebral fracture or that led to hospital admission for an injury. A fall was defined as an unexpected event in which the participant came to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Potential serious fall injuries were ascertained every six months through three questions: Since (last visit date), did a doctor tell you that you fractured or broke a bone? (If yes) Did you break a bone as a result of a fall?, and Other than the conditions we just asked you about, were you admitted to a hospital overnight for any other reasons since (last visit date)? Two experts blinded to group randomization subsequently reviewed and adjudicated independently relevant medical records, including those from all hospital admissions. If the reviewers disagreed, they discussed the case. If they still disagreed, the information was forwarded to the adjudication committee, which arrived at consensus.</p><p>A definite fall related fracture required the fulfillment of four criteria<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>: radiologic evidence of a non-vertebral, non-stress fracture<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>; report of a fall within one week of injury; absence of major trauma or periprosthetic fracture; and no evidence of pathologic fracture. The non-fracture serious fall injuries required hospital admission and one of the following: non-fracture head injury with loss of consciousness, bleeding by neuroimaging, major facial trauma, or other comparable sequela; consequences of a long lie, such as rhabdomyolysis, dehydration or volume depletion, or hypothermia; or other fall injury, such as a severe sprain.</p><p>As an additional outcome, which was not prespecified, we evaluated falls that led to persistent restricted activity, defined as affirmative responses to two questions: Since (last visit date), have you fallen?, and, Did this fall result in an inability to leave home for at least one week? The inclusion of this outcome allowed us to ascertain fall related events that were likely clinically important but did not meet the operational definition of a serious fall injury.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient involvement</title><p>No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We based the sample size for the LIFE Study on power for the primary outcome of major mobility disability. Given this sample size, the power required for detecting differences between the two intervention groups in serious fall injuries was based on preliminary data from the LIFE pilot study.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Adopting a two sided type 1 error of 0.05, assuming a 3% annual incidence rate of serious fall injuries in the health education group and 8% annual loss to follow-up, the planned sample size of 800 participants for each group yielded 80% and 90% power to detect relative hazard ratios of 0.54 and 0.49, respectively.</p><p>We tested the effect of the intervention on time until the first post-randomization serious fall injury based on a two tailed significance of 0.05 using the intention to treat approach. Event times were defined as the time from randomization until the adjudicated fall date, and censoring times were defined as the time from randomization until the last fall assessment or death. We used the Nelson-Aalen estimator to obtain cumulative incidence curves by intervention group. To compare interventions, we estimated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals and used likelihood ratio tests from Cox proportional hazards regression models, with the baseline hazard stratified by sex. We chose a priori not to stratify by field center owing to the relatively small number of anticipated serious fall injuries. Using Fine and Gray&#x02019;s approach for fitting proportional subdistribution hazard models to survival data with competing risks, we performed a sensitivity analysis considering death as a competing risk.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The types of serious fall injuries were enumerated for the two intervention groups, with the unit of measurement as people and injury. To compare the number of fractures, hospital admissions, and fractures or hospital admissions between groups, we calculated rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) using a negative binomial model, with log transformed total follow-up time as an offset. A Lagrange multiplier test was used to evaluate whether the scale variable in this model was equal to 0.</p><p>For serious fall injuries, we entered interaction terms into the Cox model (that is, separate models for each subgroup analysis) and used likelihood ratio tests to assess the consistency of the intervention effect across levels of four prespecified subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and physical performance) and one post hoc subgroup (self reported fall in the year before randomization). When analyzing the sex interaction, we did not stratify the baseline hazard by sex. Because a clinically meaningful, although non-significant, interaction was observed for sex, we completed several post hoc analyses including calculating cumulative incidence curves separately by sex; including all prespecified subgroup factors in the model when evaluating the effect of sex on the incidence of serious fall injuries; and evaluating the interaction between sex and the intervention for all serious fall injuries, fall related fractures, and fall related hospital admissions.</p><p>We calculated the proportion of participants with at least one fall leading to persistent restricted activity by intervention group. Risk ratios (95% confidence intervals) and a test for an interaction between intervention group and sex were obtained using Poisson regression, with log transformed follow-up time as an offset. We also used these methods to compare the risk of any fall over the entire follow-up period.</p><p>To understand better the sex specific results, we compared self reported and objectively measured physical activity between men and women by intervention group during the first two years of follow-up, which was the minimum duration of the intervention. For the self reported measure, we focused on walking and strength training activities. For the objective measure, we evaluated moderate activity based on accelerometry, using a definition of 760 counts/min.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We compared short physical performance battery scores between men and women by intervention group during follow-up. For each outcome, we used linear contrasts within the framework of mixed effects models to compare the average visit specific intervention effect for men versus women.</p><p>Finally, we calculated rates for falls and serious fall injuries that occurred during the physical activity and health education sessions.</p><p>We did not control for the increased risk of type I error resulting from multiple testing of the secondary and exploratory endpoints, instead viewing them as providing useful information that can potentially bolster interpretation of results for the primary endpoint, a position that has previously been expressed as reasonable in clinical trials.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> All analyses were performed in SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.4.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the two intervention groups were comparable (table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/>).

The results were consistent across several subgroups, including sex. In analyses that were not prespecified, the physical activity program was more effective in reducing the rate of all serious fall injuries, including fall related fractures and admissions to hospital, in men than in women.</p><p>Despite being the largest and longest trial of physical activity in older people,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the LIFE Study only had sufficient power to detect relatively large reductions in serious fall injuries. For the comparison of physical activity versus health education, the hazard ratio was 0.90 for serious fall injuries, which was a prespecified secondary outcome in the LIFE Study, and the rate ratio was 0.87. These null results were accompanied by a statistically significant 34% reduction in falls leading to persistent restricted activity, a finding that did not differ significantly between men and women.</p><p>In contrast to women, who showed no benefit, men randomized to physical activity experienced a 46% reduction in all serious fall injuries, including a 53% reduction in the rate of fall related fractures and a 59% reduction in the rate of fall injuries leading to admission to the hospital. Because the analyses were not prespecified, these sex specific results should be interpreted with caution and warrant replication in future studies. For comparisons between the two intervention groups, we found much larger differential increases in self reported and objectively measured physical activity in men than in women, providing one possible explanation for these results. Another possible explanation is that, in response to the physical activity program, men had greater improvements than women in their gait, balance, and muscle strength, as evidenced by their marginally greater benefit on short physical performance battery scores over time.</p><sec><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of seven exercise based clinical trials reported a pooled rate ratio of 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.90) for serious fall injuries.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Inconsistency across trials was deemed to be moderately large, with effect sizes ranging from 0.15 (0.02 to 1.16) to 0.94 (0.60 to 1.49).<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In contrast to interventions in these previous trials, the LIFE intervention was not designed specifically to prevent falls or serious fall injuries and may not have focused sufficiently on balance, a factor deemed to be important to the success of previous trials.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> None the less, the LIFE intervention has previously been shown to improve scores on the short physical performance battery,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> an integrative measure of gait, balance, and strength. Although an earlier systematic review and meta-analysis had raised concerns that increasing physical activity without adequate attention to balance might increase the risk of falling,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> we found no difference in the percentage of participants experiencing any fall between the physical activity and health education groups, despite large differences in physical activity between the groups, suggesting that balance training may have been adequate.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and strengths of this study</title><p>In addition to being underpowered to detect small, but possibly important reductions in the hazard of the prespecified outcome of first serious fall injury, our study has several other limitations. Firstly, the injurious fall outcome was limited to fractures and other serious fall injuries leading to hospital admission. These fall related injuries are associated with the greatest morbidity and costs.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, less severe injuries, such as bruises, cuts, and persistent pain, are more difficult to adjudicate since they may not receive medical attention or may be poorly documented in the medical record. Given the significant differences that were observed for falls leading to persistent restricted activity, it is possible that the physical activity program reduces the risk of any fall injury (serious and less severe). Secondly, the six month assessment interval may have led to under-ascertainment of fall related outcomes. Serious fall injuries, however, are much less susceptible to poor recall than are other falls.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> To enhance the ascertainment of serious fall injuries, medical records from all hospital admissions were reviewed and adjudicated. Thirdly, men represented only about a third of the study population, a value that is consistent with census estimates. Had a larger number of men been enrolled, the power to detect sex specific differences in the risk of a first serious fall injury by intervention group would have been enhanced. Fourthly, study participants were not recruited because of their fall risk, possibly leading to a diminished benefit of the intervention for the prevention of serious fall injuries. However, the physical activity program was no more effective among higher risk participants who reported a fall in the year before randomization or those who had more severe functional limitations. Finally, we did not control for type I error in this analysis of a prespecified secondary outcome and related outcomes that were not prespecified. This approach is consistent with the views of others, as the estimated effects sizes are trustworthy and useful even in the presence of an inflated type I error.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Study strengths include the large and racially diverse sample of vulnerable older people from eight field centers spanning the USA, the rigorous methods to ascertain and adjudicate serious fall injuries, excellent retention, and adherence rates to the physical activity intervention that were similar or higher than those achieved in other shorter studies involving older people.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In addition, because fewer than 5% of age eligible people were excluded on the basis of an underlying medical condition, our results should be broadly applicable to our target population of sedentary older people with functional limitations who do not already have major mobility disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Our results should be interpreted in the context of the primary results from the LIFE Study, which showed an 18% reduction in the risk of major mobility disability, defined as loss of ability to walk 400 m, and a 28% reduction in the risk of persistent mobility disability.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Given the morbidity and costs associated with serious fall injuries, demonstrating a concomitant reduction in this distinct and clinically meaningful outcome would further enhance the public health relevance of the LIFE physical activity intervention. Results from the current study are mixed, with no overall reduction in the prespecified outcome of time to first serious fall injury, but a substantial decrease in the rate of all serious fall injuries, an outcome that was not prespecified, in men. As a recurrent event, the outcome of all serious fall injuries may have greater clinical relevance than that of time to first serious fall injury. The safety of the LIFE intervention is evidenced by the low rate of serious fall injuries during the physical activity sessions, a rate that was comparable to that during the health education sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results do not support the benefit of structured moderate intensity physical activity in reducing the risk of serious fall injuries among sedentary older people with functional limitations.
