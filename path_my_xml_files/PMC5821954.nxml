Introduction</title><p>Myopia of any degree increases the risk of developing sight-threatening conditions such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and myopic maculopathy [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with risk increasing dramatically with progression to high myopia [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Atropine eye drops are currently the most effective treatment for managing myopia progression [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and they are widely used in Asian countries [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] where the prevalence of myopia is high [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Atropine, a nonspecific muscarinic receptor antagonist, is a potent cycloplegic and was initially used for myopia control on the premise that excessive ocular accommodation was the cause of myopia progression. However, subsequent animal research has demonstrated that atropine inhibits myopia progression via a nonaccommodative mechanism. For example, atropine inhibits experimental myopia in the chick without causing cycloplegia [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and experimental myopia in a mammalian model can be inhibited by the highly selective muscarinic receptor antagonists MT3 and MT7 [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] which do not cause cycloplegia. Moreover, atropine is effective in slowing human myopia progression at very low concentrations (0.01%) that cause negligible cycloplegia [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Although atropine inhibits myopia progression by preventing abnormal scleral expansion and eye elongation, its site and mode of action are unclear. Recent evidence from the chick model suggests that the retina is the major site of action of atropine and that atropine likely exerts its action via intermediaries such as nitric oxide (NO) and dopamine [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] although there is also evidence that it may act directly on the choroid [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Atropine treatment has been shown to increase the resting thickness of the choroid in animals [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The thickness of the choroid is reduced when the retina in animals [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] is exposed to hyperopic defocus (image plane located posterior to the retina). Choroidal thickness is also reduced during accommodation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hyperopic retinal defocus is a consequence of a lag of accommodation which commonly occurs during near work and which has been implicated as one factor in causing eye enlargement and myopia development [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of atropine eye drops on choroidal thinning induced by hyperopic retinal defocus, using automated measures of choroidal thickness obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). A secondary aim was to record the short-term effect of atropine on the resting thickness of the choroid. Some data reported here has previously appeared in abstract form (Optom Vis Sci 2015;92:E-abstract 150030).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Ten East Asian adults aged between 18 and 24 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD, 20.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8 years) participated in this study, which adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (Ref 010617), and informed consent was obtained from all participants in writing. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: aged 18 to 25, with spherical equivalent refraction (SER) with spectacle prescription between &#x02212;1.00 and &#x02212;5.00&#x02009;D (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD, &#x02212;2.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.28&#x02009;D), and with little astigmatism (&#x02264;1.00&#x02009;D) or anisometropia (&#x02264;1.00&#x02009;D). Also, individuals with amblyopia, ocular pathology, or other ocular anomalies (e.g., surgery and trauma) that might have influenced the measurements were excluded. Prior to enrolment, all participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination to confirm their refractive status and to ensure the absence of binocular or pathological abnormalities or history of significant ocular surgery or trauma. All 10 participants had visual acuity of logMAR 0.00 or better.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. SS-OCT System and Scan Protocols</title><p>The choroidal thickness measurements were obtained using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) Topcon DRI OCT-1 Atlantis (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.topcon.co.jp/">http://www.topcon.co.jp/</ext-link>), with an axial scan rate of 100,000&#x02009;Hz operated at the 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m wavelength region. The wavelength-sweeping laser had a tuning range of approximately 100&#x02009;nm centred at 1050&#x02009;nm, allowing a high axial resolution of 8&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m to be obtained (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.topcon.co.jp/">http://www.topcon.co.jp/</ext-link>). Compared to spectral-domain OCT centred at 800&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, the longer wavelengths enable deeper penetration of ocular tissues and allow a three-dimensional (3D) high contrast image of the choroid to be obtained. To enhance the signalling and imaging of the choroid, the &#x0201c;chorioretinal&#x0201d; scanning mode of the instrument was selected.</p><p>A 3D imaging data set covering an area of 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup> centred over the macula was obtained from each participant by using a scan protocol of 512 (horizontal)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;128 (vertical) A-scans per data set. The scanning was carried out by an invisible scanning laser so that eye movements were minimised during the scan. The choroidal thickness was measured by the automatic detection of the outer-border (RPE) and the chorioscleral border in order to avoid experimenter bias influencing the measures. After the choroidal thickness map was obtained from 3D imaging, a grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) used previously in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was applied to the map to give automated averaged measures of choroidal thickness within the various segments.</p><p>The choroidal thickness within the central 1&#x02009;mm diameter circle was used as the measure of SFCT. The mean of the values for the 4 segments within the 3&#x02009;mm diameter annulus were used as the measure of parafoveal choroidal thickness (PFCT).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Experiment Protocol</title><p>Participants attended two sessions that allowed choroidal measures to be made at the same time on two consecutive afternoons. At the first visit, 2.00&#x02009;D of hyperopic retinal defocus was applied to the experimental (nondominant) eye for 60 minutes, while the fellow (control, dominant) eye was fully corrected. Eye dominance was determined using a simple pointing task [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. OCT measures of choroidal thickness were made in both eyes before applying defocus and at 20-minute intervals during defocus. At the end of the 60 minutes of defocus on day 1, all experimental eyes were treated with one drop of 0.5% atropine. On day 2 (i.e., 22 hours after instillation of atropine), the experimental eye again received 2.00&#x02009;D of hyperopic retinal defocus for 60 minutes, and the fellow (control) eye was fully corrected. OCT measures of choroidal thickness were made as for day 1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Stabilisation Period</title><p>It has been reported that accommodation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], exercise [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and diurnal fluctuations [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] can all cause short-term changes in axial length and choroidal thickness. Therefore, measurements were made at the same time of day for each participant. In addition, prior to each session of measurements and before applying defocus, participants viewed a video movie for 20 minutes (binocular viewing, seated at 6&#x02009;m from the screen with full distance correction for both eyes) to reduce the influence of previous visual and nonvisual tasks on choroidal thickness.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Monocular Defocus during the Measurement Period</title><p>Following the stabilisation period, five consecutive noncycloplegic autorefraction measures were made with an open-field autorefractor (Shin-Nippon NVision-K 5001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shin-nippon.jp/">http://www.shin-nippon.jp/</ext-link>) to confirm the refractive status of each eye. To induce and maintain the desired level of retinal defocus (2.00&#x02009;D of monocular defocus), participants wore single vision disposable contact lenses (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson ACUVUE Oasys; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jnj.com/">http://www.jnj.com/</ext-link>). For participants who had refractive errors, the desired defocus was combined with the refractive correction into one single contact lens power (e.g., if the distance prescription was &#x02212;3.00&#x02009;DS, then to achieve 2.00&#x02009;D of hyperopic defocus at the fovea in that eye, a &#x02212;5.00&#x02009;DS contact lens was given). After contact lenses had settled on the eye (3-4 minutes), five consecutive autorefractor measures were again made in each eye to confirm that the desired refractive status had been achieved, before the measurement period commenced.</p><p>Participants then viewed a video movie binocularly at 6&#x02009;m for 60 minutes while remaining seated and as still as possible. OCT measures were made at 20-minute intervals in both eyes during the 60-minute viewing time. To ensure reasonably large pupil diameters which facilitate rapid OCT measures, the ambient lighting was maintained at about 10 lux (as adopted in previous similar studies [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) measured with a Digital Light Meter (TES-1335; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tes.com.tw/">http://www.tes.com.tw/</ext-link>).</p><p>At the end of the first session, trial contact lenses were discarded, and one drop of 0.5% atropine was administered to the lower conjunctival fornix of the participant's experimental (nondominant) eye. The second-day session also consisted of a 20-minute stabilisation period followed by a 60-minute measurement period with the same amount of defocus induced in the experimental eye.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using IBM&#x000ae; SPSS&#x000ae; Statistics 20. Shapiro-Wilk's <italic>W</italic> test was used to confirm that the data sets were normally distributed. The statistical model employed was repeated measures ANOVA with general linear model (GLM), with 3 within-subject factors: time (0, 20, 40, and 60 minutes), experimental versus control eye, and day 1 versus day 2. Repeated measures ANOVA was run separately for SFCT and PFCT data. Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons were performed for any variables with significant within-subject effect and interactions. A <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are reported as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1 SEM (standard error of the mean) unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>The mean baseline choroidal thickness within each of the 4 segments comprising the parafoveal annulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were not significantly different, so they were averaged to give PFCT.

Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that hyperopic defocus applied to the retina of animals [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] causes thinning of the choroid. The primary finding of the current study is that in humans, choroidal thinning in response to hyperopic defocus is abolished by one drop of 0.5% atropine, when measured 22 hours after instillation. This concentration is well within the range of concentrations (0.01&#x02013;1%) that have been used for myopia control [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>We also observed a wide range of resting choroidal thickness (prior to atropine) among our participants (range 131 to 483&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m), consistent with other studies [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that have reported a similarly wide range of choroidal thickness at the fovea (e.g., mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD: 354&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;111&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, range 80&#x02013;641&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).</p><p>Previous studies have also reported that atropine causes an increase in resting choroidal thickness. For example, Nickla and colleagues [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that in chick, intraocular injections of muscarinic antagonists including atropine induced thickening of the choroid 3 hours after injection, even in eyes wearing &#x02212;10&#x02009;D lenses. In adult humans, instillation of the homologous drug homatropine 2% also caused an increase in thickness of the choroid within 1 hour of administration [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In children, Zhang and colleagues [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that administration of 1% atropine gel twice daily for one week caused an increase in resting choroidal thickness, with the effect being greatest in the inferior meridian. However, in our study, we did not observe an increase (or decrease) in the resting (baseline) thickness of the choroid 22 hours after instillation of 0.5% atropine, even though significant mydriasis was still present and the thinning response to hyperopic defocus was abolished at that time. There are several potential reasons why the choroidal thickening effect of atropine was not observed in our study. It is possible that 1 drop of 0.5% atropine was not potent enough to induce an increase in choroidal thickness. Other possibilities are that either the effect had worn off 22 hours after instillation or less likely that we had not waited long enough to see an effect. A limitation of our study is that we only measured baseline choroidal thickness at one time point (22 hours after instilling atropine) and therefore our data cannot distinguish between these possibilities. Nonetheless, at 22 hours after instillation of atropine, the choroidal thinning response to hyperopic defocus was abolished but the previously reported increase in baseline thickness was not observed. This suggests that these two actions of atropine may have different time courses or can occur independently. Such a conclusion would be consistent with the idea that choroidal thinning and thickening are mediated by different mechanisms as suggested by Nickla et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on the basis of work conducted in the chick model of myopia. Nickla and colleagues proposed that choroidal thinning is likely mediated via contraction of choroidal, nonvascular smooth muscle by acetylcholine, whereas thickening is via a dopaminergic or nitrergic pathway. On this basis, atropine might block choroidal thinning independently from any direct or indirect effect on a choroidal thickening pathway.</p><p>Inevitably, this study has limitations. Apart from the small number of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 10), the effect of atropine was only measured at one time point (22 hours) after instillation. The reason for selecting 22 hours was to ensure that the measures of choroidal thickness were made at the same time of day on the two successive days to avoid any confounding effects of diurnal changes in choroidal thickness [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the consequence was that we will have missed any shorter-term effects of atropine, should they have occurred, for example, equivalent to the observation that homatropine can cause choroidal thickening 1 hour after instillation [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another limitation of the study is the lack of randomization of the order in which measures with and without atropine were made on the two successive days: measures with atropine were only made on the second day. The reason for instilling atropine only on the second day is that the effects of atropine can be very long lasting (~18 days) [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Had atropine been instilled on the first day, then a long washout period (&#x0003e;2 weeks) would have been necessary to ensure that the effects of atropine had worn off by the second measure. Such a long washout period would have been more likely to have allowed other, potentially confounding factors (e.g., changes in environmental temperature and participant health) to affect the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that one drop of 0.5% atropine abolishes the normal thinning of the human choroid caused by hyperopic retinal defocus, when measured 22 hours after instillation. However, a change in baseline choroidal thickness was not observed with atropine. The inhibitory effect on choroidal thinning suggests that atropine may act to block the myopiagenic effects of hyperopic retinal defocus, for example, with accommodative lag during near work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was supported by the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Asia University, Taiwan.
