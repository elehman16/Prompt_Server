The median time to death by all causes was 1059 (95% CI: 952&#x02013;NA) days in the pimobendan group and 902 (95% CI: 747&#x02013;1061) days in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .012) (Figure S4).</p></sec><sec id="jvim14586-sec-0034"><title>Discussion</title><p>Myxomatous mitral valve disease is the leading cause of heart disease in dogs, and development of CHF results in substantial morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> The EPIC study has shown, for the first time, convincing evidence of benefit of a treatment before the onset of CHF in dogs with cardiac enlargement secondary to MMVD (stage B2). Dogs receiving pimobendan had approximately two&#x02010;thirds the risk of reaching the primary endpoint compared with dogs on placebo. This resulted in a 60% prolongation of the preclinical period with dogs receiving pimobendan taking, on average, an additional 462 days, or approximately 15 months, to develop CHF or die as a consequence of MMVD. The subanalyses of the primary endpoint suggest that the majority of this benefit was attributable to delaying the onset of CHF, with relatively few dogs meeting the endpoint by experiencing cardiac death or euthanasia (Table <xref rid="jvim14586-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap">5</xref>). Overall survival was longer in the dogs receiving pimobendan in the ITT population, which included dogs experiencing death or euthanasia due to noncardiac causes. This indicates that chronic administration of pimobendan in this population was safe. Fewer dogs in the pimobendan group were censored before reaching the end of the study. The treatment effect of pimobendan was robust and persisted comparatively unchanged after adjustment for each of the baseline characteristics, either individually, or in combination in the multivariable analyses. In the explanatory multivariable analysis, the treatment effect was strengthened with a lower hazard ratio and narrower confidence intervals after the confounding effect of other dog characteristics measured at baseline was taken into account.</p><p>As well as confirming the strength of the treatment effect, the multivariable analysis confirmed the predictive importance of absolute heart size with respect to the onset of CHF as previously reported.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> Two separate echocardiographic indicators of heart size, LA/Ao and LVIDDN, were strongly and independently associated with time to the primary endpoint in the final explanatory multivariable model. Two other nontreatment variables remaining in the model were increased FS% and reduced appetite. Increased FS% might, in this situation, represent a surrogate measure of the severity of MR with a larger total left ventricular stroke volume being associated with worse regurgitation. The significant effect of reduced appetite persisted in the final model despite there being relatively few dogs with this finding. This supports the previously described negative prognostic significance of reduced appetite in dogs with MMVD.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>
</p><p>The exploratory multivariable model, excluding echocardiographic variables, confirmed the prognostic value of widely used clinical and radiographic measurements. This analysis was performed in order to provide information of prognostic value for patients encountered in a setting where accurate echocardiographic measurements might not be available; however, it should be borne in mind when interpreting these results that all dogs included in the analyses also met the echocardiographic inclusion criteria and these results therefore might not be generalizable to all dogs with a VHS &#x0003e; 10.5 in the absence of concurrent echocardiographic measurements and a confirmed diagnosis of MMVD. In our population, increased VHS, lower SAP, and higher heart rate were all independently associated with a worse outcome, although reduced appetite was not found to be significant in this model. The fact that appetite was not included in both final models (explanatory and exploratory) suggests that the effect of this variable is not stable when other variables are considered at the same time. Although a lower (but within reference range) blood pressure has previously been described in dogs with severe MMVD, when compared to dogs with mild to moderate disease,<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> this is the first study to demonstrate a worse outcome associated with lower blood pressure, even though no dog enrolled to the study would have been considered clinically hypotensive. Radiographically evident cardiomegaly and increased heart rate have previously been reported to predict a worse outcome.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>
</p><p>The EPIC study design has several notable strengths. It is the largest prospective, randomized clinical trial in small animal cardiovascular medicine. It is comparable in size to average&#x02010;sized studies of human patients with cardiovascular disease; with 360 enrolled patients, it would fall within the interquartile range of similar studies of human patients.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> All CHF endpoints were independently verified by an endpoint committee. Events other than reaching the primary endpoint which could have been influenced by the administration of trial medication were also captured in the secondary endpoint of &#x0201c;time to first event&#x0201d;. Analysis of this secondary endpoint demonstrated a significant difference in favor of the group receiving pimobendan, with a <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;value lower than that found in the primary endpoint analysis. This might imply that pimobendan delayed the onset of events other than those incorporated in the primary endpoint, for example, coughing, right&#x02010;sided CHF, and syncope. An additional strength of the study is the absence of the confounding effect of any concurrent cardiovascular medications; however, this restriction led to it being necessary to censor a number of the dogs from the primary endpoint analyses when the introduction of these drugs was required. A greater number of dogs in the placebo group needed to be censored from the study for this reason.</p><p>This is the first veterinary cardiology study to be terminated after a planned interim analysis with prospectively defined stopping criteria, having demonstrated convincing evidence of efficacy with respect to the primary endpoint. The decision to stop a clinical trial is a difficult one and involves weighing up the validity of the conclusions that can be drawn from a foreshortened study against the risks to animals remaining in a treatment trial where 1 method of treatment appears clearly more efficacious than the other.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> There are risks associated with the premature termination of studies in response to results obtained at interim analyses. Such a study might overestimate the benefit of the treatment effect by basing the results on observation of a smaller number of events than originally anticipated.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> The risk of such an erroneous result is relatively low in the current study. Only 1 interim analysis was planned and only 1 was conducted. This was performed after 4 years when the study was almost 80% complete and all the anticipated patients had been recruited to the study. The final analysis included data acquired during a further 5 months of follow&#x02010;up, meaning that the final duration of the study was nearly 90% of the duration originally planned. Finally, to minimize the risk of obtaining a &#x0201c;false&#x02010;positive&#x0201d; study result, the O'Brien&#x02010;Fleming alpha spending function<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> was used to set the <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;value to be used for the interim analysis and the adjustment of the <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;value in the final analysis.</p><p>Cardiac&#x02010;related death, either spontaneous or due to euthanasia, was incorporated as part of the primary endpoint in the EPIC study, as this was known to be an infrequent but important manifestation of MMVD that might occur in dogs with stage B2 disease. An important reason to include, rather than censor, this outcome was that concerns had previously been raised about possible detrimental effects of the administration pimobendan to dogs with preclinical MMVD.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> If our primary endpoint had focused exclusively on the onset of CHF, with dogs that died being censored, it might have appeared that we were choosing to ignore potentially detrimental effects of the treatment. We found, not unexpectedly, that only a small number of dogs met the primary endpoint in this way. Although a greater number of dogs in the pimobendan group experienced spontaneous cardiac death (12 versus 5), the proportion of dogs in each group experiencing this event was not significantly different. A greater number of dogs in the placebo group underwent cardiac&#x02010;related euthanasia (7 versus 3), but again the difference in proportions between groups was not significant. Subanalysis of the time to the separate components of the primary endpoint suggested that the difference in outcome observed between groups is largely attributable to a delay in the onset of signs of CHF. Any previously raised concerns regarding the safety of the medication should be allayed by the longer survival observed in the pimobendan group in the all&#x02010;cause mortality analysis.</p><p>There was no difference between groups in the rate or type of potential adverse events observed, indicating that pimobendan administration is safe and well tolerated. This is despite the fact that dogs in the pimobendan group spent longer in the study and therefore were at risk of experiencing adverse events for a longer period.</p><p>This clinical trial was fully sponsored by a pharmaceutical company (as acknowledged), and industry funding of studies is recognized as a potential source of bias in clinical trials.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> However, it remains the case in studies of human patients that the majority of published clinical trials are sponsored by industry.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> In the veterinary field, there are no large independent funding organizations comparable to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are likely to be able to (or wish to) fund a study of the magnitude of the one we describe; therefore, such studies are only likely to be achieved with industry sponsorship. Potential explanations of the increased likelihood of industry&#x02010;sponsored research having positive findings include the following: Industrial sponsors might be more likely to support studies that are likely to succeed, industrial sponsors might design studies with an inappropriate comparator group, or there might be publication bias with unsuccessful studies being less likely to be published.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> In the current study, evaluating the use of pimobendan for an indication where there is currently no evidence of a benefit of other treatment, the most appropriate comparator is a placebo, as was used. The risk of publication bias was minimized by the existence of a clause in the lead investigators' contracts guaranteeing the right to publish irrespective of outcome.</p><sec id="jvim14586-sec-0035"><title>Limitations</title><p>Diagnosis of CHF and confirmation of cardiac&#x02010;related death remain a challenge in clinical trials. In this study, we attempted to minimize the impact of the first of these challenges by use of an independent blinded consensus verification of CHF endpoints.</p><p>It is not possible to irrefutably confirm whether any death is cardiac related or not. In the case of dogs that died spontaneously, the investigator classified the death as being cardiac or noncardiac on the basis of the circumstances of the death and their own opinion. Postmortem examinations were not systematically undertaken, and it is therefore possible that in some cases, death was attributed to cardiac disease when in fact it was due to another condition (and vice versa). The study also allowed cardiac&#x02010;related euthanasia as part of the primary endpoint. Euthanasia is influenced by owner&#x02010;related factors, but it is likely to be precipitated by the animal having a poor quality of life, and therefore, the frequency with which it occurs is likely to be reduced by therapies that delay the onset of clinical signs. The impact of individual owner&#x02010;related factors on this outcome should be minimized by randomization of a large population, as was done in this study. Comparatively few dogs met the primary endpoint through experiencing spontaneous cardiac&#x02010;related death or euthanasia. The subanalysis of this component of the primary endpoint did not show a significant difference between groups. It appears that most of the observed effect of pimobendan can be attributed to the delay in the onset of CHF; therefore, the impact of any uncertainty in the classification of such cases should be minimal and is likely to be equally distributed between groups.</p><p>The recruitment period of the trial was longer than originally expected, but this has had no impact on the outcome of the study, as it was prematurely closed after the findings of the interim analysis.</p><p>After the primary endpoint had been reached, all dogs that developed CHF received pimobendan as part of their treatment regime, but other treatment was no longer controlled. Variability of such treatment could not have had an impact on the major conclusions of the study, but introduced a confounding factor in the all&#x02010;cause mortality analysis.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14586-sec-0036"><title>Generalizability of the Study</title><p>The results of this study are readily generalizable to the large population of dogs at risk of developing MMVD. The population recruited to the study was large, recruited in numerous countries, by many investigators, and is typical of dogs with this disease. The breed, weight, and age distribution of the population are similar to those of other populations described with this condition.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> It is also notable that the outcome for the placebo group, particularly in time to the onset of CHF and event rate, in the current study, was very similar to that reported in previous studies conducted in dogs with preclinical MMVD.<xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14586-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> The restricted weight range of dogs recruited to the study reflected the weight range for which appropriate verum and placebo study medication were available and was not because of any hypothetical limited weight range in which the treatment effect was expected to be seen. It is therefore likely, although not proven, that the conclusions of this study can be extrapolated to dogs of any bodyweight with stage B2 MMVD. The conclusions of this study are only relevant to dogs with cardiac enlargement secondary to preclinical MMVD (stage B2) as all dogs entering the study met or exceeded 3 different heart size criteria (LA/Ao &#x02265; 1.6, LVIDDN &#x02265; 1.7, and VHS &#x0003e; 10.5) and no dogs without cardiac enlargement were recruited to the study. Similarly, the conclusions are only relevant to dogs with a murmur of at least a grade 3/6 in intensity. Treatment with pimobendan of all dogs that have a murmur compatible with the presence of MMVD would not be justified on the basis of the findings of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim14586-sec-0037"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Chronic oral administration of pimobendan to dogs with echocardiographic and radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD, in the absence of concurrent cardiovascular medication, results in the prolongation of the preclinical period, and is safe and well tolerated. The median time to the onset of CHF or cardiac&#x02010;related death was prolonged by approximately 15 months, and the risk of a dog experiencing this event was reduced by approximately one&#x02010;third; the majority of the benefit observed was attributable to delaying the onset of CHF. This substantial degree of prolongation of the preclinical period is of clinical relevance and is of importance to veterinarians and owners of dogs affected by this common disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
