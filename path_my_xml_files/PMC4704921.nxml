Furthermore, in England there has been a marked increase in the number of people identified with impaired glucose regulation (IGR): blood glucose levels higher than normal but below the threshold for T2DM and associated with increased risk of developing T2DM and further complications [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given the significant economic burden of treating T2DM [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], prevention of the condition is a public health priority.</p><p>The main targets for T2DM prevention are weight loss and physical activity promotion [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Physical activity slows the progression of T2DM and its cardiovascular consequences [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and thus is often argued to be a cornerstone of T2DM prevention initiatives [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, several large, high-quality clinical trials have shown that relatively modest changes in lifestyle (eg, increased physical activity) can reduce its incidence [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Structured self-management education is recommended for facilitating lifestyle change (including physical activity) among people with T2DM and those identified as being at high risk of developing T2DM [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Pre-diabetes Risk Education and Physical Activity Recommendation and Encouragement (PREPARE) study, which combined group-based structured education and pedometer use, reported improvements in glucose regulation in people at high risk of T2DM [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notably, only the group that received a pedometer in addition to structured education demonstrated better clinical outcomes. Indeed, meta-analyses have shown that interventions that prompt self-monitoring by pedometers resulted in increased physical activity [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; among individuals with T2DM, walking programs that do this have shown that they are feasible and effective at increasing moderate intensity bouts of physical activity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>T2DM prevention guidelines recommend the provision of ongoing support for people identified as being at risk, particularly when barriers for behavior change are encountered [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although primary care offers a system for identifying individuals at high risk of T2DM (eg, through the National Health Service [NHS] Health Checks in England), it lacks the capacity and resources to offer ongoing support to the patient through regular face-to-face contact with health care professionals. As such, there is a need to develop and evaluate scalable and cost-effective T2DM prevention programs that provide ongoing behavior change support beyond structured education and pedometers and are suitable for implementation in routine care [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Tailored, computer-generated feedback on pedometer-measured step counts may be a cost-effective way to provide ongoing support for physical activity among people at high risk for T2DM. One way of achieving this is through the use of mHealth (ie, mobile phone technology [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), specifically via short message service, hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;text messaging.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>mHealth Approaches</title><p>While smartphone ownership is increasing (estimated at 55% in the UK adult population), it is less than 20% in people aged 65 years and older who are more likely to be at risk of T2DM [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Nonsmart mobile phone ownership, estimated at 77% in those aged 65-74 years [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], is commonplace; hence, text messaging has a potentially wider reach in this group. Furthermore, text messaging can be automated and individually tailored, and it allows frequent delivery with asynchronous receipt (ie, people can choose when to read the messages). Thus, it is potentially an efficient delivery channel for providing participants with information, feedback, and a choice of when to access messages.</p><p>Text-messaging interventions are increasingly used in T2DM prevention. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evaluated a text-messaging T2DM prevention intervention delivering randomly generated lifestyle advice messages to men aged 35-55 years in India. It reported significantly lowered incidence of T2DM at 24-month follow-up. However, no between-group differences in self-reported physical activity were observed. A T2DM prevention intervention in a general population (mean age of 42 years) [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that sent very frequent (5-7 per week) tailored messages (including general educational messages, diet and exercise tips, and health reminders) and prompt messages to encourage goal setting increased participant risk awareness and knowledge of T2DM. However, the majority of text-messaging interventions for T2DM self-management and prevention have targeted clinical outcomes only, in younger and middle-aged adults (55 years and younger), and have not measured behavioral outcomes (eg, physical activity) [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>It is widely accepted that the development of complex behavior change interventions, including mHealth approaches, should be informed by behavior change theory, evidence, and formative research [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and that sufficient details of the final intervention are reported [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Yet, many published mHealth studies of physical activity promotion do not describe the structure, content, or evidence base for the intervention in enough detail to allow replication. Taken together, there is uncertainty about the active ingredients, effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of evidence-based mHealth to increase physical activity in a population of people at risk of T2DM which includes older adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Context: Walking Away From Diabetes and the PROPELS Trial</title><p>Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] is an annual group-based, structured education session (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;Walking Away&#x0201d;). It is typically delivered to groups of 4-10 individuals by 2 trained educators over 3 hours. It is designed to promote walking by targeting perceptions and knowledge about IGR and physical activity self-efficacy as well as promoting self-regulatory skills such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and problem solving for relapse prevention. Participants receive a pedometer, but there is no additional contact with educators beyond the session and hence no feedback on individual progress.</p><p>PROPELS (Promotion Of Physical activity through structured Education with differing Levels of ongoing Support for those at high risk of type 2 diabetes) [ISRCTN83465245] is a multisite RCT that aims to examine the long-term effectiveness of the Walking Away education with different levels of ongoing support (over 4 years) [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The RCT includes 3 arms: Group 1 receives an informational advice leaflet; Group 2 receives the leaflet, annual Walking Away sessions, and a pedometer; and Group 3 receives the leaflet, annual Walking away sessions, and pedometer plus a comprehensive follow-on support program using pedometer self-monitoring, tailored text messaging, and telephone calls.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This paper describes the iterative development of the PROPELS follow-on support program and presents evidence about its feasibility and acceptability. The protocol for the PROPELS RCT is published elsewhere [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and Framework</title><p>To develop the PROPELS follow-on support program, we used a structured, iterative process involving concurrent and sequential research with the target population while maintaining a strong focus on integration of theory and evidence. Our framework for intervention development and piloting was informed by the model by Dijkstra and De Vries [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for developing computer-generated tailored interventions (to conceptualize the program) and the mHealth development and evaluation framework by Whittaker et al (2012) [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Fjeldsoe et al (2012) [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. An outline of our framework is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>. This development study was approved by National Research Ethics Service Committee East Midlands-Leicester (12/EM/0151) as part of the PROPELS RCT.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Design and framework of the PROPELS follow-on support program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v3i4e105_fig1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Phase 1: Conceptualization</title><p>We conducted a focused literature review to identify the key psychosocial determinants of increasing and/or maintaining physical activity levels among adults at risk of developing T2DM (see Phase 1 results for the key findings from this review). In line with Dijkstra and De Vries&#x02019; [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] model of developing computer-generated tailored interventions, we then translated these determinants of physical activity into the key objectives (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>) of the PROPELS follow-on support program.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 2: Formative Research</title><p>In parallel with Phase 1, we (KM and HE) conducted informal observations of Walking Away sessions in diverse regions where it has been commissioned into routine care pathways for the prevention of T2DM. In addition, we (KM, HE, and WH) engaged in discussions with Walking Away educators involved in an ongoing evaluation of Walking Away taking place within primary care [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this phase, we aimed to become familiar with the delivery of Walking Away, develop initial ideas about the PROPELS follow-on support structure and content, understand the cultural and ethnic diversity of our target population, explore educators&#x02019; views about supplementing Walking Away with text messaging and pedometer support, and inform the development of topic guides for subsequent focus groups.</p><p>Following this, we conducted 3 formative focus groups with our target population. Eligibility criteria included having attended the Walking Away session within the last 3 years as part of an ongoing evaluation in primary care [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], having provided consent to be contacted with regard to other research within the department, and having ability to speak and understand spoken English. Potential participants were sent an information leaflet and opt-in reply slip. A researcher telephoned those who had expressed an interest in taking part to check willingness and arrange attendance at a focus group. Written informed consent was taken immediately before the focus groups. A total of 15 participants (5 women and 10 men) aged between 39 and 76 years participated. A flexible topic guide was used that covered experiences of Walking Away (eg, what was most and least helpful for increasing physical activity and what could be improved to facilitate sustained changes), use of mobile phones in everyday life, and integration of a text-messaging follow-on support program into Walking Away.</p><p>Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Our analytical approach was based on the constant comparative method [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Specifically, KM familiarized herself with the data and identified initial codes. This involved organizing the data into meaningful groups and identifying interesting aspects in the data that formed the basis of repeated patterns (themes) across the dataset. Codes were assembled into an initial coding framework (KM and HE); this was used to code the complete dataset. NVivo qualitative data indexing software (QSR International) was used to facilitate the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 3: Pretesting</title><p>We created exemplar text messages based on the findings of Phases 1 and 2 (see the &#x0201c;Phase 1 and 2 Results&#x0201d; sections) and conducted 4 further focus groups (n=20; ages 52-77). Eligibility was the same as in Phase 2, but we also invited participants from the Walking Away study control group who had not previously attended the program [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; recruitment and consent procedures were identical to Phase 2. Prior to attending a focus group, participants received a pedometer and activity diary via postal mail and were encouraged to record the number of steps per day for 1 week. Participants were asked to bring along a mobile phone to the focus group.</p><p>As in Phase 2, a topic guide covered experiences of Walking Away. Additionally, it explored experiences of wearing the pedometer and recording steps. During the focus group, participants were sent example text messages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>) to provoke reactions in situ and generate think-aloud [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reactions and discussions about different types of messages. Data analyses followed the approach used in Phase 2. The coding framework was further developed from the Phase 2 coding framework to reflect the current phase of development.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 4: Piloting</title><p>Using the findings of Phases 1 through 3, KM drafted an initial set of text messages and tailoring matrices. The tailoring matrices (for each week of the program) specify the individual characteristics to which each message will be adapted. SS developed a computer program to automatically generate and send text messages (in line with the tailoring matrices) and to handle incoming messages. We subsequently tested the content and schedule of the text-messaging and pedometer program and the delivery processes required (eg, registering with the text message system, gathering information for tailoring, and receiving and replying to the messages). We also aimed to identify and resolve potential technical issues with the automated system.</p><p>Participants were 11 people (6 men and 5 women) from the Phase 2 and 3 focus groups who had indicated interest, including participants who were less keen on the use of text messages. This 8-week pilot study mimicked the proposed initial 8 weeks of the PROPELS follow-on support program. Participants were mailed an instruction booklet with details on how to register and what to expect from the text-messaging system, a pedometer, and an activity diary. They were instructed to wear the pedometer and self-monitor steps using the activity diary for 1 week to determine a baseline number of steps that would inform their step goals for the next 8 weeks. KM administered the brief telephone assessment to elicit each participant&#x02019;s short- and long-term step goals, an action plan for increasing physical activity, and information for the tailoring variables. Then, each week, participants received a reminder message to prompt them to submit their weekly step count via text message. This triggered an automated, tailored feedback message with the content depending on goal progress. Participants also received tailored motivational messages if they did not make progress with step counts or text in a step count.</p><p>After the 8-week period, KM conducted brief, semistructured telephone interviews with all available participants (n=10) to gain their feedback on the program. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed as in Phases 2 and 3.</p><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Example text messages used in Phase 3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v3i4e105_fig2"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phase 1: Conceptualization</title><p>We focused our literature review on text-messaging interventions to promote physical activity but also reviewed physical activity behavior change interventions within our target population more broadly to identify a number of salient behavior change techniques (BCTs) [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to incorporate within the PROPELS follow-on support program. The main findings from our focused literature review are as follows.</p><sec><title>Text Messaging for Physical Activity Promotion</title><p>The evidence base for text-messaging interventions to promote health is growing, as demonstrated by two comprehensive meta-analyses. In one meta-analysis that focused on physical activity promotion using mobile devices [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], most of the included interventions delivered through text messaging were passive, sending participants relay messages (eg, goal intentions) or generic, nontailored information about health benefits, and participants were mostly younger adults. There were two exceptions: a pilot study with older people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] provided the control (self-monitoring) group with a pedometer and mobile phone, prompted them to text in details about their symptoms and exercise, and responded with a standard message to thank them and encourage continued submission of data. Intervention (coaching) group participants received additional ongoing reinforcement coaching messages. Objectively measured step count increased in the self-monitoring group only. The intervention was feasible to deliver; however, delivery was not automated as a nurse manually adjusted text responses, and scalability was limited due to all participants being provided with a phone. The second study, an RCT of a fully automated intervention consisting of a wrist-worn device, an interactive website to provide feedback on physical activity, and text-messaging reminders of activity plans in middle-aged healthy adults reported significant increases in objectively measured activity compared to no support [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>A second meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of different formats of text-messaging-based interventions for various health behaviors and outcomes. Message tailoring and personalization were significantly associated with greater intervention efficacy [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, interventions that involved decreasing frequency of messages over the course of the intervention were more effective than interventions that used a fixed message frequency [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Text message-only physical activity interventions without tailored feedback did not increase physical activity [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, tailored feedback appears to be a promising component of mHealth physical activity interventions.</p><p>Taken together, physical activity interventions using text messages may be more effective if they incorporate active components such as self-monitoring, provide tailored feedback and personalized messages, and decrease the frequency of text messages over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Theory and Behavior Change Techniques Informing the PROPELS Follow-On Support Program</title><p>Health behavior change interventions (ie, not just text-messaging interventions) that combine self-monitoring with at least one other self-regulatory BCT (eg, goal setting) have been shown to be significantly more effective at increasing physical activity than those that did not include these specific BCTs [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These BCTs are congruent with the process of self-regulation or more specifically, control theory [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which proposes that setting goals, self-monitoring behavior, receiving feedback, and reviewing goals following feedback are central to behavioral self-management. The PROPELS follow-on support program was thus structured around behavioral self-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref>). This facilitated the selection and sequencing of the primary BCTs that are prevalent in the program&#x02019;s components [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Specifically, during the Week 1 educator telephone call, physical activity goals and an action plan were established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>). The subsequent text-messaging component drew upon a selection of BCTs to (1) encourage self-monitoring of physical activity behavior, (2) provide tailored feedback regarding physical activity progress (to highlight the discrepancy between goals and current behavior), and (3) review behavioral goals. A more detailed description of all BCTs employed within the PROPELS follow-on support program is shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>.</p><p>Interventions among people with or at risk of T2DM that included a higher number of BCTs [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or a higher number of BCTs and specific BCTs such as goal setting [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] have been associated with more weight loss. Furthermore, there is consistent evidence demonstrating the importance of several other key determinants of physical activity behavior change across general populations as well as in high-risk groups. These include attitudes toward physical activity [<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], intrinsic motivation [<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and (maintenance) self-efficacy [<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], especially when this is targeted in conjunction with self-regulation [<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. With this in mind, the PROPELS follow-on support program also targeted other determinants of physical activity behavior change via the text message component and employed additional BCTs to achieve the overall intervention objectives (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref>). Given that uncertainty remains about the acceptability of the aforementioned BCTs when delivered by text message, one aim of Phases 2-4 was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of this approach with our target population.</p><fig id="figure3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Modified self-regulation control theory which informed the PROPELS follow-on support program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v3i4e105_fig3"/></fig><fig id="figure4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The final PROPELS follow-on support program overview.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mhealth_v3i4e105_fig4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Phase 2: Formative Research</title><p>The key findings from Phase 2 that influenced intervention development and subsequent phases are presented under two interlinked themes: acceptability of text messaging for physical activity promotion and requirements for the structure of the follow-on program that includes text message content.</p><sec><title>Acceptability of Text Messaging for Physical Activity Promotion</title><p>The majority of participants reported using mobile phones in daily life and being able and willing to use text messages, even if they were not in the habit of doing so as a primary means of communication.

Participants commonly reflected that a lack of contact between the annual Walking Away group education sessions had decreased their motivation to continue with the strategies discussed in the session (eg, setting goals, wearing a pedometer). Several participants described how feedback on their goal setting and progress with increasing physical activity levels would have been useful.</p><disp-quote><p>It would have been nice to have the results of that [physical activity measures] because we never knew about that.</p><attrib>FG1-D</attrib></disp-quote><p>The preferred content of the text messages differed greatly according to individual preferences and characteristics. Some participants, especially those who described themselves as self-motivated and the sporty-type (ie, someone who has been fairly active in the past) wanted very different messages from those who described themselves as sedentary and needing more of a push. Furthermore, several participants reported prominent mobility issues, such as osteoarthritis, which meant that content focusing solely on walking was not relevant to them. Hence, the idea of the follow-on support content being tailored to individual characteristics (see Phase 3 for more detail) was appealing to participants.</p><p>Participants were adamant that text messaging should supplement, rather than replace, face-to-face contact, especially in relation to strengthening motivation.

Their active involvement in the intervention development phases resulted in specific components to meet their needs. For example, an instruction booklet about the text-messaging program and telephone calls to supplement the text messages were added to the follow-on support program to facilitate user engagement. We acknowledge that some initial training or help with text messaging (at the initial Walking Away education session) may be required to ensure that all participants are able to engage with this type of text-messaging support. Automated tailored text messaging following structured group education enables initial one-to-one help with getting started and reduces the time commitment for health care professionals and participants. It is scalable and fits into participants&#x02019; everyday lives while maintaining ongoing support following the initial education session. This is particularly important in primary care, where many people are identified as being at risk through health checks (eg, NHS Health Check, in England [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) but where there is limited capacity for providing ongoing support for behavior change. In England, a key objective of the NHS Five-Year Forward View [<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] is to implement scalable diabetes prevention programs; if successful, the PROPELS intervention may be an ideal candidate for this. Future research could explore variations of follow-on support: providing the follow-on support as a standalone intervention or pairing the follow-on support with a one-off telephone call that covers the Walking Away education session content for people who are unable or unwilling to attend group-based structured education.</p><p>The PROPELS text-messaging and pedometer follow-on support could be adapted fairly easily for other target groups such as people with newly diagnosed or established T2DM attending structured education (eg, DESMOND [Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed] [<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]) or people with or at risk of other conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease) where increasing physical activity reduces the risk of developing the condition or its consequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Time constraints related to timelines of the PROPELS RCT [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] meant that we were unable to conduct a pilot of longer duration to test the acceptability of varying text-messaging frequency, participant engagement, and retention over time. These are assessed in the PROPELS RCT along with physical activity outcomes [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further qualitative work embedded within the RCT may identify potential future adaptations and facilitate long-term implementation and could provide an in-depth understanding of how participants engage with the program over time, which components are most and least helpful, and how pedometer use, text messages, and telephone calls influence physical activity change over time.</p><p>We acknowledge that, especially in developed countries, text messaging may become less acceptable over time, and participants may prefer newer technologies such as smartphones that incorporate accelerometers. Although older adults have relatively low rates of smartphone ownership [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], recent research indicates that text messaging is becoming increasingly popular with that age group [<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Taken together, this indicates that mHealth interventions through smartphones would have had limited reach in the PROPELS study, and a predominantly text message-focused program is currently more acceptable. One advantage (and direction for future work) of the PROPELS follow-on support program is that it could be easily adapted for delivery across a variety of platforms (eg, email, app) which would allow people to choose which version they use.</p><p>A final potential limitation relates to the weekly reporting of steps. Although PROPELS participants are encouraged to record their daily step count in their activity diary and text in the weekly total, there is more room for error in comparison to, for example, texting in each day&#x02019;s total in response to a daily prompt. However, our participants voiced aversion to the idea of daily texts as overkill and off-putting. Future qualitative work in the PROPELS trial may provide an insight into participant experiences and preferences for self-monitoring step counts.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparisons With Prior Work</title><p>We developed a novel, interactive program whereby participants self-monitor their physical activity using a pedometer, text in their weekly step count, and receive automated tailored feedback on goal achievement and progress. Previous mHealth interventions for T2DM prevention included untailored, passive text-messaging content such as information about T2DM risk [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The methods that we employed to develop the PROPELS follow-on support program combine features of published mHealth development frameworks [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and multiple iterative phases of qualitative research (similar to a user-centered design process [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). The high level of engagement with our target population enabled refinements in the design to optimize its acceptability to users.</p><p>Robust development of mHealth behavior change interventions can be time consuming [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and is often allocated limited time in RCT protocols. A potential consequence of rapid development is that insufficient attention is given to the underpinning theory and evidence base or selection of active ingredients (BCTs). Given the time constraints of the PROPELS RCT protocol (12 months to conceptualize, develop, and test the follow-on support program prior to the RCT&#x02019;s commencement), this paper provides a detailed outline of a pragmatic framework for developing and piloting a text-messaging intervention that draws on relevant behavior change theory and uses rigorous qualitative methods incorporating user engagement. It encourages replication and application to the development of similar interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We developed a feasible and innovative text-messaging and pedometer program based on evidence and behavior change theory and grounded in the experiences, views, and needs of people at high risk of T2DM. A large-scale RCT is testing the effectiveness of this 4-year program over and above group-based structured education alone.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Rosemary Knight (Leicester Diabetes Centre) for her help and support in the organization of the focus groups and also the Walking Away from Diabetes educators, focus group, and pilot participants for their involvement.
