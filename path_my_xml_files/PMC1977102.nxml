This was analysed in 530 patients who were randomly allocated to receive vincristine or not. Survival was not improved by the addition of vincristine. A total of 268 patients reached plateau phase on first line therapy. Of these 226 patients were rerandomised either to continue receiving first line therapy for a further year or to cease therapy. At the present time there is a slight but not significant survival advantage in the group which received no further treatment on reaching plateau.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="153" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="154" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="155" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="156" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="157" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00094-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="158" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
