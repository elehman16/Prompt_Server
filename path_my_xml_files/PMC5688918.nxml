The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points included the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-related toxicities. <italic>Results:</italic> The ORRs were 84.4% in the DP group and 87.3% in the PF group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.653). After a median follow-up time of 25.1 months, the 1- and 2-year OS rates were 93.7% and 86.2% for the PF group and 87.3% and 69.1% for the DP group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.364). The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 55.0% for the PF group and 78.8% and 69.4% for the DP group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.845). Grade 3/4 leukocytopenia/neutropenia (68.9% vs. 19.5%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was significantly more common in the DP group. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The treatment response, OS and PFS associated with using CCRT with the DP regimen were not superior to those associated with using CCRT with the PF regimen as a first-line treatment in patients with ESCC. Additionally, the DP regimen was associated with more severe haematological toxicities.

Bronchoscopy was performed if bronchial invasion was suspected. If clinically indicated, radionuclide bone scans and coregistered <sup>18</sup>F-labeled fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) /CT scans were also performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and random assignment</title><p>This study was designed as a prospective, mono-centre, randomized phase II trial. This study was conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) from October 2010 to March 2015. Eligible patients were randomized into the PF or DF groups at a 1:1 ratio, using a computerized randomization program. The ethics committee at SYSUCC reviewed and approved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their surrogates.

A CT scan was performed with 5-mm-thick slices. The patient was scanned from the atlas (C1) to the second lumbar vertebra (L2) to cover the entire neck, oesophagus, lung and celiac lymph node regions. The gross tumour volume (GTV) included the macroscopic tumour and lymph nodes as shown by CT, PET/CT, endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography. Lymph nodes that exhibited at least one of the following features on CT were defined as positive lymph nodes: short axis &#x02265; 10 mm, distribution in a cluster of lymph nodes, central necrosis or infiltrating margin. Lymph nodes that exhibited malignant signs on endoscopic ultrasonography or demonstrated uptake on the PET/CT scan were also included in the GTV regardless of the size. The clinical target volume (CTV) included the primary tumour plus a 3-cm craniocaudal margin and a 1.0-cm margin in other directions as well as the metastatic lymph nodes plus a 1-cm margin. Regional lymphatic drainages were also covered by the CTV, including the para-oesophagus and medial and upper mediastinal lymph nodes. The supraclavicular lymph node region was included when the primary tumour was located in the cervical or the upper thoracic oesophagus. For patients with lower thoracic oesophageal carcinoma, the paracardial lymph node region was also included in the CTV. The planning target volume (PTV1) included the GTV with a 5-mm margin in all directions, and the PTV2 generally included the CTV with a 5-mm margin in all directions. All patients underwent conventional radiotherapy at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction and 5 fractions per week. The prescribed dose was 60 to 64 Gy for PTV1 and 50 Gy for PTV2. Dose constraints for critical organs included the following: the maximal dose to the spinal cord was limited to 50 Gy; the volumes of the lung receiving 20 Gy and 30 Gy were limited to 35% and 25%; the volume of the heart receiving 45 Gy was limited to 50%; and no more than 80% of the trachea could receive &#x0003e;60 Gy. Patients received either three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Briefly, 3D-CRT treatment plans were calculated with the Pinnacle planning system (Pinnacle3 version 8.0m; Philips Medical Systems, Fitchburg, WI, USA), and IMRT treatment plans were calculated with the Monacle planning system (Monacle version 5.11, ELEKTA, US). All patients were treated with a 6-MV or 8-MV linear accelerator.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotherapy</title><p>All patients received two cycles of chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, patients assigned to the DP group received two cycles of the DP regimen (docetaxel 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> delivered on day 1 and cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> delivered on day 1) at a 3-week interval. Patients assigned to the PF group received two cycles of the PF regimen (cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> delivered on day 1 and 5-FU 1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous infusion over 24 hours daily on days 1-4) at a 3-week interval. In cases of grade 4 haematological toxicity or severe non-haematological toxicities, dose adjustment was performed in the subsequent chemotherapy cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessment of treatment outcome and toxicity</title><p>During treatment, complete blood counts and serum chemistry profiles were repeated every week, and barium-swallow examination was repeated every two weeks. After treatment, patients were followed for the first time during the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> week after the end of treatment and every three months up to two years thereafter. Afterwards, follow-up was planned every six months up to five years or when clinically indicated. Medical history, physical examination, barium-swallow examination, and contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck, chest and upper abdomen were performed at each follow-up visit. Endoscopy, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide bone scanning and PET/CT depended on the discretion of the treating physicians.</p><p>Treatment response was evaluated according to the criteria of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). A senior radiologist together with a radiation oncologist evaluated the response approximately five to six weeks after the completion of treatment. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause or the last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to progression, relapse, death of any cause, or the last follow-up. Patterns of failure were defined according to the site of first treatment failure. Locoregional failure was defined as disease progression or relapse at the sites of primary tumour and/or regional lymph nodes. Distant failure was defined as disease progression or relapse at any site beyond the primary tumour and regional lymph nodes. Acute treatment-related toxicity was evaluated within six months from the beginning of treatment according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of this study was OS. Secondary end points included the treatment response rate, PFS, patterns of failure, completion rate of the protocol, and treatment-related toxicities.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used the Power and Sample Size Calculations software (Version 3.0, 2009, USA) to calculate the sample size. Prior data indicate that the median survival time on the control treatment is about 20 months. If the true median survival times on the control and experimental treatments are 20 and 35 months, respectively, we would need to study 91 experimental subjects and 91 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with probability (power) 0.900. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. A 10% adjustment for drop-outs resulted in a sample size of 100 patients each in the experimental group and the control group.</p><p>SPSS software for Windows version 19.0 was utilized to perform statistical analysis. Baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were performed for survival analysis. A two-sided <italic>P</italic>-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. Estimates are reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI) where appropriate. The date of randomization was used as the starting point for all time to event variables.

The median radiation doses of the PF and DP groups were 60.0 Gy (range, 56.0 to 64.0 Gy) and 60.0 Gy (range, 55.8 to 64.0 Gy), respectively. All patients completed radiotherapy as planned. Forty (97.6%) patients in the PF group and 32 (71.1%) patients in the DP group received chemotherapy at full-dose intensity for two cycles as planned (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Among patients in the DP group, eight (17.8%) experienced dose reduction, three (6.7%) received an altered regimen, and two (4.4%) cancelled chemotherapy during the second cycle.

Although compared with radiotherapy alone, CCRT significantly improved locoregional control and OS, the treatment outcome of CCRT remained to be improved. For instance, the locoregional failure of the CCRT arm in RTOG 85-01 was as high as 47%, and the 5-year OS was only 26%. Several RTOG studies have sought to improve the outcome of CCRT by increasing the radiation dose, including the RTOG 90-12 phase II study (PF regimen plus radiotherapy at 64.8 Gy), the RTOG 92-07 phase I/II study (PF regimen plus radiotherapy at 50 Gy with a brachytherapy boost), and the RTOG 94-05 phase III study (PF regimen plus radiotherapy at 64.8 Gy vs. 50.4 Gy). However, none of these studies demonstrated a definitive advantage over the result of RTOG 85-01 in terms of locoregional control or survival. Moreover, the incidence of treatment-related mortality was increased. Another strategy to improve the efficacy of CCRT involved intensifying the chemotherapy. However, previous studies incorporating more intensive regimens did not improve the efficacy and resulted in relatively high treatment-related mortality, including those with an increased dose intensity of 5-FU <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, additional cycles of chemotherapy before or after CCRT <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, or novel cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel and oxaliplatin <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Docetaxel is a semi-synthetic taxane with promising single-agent activity in advanced oesophageal cancer <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have also demonstrated that docetaxel enhances radiosensitivity via inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis in murine tumour cells <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.

Our result showed that the ORR was 84.4% in the DP group and 87.3% in the PF group, indicating a comparable rate between groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.653).</p><p>In patients receiving the PF regimen concurrent with radiotherapy, the median survival time was 9 to 29 months, the 1-year OS rate varied from 31% to 52%, and the 2-year OS rate was 31.5% to 46% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). In our study, the median survival time was not achieved in the PF group, and the 1-year and 2-year OS rate were 93.7% and 86.2%, respectively, which seemed to be superior to the previously reported results. Several factors might account for this discrepancy between studies. First, the dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen varied between studies. For instance, in Zhang's study, patients in the PF group received a lower dose of cisplatin and 5-FU (CDDP 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 + 5-FU 300g/m<sup>2</sup>/d d1-d3, Q4W) than in our study (CDDP 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 + 5-FU 1,000g/m<sup>2</sup>/d d1-d4, Q3W) <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Second, the radiation techniques also differed between studies. In our study, most patients (35, 85.4%) received IMRT, which has been reported to provide superior coverage of the PTV, better dosimetric results, and better treatment outcomes than 3D-CRT or conventional two-dimensional radiotherapy (2DRT) <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Finally, patient selection bias might exist especially for retrospective studies.</p><p>On the other hand, for patients receiving the DP regimen concurrent with radiotherapy, the median survival time was 21 to 43.2 months. However, the 1-year and the 2-year OS rates were not in previous studies. Li <italic>et al.</italic> reported a 3-year OS rate of 36.7% in a retrospective study <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. In our study, the 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 87.3% and 69.1% in the DP group, respectively, and the median survival time was not achieved. Our results suggest that definitive CCRT with the DP regimen did not improve the treatment response or survival in patients with ESCC, which is in conflict with the results of two previous studies. In a randomized study reported in 2012, both the ORR and OS favoured the DP regimen over the PF regimen in CCRT for patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. A recent retrospective study using a propensity score-matching method also showed that patients receiving the DP regimen had better OS and PFS than those treated with the PF regimen <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Several factors may account for this discrepancy. First, the dosage issue mentioned above might explain this finding. In both previous studies, patients in the PF group received the dose-reduced PF regimen (CDDP 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 + 5-FU 250mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d d1-d4, Q4W; CDDP 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 + 5-FU 300g/m<sup>2</sup>/d d1-d3, Q4W). In the current study, patients received the PF regimen in a standard dosage (CDDP 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> d1 + 5-FU 1,000g/m<sup>2</sup>/d d1-d4, Q3W) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The inferior efficacy of the PF regimen compared with the efficacy of the DP regimen reported in those two studies may have resulted from the inadequate dosage of the cytotoxic agents in the PF group. In addition, treatment compliance is another issue. In the present study, only 71.1% of patients in the DP group completed chemotherapy and radiotherapy at full dosage as planned without treatment interruption, which was much lower than that in the PF group (97.6%). The poor treatment completion rate might partially contribute to the unsatisfactory result in the DP group.</p><p>Severe treatment-related toxicities are the most common cause of treatment interruption or termination. As shown in our study, the most frequent grade &#x02265; 3 acute toxicity in the DP group was leukocytopenia / neutropenia (31, 68.9%). Studies in certain types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer, have demonstrated promising activity and a favourable toxicity profile of weekly chemotherapy regimens <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Therefore, the weekly schedule of the DP regimen, which may be less toxic and tolerable than the three-week or four-week schedule, should be considered in the future in definitive CCRT for patients with ESCC. Additionally, as the efficacy of standard and pegylated granulocytecolony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) agents in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) prophylaxis has been well established in terms of decreasing the risk of CIN and chemotherapy disturbances, primary or secondary prophylactic use of G-CSFs could also be considered in selected patients when prescribing three-week or four-week DP regimen <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In terms of oesophagitis, the incidence of grade &#x02265; 3 toxicity was comparable between the DP group and PF group in our study (42.2% vs. 36.6%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.496). Overall, no life-threatening toxicity or treatment-related death was observed. Several limitations existed in our study, including the small sample size, slow recruitment, and the inadequate follow-up period. Long term clinical outcomes will be reported later.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this prospective randomized phase II clinical trial indicate that definitive CCRT with the DP regimen did not improve the treatment response, overall survival or progression-free survival in patients with ESCC compared with the outcomes achieved when using definitive CCRT with the PF regimen. In addition, patients receiving the DP regimen were more likely to develop severe (grade &#x02265;3) leukocytopenia/neutropenia and experience treatment interruption or termination. However, longer follow-up and further phase III trials with larger sample sizes are warranted.
