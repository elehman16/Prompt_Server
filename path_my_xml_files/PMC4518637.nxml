Animal studies testing the fetal programming hypothesis find that maternal glucocorticoids pass through the placenta and alter fetal brain development, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, there are no prospective studies of pregnant women exposed to a sudden-onset independent stressor that elucidate the biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for the wide variety of consequences of prenatal stress seen in human offspring. The aim of the <italic>QF2011 Queensland Flood Study</italic> is to fill this gap, and to test the buffering effects of Midwifery Group Practice, a form of continuity of maternity care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>In January 2011 Queensland, Australia had its worst flooding in 30 years. Simultaneously, researchers in Brisbane were collecting psychosocial data on pregnant women for a randomized control trial (the M@NGO Trial) comparing Midwifery Group Practice to standard care. We invited these and other pregnant women to participate in a prospective, longitudinal study of the effects of prenatal maternal stress from the floods on maternal, perinatal and early childhood outcomes. Data collection included assessment of objective hardship and subjective distress from the floods at recruitment and again 12 months post-flood. Biological samples included maternal bloods at 36 weeks pregnancy, umbilical cord, cord blood, and placental tissues at birth. Questionnaires assessing maternal and child outcomes were sent to women at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. The protocol includes assessments at 16 months, 2&#x000bd; and 4 years. Outcomes include maternal psychopathology, and the child&#x02019;s cognitive, behavioral, motor and physical development. Additional biological samples include maternal and child DNA, as well as child testosterone, diurnal and reactive cortisol.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This prenatal stress study is the first of its kind, and will fill important gaps in the literature. Analyses will determine the extent to which flood exposure influences the maternal biological stress response which may then affect the maternal-placental-fetal axis at the biological, biochemical, and molecular levels, altering fetal development and influencing outcomes in the offspring. The role of Midwifery Group Practice in moderating effects of maternal stress will be tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-015-0539-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Natural disaster</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Prenatal stress</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd><kwd>Placenta</kwd><kwd>Fetal programming</kwd><kwd>Child development</kwd><kwd>Developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD)</kwd><kwd>DNA</kwd><kwd>Post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retrospective epidemiological studies suggest that maternal exposure to a severe stressor during pregnancy (e.g., death of a close relative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], foreign invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]) increases the fetus&#x02019; risk for suboptimal growth, and for developing a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders later in life, such as autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The subsequent challenge is to uncover the process that is responsible for these effects: how much of the predictive power of prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) is due to the objective severity of the mother&#x02019;s exposure to the event itself, how much is due to her subjective level of distress, how much to her hormonal response, and how might these aspects of the stress experience interact to alter risk for the unborn child? In addition, to what extent, and in what way, are the putative effects on the infant and child determined by the mother&#x02019;s genetic profile, the child&#x02019;s genetic profile, the child&#x02019;s sex, and the gestational timing of the stressor?</p><p>When testing the fetal programming hypothesis prospectively, animal studies randomly assign pregnant animals to stress or non-stress conditions and find that maternal glucocorticoids (GCs) pass the placental barrier and alter fetal development, in particular influencing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], causing changes in a wide variety of physiological outcomes for the offspring. In animal studies, the type, severity, and timing of the prenatal stress can be varied and controlled. In humans, however, the gold standards of rigorous experimental methodology are difficult to meet because we cannot randomly assign pregnant women to different stress conditions to determine the effects on the fetus. Most human PNMS research has focused on women experiencing stressful life events. However, most of these events do not occur randomly and may be clustered with other confounding socioeconomic, genetic, and personality, or temperament traits. These potentially confounding variables may have an ongoing influence on the infant and child, independent of the stressful event. Therefore, without the rigor of a randomized, controlled research design, the internal validity of a study is called into question, and the relative contributions of the multitude of biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for the wide variety of consequences seen in human offspring remain obscure. As long as mechanisms remain obscure, avenues for interventions to alter these consequences will also remain obscure.</p><p>In their seminal book, The Social Origins of Depression, Brown and Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] described their rigorous method for determining whether life events that occur prior to women&#x02019;s diagnosis for major depression may have been partly caused by the women&#x02019;s developing psychopathology, or were clearly independent of the women&#x02019;s own agency. Their Life Events and Difficulties Schedule has become the gold standard in social psychiatry research for assessing the severity and independence of life events in order to tease apart the putative causal mechanisms behind depression in women.</p><p>With respect to pregnant women and prenatal stress, a sudden, independent environmental event offers an opportunity to circumvent the obstacles to random assignment in human research on PNMS. Many forms of disaster distribute harm in quasi-random fashion, affect sizable communities that include large numbers of pregnant women, and have sudden onsets that allow the researcher to determine the moderating effects of the timing of the event in pregnancy.</p><p>In human research, it is also important to distinguish between the pregnant woman&#x02019;s objective degree of exposure to an event and the intensity of her subjective distress in response to it. Although one may assume that two rats of the same strain will not differ appreciably in their level of distress at having their tails pinched, for example, the human stress response is highly individualized. Appraisal theory, which describes the intrapsychic processes that explain why two people experiencing the same event may have completely different emotional reactions to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], suggests that the objective degree of exposure to a stressor and the subsequent subjective distress are relatively independent of each other.</p><p>The goal of the QF2011 Queensland Flood Study is to capitalize on a natural disaster in order to expand current understanding of how a stressful experience during pregnancy impacts on a woman&#x02019;s unborn child. Although we study elements of the stress experience from a natural disaster, we believe that our findings could be generalized to other forms of hardship experienced by pregnant women; as such, the Queensland floods serve as a general model of stress exposure in pregnancy, unencumbered by confounding variables, such as maternal genetic predisposition or temperament, that may self-select some women into stressful situations. We aim to determine the relative effects of several objective, subjective, cognitive, and hormonal components of the stress experience by tracking these aspects of stress as they cascade onto biological processes in mother, placenta, and fetus, and onto development through early childhood and beyond. In this article, we will summarize the background literature on PNMS, and describe the protocol for QF2011.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The fetal programming hypothesis, DOHaD, and prenatal maternal stress</title><p>The fetal programming hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], is often referred to as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). It stipulates that physical features and behaviors in offspring of prenatally stressed mothers result from permanent alterations in the structure and function of the offspring&#x02019;s organs and systems, most likely through the impact of maternal cortisol on the fetus&#x02019; developing HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because a linear relationship exists between maternal and fetal cortisol levels, relatively small increases in maternal cortisol resulting from anxiety or stress can double fetal concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], resulting in significant structural changes such as smaller hippocampal volumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, anxiety and/or stress in the mother not only increases her own circulating cortisol, it also reduces the activity of the cortisol barrier enzyme, 11&#x003b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenasetype2 (11-&#x003b2;HSD2), in the placenta (which converts maternal cortisol into inactive cortisone before it passes to the fetus), elevating placental and fetal exposure to cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Increased maternal cortisol results in the dysregulation of HPA axis activity in the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This link is important in that dysregulated HPA axis activity is implicated in psychopathological disorders in both adults and children, especially anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The changes in fetal development induced by the maternal physical and emotional environment are not necessarily detrimental to the well-being of the fetus; indeed, some alterations may be adaptive by better preparing the fetus for the postnatal environment. However, high levels of PNMS exposure might have negative effects that override the fetus&#x02019; ability to adapt.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Effect moderators</title><p>The association between PNMS and health outcomes may not be simple and linear, as a number of factors may moderate the effects of PNMS on the woman and her unborn child.</p><p>Maternal psychosocial variables may be found to moderate the effects of PNMS. For example, considerable literature debates the &#x0201c;social support buffering hypothesis&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the idea that effects of a life event will differ according to the degree of social support. There is also an extensive literature in psychology demonstrating that various styles of coping with a life event, emotion-focused versus problem-focused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], will impact on the subsequent distress experienced. For example, problem-focused coping tends to increase an individual&#x02019;s self-efficacy and control, and to reduce anger, anxiety, stress, and physiological arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The timing of PNMS appears to be an important moderator of PNMS effects on the fetus. It may be less the <italic>type</italic> of disruption to fetal neural development and more the <italic>timing</italic> in utero that determines risk for negative outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Timing effects are a function of (a) the ontogeny of fetal development, (b) alterations in maternal biological and psychological reactivity to stress during pregnancy, and (c) fetal exposure to stress-related biological processes through placental function (e.g., production of CRH) and/or placental transfer of, for example, cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>It is also feasible that both maternal and fetal genetics moderate the effects of PNMS on the HPA axis, especially following events that are novel and uncontrollable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the current project, we focus on the maternal-placental-fetal (MPF) axis because it serves as a prototypical system with well-defined physiological inter-relationships to specify how we analyze interactions between maternal and fetal genotypes, and the environment.</p><p><italic>In utero</italic> stress exposure may have sex-specific outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with some studies suggesting greater vulnerability in males, and others in females, depending on the outcome measured. Also, in rodents and humans, the activity and sensitivity of placental 11-&#x003b2;HSD2 to stimuli appears to be sex-linked, with greater vulnerability in males, which may partly explain the sex specificity of some stress-induced phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Finally, effects of PNMS on offspring may be moderated by the postnatal environment. Just as animal studies show that maternal behaviors can partially reverse adverse behavioral and cognitive outcomes in pups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], similar findings are beginning to emerge in human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Disaster research and Project Ice Storm</title><p>Our approach to PNMS research is to study pregnant women experiencing natural disasters. By their nature, disasters tend to have sudden onsets and are generally considered to be &#x0201c;independent stressors&#x0201d;. Using disasters as natural experiments in PNMS research presents an approximation of the randomization afforded by laboratory animal studies, and capitalizes on the relatively large potential subject pool following a disaster to a large community.</p><p>The first prospective study of prenatal stress from a natural disaster was Project Ice Storm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in Canada. Project Ice Storm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcgill.ca/projetverglas/">http://www.mcgill.ca/projetverglas/</ext-link>) was initiated soon after a series of ice storms struck Southern Qu&#x000e9;bec in January 1998 resulting in power outage for more than 3 million people for as long as 6 weeks during the coldest months of the year, and causing 27 deaths. The Insurance Bureau of Canada and Environment Canada count the ice storm as the worst and most costly natural disaster in Canadian history. Project Ice Storm was designed to clarify the role of PNMS in a prospective longitudinal design. Women who had been pregnant during the ice storm, or who became pregnant within three months of the storm, completed questionnaires about their objective exposure to hardship because of the storm (e.g., levels of threat, loss, change, and scope), and about their degree of distress (post-traumatic stress-like symptoms) due to the storm; they also provided saliva samples to assess diurnal cortisol patterns. Project Ice Storm mothers and children are still being followed more than 15 years later.</p><p>Effects of PNMS from the ice storm have been found in nearly every domain of child development examined. Significant effects of the degree of maternal objective exposure to the disaster (but not maternal subjective distress) have been found on the children&#x02019;s cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and epigenetic signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Effects of maternal subjective distress (and to a lesser extent, objective exposure) have been found on fingerprint asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], autistic-like traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], and diagnoses of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] throughout childhood. Objective exposure and subjective distress from the ice storm have been found to interact such that the worst child outcomes are associated with mothers who presented a mismatch between objective exposure and subjective distress, that is, children of mothers with high objective stress but low subjective distress, or with low objective stress along with high distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. There have also been significant timing effects: early pregnancy exposure seems to represent a window of vulnerability for cognition at age 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and autism-like traits at age 6&#x000bd; years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], while second trimester exposure was associated with shorter gestation lengths and other birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], while worse motor outcomes have been associated with exposure in late pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The sex of the child has often been found to moderate effects of PNMS: girls were found to be more vulnerable to effects of PNMS on asthma-related symptoms and diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and motor functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], while boys seem to be more vulnerable for effects on fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>Although the Project Ice Storm sample is relatively small (n&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;200), statistical power is enhanced by having a range of exposure levels from mild to severe; by the fact that the degree of exposure to the disaster was independent of family psychosocial attributes; by the acute onset of the event which allows exact dating of the stressor in the pregnancy; and by having detailed information on the women, their exposures, and their distress gathered relatively soon after the disaster. The independent nature of the disaster reduces the need to identify and control for all potential confounders, and allows one to disentangle the effects of the women&#x02019;s objective exposure to the event from their cognitive appraisal of it, and from their subjective distress and hormonal responses.</p><p>Project Ice Storm has many limitations, however. It suffers from the fact that women were first recruited 5-6 months after the crisis such that, for half of the women, the reports of storm events were given only after birth. It is difficult to combine diurnal cortisol data collected from women who were still pregnant, and from others who had already given birth, at the time of sampling. Although Project Ice Storm has advanced the PNMS field, it requires replication with (1) another type of disaster, (2) speedier recruitment and baseline data collection, (3) data collected from the pregnant women before the disaster struck to be able to control for pre-disaster psychopathology, (4) assessments starting earlier in childhood and better long-term retention, (5) biological samples from mother, placenta, and fetus to test hypotheses about physiological mechanisms in PNMS and interactions, and (6) with an intervention to buffer the potential effects of PNMS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The 2011 Queensland floods, the M@NGO trial, and QF2011</title><p>The Australian state of Queensland experienced severe flooding, the worst in 30 years, in early-January 2011 affecting more than 200,000 people in more than 70 towns. Three quarters of Queensland was declared a disaster zone with more than $1 billion of reported damages: flooding reached its peak in the state capital of Brisbane on January 10th. Residents of 2,100 Brisbane streets were told to evacuate and 20,000 homes were inundated. Approximately 35-40 deaths have been attributed to the floods. Two studies have published results on the effects of these floods on the perceived physical and mental health of residents. Researchers using random-digit dialing telephone surveys of more than 6,000 residents between March and June of that year found that 62 % of respondents reported being affected by Queensland&#x02019;s severe summer weather events &#x0201c;in any way&#x0201d;, including property damage (as much as 37 % for those in some suburbs), with 2 % living elsewhere at least temporarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Income was reduced for 17 % of respondents. Trauma impacts ranged from feeling &#x0201c;terrified, helpless or hopeless&#x0201d; (14 %) to thinking they might be &#x0201c;badly injured or die&#x0201d; (4 %). Up to five months after the summer disaster, 7 % of respondents reported being &#x0201c;still distressed&#x0201d; and 9 % were &#x0201c;worried about how they would manage&#x0201d;. Results from a self-report postal survey (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;960) conducted in July 2011 indicated that having been directly impacted by the floods (i.e., residence or vehicles affected by flood waters) was associated with increased risk of worse overall (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.3) and worse respiratory (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3) health, greater psychological distress (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9), and problems sleeping (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3), and with symptoms reflecting probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. As response rates from both studies were less than 50 %, results are not generalizable to the entire population. Nonetheless, these results suggest that the Queensland floods of 2011 had significant impacts on health, including distress in the general population; nothing is known from these studies about effects on pregnant women, however.</p><p>The QF2011 Queensland Flood Study was designed to address the shortcomings of Project Ice Storm and other PNMS research. QF2011 subjects were recruited either through a pre-existing clinical trial or, after the floods, directly into the study outside of the clinical trial.</p><p>The January 2011 floods occurred during the active recruitment period for a large, unrelated study of pregnant women. Since June 2010, the Mater Mothers' Hospital (MMH) in Brisbane had been involved in a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) called the M@NGO trial (Midwives @ New Group practice Options (Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000349246)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. This study pitted standard antenatal care against caseload midwifery care provided within a Midwifery Group Practice (MGP). Approximately 300 Brisbane women had already been recruited into M@NGO prior to the floods, and recruitment continued until the pre-determined end of M@NGO recruitment across all sites on May 31, 2011. For the full M@NGO trial, power analyses had determined that a sample size of 750 women was required to detect a difference, with 80 % power and a type 1 error of 5 %, in the primary, obstetric end-points for the M@NGO Trial; the secondary outcomes of the trial were determined through questionnaires offered at 6-12 weeks and 6 months postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Women were eligible for inclusion in M@NGO regardless of risk factors, and were recruited for the trial at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy, at which time psychosocial and demographic data were gathered.</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two forms of care: standard care (public hospital-based care or shared care with general practitioners) in which prenatal, labor, birth and postnatal care is provided by on duty staff &#x02013; both midwives and doctors; or MGP which provides each woman with a primary midwife who coordinates and provides continuity through prenatal, labor, birth and postnatal domiciliary care (up to six weeks postpartum). The primary midwife is supported by her MGP colleagues (typically 3-4 midwives/MGP) who provide back up in the absence of the primary midwife. In this study, births occurred in-hospital with the primary midwife coordinating higher level care as needed, for women with identified risk factors. A key feature of this model is continuity in care provision with women having 24/7 access to their primary or back-up midwife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. A 2013 Cochrane review of 13 trials (16,242 women) found midwife-led continuity of care was associated with benefits for mothers and babies, with no identified adverse effects compared with models of medical-led care including shared care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Benefits found included reductions in fetal loss prior to 24 weeks&#x02019; gestation, preterm birth, epidural anesthesia, episiotomies, and instrumentally assisted birth. Women&#x02019;s chances of being cared for in labor by a known midwife, and having a spontaneous vaginal birth, were also increased in the midwifery-led continuity care model, as were the rates of maternal satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Expanding on the previous MGP literature described above, the M@NGO trial was the first to test continuity of&#x000a0;care without excluding women at higher obstetric risk at trial entry; as such, the M@NGO participants represent a more real-world sample than in previous MGP research.</p><p>The &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of the MGP intervention are not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The 24/7 access to a known midwife, resuts in&#x000a0;more personalized access to care if needed. Having&#x000a0;a known midwife providing care in labor and the early postpartum period, and having postpartum support for several weeks if required may provide a buffer from psychosocial stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The power of MGP perinatal care to protect pregnant women and their fetuses against psychological stress (whether due to disasters, bereavement, or other hardships) is currently unknown; the subgroup from the M@NGO trial included in the QF2011 study may provide valuable data on the benefits of this model of care as an intervention to buffer against stress.</p><p>Following the Queensland flood, the QF2011 study was &#x02018;piggy-backed&#x02019; onto the M@NGO trial. QF2011 recruited additional pregnant women to create a larger sample size, with M@NGO participants as an important embedded subgroup. The QF2011 recruitment questionnaires included assessments of maternal exposure to, and stress arising from, the floods. The QF2011 protocol included biological sampling from the birth and from the newborn, and added measures of maternal and infant outcomes at 6-12 weeks and 6 months postpartum to the M@NGO protocol, as well as re-administration of the flood-related assessments 12 months post-flood (January 2012). QF2011 also includes direct assessments of the mothers and their children at ages 16 months, 2&#x000bd;, and 4 years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Problem statement, objectives, hypotheses and research questions</title><p>Retrospective human studies suggest that maternal exposure to a natural disaster or other severe stressors increases the fetus&#x02019; risk for disorders in childhood and adulthood. Animal studies, human studies of life events or anxiety, and retrospective epidemiological studies all have a number of limitations that compromise the internal validity of the study design or its conclusions, and tell us little about the active ingredients of the prenatal stress effect.</p><p>The overall aim of this project is to replicate, expand, and improve upon findings from Project Ice Storm to increase understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the effects of maternal exposure to varying levels of hardship imposed by a severe, independent stressor: a natural disaster. We will determine the effects of various aspects of maternal stress due to the 2011 Queensland floods on the mother, her pregnancy and her infant, and the extent to which these effects may be moderated by other biological, psychological, and social factors. We will also determine whether MGP care can be shown to buffer pregnant women and their unborn children against any effects of the floods.</p><p>The primary research question that QF2011 will address is the following: <bold>To what extent will the mothers&#x02019; objective exposure, cognitive appraisal, subjective distress, and cortisol levels from the 2011 Queensland floods explain variance in outcomes for the mother, the pregnancy, and the unborn child?</bold> More specific hypotheses and research questions are presented below.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>By what biological mechanisms do different components of the stress experience (e.g., objective, subjective) get translated through the Maternal-Placental-Fetal (MPF) axis to influence development of the unborn child?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Although much research on fetal-programming by PNMS is conducted on rodents, the functioning of the human placenta is distinct from that of rodents, and no appropriate animal model exists. To date, no human studies have been able to show the links between an objective environmental stressor, placental function and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is also unknown how the cascade of stress through the MPF axis, emerging from objective stress, differs from those of subjective distress. To understand how PNMS affects the MPF axis, three hypothetical models will be studied:</p><p><bold>Model 1:</bold><italic>MPF neuroendocrine systems</italic>. We propose that objective and subjective PNMS will activate a cascade of events leading to an increase in maternal, placental, and fetal cortisol terminating in altered HPA axis function and a lower stress response in the child. We predict that more severe objective/subjective PNMS will decrease activity of the placental/activity of the placental 11&#x003b2;-HSD2, resulting in increased levels of cortisol in placenta and fetal blood (cord blood). Moreover, more severe objective/subjective PNMS will also be associated with increased placental Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production that will, in turn, over-stimulate the maternal HPA axis and thus exacerbate maternal cortisol production and the inhibition of placental 11&#x003b2;-HSD2, resulting in higher levels of cortisol in placenta and fetal blood (cord blood).</p><p><bold>Model 2:</bold><italic>MPF immune systems and metabolic outcome</italic>. We propose that more severe objective/subjective PNMS will be associated with increased maternal catecholamine levels (physiological response to stress) resulting in an abnormally high level of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the&#x000a0;placenta that will increase inflammatory and oxidative status of maternal and fetal blood, which will cause an increase risk in obstetric complications (such as preterm birth, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia), which may then go on to predict future risk for metabolic and psychiatric difficulties in children later in life.</p><p><bold>Model 3:</bold><italic>Birth weight and body composition</italic>: We propose that higher placental cortisol levels will cause a decrease in the production of placental hormones regulated by glucocorticoids (such as human placental lactogen (hPL), placental growth hormone (pGH), leptin, estrogens, progesterone, and glucose transporter type 1(GLUT1; lower maternal-fetal glucose exchange)) resulting in a lower placental efficiency (lower birth weight and higher placental weight), resulting in fetal growth restriction and/or altered programming of body composition in the&#x000a0;child. We hypothesize also that maternal and fetal glucose, insulin, leptin, and other adipocytokines in blood will be involved in this process.</p><p>We also hypothesize that the effects observed in models 1-3 in placental function and in children will be more important for male fetuses compared to female fetuses.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Midwifery Group Practice (MGP) care (in comparison with standard care) will protect pregnant women and their unborn children from the impact of objective levels of exposure and subjective levels of maternal distress arising from the 2011 Queensland floods.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Project Ice Storm found multiple effects of objective stress exposure on child outcomes<italic>.</italic> Although psychosocial treatments may reduce maternal anxiety and subjective stress after a disaster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], they cannot alter the objective hardship and danger that was faced. Because QF2011 is piggy-backed onto the M@NGO study, we have a built-in RCT of prenatal care that commenced before the flooding that may demonstrate protective properties of this more personalized, and supportive, coordinated midwifery approach. We hypothesize that MGP care will buffer effects of flood stress (objective and/or subjective) on maternal outcomes, such as PTSD symptoms and depression, on perinatal outcomes (e.g., gestation length and birth weight), and on child outcomes.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(3)</label><p>Maternal and child genotypes will moderate the effects of PNMS on outcomes.

There are no data, however, on whether maternal sensitivity can moderate the effects of an independent prenatal maternal stressor on child outcomes. By the same token, it is unknown whether an objective, independent stressor in humans will influence maternal behaviors, like sensitivity, which may then mediate effects of PNMS on the child. Thus, we hypothesize that objective exposure and subjective stress from the floods will predict HPA stress reactivity and cognitive development in QF2011 infants, and that this association may be mediated and/or moderated by maternal sensitivity.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(5)</label><p>How do pre-existing levels of depression interact with peritraumatic responses to the Queensland floods to influence the trajectory of maternal mental health following exposure?</p></list-item></list></p><p>Because a measure of perinatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) is administered routinely to all women in Australia at the time of hospital booking, levels of pre-existing maternal depression are available for our subgroup of QF2011 women who had already booked at the Mater hospital prior to the floods. Therefore, the QF2011 study is in a position to respond to unanswered questions about the natural history of maternal mental health in response to a disaster. We predict that depression before exposure to the disaster will interact with levels of distress and dissociation at the time of the flooding (i.e., &#x02018;peritraumatic&#x02019;) to explain variance in postpartum levels of depression, anxiety, PTSD-like symptoms, and positive mental health.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(6)</label><p>If variance in physical characteristics, like fingerprint asymmetry and finger length ratios, are explained by levels of objective and subjective PNMS, what biological processes are they markers for?</p></list-item></list></p><p>King and Laplante have found that PNMS from the Qu&#x000e9;bec ice storm explains significant variance in physical markers associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dermatoglyphic (fingerprint) asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and the ratio of the lengths of the second and fourth fingers (2D:4D ratio) which is reputed to reflect <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].

Because events differ along so many dimensions, disaster questionnaires must be tailor-made. For Project Ice Storm, we formulated objective questions that would reflect the participants&#x02019; experiences related to four of these categories of exposure: Threat, Loss, Scope, and Change. Each dimension was scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;8, ranging from no exposure to high exposure. A total objective stress score was calculated by summing scores from all four dimensions; because there was no theoretical basis to believe that any one of the four dimensions of our scale would be more predictive than the other dimensions, and based on McFarlane&#x02019;s study of Australian fire fighters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], each dimension was weighted equally to obtain the total score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].

This scale was administered to all women at recruitment. It was re-administered at 12 months post-flood (January 2012) to update the values of financial loss, damage to house and property, experiences dealing with insurance companies, etc. Although recruitment and 12 month QFOSS scores are kept separate for some analyses, most analyses will be conducted with a final QFOSS score that integrates information from both.

The IES-R yields a total score as well as scores for three categories of PTSD symptoms: intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale, from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d;, the extent to which each behavior describes how they felt in relation to the floods during the preceding 7 days.

Given that a 12-month post-flood questionnaire was planned, which repeated the administration of the recruitment questionnaire, the steering committee chose to send these women a single questionnaire at 12 months post&#x000a0;flood rather than have them repeat the same questionnaire 2 months apart. As such, these women lacked a &#x0201c;recruitment IES-R&#x0201d; score. In order to impute these missing values, multiple regression was used to estimate their recruitment IES-R scores from post flood questionnaire responses. We used the dataset of women who had completed both the recruitment and the 12-month post flood questionnaires, and created separate algorithms for each IES-R sub-scale (Intrusions, Avoidance and Hyperarousal). Using this set of complete data, we regressed each recruitment IES-R sub-scale score on 12-month post-flood IES-R sub-scale scores, and other related scores that maximized the variance explained (STAI, PDI, PDEQ, MHC, etc.). The models explained 35.5 % (Avoidance), 44.2 % (Intrusions), and 49.1 % (Hyperarousal) of the variance in the recruitment scores. The regression coefficients from these results were used to create the equations we used for imputing the missing IES-R sub-scale scores for women who had not completed a Recruitment questionnaire. Once the sub-scales had been successfully imputed, IES-R Total scores were computed as usual by summing the sub-scales.</p><p>Maternal psychological health, psychosocial factors and other maternal measures</p><p><italic>Maternal anxiety (recruitment, 12 months post-flood, 6-12 weeks, 6 months, and 2&#x000bd; years)</italic></p><p>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]) is a valid and reliable self-report measure of how one generally feels (trait) or currently feels (state).

We will also test the ability of maternal genes associated with the HPA axis to moderate the effects of flood stress on maternal diurnal cortisol after the floods.</p></sec><sec id="FPar52"><title>Maternal mental health</title><p>Next, we will examine genetic and psychosocial mediators and moderators of the associations between flood stress and 12-month post-flood maternal outcomes such as symptoms of anxiety (STAI) and PTSD, as well as positive mental health (MHC-SF). We will test the ability of maternal coping style (Brief COPE) and specific candidate genes to moderate the effects of objective stress exposure on mental health outcomes. For women who had the EPDS administered before the floods, we will also determine the moderating effects of pre-flood depression (as measured by the EPDS) in the association between objective stress exposure and maternal mental health outcomes. Our general approach is to use hierarchical multiple linear regression, adding variables into the equation one block at a time. We first regress maternal mental health on exogenous variables such as maternal genotype and demographics; next, we add objective stress exposure; peritraumatic distress and dissociation; then psychosocial variables needed for the interaction (e.g., coping style); and finally we test one interaction at a time (e.g., objective stress-by-coping). We also test moderation and mediation effects directly using the SPSS PROCESS command; the mediation analyses include bootstrapping.</p></sec><sec id="FPar53"><title>Birth biologicals</title><p>These analyses will be guided by our models of the MPF axis, the first involving a cascade of effects via maternal cortisol to the child&#x02019;s HPA axis functioning (diurnal and reactive cortisol), and second involving a cascade through the catecholamine/inflammatory system. We will begin by testing bivariate associations throughout the model, culminating in structural equation modelling, including testing of moderation of effects by fetal sex and by timing in gestation of the floods.</p></sec><sec id="FPar54"><title>Child development</title><p>We will again use hierarchical linear multiple regression to test the effects of PNMS on child physical, cognitive, behavioral and motor development at each age, testing models similar to those described above for maternal mental health. For those variables that will be assessed at multiple time points (e.g., Ages and Stages, and CBCL), we will employ multi-level modelling once all of the data are obtained at age 4 years. This approach will determine the effects of PNMS on the initial measures of child functioning, and then on the slope of change in functioning over time.</p></sec><sec id="FPar55"><title>Power</title><p>Our best estimates of effect sizes, and feasibility, come from Project Ice Storm which began with approximately 160 live births in 1998. Sixteen years later, there are still 75 families taking part in assessments. With this cohort, we have had sufficient statistical power to show significant effects of the severity and/or timing of ice storm stress on: gestational age, obstetric complications, IQ, language, memory, attention, internalizing and externalizing problems, autistic-like symptoms, fingerprint asymmetry, obesity, brain structure, and other outcomes. Although Project Ice Storm lacks the sample size to test important interactions and advanced modelling, these data nonetheless suggest that we have adequate statistical power with respect to the QF2011 study.</p><p>The QF2011 study noted an initial formal withdrawal rate of 15.9 % between recruitment and the first face-to-face assessments of infants at 16 months of age, the withdrawal rate at the 2&#x000bd; year assessment dropped to 3.7 %. Moreover, of the 191 families remaining in the study at 16 months, 91.6 % completed some portion of the assessment. At age 2&#x000bd; years, 175 families provided data. Currently, a sample of 209 families can be contacted for the 4 year assessment which began in 2015. Using a conservative participation rate of 80 %, it is estimated that data will be available for approximately 167 families at this assessment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Ethics approval for the initial protocol was received from the Mater Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (1709M) on 4<sup>th</sup> April 2011; subsequent protocols were approved for the 16 month, 2&#x000bd;, and 4-year face-to-face assessments (Ref. #1844M). The study also has approval from The University of Queensland (2013001236).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Two 2011 <italic>Nature</italic> papers show that the production of greenhouse gases is responsible for the ever increasing risk of flooding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Prenatal stress research suggests that severe weather events increase the risk for adverse effects in the offspring, via fetal programming, that convey a huge public health burden. The goal of designing interventions for pregnant women in disasters or other stressful situations, to circumvent the effects of stress on the fetus, requires better understanding of the MPF mechanisms involved. The QF2011 study will increase current knowledge about the cascade of effects from an external event to the mother, through placenta and cord, to a host of outcomes in the unborn child. The pre-flood psychological assessments, biological samples at birth, and the embedded midwifery RCT examining the effect of Midwifery Group Practice, have provided a unique opportunity to compile the most comprehensive prospective data set ever obtained to study the effects of an independent stressor on child-bearing women, and risks for PTSD, postpartum depression, pregnancy outcomes, and infant development. By obtaining a multitude of maternal, placental and infant biomarkers from a large sample of women exposed to the flood at different points during pregnancy, we can bring the entire human maternal-placental-fetal system into the laboratory, and test integrated biopsychosocial models of prenatal stress for the first time. Armed with a better understanding of the processes involved, intervention strategies to prevent adverse outcomes in both mother and child can be designed and tested.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12884_2015_539_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
