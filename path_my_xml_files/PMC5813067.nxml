While previous research has used only visual emotional stimuli, communication entails more than that single dimension and it is known that auditory information is also crucial in this process. In addition, it is, however, unclear what the neurobiological mechanism underlying these MDMA effects on social behaviour is. Previously, studies have shown that MDMA-induced emotional excitability and positive mood are linked to the action on the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on processing of sounds (Processing of Affective Sounds Task (PAST)) and cognitive biases (Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)) towards emotional and social stimuli and the role of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor in these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty healthy recreational users entered a 2 &#x000d7; 2, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with ketanserin (40&#x000a0;mg) as pre-treatment and MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) as treatment.

Empathy is only one aspect of social behaviour, and tests are in general based on visual stimuli, e.g., including the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task and the Multifaceted Empathy Test. However, social interactions entail more than one sensory dimension, i.e., the auditory component also plays an important role in this process (Musson-Moyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>; Niedenthal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>). Since all previous experimental MDMA studies have used visual stimuli, the effect of MDMA on the processing of auditory stimuli is not known. The present study therefore included a paradigm assessing the cognitive aspect of auditory stimulus recognition (&#x02018;which sound do you hear?&#x02019;) and the emotional aspects linked to sound processing, i.e., sound-induced arousal and self-concern (&#x02018;how does this make you feel?&#x02019;).</p><p id="Par3">Previously, it has been shown that MDMA decreases amygdala activity and consequently might cause a reduction in avoidance behaviour (Gamma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>; Johansen and Krebs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Bedi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that MDMA induces a positive emotional bias since participants rated favourite memories as significantly more vivid, emotionally intense and positive during MDMA intoxication and worst memories as less negative, compared to placebo (Carhart-Harris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>). The induction of such a cognitive bias and the reduction in avoidance behaviour by MDMA would explain why MDMA increases sociability and empathy. A task often used to study cognitive bias is by means of an approach-avoidance task. This paradigm is based on research indicating that flexions and extensions of the arm when using a joystick are, respectively, related to implicit positive evaluation (approach) and negative evaluation (avoidance) (Neumann and Fritz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2000</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Serotonin (5-HT) and oxytocin systems are known to be involved in approach-avoidance behaviour; i.e., it was shown previously that intranasal administered oxytocin regulates 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and thereby interferes with 5-HT transmission, at the root of the 5-HT system, in the dorsal raphe nucleus (Cools et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008</xref>). Domes and colleagues showed that intranasal application of oxytocin led to a valence-independent modulation of the approach bias and a reduction of amygdala activity to positive and negative stimuli (Domes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). MDMA has previously been shown to induce an elevation in peripheral oxytocin concentrations (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>), and this might be a mechanism by which cognitive biases are induced by MDMA. In the present study, we were interested to test whether MDMA induces a bias towards emotional and social stimuli and whether this correlates with oxytocin concentrations.</p><p id="Par5">Pre-clinical evidence showed that changes in the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor responsivity after repeated administration of MDMA were accompanied by decreased social behaviour suggesting a role for this receptor in MDMA-induced sociality (Bull et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). Studies in humans have shown that the 5-HT<sub>2A/C</sub> plays an important role in emotion and mood. Liechti and colleagues demonstrated that by blocking the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor with ketanserin (50&#x000a0;mg), MDMA (1.5&#x000a0;mg/kg p.o.)-induced emotional excitation was attenuated (Liechti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>). In addition, van Wel and colleagues showed that the effects of a single dose of MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) on positive mood were blocked by pre-treatment with ketanserin (50&#x000a0;mg) while this was not observed for negative mood effects (van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). Since mood and emotional excitability both play a role in the empathic response and social behaviour, and are linked with the activation of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, it was hypothesised that blockade of this receptor could prevent or even counteract MDMA-induced behavioural responses to emotional stimuli.</p><p id="Par6">The present study was set up to assess the effects of a single dose of MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) on processing of emotional sounds, implicit attitudes towards social and emotional stimuli, mood, oxytocin responses and the role of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor herein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par7">Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users (12 males), with a mean (SD) age of 21.2 (2.6)&#x000a0;years.

Pre-treatment was a ketanserin capsule (40&#x000a0;mg), or placebo; treatment was an MDMA capsule (75&#x000a0;mg) or placebo. Capsules were administered orally with water, and all capsules were identically appearing. Ketanserin 40&#x000a0;mg represents a regular therapeutic dose that blocks about 91% of the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors (Brogden and Sorkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>; Sharpley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1994</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">A permit for obtaining, storing and administering MDMA was obtained from the Dutch drug enforcement administration.

After study inclusion and before actual test days, participants were familiarized with the procedures, tests and questionnaires on a training day. They were requested to abstain from any drug use 1&#x000a0;week before the medical examination until the last test day. Participants were asked not to use any caffeinated or alcoholic beverages 24&#x000a0;h before testing and to get a normal night&#x02019;s sleep as assessed.</p><p id="Par11">Prior to experimental sessions, at 9 a.m., participants were screened for drugs of abuse consumption in urine (THC, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines) and had to pass a breathalyser ethanol test. Women were given a pregnancy test. When tests were negative, participants had breakfast, filled out a questionnaire to assess their mood state (Profile of Mood States (POMS)) and a blood sample was taken to assess baseline oxytocin concentrations. Thereafter, pre-treatment was administered followed 30&#x000a0;min later by treatment. POMS and blood samples were taken 90&#x000a0;min after treatment and followed by behavioural tests. After the test battery, i.e., 150&#x000a0;min after treatment and 180&#x000a0;min after pre-treatment, POMS and blood samples were taken again and the test day ended. Test days were minimally separated by a 7-day wash-out period.</p><p id="Par12">The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and its amendments and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and the University of Maastricht. Participants signed an informed consent and were paid upon completion of the testing periods for their participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Processing of Affective Sounds Task</title><p id="Par13">The Processing of Affective Sounds Task (PAST) was constructed to measure the effect of MDMA on processing affective sounds. Sixty sounds with each a duration of 6&#x000a0;s (30 positive/pleasant, 30 negative/unpleasant) were selected from the International Affective Digital Sounds database of (Bradley and Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</xref>) which contains a set of 111 standardized, emotionally evocative sounds that cover a wide range of semantic categories (Stevenson and James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). Previously, in a study of Stevenson and James (Stevenson and James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), participants classified to which extent these sounds belonged to one of five emotional categories (happy, sad, fear, disgust, anger) and how aroused the sounds made them feel. For the purpose of our study, we selected the 30 most positive/pleasant (happy) and 30 most negative/unpleasant (sad (4), fear (19), anger (1), disgust (6)) non-verbal sounds. Norm data from the selected sounds showed that on a nine-point scale, the &#x02018;positive&#x02019; sounds were judged as significantly more pleasant (average rating&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SE [7.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.9]) than negative sounds (2.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4) (<italic>t</italic>

Participants had to type in what they thought they heard (cognitive component, recognition) and subsequently had to categorize the sound as pleasant (rating from one to three), neutral (zero) or unpleasant (rating from &#x02212;1 to &#x02212;3) and rate how aroused the perception of this sound made them (scale from one to nine) (emotional component). Only &#x02018;arousal&#x02019; and &#x02018;feeling&#x02019; ratings from correctly identified sounds were averaged to yield a mean Arousal or Feeling rating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Implicit attitude tests</title><p id="Par15">Three versions of the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) were used to test automatic action tendency towards presented stimuli (pictures). These included AATs to measure approach-avoidance behaviour to social, threat and trust stimuli. Participants were instructed to push or pull a joystick as fast as possible upon appearance of the stimuli, according to the rules, independently of the content of the stimulus. They had to push when the pictures were tilted to the right respectively to the left and pull when the pictures were tilted 3% to the left respectively to the right. Upon movement of the joystick, the picture changed in size such that it grew upon pulling and shrank upon pushing, creating the visual impression that the picture itself is being pulled closer (approach) or pushed away (avoidance). After participants moved the joystick and the picture changed format, the picture disappeared, irrespective of whether it was a correct response. Each image was presented four times, i.e., twice in pull and twice in push format. The resulting trials were presented in a semi-random order, i.e., at most three similar rotations and image categories in a row and preceded by 15 practice trials with grey rectangles (procedure cfr. (Cousijn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>)). The dependent variable was a bias score which was calculated by subtracting median approach reaction time (RT) from median avoid RT for each image category. The bias could either be positive (approach bias) or be negative (avoidance bias) indicating the automatic action tendency towards or away from a scene (Social AAT) or an emotion (Threat AAT/Trust). Before this bias was calculated, data were corrected for outliers meaning that extreme high (&#x0003e;2000&#x000a0;ms or &#x02265;3 SD above the individual participants&#x02019; mean RT) or extreme low reaction times (&#x0003c;200&#x000a0;ms or &#x02264;3 SD from the individual participants&#x02019; mean RT) were removed (procedure cf. (Cousijn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>)).</p><p id="Par16">For both the Threat AAT and the Trust AAT, 24 pictures (12 neutral + 12 high threat; 12 neutral + 12 high trustworthy) were selected from the data set of Oosterhof and Todorov (Oosterhof and Todorov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). This resulted for both tasks in 96 trials. For the Social AAT, 36 black and white pictures were selected containing either nature scenes (neutral category) or scenes with one (&#x02018;social low&#x02019;) or multiple persons (&#x02018;social high&#x02019;). Twelve pictures per category resulted in 144 trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>The Profile of Mood States</title><p id="Par17">The POMS (de Wit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2002</xref>) is a self-assessment mood questionnaire with 72 five-point Likert scale items, representing eight mood states; i.e., Anxiety, Depression, Anger, Vigour, Fatigue, Confusion, Friendliness and Elation. Two extra scales are derived, i.e., Arousal ((Anxiety + Vigour) &#x02212; (Fatigue + Confusion)) and Positive mood (Elation &#x02212; Depression).

It was demonstrated that MDMA reduced arousal experienced by negative sounds. This effect was counteracted by ketanserin. Findings showed in general no effects of MDMA on approach-avoidance behaviour. Ketanserin, however, induced avoidance behaviour in the Social AAT, independent of stimulus content, and approach behaviour in the Trust AAT, when it was administered alone. When combined with MDMA, approach behaviour in the Trust AAT was decreased. MDMA caused, in line with previous findings (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>), an increase in positive and negative mood, it lowered ratings of fatigue and it increased oxytocin plasma concentrations. Ketanserin counteracted a selection of MDMA-induced mood effects 150&#x000a0;min after MDMA intake.</p><p id="Par37">In the Processing of Affective Sounds task, it was shown that MDMA reduced arousal induced by negative sounds; pre-treatment with ketanserin changed the MDMA response, i.e., increasing the arousal experienced by negative sounds and thereby returning the arousal levels to a placebo-like response. This placebo response was in line with the norm data on which the task was based (Stevenson and James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>) and previous findings in non-drug using volunteers, showing that listening to unpleasant sounds induced larger startle reflexes and larger heart rate decelerations compared with listening to pleasant sounds. It was suggested that these sounds activated the appetitive and defensive motivational circuits (Bradley and Lang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</xref>). Our findings suggest an MDMA-induced indifference to negative sounds, or an inhibition of fear induced by negative sounds, which could hint at an inhibition of in-built fear responses (Phillips et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1998</xref>). These findings are also in line with a rodent study, showing disruption of pre-pulse inhibition after treatment with MDMA, which was counteracted by a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist. It was concluded that the effect of MDMA was caused by action on this receptor (Padich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1996</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">The absence of significant correlations between self-rated arousal levels on the POMS in the separate drug conditions and the arousal elicited by the emotional sounds demonstrates that the observed effects were not simply related to a general MDMA effect on arousal levels but were stimulus dependent. While the general level of arousal was rated higher in the MDMA condition and lower when MDMA was combined with ketanserin, this pattern was opposite when confronted with auditory stimuli in the PAST. So, during MDMA intoxication participants experienced more general arousal but stimulus-related arousal was less, especially when confronted with negative stimuli. This is a very interesting reaction, and it can be suggested that participants felt less discomfort or more at ease when they heard negative sounds. This could contribute to the therapeutic potential of MDMA in a therapeutic setting, i.e., when patients are asked to talk about their negative experiences and then being confronted in an auditory way with the negative wording, their arousal levels might, not increase, their defences might be lowered which has been suggested to contribute to the therapeutic process (Greer and Tolbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1990</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">MDMA induced in general no cognitive bias, as suggested by the absence of effects on the approach-avoidance tasks. In the Trust-AAT, it counterintuitively decreased the ketanserin-induced stimulus-intensity-independent approach behaviour. Interestingly, many studies have shown that approach and avoidance arm movements are facilitated by positive and negative affect, respectively (Phaf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>). MDMA is known to cause an increase in both affective states (van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>), e.g., increasing positive mood but in parallel also elevating feelings of anxiety and confusion. This effect on both mood states could explain the lack of hypothesised effects. Separately blocking the positive and negative mood effects of MDMA could be used to test whether MDMA induces a mood-congruent cognitive bias, i.e., approaching when in a positive mood and avoiding when in a negative mood state. Previously, it was shown that negative mood effects (anxiety) could be blocked by using verbal support during an MDMA session (Vizeli and Liechti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>), while positive effects were inhibited by using ketanserin in combination with MDMA (van Wel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>). In addition, while previous research demonstrated that intranasal administration of oxytocin modulates approach bias (Domes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>), it was shown that the MDMA-induced increase in oxytocin plasma concentrations is smaller than the increase induced by intranasal administered oxytocin (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). The latter potentially also explains why in the present study, no MDMA-induced bias was found.</p><p id="Par40">In line with previous studies (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>), MDMA caused an increase in oxytocin concentrations, 90 and 150&#x000a0;min after administration, i.e., oxytocin plasma concentrations were doubled compared to placebo. Interestingly, ketanserin blocked this MDMA-induced elevation in oxytocin concentrations but only 150&#x000a0;min after MDMA administration, i.e., 180&#x000a0;min after pre-treatment with ketanserin. This effect was not observed 90&#x000a0;min after MDMA administration, respectively, 110&#x000a0;min after ketanserin pre-treatment. The ketanserin-induced changes in oxytocin concentrations were not associated with the ketanserin-induced changes in MDMA-mood effects. Ketanserin works as an antagonist on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, and previously, animal studies have shown that the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor is involved in oxytocin secretion (J&#x000f8;rgensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>). It is therefore suggested that the MDMA-induced elevation of oxytocin concentrations could be attributed to its action on the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, though this needs to be investigated further. In addition to this, previous research has shown the oxytocin receptor gene to be associated with sociability feelings during MDMA intoxication (Bershad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>) and with the efficiency of social auditory processing (Tops et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the oxytocin receptor gene in combination with actions on the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor could also mediate the efficiency of sound processing after MDMA administration.</p><p id="Par41">In conclusion, present findings seem to suggest that a single dose of MDMA (75&#x000a0;mg) does not induce a specific bias towards emotional or social stimuli but it reduces arousal experienced by listening to negative sounds. The latter effect seems to be mediated by the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, since ketanserin blocked this effect. This behavioural effect was not related to subjectively experienced arousal. It is suggested that this seemingly lowering of defences when confronted with negative stimuli might play a role in the therapeutic process.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The original version of this article was revised: One of the authors was missing its initial.
