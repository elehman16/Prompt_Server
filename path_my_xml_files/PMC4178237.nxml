Participants, the bronchoscopist, and immunologists were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was safety, assessed by the frequency and severity of vaccine-related local and systemic adverse events. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed with laboratory markers of cell-mediated immunity in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed for 24 weeks after vaccination. Immunogenicity to both insert Ag85A and vector modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was assessed by ex-vivo interferon-&#x003b3; ELISpot and serum ELISAs.

Respiratory adverse events were rare and mild. Intradermal MVA85A was associated with expected mild local injection-site reactions. Systemic adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. Three participants in each group had no vaccine-related systemic adverse events; fatigue (11/24 [46%]) and headache (10/24 [42%]) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Ag85A-specific systemic responses were similar across groups. Ag85A-specific CD4 T cells were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from both groups and responses were higher in the aerosol group than in the intradermal group. MVA-specific cellular responses were detected in both groups, whereas serum antibodies to MVA were only detectable after intradermal administration of the vaccine.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Further clinical trials assessing the aerosol route of vaccine delivery are merited for tuberculosis and other respiratory pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The Wellcome Trust and Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis is caused by inhalation of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and remains a major global public health problem, causing 1&#x000b7;3 million deaths worldwide in 2012. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The only licensed vaccine, intradermal BCG, is effective in preventing disseminated tuberculosis, but confers a highly variable degree of protection against pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in adults.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref></p><p>One tuberculosis vaccine development strategy is to boost BCG with a subunit vaccine expressing one or more <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> antigens.

High numbers of cells making Ag85A-specific cytokines were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from both participants. Most interferon-&#x003b3;-producing CD4 T cells also produced TNF&#x003b1; and interleukin 17. Interferon &#x003b3; from CD8 T cells was also detected in these samples. Frequencies of whole blood CD4 T cells producing interferon &#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, interleukin 2, and interleukin 17 were also high in these two participants (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

Bronchoscopic airway examination, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, and S<sub>p</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were within normal limits, providing further reassuring evidence for the absence of harm to the airways. Systemic reactogenicity of MVA85A administered by both routes was mild, which is consistent with previous trials.</p><p>Although an isolated case of shingles occurred in one participant 11 days after aerosol administration of MVA85A, no previous vaccine-related cases of shingles have been reported in more than 2500 recipients of intradermal MVA85A (H McShane, unpublished). Shingles is quite common in the general population and has been reported to occur before 45 years of age in 8&#x000b7;6% of healthy men and 10&#x000b7;5% of healthy women.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In a recent US phase 1 trial of a novel live recombinant BCG tuberculosis candidate vaccine, two of eight participants developed shingles within 2&#x02013;3 months of vaccination.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>The aerosol route of immunisation induced potent antigen-specific T-cell responses in the bronchoalveolar lavage and in the systemic circulation. Compared with the intradermal vaccination route, the aerosol route induced equally strong systemic responses and significantly stronger bronchoalveolar lavage responses. The cytokines measured&#x02014;interferon &#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, interleukin 2, and interleukin 17&#x02014;are important for the control of mycobacterial infection.<xref rid="bib17 bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17&#x02013;20</sup></xref> The intradermal route also induced lung CD4 T-cell responses, although these were of a smaller size than those induced by the aerosol route.

In this study, we could not detect antivector or anti-insert antibodies in bronchoalveolar fluid from any participants, possibly because the fluid is highly diluted. A vaccination route that does not induce immunity to the vector, which could interfere with insert-induced responses, is an attractive approach for vaccines that need repeat administration.</p><p>The two participants who received high-dose MVA85A had higher systemic and mucosal Ag85A responses than did those who received the lower dose. Because the two participants who received the high dose were randomly allocated to the aerosol group, whether or not a similarly high intradermal dose would lead to an increase in cellular mucosal responses is unclear. One of the two participants who had the high dose had a strong anti-MVA interferon-&#x003b3; response (both CD4 and CD8 T cells).</p><p>MVA85A has been given intradermally in all previous trials in human beings, including the recent efficacy trial in tuberculosis-exposed BCG-vaccinated infants, in which immunogenicity was modest and no significant enhanced efficacy was recorded.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Direct delivery of the vaccine to the lungs might improve immunogenicity and efficacy.
