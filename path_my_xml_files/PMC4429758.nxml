RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7&#x02013;10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12&#x02013;23 or 24&#x02013;35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6&#x02013;11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3&#x02013;7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0&#x02013;17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1&#x02013;0.3] per 100 PY).

RSV infection elicits symptoms ranging from sinusitis and otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [<xref rid="CIV065C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In temperate climates, outbreaks occur in winter months. Tropical countries also have RSV seasons but with greater variation than in temperate locations [<xref rid="CIV065C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>A review of the global burden of RSV estimates an annual incidence of approximately 34 million episodes of ALRI associated with RSV infection in children aged &#x0003c;5 years [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Just over 3 million episodes were estimated to result in hospitalization and between 66 000 and 199 000 in death [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most deaths (99%) occur in the developing world [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Infants have consistently higher rates of RSV-associated illness and hospitalization than older children in both industrialized and developing nations [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIV065C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The high burden of RSV-associated morbidity and mortality means that development of safe and effective vaccines is a priority. Several candidates are in development [<xref rid="CIV065C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, more information on the epidemiology of RSV is needed to inform control strategies. Few studies have captured RSV burden using community-based active surveillance of healthy children and laboratory-confirmed RSV. In addition, the burden and seasonality of disease in southern hemisphere, tropical, and subtropical countries need to be better understood, as does the burden in specific age groups including older children.</p><p>Vaccine efficacy trials are ideally placed to evaluate viral epidemiology, as they provide intensive, active follow-up of a well-defined population. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines, we evaluated the prevalence and incidence of RSV in children aged 6 months to &#x0003c;10 years at first vaccination and undergoing 1 year of prospective active and passive community-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of RSV among ILI episodes. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI in the study population and occurrence of coinfection of RSV with other respiratory viruses in ILI were also estimated. Samples were obtained from an efficacy trial of 2 pandemic influenza H1N1 vaccines (NCT01051661 sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.) [<xref rid="CIV065C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and Conduct of the Clinical Trial</title><p>The trial was a randomized, observer-blind, parallel group, multicountry trial of AS03-adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccines. The trial was conducted at 17 centers in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between 15 February 2010 and 19 August 2011. Completion of enrollment took up to 6 months and varied by country [<xref rid="CIV065C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The institutional review board for each participating center approved the trial. Parents/guardians provided written informed consent. Healthy children aged 6 months to &#x0003c;10 years were enrolled.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Surveillance for Influenza-like Illness and Sample Analysis</title><p>Passive surveillance was conducted from the day of first vaccination; parents were instructed to contact the study center within 24 hours after the child became ill. Active surveillance via scripted telephone contact was conducted from 2 weeks after first vaccination, and contact was made every 1&#x02013;2 weeks through day 385. ILI was defined as fever (temperature, &#x02265;38.0&#x000b0;C) by any route and at least 1 of the following: new/worsening cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea.</p><p>One anterior nasal swab and 1 throat swab were collected ideally within 24 hours of ILI onset and, at most, within 7 days. Swabs were transported in a single tube of M4RT transport medium, stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C, and maintained on dry ice during transport. Samples were ideally collected at the child's home, but a visit to a study center could be arranged if necessary. If the child was hospitalized, the sample was collected at the hospital if feasible. A 7-day symptom-free period was required between new ILI episodes. Analysis of samples for RSV (subtypes A and B) and other respiratory pathogens was performed using standard multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques [<xref rid="CIV065C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIV065C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome Variables and Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary outcome variable was PCR-confirmed RSV in nasal/throat swabs in children with ILI. The primary outcome included both single RSV infection and coinfections with other respiratory viruses. Single RSV infections and coinfections with other respiratory viruses were also recorded separately. Pneumonia was documented in children with ILI and was defined as an acute illness (1 or more of the following symptoms: fever [temperature, &#x02265;38&#x000b0;C], new or worsening cough, dyspnea, consistent auscultation findings [rales or diminished breath sounds], pain in the chest or abdomen when breathing, or purulent or bloodstained sputum production) and radiologic findings consistent with pneumonia. Clinical characteristics of the ILI episode (reported by the child's parent), any medical attendance, and any hospitalization were recorded. Medical attendance did not include contact with study personnel to collect nasal/throat samples.</p><p>Analysis of prevalence was performed on the total cohort, with ILI episodes tested by multiplex PCR, which included all children enrolled who experienced an ILI and had an adequate nasal/throat sample.

As there was a window of at least 7 days between 2 ILI episodes, it was assumed that each episode was independent. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed [<xref rid="CIV065C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Prevalence was stratified according to country and age at the time of the ILI episode (6&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;23, 24&#x02013;35, 36&#x02013;59, 60+ months), whether the child was medically attended (saw a doctor or other healthcare professional), and whether the child was hospitalized.</p><p>Analysis of incidence was performed on the total cohort, which included all children enrolled.

Almost all children with ILI associated with RSV experienced a new or worsening cough (96%), which is a common symptom of lower respiratory tract infection. Among children with ILI but no RSV infection, 78% experienced a new or worsening cough. The median length of ILI episode associated with RSV was 8 days. The median in different age groups ranged from 6 to 10 days in Australia, 6 to 16 days in Brazil, 7 to 9 days in Colombia, 12 to 25 days in Costa Rica, 5 to 14 days in Mexico, 5 to 8 days in the Philippines, 0 to 10 days in Singapore, and 6 to 9 days in Thailand.

We therefore conducted 1 year of prospective active and passive community-based surveillance of healthy children in multiple tropical and southern hemisphere countries where prospective data are lacking. Because community-based surveillance is difficult and costly to carry out, most studies have been based on hospital-based surveillance. This captures only severe RSV infection that has resulted in hospitalization [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and is limited in developing countries by its dependence on access to hospitals. Because our study was conducted as part of a clinical trial, it benefitted from active follow-up, a well-characterized population, consistent methodology between countries, samples taken from a high proportion of children, and use of a sensitive and specific PCR assay for RSV detection. In addition, we studied a wide age range up to 10 years, unlike most other studies that typically focused on children aged &#x02264;5 years. By stratifying the age groups, we could detect differences in incidence and prevalence across ages.</p><p>The study showed a prevalence of RSV type A or B in ILI ranging from 4.2% to 16.2% across countries, with an overall prevalence of 9.7%. The observed overall prevalence of RSV subtype B in ILI was higher than subtype A (6.5% vs 3.0%), although this was not consistent across countries. Overall, prevalence declined with age, ranging from 18.2% in the 6- through 11-month age group to 3.7% in the &#x0003e;60-month age group. The Philippines was the only country with the highest RSV prevalence in the youngest age group (37.1%); in other countries, the highest prevalence was in the 12- through 23- or the 24- through 35-month age groups. The incidence of RSV in ILI across countries ranged from 0 to 81.1 per 100 PY (6&#x02013;11 months), 0 to 31.1 per 100 PY (12&#x02013;23 months), 10.8 to 24.7 per 100 PY (24&#x02013;35 months), 2.2 to 10.3 per PY (36&#x02013;59 months), and 0.6 to 3.4 per PY (60+ months). The Philippines and Mexico were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6&#x02013;11 months; in other countries, the highest incidence was in the 12- through 23- or the 24- through 35-month age groups. However, interpretation of the 6&#x02013;11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6&#x02013;11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6- through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season.</p><p>Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [<xref rid="CIV065C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged &#x0003c;5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [<xref rid="CIV065C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The estimated incidence per 100 PY in these studies was 2.2 in Bangladesh, 2.7 in India, 4.8 in Indonesia, 8.4 in Kenya, 9.4 in Nigeria, and 12.8 in Guatemala.</p><p>Several other active surveillance studies have evaluated RSV in different age groups. In children in Indonesia aged &#x0003c;59 months, the incidence of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was highest in children aged 6&#x02013;23 months (19.8, 10.4, and 15.4 per 100 PY in the 6- through 8-, 9- through 11-, and 12- through 23-month age groups) [<xref rid="CIV065C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6- through 8-month age group [<xref rid="CIV065C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0- to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3- through 5- and 9- through 11-month age groups [<xref rid="CIV065C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0&#x02013;5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6&#x02013;30 months [<xref rid="CIV065C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A study in India reported a more uniform distribution of RSV-associated ALRI across age groups (3.3, 5.2, and 2.7 per 100 PY in children aged 0&#x02013;11, 12&#x02013;23, and 24&#x02013;35 months, respectively) [<xref rid="CIV065C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our study illustrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness. As far as we know, it is the first active surveillance study of RSV to capture incidence data on medical attendance outside the hospital setting. Most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. One third of ILI episodes associated with RSV resulted in absence from school or day care; however, not all children attended school or day care. Eight of 88 ILI episodes that required hospitalization were associated with RSV, an overall incidence of 0.2 per 100 PY. This compares with RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization of 1 per 100 PY in Kenya [<xref rid="CIV065C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, surprisingly few pneumonia cases were observed in our study. A recent review of pneumonia worldwide estimated the number of new episodes of RSV-associated pneumonia in children aged 0&#x02013;4 years to be 17 778 in Australia, 431 938 in Brazil, 140 879 in Colombia, 10 724 in Costa Rica, 320 132 in Mexico, 700 364 in the Philippines, 3126 in Singapore, and 186 889 in Thailand, although the incidence rate was not calculated [<xref rid="CIV065C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>One of the most important study limitations was that only healthy children entered the efficacy trial (eg, no children with malnutrition), so that participants were healthier than those from a random community sample, thus, limiting generalizability. Despite this limitation, we demonstrated a high RSV burden, highlighting that it is not confined to children at high risk. Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged &#x0003c;2 years 6 months [<xref rid="CIV065C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIV065C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses. Finally, we recruited no children aged &#x0003c;6 months and a limited number of children aged 6&#x02013;11 months, so our findings are relevant only to older children.</p><p>Our use of active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through the more usual hospital-based surveillance methods. A substantial part of the RSV burden occurs in older infants and children. This has implications for future vaccination strategies, including the possibility of broadening the target age range.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/civ065/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>).
