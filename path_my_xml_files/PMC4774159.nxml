While intrinsic diagnostic value of these tests is demonstrated, the consequences of carrying out these tests on opiate maintenance treatment (OMT) have not been established. The main objective will be to assess the impact of on-site urine drug screening tests (OS-UDS) in general practice compared to routine medical care on OMT retention at 6 months in opioid-dependent patients initiating buprenorphine.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The ESUB-MG study uses a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial design. General Practitioners (GPs) regularly managing patients treated with buprenorphine and consenting for participating will be invited to participate. GPs will be randomly assigned to one of two groups for 6 to 24&#x000a0;months: (a) control group (usual care: standard medical strategy for assessing drug use); (b) interventional group (including 1/ a training session on practice and interpretation of OS-UDS; 2/ the supply of OS-UDS at GPs&#x02019; medical offices; 3/ performing an OS-UDS before the first prescription of bupr&#x000e9;norphine). GPs will have to include 1 to 10 patients aged 18&#x000a0;years-old or more, consulting for starting treatment by buprenorphine, not opposed to participate. The primary outcome will be OMT retention at 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized interventional trial should bring sufficient level of evidence to assess effectiveness of performing OS-UDS in general practice for patients treated by buprenorphine. Training GPs to drug tests and supplying them in their office should lead to an improvement of opioid-addicted patients&#x02019; care through helping decision.</p></sec><sec><title>Trials registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02345655?term=esub&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02345655</ext-link> (first registration May 14, 2014)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Opioid related disorder</kwd><kwd>Opiate substitutive treatment</kwd><kwd>Buprenorphine</kwd><kwd>Substance abuse detection</kwd><kwd>Urine drug screening test</kwd><kwd>Outpatient</kwd><kwd>General practitioner</kwd><kwd>Maintenance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004690</institution-id><institution>Minist&#x000e8;re de la Sant&#x000e9;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHRCN1370450N</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Opioid addiction is currently defined as a &#x0201c;chronic, relapsing disorder&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mortality of untreated heroin dependence is consistently estimated at 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;% per year, at least half of which is because of heroin overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Beyond mortality and morbidity, heroin dependence inflicts enormous social and economic costs due to crime, unemployment, relationship breakdown, and the cost of law enforcement. Data from systematic reviews show that methadone maintenance is the most effective treatment in retaining patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The systematic review by Mattick et al. demonstrated the efficacy of buprenorphine maintenance treatment, with a lower retention rate than methadone but giving a similar decrease in opiate consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone (marketed as Suboxone&#x000ae;) was created to prevent the injection of buprenorphine. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in preventing intravenous use of buprenorphine is not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The management of opiate-dependent patients in France is shared among specialized centres and general practitioners (GPs). Three drugs are available for the maintenance treatment methadone, buprenorphine (approved since 1995) and buprenorphine-naloxone (approved since 2006). Methadone must be initially prescribed by practitioners in specialized addiction centers, whereas buprenorphine and buprenorphine-naloxone should be prescribed by any general practitioner and available through community pharmacies. The number of people receiving maintenance treatment was estimated around 100,000 for high-dose buprenorphine and around 40,000 for methadone in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Because the availability and the easy access to buprenorphine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] most of opiate-dependent patients are managed in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Actually, few GPs take care of these patients: they were only 24&#x000a0;% in 2009 to regularly take care of patients under opiate maintenance treatment (OMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One of their difficulties is to evaluate the concordance between the patient&#x02019;s word and his drug use (OMT and other illicit drugs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] while associated drug use is frequent (at least one or two thirds of patients under OMT would also consume alcohol and benzodiazepines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]).</p><p>In the field of addiction, assessment of substances consumption is crucial for diagnosis and, even more, for medical management. Nevertheless, this assessment is often difficult as self-reports use to under estimate psychoactive substances&#x02019; consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One Scandinavian study in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] compared the assessment by the psychiatrist of drug consumption in an emergency setting to that obtained by a urine drug screening test (UDT); the reference method being chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The physician had correctly assessed the consumption of alcohol but the assessment for illicit substances was not so good for other- psychoactive substances. The value of urine drug screening was assessed comparing urine screening tests&#x02019; results and chromatography. At the same time, urine drug screening presented a better sensitivity for benzodiazepines, opiates and cannabis. This study clearly showed that physicians&#x02019; assessment of psychoactive drug use lead to underestimate the true consumptions, and UDT would be useful in making decisions about treatment.</p><p>By contrast, in certain context, patients can overestimate their use of psychoactive substances notably when entering a detoxification program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>French guidelines highlight the need to assess opiate dependence for the management of patients taking OMT: screening tests have to be performed before introducing methadone; they are recommended before starting treatment with buprenorphine and during the follow up of both treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Methadone prescription guidelines detail the recommended urine tests: a first, mandatory test before starting methadone treatment and later control tests. The first urine test confirms current drug consumption and the absence of methadone intake. Tests are subsequently done once or twice a week during the first 3&#x000a0;months of treatment, then twice monthly. When the patient has transferred to an outpatient setting, tests can be done if the physician considers it necessary. Tests are not obligatory for buprenorphine, but highly recommended. In 2011, French guidelines advised a standardized screening test schedule in the initiation and follow-up of buprenorphine treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The drug tests can be carried out by immunochemical methods, either by automated analyzers in the biology laboratory or by drug screening kits. These tests (whether on a laboratory automat or using a commercial kit) are qualitative and have defined thresholds. False negatives exist for cocaine and benzodiazepines in particular, but test quality is intrinsically better for opiate detection (1.9&#x000a0;% false negatives) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Results can be confirmed by the reference method, liquid or gas phase chromatography with mass spectrometry, which gives quantitative measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Screening can be done during the patient&#x02019;s visit, in either a specialized addiction centre or the physician&#x02019;s office. Laboratory tests, regardless of the method or the biological medium, are reimbursed by the French health insurance system with no limit on their number or time period. In medical offices, immunoassays have been shown to be reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; nevertheless, on-site urine drug screening (OS-UDS) by commercial kits are not reimbursed by the French health insurance system but some specialized addiction networks in France provide them to their members.</p><p>In a recent study performed among a sample of French GPs, only 12.2&#x000a0;% of GPs reported to perform urinary screening tests and in this proportion were counted GPs who reported to use them for other reasons than initiation and follow up of OMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The main reason for not performing UDS was a lack of knowledge about screening tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Among the few GPs using tests, the consequence they reported was mainly reinforcing dialogue with the patient. In another study performed in the same area among 1,507 patients initiating an OMT with buprenorphine or methadone, only 2.6&#x000a0;% had at least a drug test reimbursed by the Health Insurance System during their addiction treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Few studies explored the consequences of carrying out these tests on medical management. In the previous cited study, having been drug tested was associated with a better opiate substitution maintenance, with 45&#x000a0;% decrease of drop-outs (95&#x000a0;% CI: 0.38&#x02013;0.80) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a retrospective cohort study of methadone users performed through data obtained from a primary care prescription registry in Tayside, Scotland, a history of having urine tested was a protective factor in relation to all-cause mortality with a reduction of 70&#x000a0;% of risk of death (HR 0.33, 0.22 to 0.49) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. On the basis of the literature, one would suppose that carrying out UDS would provide an improvement in the management of patients with opioid addiction and positive outcomes for patients such as longer opiate substitution maintenance and its clinical consequences in which a decrease in mortality. However, this hypothesis relies only on observational data, and we cannot rule out confusion bias.</p><p>In order to provide more consolidated data on the interest of using UDT in the context of general practice, we propose an interventional trial, which the main objective is to assess the impact of on-site urine drug screening tests in general practice compared to routine medical care on OMT retention at 6 months in opioid-dependent patients initiating buprenorphine. Second objectives are to assess the acceptability of OS-UDS by patients and GPs, to assess patient adherence to buprenorphine and to assess associated psychoactive consumptions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The ESUB-MG study is a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial design.

Consecutively, academic general medicine departments were developed in each faculty. In 2008, an academic pathway of general medicine was created.</p><p>In order to assist the French health authorities, in charge of the monitoring and the scheduling of psychoactive substances with abuse potential, a monitoring system for psychoactive medications abuse consisting of a national network of 13 centers for evaluation and information on pharmacodependence-addictovigilance (CEIP-A) was created in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>In both sources for selection, GPs will be contacted by postal mail comprising a questionnaire for validating inclusion criteria for the GP, and an agreement form for participating to the ESUB-MG study.

Clusters will not be randomized all at once (first patients inclusion need to begin whereas GPs&#x02019; recruitment will be on-going), thus the allocation for each consecutive participating GP will be obtained from the USMR through a specific website. To avoid contamination bias, no more than one GP could be included in a given medical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Intervention</title><p>Intervention will consist in: 1) a training session for GPs on use and interpretation of OS-UDS; 2) the supply of OS-UDS at GPs&#x02019; medical offices; 3) performing an OS-UDS before the first prescription of buprenorphine. GPs will be let free to perform OS-UDS for the follow-up if they judge it necessary.</p><p>GP assigned to the intervention group will be visited by a clinical research assistant (CRA) to be trained on the methods for performing test (urinary sample collection and reading of the test results). The training session is expected to last about 1&#x000a0;h, and a written guidance will be provided. Material for testing (OS-UDS) will also be supplied during this session. OS-UDSs will be centrally bought by the CHU de Toulouse and will be provided by the CRA in charge of the training session.</p><p>During the consult, GPs of the intervention group will dedicate an average 5&#x000a0;min to perform OS-UDS. Patients will be asked to collect a urine sample at the GP&#x02019;s medical office. GP will read and communicate the results immediately to the patients. GPs will keep free of their management according to OS-UDS results.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>OS-UDS characteristics</title><p>OS-UDS will be in accordance with positivity threshold recommended by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMSHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The SAMSHA increase the threshold for screening opiates in 2008 (2000&#x000a0;ng/mL instead of 300&#x000a0;ng/mL) to avoid false positive to ingestion of poppy-seeds. Nevertheless, many laboratories maintained the threshold of 300&#x000a0;ng/mL to preserve the opiates screening sensibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, we will use the threshold of 300&#x000a0;ng/mL.</p><p>Several substances will be screened through the OS-UDS in our study: buprenorphine, methadone&#x02019;s metabolite, 2-ethylidine-1,5-dimethyl-3,3 diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), opiates, and cocaine. Opiate substitutes should be systematically screened before starting buprenorphine, according to guidelines. Buprenorphine screening is intended to assess adherence to OMT after initiation, whereas opiates are screened to monitor concomitant consumptions over the course of OMT, or to confirm an opiate addiction before the first prescription (which confirms the indication of OMT). Methadone screening is intended to rule out an ongoing treatment by methadone. Cocaine is often consumed with opiates. In France, at least 10&#x000a0;% of patients would be concerned by cocaine consumption while they are treated with an opioid substitute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and it is associated with negative outcome. Some patients could request for an OMT being unaware of the indication of these drugs and believing they could be offered such treatment.</p><p>Positivity thresholds currently used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and that we will use are: buprenorphine: 10&#x000a0;ng/mL ; EDDP (the metabolite of methadone): 100&#x000a0;ng/mL ; opiates: 300&#x000a0;ng/mL ; cocaine: 300&#x000a0;ng/mL.</p><p>At these thresholds, sensibility was 80&#x000a0;% (IC 95 %: 55&#x02013;100) and specificity 99&#x000a0;% [96 &#x02013; 100] for opiates, sensibility not calculable and specificity 100&#x000a0;% [100&#x02013;100] for cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In another study, sensibility for buprenorphine with 3 different OS-UDS varied from 88 to 100&#x000a0;% and specificity from 91 to 100&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Controlled group</title><p>Controlled arm will correspond to standard medical strategy for assessing consumptions while prescribing OMT. Excluding OS-UDS, there will be no prohibited procedure. In particular, GPs of the controlled harm are authorized to implement any biological test to ascertain associated substances use, including for instance laboratory testing. However, according to previous data, we can expected that few drug tests should be performed in this control group: 1 to 3&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome will be OMT retention at 6&#x000a0;months.

Actually, a review on all Cochrane systematic reviews performed by the Cochrane Review Group on Drugs and Alcohol highlighted that the main outcomes used in studies assessing effectiveness of opiate maintenance treatment were retention in treatment and illicit use of heroin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Whatever the treatments compared, the retention in treatment was the most constant and the most reproducible outcome used over the different clinical trials because heroin use (assessed through different ways, self-reported or through urinary analysis) is rarely reported in a standardized way. This outcome could be considered as intermediate steps of treatment for heroin-addicted patients. Because observational studies showed high rates of mortality in heroin-addicted patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], especially early after discharge from treatment, the ability of a treatment in retaining people in treatment should be reported as a proxy of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Retention in treatment will be defined as patients remaining under opiate maintenance treatment at 6&#x000a0;months in a context of medical care (i.e. drug prescribed by a physician, not diverted or obtained through an illegal way, whatever the drug considered, buprenorphine; buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone) and assessed by the general practitioner at the end of the follow-up. Patients switching from buprenorphine to methadone or to buprenorphine/naloxone during study follow-up will be considered as remaining under opiate maintenance treatment.</p><p>The patient will be defined as retained in treatment if he will be prescribed by the same GP a legal opiate maintenance drug, or if the drug will be prescribed by another practitioner in connection with the treating physician. In case of loss of follow-up or diverted use of drug (intravenous or nasal route or illegal acquisition of the OMT drug), the patient will be considered as not retained. In case of death, the patient will be considered as maintained until the date of death, and censored after this date. Buprenorphine must be prescribed under strict conditions for a maximum of 28&#x000a0;days (methadone for a maximum of 14&#x000a0;days). Consequently, a patient not attending a medical visit for more than 56&#x000a0;days (2&#x000a0;months) should be considered as not remaining under opiate maintenance treatment.</p><p>Retention in treatment has to be recorded at 6&#x000a0;months (time window tolerated of +/&#x02212; 14&#x000a0;days) as there is no scheduled or mandatory visit for the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary judgment criteria will be the adherence to buprenorphine associated psychoactive substances use, and acceptability of OS-UDS reported by the patient, the GP.</p><p>We will specifically collect for both groups: characteristics of buprenorphine utilization (dose, duration), exposure to opiate or other illegal substances (heroin, morphine, cannabis, cocaine, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, other&#x02026;) during the follow-up (self-reported during medical examination and/or biologically assessed); for the intervention group: number of OS-UDS performed by GP and by patient acceptability reported by the patient and by the GP (self-reported questionnaires).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Cross-link data</title><p>To ensure completeness in prescription drug records, significant medical event and death occurring during follow up, additional information on medical care will also be obtained through the database of the health insurance scheme.

In studies performed in our area, observed retention rates were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using reimbursement data from the French Health Insurance system at the regional level, we compared retention rate of patients newly treated by buprenorphine according to performing or not urinary testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this study including 1,507 subjects followed-up over 30&#x000a0;months, the retention rate in patients with urinary testing was significantly better than the reference group, with an adjusted Hazard Ratio of 0.55 (95&#x000a0;% CI: 0.38&#x02013;0.80).</p><p>Thus, considering a retention rate in the reference group of 36&#x000a0;%, and an expected retention rate of 50&#x000a0;% in the intervention group, if mean cluster size (m)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, &#x003b1; risk&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 and &#x003b2; risk&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20, the theoretical formula of Hayes and Moulton gives 100 clusters by group, i.e. 100 GPs in each group, corresponding to 200 patients in each group, i.e. 400 patients in all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Recruiting 2 patients by GPs over a period of 18&#x000a0;months seems realistic, even if these GPs are not working in an addiction specialized network. Hypothesizing that the expected retention rate will be 50&#x000a0;% in the intervention group is very conservative. Actually, with an expected retention rate of 60&#x000a0;% (as observed in our previous study) or with an expected relative risk of 0.3-0.4 in favour of the intervention group (as observed in the McCowan study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with a benefit of performing urinary testing -whatever the results- on mortality in patients treated by methadone in UK). With this retention rate, only 34 clusters should be needed, corresponding to 34 GPs in each group, 68 in the all sample, and consecutively 136 patients. This hypothesis should be probably optimistic but not completely unrealistic.</p><p>This strategy will allow to overcome the proper effect of each GP, to get enough clusters for the analysis and to regroup clusters (on the basis of the same geographic area (in French &#x0201c;Bassins de sant&#x000e9;&#x0201d;) giving a sufficient number of individuals in each cluster (5 subjects).</p><p>The Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> summarizes the design of the study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Design of the ESUB-MG pragmatic randomized controlled trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12875_2016_413_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Patients, will be analyzed according to the intervention assigned to their GPs, whether being exposed to OS-UDS during their participation or not, in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p>For patients followed up until the end of the study, the retention rate will be the percentage of patients still under OMT (complete data).

The aim is to assess the impact of a global intervention, including a better knowledge of UDS (through a specific GP&#x02019;s training to perform UDS and interpret their results), and giving the opportunity to perform OS-UDS for any patient consulting for an OMT initiation in the medical office by the GP. The better way to assess this impact with a sufficient level of evidence is to perform a randomized intervention trial in primary care context, comparing OMT retention at 6&#x000a0;months in patients cared by GPs randomly assigned to having on-site UDS, compared to patients cared by GPs randomly assigned to performing standard care.</p><p>Most of OMT patients in France are managed in the context of primary care, whereas most of OMT clinical assessments have been done in the context of specialized centers. UDS should be used in this context of primary care, but are rarely done. Commercial kits are giving the possibility to perform UDS extemporarily in the medical office. The limits of these tests in terms of sensitivity and specificity are well-known, and this project does not aim to assess the intrinsic validity of these tests, assuming that they present a sufficient quality to be licensed in France, but to assess effectiveness of performing OS-UDS in general practice for patients treated by buprenorphine.</p><p>The widespread use of UDS is already a reality for some (few) GPs working in specialized addiction networks and in centers without laboratories inside. However, outside this context, urine testing is rare and knowledge of GPs remains scarce. Demonstrating the positive impact of OS-UDS on GPs&#x02019; practice (in managing patients) and behaviors of patients treated with buprenorphine in general practice (adherence) would be an important issue in the field of opioid addiction care.</p><p>Training GPs to drug tests and supplying OS-UDS in their office should lead to an improvement of opioid-addicted patients&#x02019; care through helping decision making in the GP medical office, improving GPs&#x02019; practices, improving adherence of treated patients, and consequently, improving short and long term outcomes of OMT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>Inclusions of GPs and patients will begin from January 2016 to March 2016 according to French regions.
