On the other hand, intravenous form of dexketoprofen trometamol has been marketed recently in our country. It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and it has analgesic activity, which is started tremendous after parenteral usage.

Patients without severe renal, hepatic and cardiac disease, peptic ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding, crohn's disease or colitis ulcerosa, coagulation disorder, known allergic reaction to one of these drugs, chronic pain and routine analgesic usage, occurrence of complication during the operation were included into the study. All the patients were informed about Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device during the pre-operative visits. Patients who did not take the premedication administered thiopental (3-5 mg/kg), vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 mcg/kg) in induction. Anesthesia maintained by using 50%/50% O<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>O and sevoflurane (1-2%). During the operation, patients monitored by non-invasive blood pressure measurement, Electrocardiogram, SpO<sub>2</sub> and end tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, and also ventilated by tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and 12 respirations/min.</p><p>Patients then randomly divided into three groups as Group I (paracetamol, <italic>n</italic> = 20), Group II (dexketoprofen, <italic>n</italic> = 20) and Group III (placebo, <italic>n</italic> = 20) for post-operative analgesia administration. Randomization was performed using a sealed opaque envelope with a computer-generated block random allocation. One gr of paracetamol (Perfalgan 10 mg/ml 100 ml Flacon Bristol-Myers Squibb Labarotories, Renaudin Itxassou France) administered to Group I by intravenous infusion in 15 min during the closure, and 1 gr of intravenous paracetamol administered at every 6 h during the following 24 h. Dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/2 mL (Arveles 50 mg/2 ml Menarini International Italy) diluted in 100 mL of saline and administered in 15 min by intravenous infusion during the closure, and dose repeated at every 8 h of post-operative period. 100 ml of saline was administered by intravenous infusion in 15 min to Group III during the closure and at every 6 h of post-operative period. The researcher who knows the group of the patient prepared the test drug was blind to the evaluation of pain relief, whereas the person evaluating the analgesic effects was blind to the treatment drug. Patients then taken to recovery room and pain was assessed by VAS. If the VAS &#x02265;3, then 1 mg of morphine was administered as an additional analgesic in 10 min intervals until the VAS decreased below 3. PCA equipment (Abbott Pain Management Provider, North Chicago, USA) used for all patients PCA device was programmed as bolus dose of 1 mg morphine on demand and 10 min locked-out intervals. Intravenous morphine was used for PCA in all groups. (Morphine concentration is 0.2 mg/ml). VAS and additional analgesic consumptions of all patients were evaluated at 0<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h of post-operative period.</p><p>Mean arterial pressures (MAPs) and heart rate (HR), were evaluated at 5 min intervals during the operation and also at 0<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h in the post-operative period during the evaluation of VAS and morphine consumptions. Probable post-operative side-effects (nausea, vomiting, urine retention, gastric pain, itching, dizziness, visual impairment, sedation, and respiratory depression) and patient satisfaction were noted while monitoring the pain. Nausea, vomiting, urine retention, gastric pain, itching, dizziness, and visual impairment were assessed as 0: None, 1: Mild, 2: Moderate and 3: Severe. Sedation was assessed by Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) (1: Fully awake and oriented, 2: Drowsy, 3: Eyes closed, but rousable with command, 4: Eyes closed, but rousable with mild physical stimulation, 5: Eyes closed, not rousable with physical stimulation).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyzing</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to compare by means of differences in cumulative 24-h morphine consumption among groups.

Descriptive statistics were presented as mean&#x000b1;standard deviation or median (minimum-maximum) for continuous variables, medians (25<sup>th</sup> -75<sup>th</sup> percentiles) for ordinal variables, and case count and (%) for nominal variables. Significance of differences between groups was analyzed with one way analysis of variances for means, and with Kruskal Wallis for medians. If the results of ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis was found to be significant then <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey or nonparametric multiple comparisons were utilized for determining the distinct group. Nominal data were evaluated by Pearson's Chi-square test. Significance of differences for repeated hemodynamic and analgesic use within groups were measured with repeated measures variance analysis; changes in VAS, RSS, and Global Satisfaction Scale scores were assessed by Friedman test; significance of differences of changes of incidence of nausea and vomiting was evaluated with Cochrane's Q. If the results of repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman were found to be significant then Bonferroni adjusted multiple comparison tests or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test were used for determining the distinct follow-up times. <italic>P</italic> values lover than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

Using the analgesics at the final periods of the surgery contributes to the pain control immediately after the operation.

Although, there were no significant differences between groups for the 0<sup>th</sup> min mean VAS values, also there weren&#x02019;t any significant differences between groups for VAS scores at any follow-up times. Within groups VAS score comparisons revealed statistically significant differences for pain score reductions at 12<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h compared to baseline in control group, at 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h in dexketoprofen group, and at 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h in paracetamol group. Delbos and Boccard studied the effects of intravenous paracetemol on daily morphine use after orthopedic surgery, and found total morphine consumption significantly decreased in paracetamol group compared to placebo group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Varrassi <italic>et al</italic>. found no significant difference for the morphine consumption between two groups in their study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] It was found in many studies that intravenous paracetamol decreased total morphine consumption compared to placebo in post-operative period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It was also reported by authors that opioid consumption was decreased in dexketoprofen groups compared to placebos in their studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In our study, total consumed morphine amount decreased in 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h in dexketoprofen trometamol group, and in 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> h in paracetamol group, compared to baseline during the 24 h of follow-up period. According to these, combined use of paracetamol or dexketoprofen trometamol with morphine is thought to achieve an effective analgesia by complementary impact, and will reduce the morphine consumption.</p><p>The HR and MAP were measured since post-operative pain and analgesics may also affect the hemodynamic parameters. In our study, it was found that, there were no differences between the groups regarding to MAP, HR, and respiratory rate; the inter-group differences were observed in parallel, and decreased and eventually returned to the normal levels. These reductions in HR and MAP may be due to both the reductions in VAS and anxiety, fluid resuscitation and the adverse effects of analgesic agents. In accordance with the literature data, we found that, none of our patients&#x02019; MAP and HR values decreased more than 20%; so the difference was not significant clinically.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] We also think that, this result may be due to use of the optimum pain management.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Consort Diagram</label><caption><p>Patient randomization and disposition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-18-897-g005"/></fig><p>The main factors that are limiting the widespread use of the opioids are respiratory depression and sedation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The deaths that are seen during the opioid usage depend on respiratory depression and sedation is a valuable parameter that is used for early recognition of respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Respiratory depression rate, which is the most feared side effect, is very low in the literature data.

In their study, Hanna <italic>et al</italic>. found that there were higher sedation scores of dexketoprofen and ketoprofen compared to placebo at 2<sup>nd</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> h interestingly; however, it was explained as the observers assessed sedation and sleep wrongly due to the quality of this analgesic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In the study by Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Palaz&#x000f3;n <italic>et al</italic>., it was found that the sedation was lower in i.v paracetamol group when compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] In another study, efficacy of intravenous dexketoprofen trometamol was evaluated by adding i.v PCA tramadol for postdiscectomy pain, similar to the results of our study no significance was observed according to RSS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>There are many factors in the etiology of the post-operative nausea and vomiting such as anesthetic gases and surgical procedures.

The amount of total morphine was lower in the dexketoprofen trometamol and paracetamol groups compared with control group; however, there were no differences in the incidence of nausea and vomiting between the groups. Beside opioid usage, it was because of the higher incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in gynecological illnesses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] In addition, this situation may be related to factors increasing the susceptibility of patients with nausea and vomiting and which we did not ask before (nausea due to vehicles, history of sensitivity to the drugs, which were used before etc.). The sample size of this study was calculated for evaluating the difference in 24 h total morphine consumption between groups so for evaluating nausea and vomiting a bigger sample size may be necessary. None of our patients had urinary retention, stomach ache, dizziness, and visual impairment.</p><p>The patient satisfaction is one of the most important criteria in assessing the efficacy of the analgesic and the anxiety of the patient. Since, the moods of the individuals and threshold of sensitivity to the painful stimuli can be different, it is expected that the satisfaction about the post-operative treatments may differ in between different people. In a study by Peduto <italic>et al</italic>., it was reported that global efficiency was defined as good or excellent in 87% of patients receiving i.v paracetamol, whereas 65% of patients in the control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Varrassi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that, global efficacy was assessed as good or excellent similarly in i.v paracetamol group and ketorolac group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Tuncer <italic>et al</italic>. determined that they found similar patient satisfaction rates between the groups.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Cakan <italic>et al</italic>. found increased satisfaction scores in paracetamol management in their lumbar discectomy patients and they postulated that this may be the result of high serotonin levels caused by paracetamol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Ekmek&#x000e7;i <italic>et al</italic>. added dexketoprofen trometamol to i.v PCA tramadol for post laparoscopic pain treatment and observed increased patient satisfaction in their dexketoprofen trometamol + tramadol group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] In our study, in all follow-up times, there was only significant difference between the 0<sup>th</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> h satisfaction scores between the groups. Patient satisfaction score of the control group at 0<sup>th</sup> h was lower than both satisfaction scores of the dexketoprofen trometamol and the paracetamol groups. There was a significant difference in satisfaction scores compared to baseline scores only in the control group and satisfaction scores were increased at statistically significant level in all the follow-up time except the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> h. In dexketoprofen trometamol group, only 6/20 patients (30%) stated patient satisfaction as good, whereas 14 (70%) as excellent. This rate is the same as the paracetamol group. However 10/20 patients (50%) indicated patient satisfaction as good, 8 (40%) as excellent and 2 (10%) as moderate.</p><p>As a result, paracetamol and dexketoprofen trometamol combined with PCA morphine provides only slight advantages on certain times such as higher patient satisfaction and lower sedation scores. According to results of the present study, routine addition of dexketoprofen trometamol and Paracetamol to PCA morphine after hysterectomies is not recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank all staff of Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic and all the patients.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kehlet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The value of &#x0201c;multimodal&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;balanced analgesia&#x0201d; in postoperative pain treatment</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1993</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>1048</fpage><lpage>56</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8105724</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kehlet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Controlling acute pain-role of preemptive analgesia, peripheral treatment and balanced analgesia and effects on outcome</article-title><source>Pain 1999-An Updated Review</source><year>1999</year><publisher-loc>Seattle</publisher-loc><publisher-name>IASP Press</publisher-name><fpage>459</fpage><lpage>62</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pinzur</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Garla</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>Pluth</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Vrbos</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Continuous postoperative infusion of a regional anesthetic after an amputation of the lower extremity.
