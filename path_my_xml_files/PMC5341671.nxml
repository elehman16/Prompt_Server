The duration of this study was 1 year. Written informed consents were taken from the patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with ASA physical status I&#x02013;II, aged 18&#x02013;50 years. Patients were excluded if they had a mouth opening &#x0003c;2 cm, anticipated difficult airway, poor general health, body mass index &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, upper respiratory tract infection, increased risk of aspiration (gastroesophageal reflex disorder, hiatus hernia, and pregnancy), cervical spine fracture or instability, and history of allergy to one or more drugs and latex.

All patients were given tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally at bedtime on the previous night of surgery and were kept nil per oral for 12 h before surgery. After the patient was shifted to operation theater, standard monitors such as pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure, and 3 lead electrocardiogram were connected. Intravenous (IV) access was gained with 18-gauge cannula and Ringer's lactate infusion was started. Patient were given injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV, injection midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV, injection tramadol 1 mg/kg IV, injection ondansetron 4 mg IV, injection ranitidine 40 mg IV, and then preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Anesthesia was induced with injection propofol 2.5 mg/kg IV and injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV was used to achieve neuromuscular blockade.</p><p>Patients were ventilated and after the adequate depth of anesthesia had been achieved, each device was inserted after lubrication of posterior surface with water-based jelly. S-LMA was inserted using a smooth circular rotating movement until definite resistance was felt when the device was in the hypopharynx. This technique was used as suggested by the manufacturer.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] P-LMA was inserted using the index finger and advanced into the hypopharynx until resistance was felt.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In Group P, size 4 P-LMA was inserted which was according to the patient's weight and cuff was inflated to 30 ml as recommended by the manufacturer. For patients of Group S, S-LMA size 4 was inserted according to the weight and cuff was inflated to 45 ml.</p><p>An effective airway was confirmed by bilateral symmetrical chest movement on manual ventilation, square wave capnography, the absence of audible leak of gas, and lack of gastric insufflations. If it was not possible to insert the device or ventilate through it, two more attempts of insertion were allowed. If placement failed even after three attempts, the airway was secured through other airway device as suitable and the case was excluded from our study. After securing the device in place, a well lubricated 16 <italic>F</italic> gastric tube was introduced into the stomach through the gastric drainage port.</p><p>Patients were maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen mixture (N<sub>2</sub>O: O<sub>2</sub> 70:30) and isoflurane 1% connected to Drager Fabius machine and put on volume mode and intermittent boluses of vecuronium were administered IV. Patient also received paracetamol infusion IV 15 mg/kg intraoperatively. A single blinded assistant collected data on the number of attempts for successful LMA insertion, the time taken and the ease of LMA insertion. The oropharyngeal leak pressures (OLPs) were determined by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 L/min. The OLP was the pressure in the circuit when an audible noise was heard over the mouth. For safety concerns, the maximal allowable OLP was 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>At the end of operation, anesthetic agents were discontinued and neuromuscular block was reversed with injection glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV, injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg IV allowing smooth recovery of consciousness. The device was removed after the patient regained consciousness and breathed spontaneously and responded to the verbal command to open the eye. Blood staining of the device, trauma to the mouth, tooth or pharynx, and sore throat were noted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>The study population consisted of 100 ASA I&#x02013;II, patients posted for elective surgery under general anesthesia.

Guided insertion was always successful following failed digital insertion. The mean duration of insertion with the P-LMA was longer in comparison to S-LMA (23.67 &#x000b1; 1.83 vs. 20.58 &#x000b1; 1.73 s) which makes S-LMA effective in scenarios requiring the urgent need for ventilation hence more effective in its life-saving role in difficult airway.</p><p>The specially designed airway tube (LMA evolution curve) which has an anatomical resemblance allows for smoother and easier insertion of S-LMA and thin wedge-shaped leading edge which gives it an edge over other LMAs which conventionally require digital insertion or use of the introducer.</p><p>The difficulty in inserting the Proseal may be due to the shape of its larger, deeper, and softer bowl with the gastric drainage port forming the nonlinear leading edge. The higher success rate was also associated with a lesser insertion time with S-LMA than with P-LMA. These findings of our study have been supported by other studies.</p><p>Hosten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported the first attempt success rates of 93% with both S-LMA and P-LMA. Mean airway device insertion time was significantly shorter with S-LMA than with P-LMA (12.5 &#x000b1; 4.1 s vs. 15.6 &#x000b1; 6.0 s; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) in 60 adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><p>Seet <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] also compared the safety and efficacy of S-LMA with P-LMA. The success rate of the first attempt insertion was higher for the S-LMA than for the P-LMA (98% and 88%, respectively) in 99 nonparalyzed adult patients which confirm our data.</p><p>OLP measurements are commonly performed with LMA to assess the degree of airway protection, its feasibility for using them for positive pressure ventilation, and for confirmation of successful supraglottic airway placement.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Inadequate placement will increase the leak and the purpose of using LMA as an effective ventilatory device will not be fulfilled.</p><p>In our study, the mean OLP was significantly higher in the P-LMA in comparison to S-LMA (24.04 vs. 20.05 cm of H<sub>2</sub>O) suggesting that the P-LMA is a more effective ventilatory device as OLP is considered as a marker of efficacy and safety while using LMA devices.</p><p>Our data are consistent with three randomized trials comparing the two devices. A study by Eschertzhuber <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed that the OLP was lower in the Group S by 4&#x02013;8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O than in the Group <italic>P</italic> in a crossover trial in 93 female patients undergoing surgery with a size 4 S-LMA. Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported a similar difference between the two devices (31.7 vs. 27.9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) in a study on 70 female patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological procedures. Seet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found mean OLP with the S-LMA was 21 &#x000b1; 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (95% confidence interval 20&#x02013;22). This was significantly lower than that of the P-LMA, 25 &#x000b1; 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (95% confidence interval 23&#x02013;27; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The lower OLP for the S-LMA is probably related to the less elastic and less moldable property of the polyvinyl chloride single cuff. The Proseal has a double-cuff design and is made of silicone rubber with higher elasticity and is more ideal for molding. This may result in a better glottic seal. In addition, the lower OLP with the Supreme may be due to movement of the semirigid curved airway tube.</p><p>Raised intracuff pressures in LMA are associated with increased incidence of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity such as sore throat. In this study, the intracuff pressures were significantly higher in P-LMA in comparison to S-LMA at all cuff volumes of inflation range which is supported by other studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Intracuff pressure should be kept according to the manufacturer's instruction. In P-LMA, other studies indicate that intracuff pressure increases progressively during the surgery in which nitrous oxide is used with oxygen which might increase the pharyngolaryngeal morbidity.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] S-LMA is devoid of this effect which makes it hassle free to use in such cases and gives it an another edge over P-LMA.</p><p>Gastric drain insertion was accomplished in 100% patients in both the groups and was successful in the first attempt in 88% in P-LMA group in comparison to 96% in S-LMA group the results of which are similar to those found by a study by Hosten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] where the first attempt success rates for the drainage tube insertion were 93% for P-LMA and 100% for S-LMA 100%. If the gastric tube is easily passed, it indirectly confirms correct placement of the supraglottic device.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Incorporation of gastric drainage port has led to the use of such devices easily as aspiration of gastric contents will reduce the intragastric volume considerably and ultimately reducing the risk of aspiration.</p><p>P-LMA is a reusable version which can be safely used up to 40 times after properly autoclaving it. Improper sterilization may predispose the patient to iatrogenic infections. In such scenarios, S-LMA has the advantage of being a single use device. There is an increased tendency toward using single-use devices due to the awareness that protein and bacteria persist on surgical and anesthetic instruments following the decontamination and sterilization process. The S-LMA can reduce or even eliminate the fear that patients may contract iatrogenic infections such as variant Creutzfeldt&#x02013;Jakob disease, HIV and hepatitis B or C[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] which makes it a perfect option in this regard.</p><p>S-LMA can provide acceptable if not as high glottic seal as that provided by P-LMA but features of anatomically shaped airway tube and inclusion of gastric drain makes it an acceptable alternative for ventilation. Being made of polyvinyl chloride, it also eliminates the chances of increasing cuff pressure in the presence of nitrous use. Faster insertion time along with more ease in introduction makes it a favorable device for use. In this era, advances for providing adequate ventilation while minimizing the adverse outcomes of conventional intubation have led us to use this family of supraglottic airway devices frequently.</p><p>Both these devices provide greater patient's as well as anesthesiologist's satisfaction thereby leading to their incorporation in our routine practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Both the devices P-LMA and S-LMA can act as ventilatory devices but where P-LMA provides a more effective glottic seal, S-LMA provides acceptable glottic seal with easier and faster insertion and being a single use device, reduces the chances of transmission of infections, and, therefore, can be considered as a better alternative to P-LMA.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thankful to the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Silchar Medical College and the patients enrolled in the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rushman</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cashman</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Rushman</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cashman</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intubation and ventilation</article-title><source>Lee's Synopsis of Anaesthesia</source><year>1999</year><publisher-loc>Great Britain</publisher-loc><publisher-name>MPG</publisher-name><fpage>246</fpage><lpage>53</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Eriksson</surname><given-names>LI</given-names></name><name><surname>Fleisher</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiener-Kronish</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name></person-group><source>Miller's Anesthesia</source><year>2015</year><edition>8th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Churchill Livingstone Elsevier</publisher-name><fpage>1661</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protection from aspiration with the LMA-ProSeal after vomiting: A case report</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>2003</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>78</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12514156</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brain</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Verghese</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Strube</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The LMA &#x02018;ProSeal&#x02019;
