In spite of the various precautions taken, the postoperative period following surgical removal of third molar is frequently associated with pain, swelling and temporary restriction of mouth opening along with decreased masticatory capability. One of the factors most closely linked to the intensity of postoperative pain and swelling is the type of healing of the surgical wound.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>There is a certain amount of controversy regarding the type of healing based on whether it is of the primary or secondary type. Conflicting opinions have been expressed in the literature concerning these two types of healing. Some authors are in favor of closed healing, whereas other authors report that primary healing frequently causes greater pain and swelling than secondary healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Other authors are of the opinion that postoperative progress does not differ in the two types of healing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>This comparative study compares primary and secondary healing after surgical removal of impacted third molars, evaluating the incidence of postoperative complications, and monitoring the extent of swelling and the severity of pain.</p><p>Also, this study compares the primary and secondary healing following surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars by monitoring the extent of postoperative swelling and severity of pain.</p><p>Following criteria will be evaluated after post-surgical period:</p><p>
