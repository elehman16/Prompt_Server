Despite intense research efforts in the past five decades to elucidate the underlying etiology of prostatic growth in older men, the cause-and-effect relationships have not been established.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Lower urinary tract symptoms can be characterized as abnormal voiding sensations that occur with a frequency or severity that affects the quality of life. Common LUTS include urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, intermittency, incomplete emptying, and a weak stream. Nocturia is the most prevalent symptom and it has been noted in one-half to two-thirds of the men studied. Other bothersome symptoms include dysuria, terminal dribbling, urinary incontinence, and genital pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The development of effective therapies such as alpha-adrenergic blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, and the possibility of their combined use, represent the most significant advance in the treatment of BPH.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Currently available &#x003b1;-blockers have similar effects on BPH, improving symptoms by approximately 35% and the maximum urinary flow rate by 1.8 to 2.5 mL/s.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] For the treatment of BPH/LUTS in the United States today, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, and tamsulosin are the most prescribed &#x003b1;1AR antagonists. Terazosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin are non-subtype selective, in that, they block all three &#x003b1;1AR subtypes. In contrast, tamsulosin blocks &#x003b1;1a = &#x003b1;1dARs with 10-fold greater affnity than &#x003b1;1bARs, and is therefore considered to be &#x003b1;1AR subtype selective.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Naftopidil, with three times greater affinity for &#x003b1;1D than for the &#x003b1;1A-AR subtype, is an &#x003b1;1-blocker that has been approved for clinical use, for LUTS/BPH, only in Japan, since 1999.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Different from tamsulosin and silodosin, which have a higher and extremely higher affinity for the &#x003b1;1A-AR subtype than for the &#x003b1;1D-AR subtype, respectively, naftopidil has distinct characteristics, because it has a three-fold affinity for the &#x003b1;1D-AR subtype than for the &#x003b1;1A-AR subtype. As the tissue of BPH shows nine- and three-fold increased expression of mRNA in the &#x003b1;1A and &#x003b1;1D-AR subtypes, respectively, compared to normal prostatic tissue, it has been speculated that not only &#x003b1;1A, but also &#x003b1;1D-AR, contribute to the contraction of the prostatic smooth muscle.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The reports by Momose <italic>et al.</italic> and Masumori <italic>et al.</italic> have given results that tamsulosin is superior to naftopidil in the treatment of LUTS due to BPH, which are contrary to a majority of the studies published. The previous studies have concluded that naftopidil is as effective as tamsulosin. Hence, this study has been conducted to document the role of naftopidil in the treatment of LUTS due to BPH and compare its effect with tamsulosin, in the Indian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 120 symptomatic patients of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, attending the Outpatient Department of Surgery and Urology of Pt BDS PGIMS Rohtak, in collaboration with the Radiology Department after taking written and informed consent.</p><p>The patients were selected on the following inclusion criteria: Age more than 45 years, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia for a duration of at least six months of storage symptoms (increased day time frequency, urgency and nocturia, and/or voiding symptoms (difficulty in initating micturation, feeling of incomplete voiding, impaired quality of the stream or interruption of stream), day time frequency &#x0003e;8 times or nocturnal frequency &#x0003e;2, maximum flow rate between 5 and 15 ml/second, with a voided volume of at least 150 ml, post void residual urine less than 150 ml by abdominal ultrasound, international prostate symptom score &#x0003e;13 points, and international prostate symptom bother score &#x0003e;3 points.</p><p>The patients were excluded if they had satisfied any one of the following exclusion criteria: Previous prostate surgery, severe visceral disease, postural hypotension, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, suspected prostate cancer, urethral stricture disease, history of pelvic irradiation, bladder neck disease, acute bacterial prostatitis, acute urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, history of concomitant medication that could alter the voiding pattern before inclusion (calcium antagonist monoamine oxidase inhibitors or anti cholinergic drugs), active hematuria, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &#x0003e;2.0 mg/dl), severe hepatic impairment (transamimases &#x0003e;2 times the upper normal limit and/or total bilirubin &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dl), patients on antipsychotic medications, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, history of severe heart disease (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the previous six months), and ascertained or suspected hypersensitivity to tamsulosin or naftopidil.</p><p>The patients were divided into two groups by a computer-generated, simple, randomized analysis.</p><p>Group 1 (tamsulosin group): Sixty patients would be administered 0.4 mg tamsulosin once daily for three months</p><p>Group 2 (naftopidil group): Sixty patients would be administered 75 mg naftopidil once daily for three months.</p><p>The IPSS self-evaluating questionnaire was filled for each one of the eligible patients. Patients in both the groups would be evaluated at the beginning of the study and then at one- and three-month intervals by means of ultrasonography, uroflowmetry, and the international prostate symptom score and quality of life index questionnaire.</p><p>The IPSS and international QOL score was calculated to assess the subjective patient response to LUTS after the start of treatment, to compare it with the uroflowmetry findings. The IPSS score contained seven symptom questions, which included, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia, each referring to the last month, and each involving the assignment of a score from 1 to 5, for a total of a maximum of 35 points. A score of 0-7 was considered mildly symptomatic, 8-19 moderately symptomatic, and 20 to 35 severely symptomatic.</p><p>The quality of life index consists of scoring the patients on their response to the question, &#x0201c;How would you feel if you had to live with your urinary condition the way it is now, no better, no worse, for the rest of your life?&#x0201d; on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 being most delighted and 5 being dreadful.</p><p>We performed our uroflowmetry on Laborie Urocap III uroflowmeter with Bluetooth technology.</p><p>The patients included in the study as well as the doctor conducting the study were blinded to the drug being administered and the group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>OBSERVATIONS</title><p>A total of 120 patients were divided randomly into Group 1 (tamsulosin) and Group 2 (naftopidil) of 60 patients each, and were followed up for three months with no dropouts during the duration of the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Prostate size and post-void residual volume on ultrasonography</title><p>The prostate size was assessed by ultrasonography at inclusion and follow up, at one and three months.

On the other hand, &#x003b1;1-blockers improve BOO through a decrease in tone of the prostatic smooth muscle. Several &#x003b1;1-blockers are clinically available, including those having nonspecific affinity for &#x003b1;1-AR subtypes (prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin) and those having specific affinity for them (tamsulosin, naftopidil, silodosin).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Eight randomized studies of naftopidil compared with other &#x003b1;1-blockers (tamsulosin in six, tamsulosin and silodosin in one, and phytotherapy in another) in contemporary English literature [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], using IPSS and uroflowmetry for evaluation of LUTS, after 2003, are shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, which consists of various inclusion criteria, study designs, treatment durations, and sample size.
