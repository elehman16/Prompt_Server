stability group and a lumbar instability group, and to evaluate the effectiveness of hip
exercises for low-back pain patients with lumbar instability. [Subjects] Seventy-eight
patients with chronic low-back pain were the subjects. [Methods] The patients were divided
into two groups: a lumbar stability group (n=45) and a lumbar instability group (n=33).
They were assessed using the Korean version of the Oswestry Disability Index (KODI) to
determine the level of disability of the patients with low-back pain. A 100&#x02005;mm visual
analog scale (VAS) was used to assess low-back pain. [Results] The limitation of hip range
of motion of the lumbar instability group was significantly greater than that of the
lumbar stability group. Comparisons among four groups at three weeks and six weeks after
the start of hip exercises revealed that the VAS score of each group had significantly
decreased. Comparisons among four groups at three weeks and at six weeks after the start
of hip exercises revealed that the KODI score of each group had significantly decreased.
[Conclusion] These findings suggest that the performance of hip exercises by chronic
low-back pain patients with lumbar instability is more effective than conventional therapy
at reducing low-back pain and levels of disability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chronic low-back pain</kwd><kwd>Hip exercise</kwd><kwd>Lumbar instability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many researchers have reported that lumbar postures resulting from abnormal kinematic
habits are related to low-back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hypofunction in relation to lumbar
segmental movements is divided into spasticity and instability of the lumbar segments<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Spinal instability is defined as an abnormal response to applied loads and is characterized
by movement of spinal segments beyond their normal limits<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> Lumbar segment hypofunction is related to low-back pain, and
radiological findings have shown that lumbar instability is found in 23&#x02013;69% of chronic
low-back pain patients during flexion and extension movements<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the evaluation of
lumbar segment instability, Kasai et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
and Hicks et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> have presented the
passive lumbar extension test and the prone instability (PI) test, respectively, as valid
evaluation tools. In addition, lumbar segment hypofunction causes hip joint hypofunction,
and lumbar segment instability leads to spasticity or weakening of the muscles surrounding
the hip joint. Sahrmann<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that,
because of the characteristics of the hip joint, which is anatomically adjacent to the
lumbopelvic region, the hip joint&#x02019;s functions are closely related to low back pain. McGregor
et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that, to compensate for
the weakening of the abdomen and the back, low-back pain patients adopt rounded-back
postures with flexion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, and that lesions in the
lumbopelvic region cause the weakening and tension of the muscles surrounding the hip joint.
Van Dillen et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
limitation of hip range of motion of low-back pain patients was significantly different from
that of healthy persons. When presenting a theory that low-back pain patients&#x02019; trunk flexion
causes excessive movement of the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane due to the limitation of
hip joint internal rotation, McConnell<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported a tendency toward internal rotation of the hip joint due to the gluteus medius
muscle&#x02019;s hypofunction and iliotibial tract&#x02019;s shortening. Neumann et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that hypofunction of the gluteus medius muscle
would cause lumbopelvic region instability.</p><p>A recent study investigated correlations between low-back pain intensity and the limitation
of hip joint function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
assessment of the hip joint in relation to low-back pain has been perceived as playing an
important role in selecting the direction of treatment. However, studies conducted in Korea
have yet to clearly identify lumbar segment hypofunction related to chronic low-back pain,
and no study has investigated hip joint hypofunction in relation to the pattern of
hypofunction or compared changes in the intensity of low-back pain after interventions for
hip joint muscles.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate chronic low-back pain patients&#x02019; hip
joint hypofunction in relation to patterns of lumbar segment hypofunction and to examine the
effects of exercises that enhance hip joint function on the decrease of low back pain and
disability levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The inclusion criteria for this study was experience of low-back pain for at least three
months. Participants were excluded if they had undergone an orthopedic or neurosurgical
operation, if they were being treated due to other neurologic problems, if they had acute
inflammation or tumors, or if they were pregnant. Among the applicants, 78 were enrolled in
this study based on the selection criteria. This study was approved by D Hospital, and all
the participants provided their written informed consent.</p><p>The 78 selected subjects were divided into a lumbar stability group (n=45) and a lumbar
instability group (n=33) based on questionnaire and lumbar instability test results. Among
the 45 subjects in the lumbar stability group, 25 were randomly assigned to a hip-joint
exercise subgroup (Experimental Group I), and 20 were randomly assigned to Control Group I.
Among the 33 subjects in the lumbar instability group, 22 were randomly assigned to a
hip-joint exercise group (Experimental Group II), and 11 were assigned to Control Group II.
An evaluation before the intervention determined the low-back pain intensity, low-back pain
related disability indexes, and the hip range of motion of the patients. Experimental Group
I group and Experimental Group II performed hip-joint exercises along with lumbar
stabilization exercises. Control Group I and Control Group II only performed lumbar
stabilization exercises. The intervention was conducted for a total of six weeks and
low-back pain intensity and low-back pain related disability indexes were repeatedly
evaluated at three weeks and six weeks after the start of the intervention. During the
experimental period, two participants in Experimental Group I, four in Control Group I, one
in Experimental Group II, and two in Control Group II dropped out due to time constraints.
Therefore, only the data of the 69 subjects who completed the experiment was analyzed.</p><p>Lumbar instability was evaluated as at least one positive finding in three tests: passive
accessory inter-vertebral motion (PAIVM), passive lumbar extension (PLE), and PI. The VAS
was used to examine the intensity of low-back pain of the subjects, and the KODI
questionnaire was used to examine the level of functional disability due to low-back pain of
the study subjects.</p><p>For the lumbar stabilization exercises, the study subjects performed four closed-chain
exercises that are effective for lumbar stabilization. The exercises were selected from the
sling exercises for lumbar stabilization presented by Unsgaard-Tondel et al<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects maintained 10 seconds of
contraction in of each exercise, before returning to the initial position and resting for
three seconds. They repeated each exercise four times per set for four sets, with 30 second
rest periods between each set. As subjects&#x02019; ability to perform the exercises improved, the
region of suspension was moved distally to increase the load.</p><p>To increase hip range of motion, Experimental Group I and Experimental Group II actively
performed open-chain hip joint exercises using slings, and each exercise was performed for
five minutes. There is a functional relation between the hip and lumbar spine in the
lumbopelvic region. The subjects performed the exercises for a total of 20 minutes, three
times a week.</p><p>Experimental Group I and Experimental Group II also performed active resistance exercises
for the hip joint using elastic bands (Theraband, USA). The band colors were selected based
on subjects&#x02019; ability. For hip joint flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, the
subjects were instructed to fix the band on the ankle in the standing position, the starting
position and to perform active exercises throughout the entire range of motion for each
task. For internal rotation and external rotation, the subjects were instructed to fix the
band on the ankle in an upright sitting position on a fixed chair, the start position, and
to perform active exercises throughout the entire range of motion for each task. When their
abilities to perform the exercises had improved, the subjects were instructed to sit on a
Swiss ball for the starting position. The lengths of the bands were set so that 75% of the
maximum resistance exercise could be maintained. Each task was repeated ten times at 75% of
maximal muscle strength. Each of the six exercises was repeated 10 times. The subjects were
instructed to perform three sets of exercises per motor unit and to take a rest for one
minute between each set. The study subjects performed the exercises three times per week and
the intervention was conducted for six weeks.</p><p>One-way ANOVA was conducted to examine whether there were differences in low-back pain
intensity and low-back pain related disability indexes among the four groups. One-way
repeated ANOVA was also conducted to examine differences in the degree of changes between
the measurement time points among the four groups. The Bonferroni test was conducted as
post-hoc tests. The measured data were statistically processed using SPSS WIN ver. 18.0 and
a significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the 69 subjects who completed the intervention are shown in

to the ratios of lumbar instability (23&#x02013;69%) reported by previous studies which used
radiological images to assess chronic low-back pain patients&#x02019; flexion-extension. In the
present study, the evaluation of the subjects&#x02019; hip range of motion before the intervention
revealed that it was less than that of healthy Koreans reported by a previous study<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although Melin<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that limitation of the hip range of motion would
increase along with the low-back pain, and that significant limitation of hip-joint flexion,
extension, and internal rotation, as well as decreases in the flexibility of the hamstring
muscle were observed in males, and in the present study, the levels of limitation were found
to be significantly high in hip-joint extension and internal rotation. In addition in the
comparison of the two groups, the lumbar instability group showed higher levels of
limitation than the lumbar stability group (p&#x0003c;0.01), which indicates that higher levels
of lumbar instability are related to higher levels of limitation of hip range of motion.</p><p>Nadler et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that low-back
pain patients showed imbalances in their hip-joint muscles and that the strength of the
hip-joint extensor muscles was increased by lumbar strengthening exercises. Limke et
al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> implemented resistance exercises
in spinal rehabilitation exercises for patients with chronic low-back pain and melosalgia,
and reported decreases in low-back pain intensity and disability levels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that lumbar stabilization exercises performed by chronic
low-back pain patients are effective at reducing low-back pain intensity and low-back pain
related disability indexes, and this study also found significant decreases in low-back pain
intensity and disability indexes (p&#x0003c;0.01) in each of the four subgroups, confirming that
lumbar stabilization exercises are helpful for the treatment of low-back pain. In the
comparison of average differences in the decreases in low-back pain among the measurement
time points between the experimental subgroups for which hip joint exercises were added as
an intervention, and the control subgroups, the experimental subgroups showed significantly
larger decreases than the control subgroups (p&#x0003c;0.01). The lumbar instability experimental
group, that had higher levels of limitation of the hip range of motion, showed larger
decreases than the lumbar stability group (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>The control groups allowed comparison of the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises. The
lumbar instability group showed larger decreases in low-back pain intensity after lumbar
stabilization exercises than the lumbar stability group.</p><p>When the hip range of motion was evaluated six weeks after the beginning of the
intervention, each of the four groups showed increases in the range of motion, with the
experimental subgroup of the lumbar instability group showing the largest increase. The
differences in the range of motion among the four subgroups were not statistically
significant.</p><p>In conclusion chronic low-back pain patients have limitations in the range of motion of
their hips compared to healthy persons, and the patients with lumbar instability showed
greater limitation than the patients with lumbar stability (p&#x0003c;0.01). When patients with
lumbar instability and high levels of limitations of the hip range of motion, performed hip
joint exercises including lumbar stabilization exercises, their low-back pain and disability
indexes significantly decreased compared to the lumbar stability exercise and the control
subgroups (p&#x0003c;0.01). In conclusion, the evaluation and therapeutic intervention for the
hip joint should be considered a major element for chronic low-back pain patients with
lumbar instability; therefore, further research should be conducted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kasai</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Current trends in exersie management for chronic lowback
