The most commonly used SDD regimen consists of a non-absorbable antimicrobial mouth paste and gastroenteral suspension containing colistin, tobramycin and amphotericin. In addition, systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered during the first four days in the intensive care unit (ICU). SOD consists of the mouth paste only. Both strategies have been associated with lower mortality, shortened length of stay in hospital and ICU, and less ICU-acquired infections such as bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Routine use of SDD and SOD has remained controversial, mainly because of the fear that (long-term) use will increase antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis failed to demonstrate such an association, but also concluded that more evidence is needed regarding the long-term effects of SDD/SOD on ICU ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We, therefore, measured the prevalence of colistin and tobramycin resistance in five ICUs that have continuously been using SDD or SOD for 6&#x000a0;years or longer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The effects of SOD and SDD were evaluated in a cluster-randomised cross-over study between 2004 and 2006 (study I). Each of 13 participating ICUs used SDD, SOD and standard care (no SDD/SOD), as unit-wide measures for 6&#x000a0;months, with the order of the three periods randomised per ICU. Methodological details and results of the study have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A second cluster-randomised cross-over study (study II) evaluated the effects of SOD and SDD (without standard care period) when applied as unit-wide interventions during 12&#x000a0;months in 16 Dutch ICUs between 2009 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Five ICUs participated in both studies, and continued to use SDD as standard care in the interval between studies (2006 to 2009). These ICUs were contacted to verify that no changes in infection control strategies had taken place for the duration of both studies. For both studies, the need for informed consent was waived by the institutional review board. (See Acknowledgements for full details)</p><p>During both studies, monthly point prevalence surveys were performed, in which rectal swabs and throat swabs or endotracheal aspirates (respiratory samples) were obtained from all patients present in the ICU on the day of the survey. This included patients who did not receive SDD or SOD at the time of the point prevalence survey. Where possible endotracheal aspirates were obtained, with throat swabs regarded as the best option in non-intubated patients.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microbiology methods</title><p>Samples were plated on selective agar, including media containing polymyxin and tobramycin in local microbiology laboratories. Screening for colistin resistance was done using plates containing polymyxin B (5&#x000a0;mg/l) in study period I and polymyxin E (4&#x000a0;mg/l) in study period II. Cultures were analysed semi-quantitatively for growth of gram-negative bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for colistin and tobramycin were determined using automated testing. EUCAST cutoff values were used to determine antibiotic resistance to colistin and tobramycin. Bacteria with susceptibility reported as intermediate (I) or resistant (R) were considered resistant. Species with intrinsic resistance to colistin, such as <italic>Morganella</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter</italic> and <italic>Serratia</italic> spp. were excluded from the analysis for colistin resistance.

Patients could participate in multiple sequential surveys during one intervention period. The prevalence of antibiotic resistance is given as percentage with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Relative risks (RR) and 95% CI were calculated to compare the prevalence of resistance between the two study periods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The average duration of SDD/SOD use per ICU was 7.05&#x000a0;years (range 6.8 to 7.5&#x000a0;years), excluding the 6-month standard care period of study period I.

Moreover, resistance to tobramycin among gram-negative bacteria was lower after several years of SDD and SOD.</p><p>These findings provide further evidence on the ecological effects of SDD and SOD in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, which was previously documented during short-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The current results support previous findings obtained from two longitudinal studies in Germany and Spain using clinical culture results and surveillance cultures, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a French retrospective study, spanning 6&#x000a0;years, carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria based on clinical culture results was compared for individual patients receiving or not receiving SDD, yielding no changes in resistance among gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 17 Dutch ICUs that continuously used SDD or SOD during 4&#x000a0;years of follow-up, there was no increase in resistance against colistin and tobramycin among gram-negative bacteria, while resistance against third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin decreased during the follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The current results are based on point prevalence samples obtained from all patients present in the ICU on a predefined moment, also including patients not directly exposed to SDD or SOD, thus reflecting the ICU ecology. If SDD or SOD would directly cause antibiotic resistance in exposed patients, inclusion of non-exposed patients would dilute this effect, creating a bias towards null. However, in a previous analysis of patients receiving SDD or SOD during study period I antibiotic resistance was lower than during standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Results of the second cluster-randomised cross-over study, performed in 16 ICUs yielded a 7% and 4% monthly increase in the prevalence of aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacteria in rectal samples during 12&#x000a0;months of SDD and 12&#x000a0;months of SOD, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, SDD was associated with an increase in aminoglycoside resistance genes in the non-culturable intestinal flora in some patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These findings are in contrast with the current findings, which might be related to differences in the duration of follow-up (7&#x000a0;years versus 24&#x000a0;months), study population (five ICUs versus 16 ICUs), and detection methods (conventional microbiology versus metagenomics approaches). Careful monitoring of aminoglycoside resistance should, therefore, be performed during SDD or SOD.</p><p>Clonal spread of colistin-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> has been described after introduction of SDD during an outbreak that could not be controlled with classical infection control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].
