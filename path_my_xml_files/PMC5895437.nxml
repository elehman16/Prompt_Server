Several studies have indicated that appropriate pain treatment protocols reduce postoperative morbidity, improve the results of the surgery, and decrease hospital costs.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>A likely, common mechanism for many adverse outcomes in patients with spinal fusion surgery is the systemic inflammatory response to surgical tissue injury.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> In addition, the activation of glial cells in the surgical wound stimulates the production of cytokines in the central nervous system, which can induce peripheral, and central sensitization through generation of nitric oxide, free radicals, and excitatory amino acids, possibly also causing chronic, and neuropathic pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The role of inflammatory cytokines is also well recognized in the process of secondary hyperalgesia, and central sensitization.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>Obtaining adequate analgesia after major surgery is a problematic issue, and postoperative pain still imposes a major burden of suffering on surgical patients. Intravenous (IV) patient-controlled opioids the mainstay modality in acute surgical pain treatment, expose the patients to potentially serious side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Lidocaine which developed in the year 1948 is the first amino amide-type short-acting local anesthetic (LA). Originally, it was used mainly via the IV route as an antiarrhythmic drug. Lidocaine has a very short half-life, and a favorable safety profile, and is therefore the LA of choice for continuous IV administration.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>The perioperative administration of systemic IV lidocaine has been shown to be an effective method in postoperative pain management with a favorable effect on pain scores, opioid consumption (opioid-sparing effects), and recovery after surgery without any clear evidence of harm.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Lidocaine has analgesic, and anti-inflammatory effects that are induced by reduction of cytokines production through inhibition of neutrophil activation, and the analgesia may persist even after plasma concentration reduction.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Lidocaine IV administration produces an analgesic effect in various pain states, such acute postoperative pain, and neuropathic pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Lidocaine infusion has been shown to be successful in controlling pain, whereas other agents have failed. The opioid sparing properties of IV lidocaine infusion added to its analgesic, and anti-hyperalgesic properties make lidocaine infusion a viable option for pain control in chronic opioid users.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><sec><label>1.1</label><title>Aim of the work</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the postoperative Visual Analog Score (VAS) for 3 months, following intraoperative use of lidocaine IV infusion, during adult spinal fusion surgery.

In both the groups, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air mixture at sufficient concentration to maintain systolic blood pressure within the limit of 20% baseline value.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) 1gm was given by IV infusion to all patients before extubation. Reversal of residual muscle relaxant was accomplished using neostigmine, and atropine at the end of the operation.

The authors found that 1&#x0200a;mg/kg, or 5&#x0200a;mg/kg of IV lidocaine, and placebo improved pain in patients with neuropathic pain attributable to FBSS, but the 5&#x0200a;mg/kg dose was significantly, more effective in some pain items (sharp, dull, and deep pain).<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Administration of IV bolus injection of 1.0&#x0200a;mg/kg lidocaine immediately, before induction of anesthesia, then a continuous infusion at a rate of 2&#x0200a;mg/kg/h had a significant postoperative analgesic effect in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest the role of lidocaine infusion as adjuncts to general anesthesia, it significantly, decreased long term postoperative back pain intensity, and delayed, and reduced the need for rescue analgesics, in patients that undergoing spinal fusion surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Limitations</title><p>Small sample size is a limitation of this study which may affect our results however this sample size was similar to other study (10), another limitation is serum level of lidocaine which was not measured in this study however the loading, and maintenance dose in the present study was similar to those in previous studies (28&#x02013;31) with no detectable side effects.</p></sec><sec><label>7</label><title>Recommendations</title><p>The authors recommend further studies to be performed on a larger sample size, and different doses may be used to detect an optimal lidocaine dose. The study recommends the intraoperative use of lidocaine IV infusion as an alternative mode of analgesia following spine surgery due to its long-term analgesic effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> A.
