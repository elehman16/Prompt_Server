In such settings, findings from a Cochrane systematic review suggest that the copper intrauterine device (IUD) is probably more effective than DMPA at preventing pregnancy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, there remains a lack of robust evidence on non-contraceptive benefits, side effects and HIV risk of different LARC methods that is necessary to inform family planning health policies, contraceptive counselling and the individual woman&#x02019;s contraceptive choice.</p><p>Contraception is a complex intervention involving medical, physiological, psychological, behavioural and personal components to which both desirable and undesirable non-contraceptive effects have been attributed. LARCs include various non-hormonal (IUDs) and hormonal options (injections, implants, hormonal IUDs (eg, Mirena)), which quite plausibly have different side effects. Side effects attributed by women to their contraception method often lead to contraception discontinuation, which is a common cause of unintended pregnancy. Therefore, providing women with accurate information about side effects of different contraception methods, and making a variety of methods available, could improve method adherence and effectiveness.</p><p>Limited evidence from two small randomised trials conducted among postnatal women in South Africa suggests that both postnatal depression and sexual dysfunction may be side effects of injectable progestogen use when administered soon after pregnancy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> These studies conducted by our South African research unit include a randomised double-blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT) of injectable norethisterone (NET-EN) versus placebo<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and a single-blind randomised trial of DMPA versus the IUD.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Dysmenorrhea and heavy periods were reported more frequently among women in the IUD arm of the latter study; however, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Another randomised trial conducted in our unit among women who had recently undergone termination of pregnancy found that more women in the injectable progestogen group had reduced libido and were more likely to use condoms than women in the IUD arm.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Reduced menstrual flow and amenorrhoea were effects seen more commonly in the injectable progestogen arms of the progestogen versus IUD studies,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> whereas substantially more &#x02018;troublesome bleeding&#x02019; occurred in the progestogen arm of the NET-EN versus placebo study in postnatal women.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>These and other non-contraceptive effects could influence HIV acquisition and disease progression among HIV-prevalent populations. While immune suppression and hypo-oestrogenic effects are thought to contribute to an increased risk of HIV acquisition among women using DMPA, it has been countered that this injectable method could also have protective effects for HIV acquisition due to associated amenorrhoea.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Reduced libido with injectable progestogens shown in two previous RCTs<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> might also mitigate the potential to increase HIV acquisition risk. Thus, the summary effect of psychological, behavioural and physiological mechanisms associated with effects of DMPA (and other LARCs) on HIV acquisition cannot be predicted without further research on non-contraceptive effects.</p><p>The large, multicentre &#x02018;Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">i</xref> Trial&#x02019; led by an FHI360/WHO consortium comparing HIV incidence and pregnancy rates of three different LARCs (IUD, DMPA, levonorgestrel (LNG) implant) provides a unique opportunity to also compare the effects of these LARCs on mood, sexual function and menstruation within the context of a stringent RCT protocol.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Objectives</title><p>This study aims to compare the effects of three LARCs (IUD, DMPA and LNG implant) on mood, sexual function, condom use and menstruation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design and participants</title><p>This study is a randomised trial that will be conducted at the Effective Care Research Unit (ECRU) in East London, South Africa.

At the 3&#x02009;month follow-up visit for the ECHO study, women who consent to participate in the ancillary study will be enrolled and interviewed by ancillary study researchers, which will administer a questionnaire. Depression and sexual dysfunction will be evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Arizona sexual experiences scale (ASEX), respectively.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> The BDI-II has been used in the same cultural context, translated into the local language (IsiXhosa) and previously validated in our study population.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 10</xref> We have used the ASEX scale in a previous study in our population and found it to be a useful tool,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> although to our knowledge it has not been formally validated. In addition to assessment with these instruments, participating women will be asked to prospectively complete a 28-day daily diary at home of symptoms and behaviour, commencing on the day of their enrolment visit.

As randomisation is designed for the main ECHO trial and not the ancillary study, we plan to recruit an additional 10% to accommodate potential differences in group size due to block randomisation and in the event that a small proportion of women in the main trial decline participation in the ancillary study. Therefore, we will require a total sample size of 522 women (approximately 174 in each arm).
