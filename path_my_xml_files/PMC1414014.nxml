This reduction was related to reduced atelectasis and increased aeration. We hypothesized that spontaneous breathing will result in better ventilation and aeration of dependent lung areas and in less cyclic collapse during the tidal breath.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomized controlled experimental trial, 22 pigs with oleic-acid-induced lung injury were randomly assigned to receive APRV with or without spontaneous breathing at comparable airway pressures. Four hours after randomization, dynamic computed tomography scans of the lung were obtained in an apical slice and in a juxtadiaphragmatic transverse slice. Analyses of regional attenuation were performed separately in nondependent and dependent halves of the lungs on end-expiratory scans and end-inspiratory scans. Tidal changes were assessed as differences between inspiration and expiration of the mechanical breaths.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Whereas no differences were observed in the apical slices, spontaneous breathing resulted in improved tidal ventilation of dependent lung regions (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) and less cyclic collapse (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) in the juxtadiaphragmatic slices.

Studies in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) suggest that spontaneous breathing with APRV not only reduces the need for sedation to adapt the patient to the ventilator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but also improves both systemic blood flow and arterial blood oxygenation when compared with controlled mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mechanisms for improved oxygenation with spontaneous breathing during APRV include a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and improved ventilation-perfusion matching, as demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a recent computed tomography (CT) study in pigs with oleic-acid-induced lung injury, we observed recruitment of the atelectatic lung and an increased end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) by spontaneous breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This should reasonably contribute to reduce shunting.</p><p>Ventilation at lower EELV and/or low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the absence of spontaneous breathing may also cause cyclic opening of lung units during inspiration (tidal recruitment) and closing of lung units during expiration. Cyclic opening and closing of lung regions causes shear stress that may contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Controlled mechanical ventilation in the supine position causes larger tidal excursions of the diaphragm in its upper, anterior part than in its dorsal segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This is due to higher abdominal pressure in the dependent regions that limits diaphragmatic movement more there than in nondependent regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, posterior muscular sections of the diaphragm move more than the anterior tendon plate during spontaneous breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mechanical ventilation is consequently distributed preferentially to the anterior regions while dependent regions are favored during spontaneous breathing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Based on these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we hypothesized that spontaneous breathing with APRV favors the distribution of intrapulmonary gas to dependent, usually well-perfused, lung regions, making them better aerated than in subjects with a passively moving diaphragm. Moreover, we assumed that with better aeration of dependent lung regions there may be less cyclic collapse (or tidal recruitment) of lung tissue. This should reduce the shear stress caused by the opening and closing of air spaces. These hypotheses were tested using dynamic (high time resolution) CT scanning of single apical and juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions during tidal ventilation in porcine oleic-acid-induced ALI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental setting and protocol</title><p>The study was performed in the research laboratory of the Department of Clinical Physiology at the University Hospital of Uppsala, Sweden and was approved by the local institutional review board for animal studies. Dynamic CT scans were performed in 22 pigs with oleic-acid-induced lung injury. Pigs have also been included in a different CT study addressing effects of spontaneous breathing on end-expiratory atelectasis and lung volume using spiral CT scans of the total lung during end-expiratory clamping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The present study shows regional analyses of dynamic CT scans obtained during sustained tidal ventilation as described in the following. The animal preparation has been described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Briefly, anesthesia was induced intramuscularly and maintained by infusions of 30 mg/kg/hour ketamine, 0.1 mg/kg/hour midazolam, and 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg/minute remifentanil. The pigs were mechanically ventilated via a tracheostomy in the supine position and lung injury was induced with repeated central venous oleic acid injections (0.1 ml/kg) as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two hours after the induction of ALI, animals were randomized using sealed envelopes to receive either APRV with or without spontaneous breathing. Six hours after randomization, the pigs were transferred to the radiology department without interrupting ventilation or changing the ventilatory mode, and transverse dynamic chest CT scans were then performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilatory setting</title><sec><title>APRV without spontaneous breathing</title><p>Time-cycled pressure-controlled ventilation (Evita 4; Dr&#x000e4;ger, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany) was applied with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/minute, an inspiratory:expiratory time ratio of 1:1, FiO<sub>2 </sub>of 0.5, PEEP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and an inspiratory pressure that resulted in a tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) of approximately 10 ml/kg. Adjustments of the respiratory rate up to 30 breaths/minute and increments of inspiratory pressure were allowed in order to avoid hypercapnia above a PaCO<sub>2 </sub>of 60 mmHg and to compensate for decreased compliance. To suppress spontaneous breathing during hypercapnia, the remifentanil infusion was increased to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/minute and, if spontaneous breathing efforts were detected in esophageal pressure and/or gas flow tracings, 2.5 mg/hour pancuronium bromide was infused for muscle relaxation (this was necessary in four animals). The PEEP, the inspiratory:expiratory ratio, and FiO<sub>2 </sub>were kept constant during the entire study.</p></sec><sec><title>APRV with spontaneous breathing</title><p>The ventilator settings were guided by the principles already described. To allow reinstitution of spontaneous breathing the respiratory rate of the ventilator was decreased to 15 breaths/minute, resulting in (preset) inspiratory and expiratory times of 2 s, and the remifentanil infusion was lowered.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gas analysis, ventilatory, and lung mechanics measurements</title><p>Methods and techniques for gas analysis, ventilatory, and lung mechanics measurements have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CT scanning and analysis</title><p>During ventilation a frontal topogram of the chest was obtained with a Somatom Plus 4 (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and two transverse slices with a thickness of 8 mm were defined: one apical slice located at the midpoint of the intrathoracic trachea, and another slice located 1&#x02013;2 cm above the diaphragm.</p><p>In each of the two defined transverse slices, dynamic CT scans (140 kV, 111 mA, 0.75 s for one spin) over an acquisition time of 4.5 s were performed without interrupting ventilation in random order, ensuring inclusion of at least one ventilatory cycle. The CT scanner provided image reconstructions with effective time resolution of 0.1 s, resulting in 45 single scans for each slice. Depending on the transverse image size, the pixel size was 0.25 &#x000b1; 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>, resulting in a voxel size of 1.96 &#x000b1; 0.39 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The CT images were transferred to a personal computer and analyzed with a computer program (Osiris; University of Geneva, Switzerland). The investigator was blinded to the ventilatory mode. In all slices of the dynamic scans of the two defined lung regions, the entire lung was chosen as the region of interest (ROI) by drawing the external boundaries of the lungs inside the ribs and the internal boundaries along the mediastinal organs. The images with the highest mean Hounsfield units (HU) and with the lowest mean HU in the following sequence of images with decreasing HU numbers, representing the end-expiratory and end-inspiratory images (during APRV with spontaneous breathing, breaths with combined ventilator and spontaneous breathing activity), were selected by another researcher (JZ) in order not to unblind the ventilatory mode and passed to the investigator (TM) for further analysis.</p><p>The marked lung was divided into a ventral, nondependent half and a dorsal, dependent half (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, center) bisecting a ventral to dorsal axis that represents the highest chest diameter in parallel to a reference line from the sternum to the spine. Larger blood vessels were marked separately and data were subtracted. The number of voxels corresponding to each attenuation value in ventral and dorsal ROIs of each slice were counted and stored by the computer program. Attenuation values outside the range of -1,000 to +100 HU, which constituted less than 1% of all counts, were excluded. For repeated marking of the external boundaries of the lungs using similar technology, the intraobserver variability for the determination of ROIs was 1.7% of the mean ROI area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Continuous attenuation distributions of each ROI were analyzed using four groups of attenuation ranges with decreasing air content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]: range I included attenuation values between -1,000 and -900 HU previously defined as hyperinflation, range II included values between -900 and -500 HU defined as normal aeration, range III included values between -500 and -100 HU previously defined as poor aeration, and range IV included values between -100 and +100 HU representing atelectasis or lung parenchyma with a gas content of 10% or less.</p><p>The gas content of each ROI was calculated as follows: (mean HU / -1,000) &#x000d7; voxel number &#x000d7; voxel volume. For the calculation of the gas content, all voxels ranging from -1,000 to 0 HU were used.</p><p>These calculations were performed to obtain the regional distribution of aeration and the amount of nonaerated lung tissue in end-expiratory scans as well as end-inspiratory scans. To assess the distribution of regional ventilation, the end-expiratory gas volume was subtracted from the gas volume calculated from the end-inspiratory scans. Tidal recruitment (cyclic collapse) was estimated by subtracting the calculated amount of nonaerated tissue in inspiratory scans from the corresponding values in expiratory scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Primary outcome measures were the tidal changes in regional gas volumes and the amount of nonaerated lung. Sample size estimation was based on findings from previous studies. To detect differences in these parameters between ventilatory settings with the given two-sided parallel design at a significance level of 5% (&#x003b1; = 0.05) with a probability of 80% (&#x003b2; = 0.20), based on an estimated difference of 1.25 of the parameter's mean standard deviation, at least 20 animals had to be studied.</p><p>Results are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. All statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software package (STATISTICA for Windows 6.0; StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). A normal distribution of data was confirmed by the Shapiro&#x02013;Wilks <italic>W </italic>test. Two-way analysis of variance with the factors lung region and ventilator mode was used to detect regional aeration differences.

No between-groups differences in any measured cardiorespiratory variable have been observed before and 2 hours after the induction of lung injury when pigs were randomized, also indicating that the degree of lung injury was comparable between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. During specific ventilatory treatment, apart from a significantly higher effective respiratory rate (including spontaneous breathing) and a trend towards lower tidal volumes with spontaneous breathing, ventilatory variables such as the minute ventilation, alveolar ventilation and airway pressures were comparable between APRV with and without spontaneous breathing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, tables I-III, data kindly reproduced with permission of Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The proportion of minute ventilation due to spontaneous breathing during APRV with spontaneous breathing could not be measured directly, because the spontaneous breathing activity partially coincides with mechanical breaths. However, the mechanical ventilation should have been halved by the 50% reduction of the respiratory rate of the ventilator down to 15 breaths/minute during APRV with spontaneous breathing. Minute ventilation was comparable between both settings, however, suggesting a 50% contribution of spontaneous breathing to the total ventilation.</p></sec><sec><title>Regional distribution of tidal ventilation and recruitment</title><p>Analyses of continuous attenuation distributions of apical and diaphragmatic ROIs during both inspiration and expiration are plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

No significant differences between ventilator modes were observed in the apical slice (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The main findings of this dynamic CT study in oleic-acid-induced lung injury were that spontaneous breathing during APRV is associated with improved tidal ventilation and end-expiratory aeration of dependent juxtadiaphragmatic lung zones and is associated with less tidal alveolar recruitment. The end-inspiratory loss of alveolar aeration, however, was less extensive when spontaneous breathing was allowed during APRV.</p><sec><title>Methodological aspects and limitations of the model</title><p>In contrast to endotoxin or lavage models, oleic-acid-induced lung injury is characterized by both inflammation and structural lung damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] associated with a certain amount of alveolar edema depending on the amount of injury. Whereas lavage models tend to lead to spontaneous recovery of pulmonary function over time, oleic-acid-induced injury produces an injury that is stable in terms of gas exchange impairment for several hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>One could assume that it is necessary to investigate exactly the same lung tissue in both end-inspiratory and end-expiratory images to estimate the regional distribution of tidal ventilation, especially in an inhomogeneous model of lung injury. In a previous investigation comparing different techniques of lung CT in the same experimental model we demonstrated that one single slice is representative for at least three neighbored slices (each 8 mm apart) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The neighboring slices showed no significant differences for any range of attenuation, and this result was not modified by any additional factor such as the ventilatory mode, respiratory phase or scanning technique (spiral or dynamic CT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present analyses ROI sizes appear large enough to minimize effects of transverse movement of the lung tissue. In summary, the technique used in this model of acute lung injury allows one to investigate regional changes of gas content and nonaerated lung tissue during tidal ventilation, knowing that the lung regions investigated during end-inspiration and end-expiration are not necessarily exactly identical.</p><p>We used an external PEEP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in this study, which has been used in previous animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This PEEP level in combination with controlled mechanical ventilation was obviously not able to restore the EELV after induction of mild to moderate lung injury in our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although no widely accepted strategy to optimize the PEEP in pigs exists, higher PEEP levels might have favored restoration of the EELV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and might have prevented cyclic alveolar collapse. However, the aim of this study was not to compare different alveolar recruitment strategies but to study the effects of unrestricted spontaneous breathing on lung aeration, which required comparable PEEP levels in both treatment groups. Our study design even resulted in comparable end-inspiratory and mean airway pressures between the groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, table III, data kindly reproduced with permission of Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A minority of pigs randomized to receive APRV without spontaneous breathing required neuromuscular blockade to suppress spontaneous breathing. Neuromuscular blockade did not affect gas exchange in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome who had been rendered apneic by lowering the PaCO<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The use of neuromuscular blockade in some animals to guarantee controlled mechanical ventilation therefore cannot explain entirely the changes in cardiopulmonary function and ventilation distribution observed with persisting spontaneous breathing during APRV.</p></sec><sec><title>Tidal ventilation and recruitment</title><p>An inhomogeneous distribution of tidal ventilation, as shown earlier in patients with ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], may be explained by regional differences in transpulmonary pressures. Transpulmonary pressure is subject to a cephalocaudal gradient, with lower transpulmonary pressures in the caudal parts of the lungs than in the cephalad parts. Mechanisms include the transmission of abdominal pressure to the thoracic cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], an effect that may decrease from the base to the apex, as well as compression of lung tissue by the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We observed a redistribution of tidal and end-expiratory volumes to dependent lung regions close to the diaphragm and observed a reduced non-aerated lung volume with spontaneous breathing (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has been shown that spontaneous diaphragmatic movements are greatest in the posterior parts of the chest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which can be partially explained by the location of the muscular parts of the diaphragm preferentially in the lateral and posterior sections and more distended muscle fibers. This should result in locally increased transpulmonary pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], in alveolar recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and in improved ventilation of dependent regions close to the diaphragm. In contrast, differences in tidal volume distribution between dependent and nondependent apical lung regions were not significantly influenced by the ventilator mode (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), supporting the idea that diaphragmatic activity is the most important factor influencing ventilation and aeration distribution.</p><p>The tidal recruitment was lower with spontaneous breathing. While tidal recruitment was observed during both ventilatory modes, it was more than twice as high without spontaneous breathing in the dependent lung regions near the diaphragm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This cyclic alveolar collapse and reopening causes shear forces with transmural pressures of up to 100 cmH<sub>2</sub>O applied to lung cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Cyclic opening of lung units during inspiration and closure of lung units during expiration causes mechanical stress, and may contribute to ventilator-associated lung injury including aggravation of pulmonary and systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We did not measure markers for ventilator-associated lung injury, however, and therefore cannot conclude on the basis of the present data that spontaneous breathing during APRV would prevent or alleviate ventilator-associated lung injury.</p><p>Despite the larger amount of tidal recruitment, consolidated lung tissue at end-inspiration was still more pronounced during APRV without spontaneous breathing as compared with during APRV with spontaneous breathing, suggesting that the presence of both distended and collapsed (or consolidated) lung regions was more probable in the absence of spontaneous breathing. An external PEEP higher than 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, as used in this study, might have reduced the cyclic alveolar collapse during controlled mechanical ventilation.</p></sec><sec><title>Spontaneous breathing and regional end-expiratory distribution of gas and nonaerated tissue</title><p>Previous data from static spiral CT studies of the whole lung have demonstrated that spontaneous breathing results in an increased EELV and in an improvement in arterial blood oxygenation and cardiac output, both contributing to improved oxygen delivery in the same animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, table III, data kindly reproduced with permission of Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, USA). These quantitative aeration differences associated with spontaneous breathing are extended by the present regional analyses of attenuation distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), suggesting that an improved EELV is mostly due to alveolar recruitment in dependent juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions with spontaneous breathing and improved regional aeration in dependent lung regions (qualitative aeration differences). These observations may also be explained by higher transpulmonary pressures in dependent juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions, as already discussed. Our data also confirm recent data from single photon emission tomography studies in the same animal model showing not only improvement of ventilation in dependent lung areas close to the diaphragm, but also improvement in regional perfusion of these areas with spontaneous breathing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results of this study show that spontaneous breathing with APRV promotes alveolar recruitment mainly in dependent, juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions. This results not only in improved end-expiratory aeration, but also in redistribution of the tidal ventilation to dependent lung zones. In addition, spontaneous breathing with APRV countered the undesirable cyclic alveolar collapse in dependent lung regions that can contribute to ventilator-associated lung injury. These data support the hypothesis that active contractions of the diaphragm are a major factor explaining the improved oxygenation by reduction of an intrapulmonary shunt observed in animal models and in patients with ALI. Our data further support the clinical concept to allow, rather than suppress, spontaneous breathing activity in ALI.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; 	In pigs with oleic-acid-induced lung injury, spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release ventilation redistributes tidal ventilation to dependent lung regions close to the diaphragm.</p><p>&#x02022; 	Cyclic alveolar collapse during tidal ventilation, which is considered a risk factor for ventilation-associated lung injury, occurred less in pigs breathing spontaneously.</p><p>&#x02022; 	Previously observed improvement in end-expiratory lung volume in the same animals is explained by alveolar recruitment and redistribution of aeration mainly to dependent juxtadiaphragmatic lung regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALI = acute lung injury; APRV = airway pressure release ventilation; CT = computed tomography; EELV = end-expiratory lung volume; FiO<sub>2 </sub>= fraction of inspired oxygen; HU = Hounsfield units; PaCO<sub>2 </sub>= arterial carbon dioxide tension; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; ROI = region of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HW conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination, performed measurements, and wrote the manuscript.
