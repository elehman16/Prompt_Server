UI was socially disabling in 0.33&#x02009;million (2.2%).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> UI has a negative impact on a woman&#x02019;s social, physical and psychological well-being, leading to embarrassment, low self-esteem and social isolation. UI is associated with negative effects on the productivity of working women, with some avoiding employment because of fear of embarrassing situations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> UI has significant cost implications to the individual and the health service. The total annual cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) for the management of women over the age of 40 with UI was &#x000a3;301&#x02009;million or 0.3% of the NHS budget.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Costs borne by women in terms of out-of-pocket expenses were &#x000a3;230&#x02009;million<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or &#x000a3;290 per woman per year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> All values reported are inflated to 2009 values.</p><p>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of UI in premenopausal women, accounting for almost 50% of cases.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It is defined as involuntary leakage of urine on effort, or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. Initial management of SUI includes conservative therapy such as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), biofeedback, electrical stimulation or drugs. When conservative therapy fails, in about one-third of cases, surgery is the next option<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Of the surgical treatments available, tension-free standard midurethral slings (SMUS; retropubic tension-free vaginal tape (RP-TVT) and transobturator tension-free vaginal tape (TO-TVT)) are the most commonly performed procedures for SUI, resulting in 11&#x02009;000 finished consultant episodes in England in 2009&#x02013;2010, with estimated costs of &#x000a3;2044/procedure,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> that is, a total of &#x000a3;22.5&#x02009;million/year. The Cochrane review of minimally invasive midurethral slings (MUS)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> concluded that there was no evidence of significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between RP-TVT and TO-TVT, and therefore the control arm for the proposed randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a pragmatic combination of these two types of SMUS. Analysis of British Society of Urogynaecology&#x000a0;database showed that the vast majority of SMUS in the UK are done under general anaesthesia (GA) or deep intravenous patient sedation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Single-incision mini-slings (SIMS) represent the third generation of MUS; they have been developed with the aim to offer a true ambulatory procedure for treatment of SUI with reduced morbidity and earlier recovery while maintaining similar efficacy to SMUS. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) undertook an interventional procedure overview of SIMS<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> for the management of SUI in women in July 2007 (NICE guidance/IP398): there was no RCT evidence and only small case series data were available. The report concluded that the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of SIMS was inadequate in quality and quantity, and recommended that SIMS should only be performed in the context of research. Similarly, the Cochrane review of minimally invasive MUS found no randomised evidence evaluating SIMS.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Rationale for the study</title><p>The European guidelines<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> on the management of urinary incontinence describe two concepts of MUS for the surgical treatment of SUI in women: (1) Tension-free MUS that include all MUS that depend on their post-insertion fixation mechanism on friction to nearby tissues within their relatively long trajectory of insertion such as SMUS (both RP-TVT and TO-TVT); one type of non-anchored SIMS (Contasure-Needleless) also fits into this group. (2) Anchored MUS that include all other SIMS and other anchored slings such as Remeex TRT; the latter is mainly used in women with recurrent SUI.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> SIMS fundamentally differs from SMUS because they have a shorter trajectory of insertion and therefore need a robust anchoring mechanism to the obturator complex with a strong post-insertion pull-out force. All currently available SIMS share the same tape material (type 1 polypropylene) and the insertion technique through a single vaginal incision; however, they differ in the type/robustness of the anchorage mechanism used.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> A number of recently developed SIMS, such as Ajust, Altis, and TFS, have an added advantage that allow post-anchorage adjustment of the sling tension and have been shown in independent animal studies, assessing their immediate and delayed extraction forces, to be associated with the strongest and most robust anchoring mechanism to the obturator complex.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref></p><p>A multicentre prospective cohort study of adjustable anchored SIMS-Ajust in 100 women has shown its acceptability (75%) and feasibility (97%) to be done under local anaesthesia (LA).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We recently concluded our multicentre prospective pilot RCT<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> where 137 women were randomised to adjustable anchored SIMS-Ajust (n=69), performed under LA, versus SMUS (TVT-O; n=68). At a minimum of 12 months&#x02019; follow-up, there were no significant differences in the patient-reported success rate (OR 0.895; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.344 to 2.330; p=1.000), objectives success rate (OR 0.929; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.382 to 2.258; p=1.00) and reoperation rates (OR 0.591; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.136 to 2.576; p=0.721) between both groups. Comparable number of women reported significant improvement in their quality of life (QoL) (p=0.190) and sexual function (p=0.699) in both groups. Similar results were recently reached by a Deutsch group in a similar small RCT. Similar results were reported in observational studies with varying cohort sizes: patient-reported and objective success rates of 85%&#x02013;91% up to 12-month follow-up.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref></p><p>A recent updated systematic review and meta-analysis<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> compared the effectiveness and complications of SIMS versus SMUS for the surgical management of female SUI. The authors considered TVT-Secur to be clinically irrelevant, having been excluded from clinical practice and excluded the relevant RCTs, hence included a total of 26 RCTs (n=3308 women). Meta-analyses showed that at a mean follow-up of 18 months, there was no evidence of significant differences between SIMS and SMUS in patient-reported and objective cure rates (relative risk (RR): 0.94; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.88 to 1.00; and RR: 0.98; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.94 to 1.01, respectively). Interestingly, SIMS had significantly lower postoperative pain scores, earlier return to normal activities and earlier return to work (weighted mean difference (WMD): &#x02212;2.94; 95%&#x02009;CI &#x02212;4.16 to &#x02212;1.73; WMD: &#x02212;5.08; 95%&#x02009;CI &#x02212;9.59 to &#x02212;0.56; and WMD: &#x02212;7.20; 95%&#x02009;CI &#x02212;12.43 to &#x02212;1.98, respectively). The authors reported that SIMS had a trend towards higher rates of repeat continence surgery, although it did not reach statistical significance (RR: 2.00; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.93 to 4.31). An exploratory subgroup analysis evaluating adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust and TFS) versus TO-TVT included four RCTs and showed no evidence of significant differences in patient-reported or objective cure rates. However, it is important to note that they found no RCTs evaluating Altis.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The authors concluded that &#x02018;<italic>on excluding TVT-Secur, there was no evidence of significant differences in patient-reported and objective cure between currently used SIMS and SMUS at midterm follow-up while associated with more favourable recovery time&#x02019;.</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The authors urged caution in the interpretation of results due to the heterogeneity of the small trials included, lack of blinding of the assessors which can be a source of bias, the level of incomplete data leading to attrition bias and the relatively short term of follow-up.</p><p>Evidence of longer term outcomes for adjustable anchored SIMS are now emerging. In July 2012, Sivaslioglu <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> reported a 5-year follow-up for their RCT of TFS versus SMUS (n=80). The results showed no evidence of significant difference in objective and patient-reported success rates (TFS 83%&#x02013;89%&#x02009;vs SMUS 75%&#x02013;78%,&#x02009;respectively). Similarly, Naumann <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> reported a 2-year follow-up of observational study of 51 women who underwent SIMS-Ajust; the patient-reported success rate was 86%.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of any new technology is a prerequisite for its adoption in clinical practice. Our team performed the first health economic analysis of adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust) compared with SMUS (TVT-O).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The health economic outcome measures were incremental costs to the health services, patient quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY. Results have shown an incremental total cost savings to the health service of &#x000a3;142/procedure with adjustable anchored SIMS, not counting the further potential economic gain of earlier return to work in these women. There were no significant differences in QALYs generated compared with SMUS: 95%&#x02009;CI &#x02212;0.008 to 0.002. Assuming these results were generalisable to all currently performed MUS procedures in England and Wales (approximately 11&#x02009;000 in 2010),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> our analyses suggest the potential for substantial cost savings to the NHS in the UK of about &#x000a3;1.5&#x02009;million per year. However, these results have to be confirmed in the definitive RCT.</p><p>The above evidence has led to a consensus among urologists and urogynaecologists that an adequately powered RCT with clinical effectiveness as the primary end point is now timely and required to inform surgeons, patients and decision makers with the most clinically effective, cost-effective surgical treatment for primary SUI, which is associated with the least burden on patients&#x02019; QoL and NHS resources.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The aim of this pragmatic multicentre RCT is to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adjustable anchored SIMS compared with tension-free SMUS in the surgical management of female SUI.</p><p>The hypothesis being tested is that patient-reported success rate following surgical treatment with adjustable anchored SIMS procedures is non-inferior to tension-free SMUS, while the former is associated with less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, earlier recovery and consequently earlier return to usual activities/work, and is more cost-effective than SMUS.</p><p>The primary objective is to compare SUI outcomes in terms of patient-reported success rates as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 12 months.</p><p>The primary economic objective is to compare cost-effectiveness measured in terms of QALYs derived from responses to the EQ-5D and the ICIQ-LUTSqol over the follow-up period.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to compare objective success rates (24-hour pad test/home cough stress test) and other patient-reported outcomes, including postoperative pain scores and health-related QoL using the ICIQ-LUTSqol, impact on other urinary symptoms (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire &#x02014; Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS)), impact on sexual function (ICIQ-FLUT-Sex/PISQ-IR), complication rates, disease recurrence and costs to the NHS and patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority RCT comparing adjustable anchored SIMS with tension-free SMUS in surgical management of SUI in women.

Women will be accompanied by a nurse for support. All participating surgeons will use an adjustable anchored SIMS that meets the prespecified criteria described below. A standardised insertion technique will be used by all surgeons following the original description of the particular SIMS used. Most adjustable anchored SIMS, however, have a fairly similar procedure of insertion. We describe below the standard insertion steps for the adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust-CR Bard and Altis-Coloplast): women will be positioned in lithotomy position with hips flexed at 90&#x000b0;&#x02013;100&#x000b0;. LA infiltration is as above; a suburethral vertical vaginal incision (~1.5&#x02009;cm) will be made; and bilateral paraurethral tunnels will be created reaching to the posterior margin of the inferior pubic ramus but without piercing the obturator membrane. Further infiltration of LA into the obturator membrane will be done, and SIMS, with the &#x02018;fixed anchor&#x02019; end mounted on the applicator, would be introduced through the predissected paraurethral tunnel until reaching behind the inferior pubic ramus. The applicator would then pivot slowly behind the ramus and through the obturator complex allowing the fixed anchor to maintain its position in the obturator membrane and muscles at points equivalent to 10 and 2 o&#x02019;clock in relation to the urethral orifice. The insertion steps would be repeated on to the other side allowing the &#x02018;adjustable anchor&#x02019; to be fixed in the contralateral obturator complex. The SIMS is now robustly anchored and the tension would then be adjusted as required to achieve continence while avoiding voiding difficulty. Performing the cough stress test can prove very helpful in this adjustment process and is recommended. The adjustable anchor would then be locked in the case of the Ajust (not required with Altis), and a cystoscopy will be performed to exclude perforation and the vaginal incision closed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Tension-free SMUS</title><p>The choice of SMUS whether retropubic or transobturator will depend on the surgeon&#x02019;s experience. We expect a 50% representation of each type of SMUS in the control arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Retropubic tension-free vaginal tape</title><p>RP-TVT will be type 1 polypropylene mesh (monofilament and macroporous: pore size &#x02265;75&#x02009;&#x003bc;m). The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedure was developed by Ulmsten <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The procedure will be done under GA or intravenous sedation as per the standard practice of each surgeon. The bladder will be emptied with a Foley catheter. Close to the superior rim of the pubic bone, two 1&#x02009;cm long transverse incisions 3&#x02009;cm either side of the midline will be made after injection of LA into the abdominal skin just above the symphysis pubis, down along the back of the pubic bone to the retropubic space and vaginally into the periurethral area. An incision ~1.5&#x02009;cm long will be made in the midline of the suburethral vaginal wall, followed by dissection of the periurethral tunnels to allow introduction of the TVT needle. A stent will be inserted into the Foley catheter to deviate the urethravesical junction away from the path of the needle. The TVT needle perforates the urogenital diaphragm and will be brought up to the abdominal incision &#x02018;shaving&#x02019; the back of the pubic bone. The procedure will then be repeated on the other side, and a cystoscopy will be performed to exclude perforation. The cough stress test may then be performed, according to the surgeon&#x02019;s standard technique, and the sling adjusted in a tension-free fashion and the incisions are closed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Transobturator tension-free vaginal tape</title><p>TO-TVT will be type 1 polypropylene mesh (monofilament and macroporous: pore size &#x02265;75&#x02009;&#x003bc;m). All procedures will be performed under GA as originally described by Delrome<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and de Leval<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> for the outside-in and inside-out routes, respectively. Women are positioned in lithotomy position with hips flexed at 100&#x000b0;&#x02013;110&#x000b0;, and LA may be infiltrated into the vaginal angles; the latter is not a standard practice, however is recommended in a similar regimen to the one used in the adjustable SIMS insertion (above). A ~1.5&#x02009;cm suburethral longitudinal vaginal incision will be made and bilateral paraurethral tunnels created reaching to the posterior margin of the inferior pubic ramus. Bilateral groin incisions are made 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;cm lateral to the labiofemoral fold and 2&#x02009;cm above the level of urethra. The transobturator trocar is inserted from groin incisions at 90&#x000b0; to pierce the obturator muscles and membranes and then guided by the surgeon&#x02019;s finger to the vaginal incision. TO-TVT is then mounted on the trocar and the trocar is withdrawn in reverse order. The previous two steps are repeated on the contralateral side achieving TO-TVT suburethral placement, and the TO-TVT is then adjusted tension-free. For the inside-out technique of insertion, TO-TVT would be introduced in the reverse route from the vaginal incision towards the groin using the winged guide to protect the lower urinary tract (LUT). A cystoscopy will be performed to exclude LUT injury. Vaginal and skin incisions will then be closed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study population</title><p>The study included women aged 18 years or over with SUI who have been referred to the collaborating surgical gynaecology, urology and urogynaecology units from across the UK for treatment of SUI for whom surgery has been indicated.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Setting</title><p>The study will be done in secondary and tertiary care acute hospital settings across the UK.

At 4 weeks postoperatively, participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire (on the last section of the diary) to capture pain, use of analgesia, complications, return to work/normal activities, PGI-I and EQ-5D. At 3 months postoperatively, participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires &#x02014; to measure the PGI-I, EQ-5D, ICIQ-SF, UPS and questions related to health services resource &#x02014; and to report any complications or further treatment received for UI.

Taking into account the inevitable waiting time between randomisation and receiving the surgical treatment (average surgical waiting list is 8&#x02013;12 weeks), and in addition the clinical importance of assessing the outcomes at 12&#x02009;months postoperatively, we aim to send the 1-year follow-up pack at 15&#x02009;months postrandomisation.

Adjustable anchored SIMS is not hypothesised to increase this proportion, however may have other potential benefits as outlined previously. It is therefore important to show that SIMS is clinically non-inferior to SMUS and to measure these other dimensions (such as cost-effectiveness, mediated through shorter stay and earlier recovery, QoL mediated through less pain, and any safety signals via the complication rate) in an adequately powered, pragmatic RCT with long enough follow-up. It is essential therefore that the study is powered to demonstrate non-inferiority within an appropriate margin, and hence this clinical outcome is the correct choice as primary outcome. A 10% inferiority margin has been deemed by expert clinicians as the maximum inferiority margin in clinical effectiveness that would be accepted should SIMS prove to be superior in other outcomes such as shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain, earlier recovery and more cost-effective. In such case, adjustable anchored SIMS would then reliably be able to be considered as a first-line surgical treatment of women with primary SUI.</p><p>Published literature suggests that P1, the percentage success rate at 12&#x02009;months in the SMUS arm, will be about 85%; identical results were confirmed by our pilot RCT. Estimating P2, the percentage of success in the adjustable anchored SIMS arm, is more difficult due to lack of published evidence; a crude meta-analysis of the 12-month outcome data from our multicentre pilot RCT and few other small studies indicates a similar P2 of 85%.</p><p>Power estimates were explored by simulating trials of fixed sample size (using equal allocation) with binary responses generated by P1=85%&#x02009;and P2=85%. Power was then estimated as the proportion of simulated trials where the lower bound of the two-sided CI satisfied P1-P2 &#x0003e; &#x02212;10%. Simulations, run in Stata V.11.2 show that a trial of 275 per arm or 550 in total is required for the lower bound of the estimated 95% CI to rule inferiority at the specified level with 90% power. Adjustment for potential 15% dropout inflates the trial to 650 in total. For comparison, a trial of this size would have above 80% power to test superiority on secondary outcomes of difference in means of size one-quarter of an SD (or 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.28 SD).</p><p>In our multicentre pilot RCT,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> 131/137 women (95.6%) completed the 12-month follow-up and showed no significant differences in the patient-reported success rate (OR 0.895; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.344 to 2.330; p=1.000) between adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust) and SMUS (TVT-O) groups. These results, together with similar results from other studies detailed above,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;21</xref> provide assurances for the reliability of our sample size calculations. A statistical reviewer previously queried whether we had considered the implications if in fact the success of the two procedures were not identical but slightly different. If we consider success rates of 84% and 85%, the study retains 90% power to detect a slightly larger margin of non-inferiority of around 11%, and so to all intents and purposes a sample size of 650 remains adequate.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Recruitment rates and milestones</title><p>Our recruitment rate estimates are based on data from the pilot multicentre RCT comparing adjustable anchored SIMS (Ajust) with SMUS (TVT-O). We believe that these centres are representative of the UK; 137 women were recruited across six centres at a rate of 3.4 per centre per month. Overall, 137/181 (76%) patients were willing to be randomised; however, we have used a more conservative estimate of 50% in our recruitment projection. Therefore, it has been estimated that in order to approach 1300 eligible patients to randomise the required 650 patients, 25 centres would need a throughput of at least 90 eligible patients per centre per year to recruit three patients per month. The recruitment projection is based on 18 months of recruitment (months 7&#x02013;24 inclusive) and allows for set-up, holidays and waiting list times. We expect a staggered recruitment of centres with all centres active by the end of month 18. The first 45 patients will be recruited by month 12, 256 patients by month 18 and the remaining 367 patients by month 24, making a total of 668 patients.</p><p>Due to lower than predicted recruitment, a further extension has been granted to enable recruitment to reach at least 600 participants This increases the recruitment period so that the last participant will be recruited in month 44.

Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared using generalised linear models, with adjustment for design covariates. As standard we also adjust all our surgical RCTs for centre/surgeon effects; adjustment for centre/surgeon will be by random effect in the trial analysis.</p><p>For the primary outcome, we plan to dichotomise the PGI-I responses with &#x02018;success&#x02019; defined as &#x02018;very much better&#x02019; or &#x02018;much better&#x02019; and the rest of responses as failures; this will determine whether the women are satisfied with their operation and hence consider their symptoms are resolved and do not seek further treatments. In addition, this definition of &#x02018;success&#x02019; is widely used within the research field of surgical treatment of SUI and was used in our pilot RCT, and therefore will allow comparing our results with other trials in the literature. We will also perform a secondary analysis using ordinal regression on the 7-point PGI-I scale, so potentially using more of the information in the outcome. However, we do not propose adopting this ordinal regression as the primary analysis since the underlying proportional odds model makes strong assumptions about the consistency of treatment effect across the levels of response, and particularly in the context of a non-inferiority design there may be departures from those assumptions that would interfere with establishing whether the simple hypothesis around the non-inferiority of the binary &#x02018;success&#x02019; under the two operations had been shown.</p><p>The statistical analysis of the primary outcome will be by the usual intention-to-treat (ITT) and also a suitably defined per-protocol analysis (to reflect the unique nature of non-inferiority designs and the issue that ITT for such designs may not be the most conservative analysis and inflate the true type I error rate, given that in a non-inferiority design the null hypothesis is that the interventions are not non-inferior or equivalent). If the two approaches return material differences in interpretation, this will be investigated carefully. Results will be displayed as estimates and 95% CIs derived from appropriate generalised linear models. CIs around observed differences will then be compared with the prespecified non-inferiority margin.</p><p>Secondary outcomes will be analysed similarly. Outcomes such as postoperative pain will be assessed under a superiority hypothesis as we believe that this will be lower in the intervention arm. As stated in the sample size section, there is above 80% power to detect a difference of a quarter of an SD under a superiority hypothesis.</p><p>All analyses will follow a carefully documented statistical analysis plan. Subgroup analyses (appropriately analysed by testing treatment by subgroup interaction) will explore possible treatment effect modification.

If a woman falls pregnant after receiving treatment within the RCT, her data will be censored at the time of confirmed pregnancy for the primary analysis. This small number of women will still be followed up for all outcome data as usual, and if the numbers warrant, a sensitivity analysis including them will be undertaken on the primary outcome.</p><p>The TSC and an independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will be asked to review and comment on the statistical analysis plan prior to analysis. There are no plans for any formal interim analyses to be seen by the DMC. A single main analysis will be performed on the 12-month primary outcome and repeated on the 2-year and 3-year outcomes. The DMC will meet before recruitment begins, or as soon as practical, to agree the Terms of Reference and other procedures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Our primary health economic evaluation will be from a health service provider&#x02019;s (NHS) perspective; however, we will also present data from a wider societal perspective.

This questionnaire will be administered at 3 and 12 months, then yearly for 3 years. It is generally accepted that patient recall is accurate up to 12 months, and it is highly unlikely that a patient would not remember significant events relating to their disease over this time period. Data collected will include secondary care contacts (hospital inpatient admissions, outpatient appointments) and primary care contacts (eg, GP contacts, nurse contacts, physiotherapist consultations) and prescription drug medications. These healthcare utilisation data will be combined with unit cost information for the use of specific resources using standard sources.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> Data on costs for each group (SIMS and SMUS) will be summed to provide an average cost per patient trial participant. Sensitivity analysis will be used to explore various distributions of cost data as well as various methods for the imputation of missing and censored data. We will provide a comprehensive range of deterministic sensitivity analyses to test any assumptions we make in our analysis on the overall results. For example, we will test best and worst case scenarios for the intervention cost (whether all procedures in the SIMS arm are conducted under GA or LA). The impact of any missing data and methods of data imputation on our results will also be tested. We will test the impact of these and a range of other sensitivity analyses to be determined as the trial progresses on all our results (eg, cost utility analysis and cost benefit analysis).</p></sec><sec id="s8b"><title>Participant costs</title><p>Out-of-pocket patient expenses (including the purchase of containment products), private healthcare costs, travel costs and costs associated with lost days at work will also be collected using the patient-administered questionnaire and incorporated into the patient perspective analysis.

These data will be transformed into utility values using standard algorithms. QALYs will be calculated, using the area under the curve methods, with any differences between groups being reported. Both measures will be compared and contrasted and tested for comparability in measuring outcomes for these women.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p>The analysis will use the estimates of mean costs and QALYs as described for each trial participant to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 12-month follow-up period and where appropriate the analysis will mirror that of the statistical analyses. Cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained) will also be reported over the 3-year follow-up period. The results of the analysis will be presented as incremental costs, effects and incremental cost per QALY. Bootstrapping of cost and QALY differences, as well as a range of one-way and multiway deterministic sensitivity analyses, will be conducted to address uncertainty in the estimates. Cost per QALY data will also be presented in the form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Discrete choice experiment</title><p>Previous research<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> has suggested that EQ-5D questionnaire may not fully capture the benefits from successfully treating incontinence. They may not fully represent patient preferences for treatments and their associated outcomes. Therefore, we will conduct a DCE to elicit preference for the process, patient experience and health outcomes. A DCE presents respondents with a series of hypothetical choices that describe the choice alternatives by their underlying attributes; respondents are asked to choose the alternative they prefer. The values of the attributes vary across choice scenarios; by observing the peoples&#x02019; choices, it is possible to infer their preferences over the attributes of each surgical procedure. The extent to which an individual values an intervention depends on the levels of these attributes.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> DCEs are commonly used to identify people&#x02019;s preferences in a variety of non-market situations/services/commodities.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref></p><p>The attributes and levels for the DCE will be informed by systematic literature searching and advice sought from clinical experts. Attributes might include preferences for general/local anaesthetic, preferences for pain levels, cure and improvement rates, impact on activities of daily living, and so on. These attributes and levels will be combined to identify profiles that will be used to develop scenarios to present the study participants. The questionnaire will be piloted among a convenience sample to refine all practical aspects of the survey and to ensure that trade-offs can be made between the identified attributes. Once the pilot is complete and the questionnaire has been refined, it will be administered to the trial participants at the end of the 3-year follow-up.</p><p>Experimental design techniques will be used to generate an efficient set of choices from which preferences will be estimated. Logistic regression techniques will be used to analyse the response data. A cost attribute will be included so that willingness to pay (WTP) can be estimated. The results of the DCE information will be combined with the clinical outcomes estimated from the trial to provide an estimate of mean WTP for each of the two interventions. Results of the WTP aspect of the DCE will be presented as incremental NB between groups, where NB will be measured as WTP less the mean cost for each intervention. The intervention with the greatest NB will be deemed the most efficient. The results of this analysis will be compared and contrasted with the cost/QALY outcomes and will yield some information regarding the applicability of traditional QALY measurement to conducting economic evaluation in UI. The resultant costs and utilities will be used to estimate preference-based quality weights for this condition.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Organisation: trial management and oversight arrangements</title><sec id="s12a"><title>Study Office in Aberdeen</title><p>The SIMS trial is managed by the Study Office at the CHaRT based within the Health Services Research Unit (HSRU), University of Aberdeen.
