Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is characterized with symptoms such as pain, paraesthesia and sensory loss predominantly in lower extremities due to the peripheral somatosensory system involvement.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, DPN is associated with an impaired quality-of-life and psychological problems in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Prevalence of DPN has reported to be 10-26% depends upon using criteria for diagnosing DPN.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Though many analgesic agents including anti-depressants, carbamazepine, gabapentin, opioids and more recently, duloxetine and pregabalin have been introduced for management of DPN, but it seems that already mentioned pharmacologic treatments are not appropriate enough due to lack of long-lasting pain relief, poor tolerability and side-effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] So, mentioned factors in addition to increased health-related costs of DPN made it as a challenging issue which need further investigations.</p><p>In order to avoid the limitations of mentioned analgesic agents, recently the use of topical agents such as lidocaine patches, high-dose capsaicin and botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) have been developed. Though the effectiveness of these agents for pain relief of DPN was not confirmed in all studies, but the superiority of them, their minor systemic side-effects, made their use more favorable in this regard.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>BTX-A is a potent neurotoxin, which commonly used for the treatment of dystonia, muscle hyperactivity and glandular hyperactivity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Some evidences suggests that regardless of its myorelaxant action, BTX-A might have analgesic properties for DPN.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Although the mechanisms of its analgesics effect was not determined clearly, but evidences from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated the analgesics effect of BTX-A injection on neuropathic pain of diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Considering the dramatic increasing rate of diabetes and consequently its related complications most importantly DPN, challenges regarding proper treatment of DPN and its effect on the quality-of-life and care of diabetic patients, the aim of this current study was to evaluate the effect of intradermal BTX-A injections on pain symptoms of patients with diabetic neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial study, 57 type 2 diabetic patients aged &#x0003c;70 years with neuropathic pain in both feet referred to neurology clinics of Al-Zahra and Kashani Hospitals, affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, from September 2011 to September 2012, were enrolled.</p><p>The protocol of the study was approved by Regional Bioethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Research Project Number: 390565).</p><p>The patients were selected by simple randomized sampling method. Written informed consent was obtained from all selected patients.</p><p>There were also prerequisites that the medication for neuropathic pain had not been changed within the previous 1 month period and during the course of the trial.</p><p>Diabetic neuropathy (DN) (symmetrical distal sensory and motor polyneuropathy) in selected patients was diagnosed using DN4 questionnaire and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) examinations.</p><p>Patients with no appropriate cooperation, hypersensitivity reaction to BTX-A and those who currently use other analgesics for their neuropathic pain were excluded. In addition those with an infection at the injection site, any lumbar-sacral radiculopathy based upon clinical presentation, neurologic examination and electrodiagnostic (EDX) study, motor deficit, alcoholism and renal function impairment, distal muscle weakness and atrophy, history of myasthenia gravis, concomitant usage of aminoglycosides and breastfeeding mothers were excluded from the study.</p><p>Other causes of DN was determined in each case separately according to his/her medical file and presented documents. In conflicting case, further diagnostic test was done.</p><p>Selected patients were randomized in two intervention (BTX-A injection) and placebo groups (normal saline injection).</p><p>The injections will be distributed across the dorsum of the foot, in a grid distribution pattern covering a total of 12 (3 &#x000d7; 4) sites. The distribution of these sites will be such that the distance between them was approximately equal. To keep the study blind, the preparation of saline and BTX-A was performed by an independent study physician, who did not participate in the interview of participants.</p><p>One hundred units of BTX-A (Dysport-Ipsen, UK) in 0.9% saline were then administered intra-dermally into one foot, with each injection comprising approximately 8-10 U BTX-A, using an insulin syringe.</p><p>Nearly 0.9% saline injections were performed in an identical manner.</p><p>The outcome of injection on diabetic neuropathic pain was assessed using neuropathy pain scale (NPS) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores by Neurologist.</p><p>The outcome of injection was evaluated 3 weeks after injection.

Bach-Rojecky <italic>et al</italic>. in Croatia have investigated antinociceptive activity of BTX-A in a model of DPN pain in rats. They demonstrated that unilateral BTX-A injection result in bilateral pain reduction with long-lasting effect up to 4 weeks.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Ranoux <italic>et al</italic>. in France studied the analgesics effects of one-time intradermal administration of BTX-A on DPN pain in 29 diabetic patients. The outcome was reported at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks after injection. They indicated that BTX-A have a significant effect on pain intensity of DPN from 2 to 14 weeks after injection. For the 1<sup>st</sup> time, they concluded that BTX-A independent of its action on muscle tone have an analgesic effect on DPN pain. Hence, chronic DPN related pain considered as a novel indication for intradermal BTX-A injection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In another recent study, Ranoux in France reported that one session of multiple intradermal BTX-A injection have long-lasting analgesic effects in patients with DPN. The results were compatible with a reduction of peripheral sensitization.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Yuan <italic>et al</italic>. in Taiwan, in a double-blind crossover trial have investigated the effect of intradermal BTX-A for DPN pain in 20 patients. They showed that using VAS, BTX-A significantly reduced DPN pain during a 12-week period. Nearly 44.4% of their studied patients reported VAS reduction regarding DPN pain within 3 months after injection.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The findings of the current study were in line with mentioned study but we did not study the long-term effect of BTX-A in this regard. According to VAS scale 30% of patients in the intervention group have no pain after intervention. The results of our study showed that all studied pain domains, studied by NPS score, significantly decreased. Regarding cold sensation P value was 0.05.</p><p>DN4 scores among studied population in interventional (BTX-A) group showed a significant reduction in electric shocks, burning, pins, needles and brushing. They did not show a significant difference in reminder items.</p><p>It seems that it may be due to small sample size but for more conclusive result it should be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>BTX-A usually administrates intramuscularly for focal spasticity or dystonia but in this study we evaluated intradermal effect of BTX-A for DPN pain. Considering the extent of the painful area and safety of the procedure, it seems that this form of injection is more favorable for DPN pain treatment than intramuscular form.</p><p>The advantage of our study was that we used NPS score for outcome measurement. However, because neuropathic pain is associated with a variety of pain sensations, the effects of any treatment on different sensations could go undetected if specific pain qualities are not assessed. So, we used NPS score which evaluate the variety of pain sensation.</p><p>The limitation of this study was that the outcome of BTX-A injection in DPN pain was evaluated for a short time, i.e., 3 weeks after injection and the long-term effect of BTX-A was not studied due to the problems regarding patients regular follow-up. This limitation should be considered in our future studies; however the results would be important in clinical practice for proper management of DPN pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that intradermal injection of BTX-A has a significant effect on DPN pain and it is a well-tolerated agent for the purpose. Although obtained results suggest that BTX-A could be an appropriate therapeutic agent in this field, but for more conclusive result and better DPN pain management protocol further large scale studies with long-term follow-up period is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tesfaye</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Recent advances in the management of diabetic symmetrical polyneuropathy</article-title><source>J Diabetes Investig</source><year>2010</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>33</fpage><lpage>42</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tankisi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Pugdahl</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Fuglsang-Frederiksen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnsen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fawcett</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Pathophysiology inferred from electrodiagnostic nerve tests and classification of polyneuropathies.
