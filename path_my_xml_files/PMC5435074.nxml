Because levothyroxine administration suppresses the hypothalamic&#x02010;pituitary&#x02010;thyroid axis (HPTA), thyroid function tests could be altered after cessation of therapy.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p><p>Thyroid hormone replacement therapy in euthyroid patients suppresses hypothalamic and pituitary function by negative feedback of thyroid hormones on thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (thyrotropin; TSH).<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Chronic suppression of the HPTA will result in pituitary thyrotrope atrophy and subsequently, thyroid gland atrophy and impaired secretion of thyroid hormones.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
</p><p>In humans, withdrawal of therapy after prolonged treatment can result in serum thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations below their respective reference intervals, with the length and degree of suppression influenced by the type, dose, and duration of replacement therapy.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Additionally, thyroid function tests can be affected for months after long&#x02010;term thyroid hormone administration. During recovery from suppression, serum TSH concentration increases prior to thyroid hormones and can result in hormone levels similar to those found in primary hypothyroidism. Studies evaluating the effects of levothyroxine administration on the HPTA in euthyroid dogs are conflicting.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Levothyroxine administration to healthy dogs for 5 weeks did not suppress T<sub>4</sub> response to TRH administration in 1 study,<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> while another study documented complete suppression of TRH induced T<sub>4</sub> secretion after 6 weeks of treatment.

</p><p>The suppressive effects of thyroid hormone therapy and subsequent recovery of the HPTA present a diagnostic challenge when evaluating thyroid function. The influence of dosage, duration of treatment, and effects on serum TSH concentrations of levothyroxine administration has not been studied in the euthyroid dog. The effect of levothyroxine supplementation in euthyroid dogs on thyroid function tests has been investigated in only 1 study.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> That study contained a small number of dogs, did not measure serum TSH or free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations, administered twice daily levothyroxine rather than the currently recommended once daily treatment, and evaluated a single duration of treatment. In addition, the duration of follow&#x02010;up after discontinuing treatment was insufficient to document full recovery of the HPTA. It is not known whether supplementation for more than 8 weeks will increase the time it takes for the HPTA to normalize.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> In this study, we evaluated the degree and duration of suppression of the HPTA that occurs after chronic levothyroxine<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14711-note-1003">1</xref> administration to euthyroid dogs in order to identify when thyroid function tests accurately document euthyroidism after withdrawing supplementation. We hypothesized that levothyroxine administration would suppress the HPTA in euthyroid dogs and that the HPTA would recover within 8 weeks in all dogs, regardless of the duration of treatment.</p><sec id="jvim14711-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim14711-sec-0009"><title>Dogs</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine and by the Veterinary Teaching Hospital Board.

Week 1 of the supplementation period was designated as the time the target therapeutic range was reached. Dogs were evaluated every 4 weeks during the supplementation period by standardized history and physical examinations, and a blood sample was obtained 4&#x02013;6 hours after levothyroxine administration for measurement of serum concentrations of T<sub>4</sub>, fT<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, and TSH. At each evaluation, prescribed levothyroxine tablets were counted to determine owner compliance. After completion of levothyroxine administration (denoted as week 1&#x02013;16 of the withdrawal period), dogs were evaluated at 1 and 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks after cessation of treatment by standardized history and physical examination and measurement of serum T<sub>4</sub>, fT<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, and TSH concentrations. Any dog that developed an illness or required administration of a drug other than routine antiparasite prophylaxis were reviewed by 2 of the investigators to determine whether it should be excluded from the study.

The sensitivity of the assay, defined as the calculated concentration of free T4 at 2 standard deviations below total specific binding (11 assay runs), was 3.6 pmol/L. For other estimates of assay performance, 3 pools of canine serum were made with aliquots from clinical samples. In canine serum pools with mean concentrations of 7 (Low), 26 (Mid&#x02010;range), or 56 (High) pmol/L, the interassay %CV were 28, 16.3, and 9.5%, respectively (n = 11 assays). The interassay repeatability for the Low pool seems disappointing but small numerical differences are magnified in the low concentrations near the sensitivity of the assay. The intra&#x02010;assay %CV from the same pools were 11.0, 8.3, and 8.7%, respectively (n = 10&#x02013;14 replicates).

Effect of time on each outcome within each group was assessed using mixed model ANOVA followed by Tukey's procedure for multiple comparisons. The linear model specified sample week as a fixed effect and dog identification as the random effect. Correlation among residuals was modeled by specifying the AR(1) covariance matrix. For change from baseline and for individual hormonal concentrations during treatment (weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8) the treatment groups were compared using mixed model ANOVA.

The anticipated suppression of serum T<sub>4</sub>, fT<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>3,</sub> and TSH concentrations after up to 16 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine was not present. Therefore, thyroid function can be accurately investigated as early as 1 week after cessation of levothyroxine supplementation of similar dosage and duration.</p><p>Levothyroxine administration suppresses pituitary thyrotrope function and could result in atrophy as well as suppressed secretion of TSH. As a consequence of prolonged reduction in plasma TSH, thyroid gland atrophy can occur.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Dogs in the present study showed little evidence of residual effects of the negative feedback of exogenous levothyroxine on the HPTA. Only 1 dog had a sustained effect potentially attributable to levothyroxine treatment, with increase in serum TSH concentrations above the reference interval (0.59&#x02013;1.27 ng/mL) up to 16 weeks after discontinuing supplementation, with normal serum concentrations of T<sub>4</sub>, fT<sub>4,</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>. However, the serum TSH remained elevated when evaluated 14 months after the conclusion of the study. The sustained TSH increase is unlikely to be related to levothyroxine treatment but may represent developing lymphocytic thyroiditis. Another dog exhibited a low T<sub>4</sub> at 1 time point during the withdrawal period, but the concurrent TSH concentration was normal. At no point during the withdrawal period did a study dog exhibit a low serum T<sub>4</sub> or fT<sub>4</sub> and a high TSH concentration. This emphasizes the value of measuring serum T<sub>4</sub> and/or fT<sub>4</sub> and TSH concentrations concurrently when assessing thyroid function in euthyroid dogs inappropriately supplemented with levothyroxine. However, the HPTA may not be completely recovered in 1 week despite normalization of thyroid hormone concentrations and TSH.</p><p>Similar to a previous study of levothyroxine administration to euthyroid dogs, suppression of the HPTA was documented during the supplementation period in both groups.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Suppression of TSH was quite marked in group 2 dogs, with all having a decrease in the TSH concentration by more than 38%, which is the 1&#x02010;sided critical different of the assay (i.e., estimate of the analyte's individual biological variation and the assay's imprecision).<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> While dogs in the present study exhibited normalization of the HPTA 1 week after discontinuation of levothyroxine, the HPTA was suppressed for at least 4 weeks after cessation of supplementation in a previous study.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> The assessment of HPTA function using dynamic thyroid testing (TRH and TSH stimulation tests) may account for the difference because endogenous TSH concentrations may be less sensitive than tests of thyroid reserve. In addition, levothyroxine was administered at approximately twice the daily dosage in the previous study compared with the present one.</p><p>A significantly higher mean serum TSH concentration was noted 1, 4, and 8 weeks after withdrawal of levothyroxine in dogs treated for 16 weeks compared with those supplemented for 8 weeks. This is likely the result of thyroid gland atrophy as found in another study<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> caused by suppression of TSH during more prolonged levothyroxine treatment. Because serum thyroid hormone concentrations were not suppressed after ceasing treatment, it is likely the elevated serum TSH concentration stimulated secretion of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> from the thyroid gland sufficient to maintain normal function. This phenomenon has previously been shown histologically by an increase in pituitary thyrotrope number and size with concurrent high activity of the thyroid gland after withdrawal of levothyroxine.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Therefore, levothyroxine administration for longer than 16 weeks may affect thyroid function tests to a greater degree than shorter duration supplementation.</p><p>The investigators chose to administer levothyroxine once daily based on the resolution of clinical abnormalities of hypothyroidism in dogs supplemented in a similar manner.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Although once daily dosing results in more fluctuation in serum T<sub>4</sub> concentrations compared to twice daily dosing, the duration of action of T<sub>4</sub> is longer than its plasma half&#x02010;life.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> In previous studies of the HPTA, dogs were administered levothyroxine twice daily, making comparisons difficult.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>
</p><p>Humans can have marked suppression of the HTPA after thyroid hormone supplementation, with more protracted treatment associated with prolonged recovery that could require many months.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> It might be inappropriate to extrapolate findings in humans to dogs because the half&#x02010;life of T<sub>4</sub> in humans is substantially longer than in dogs, which would cause a greater degree of both thyrotrope and thyroid gland atrophy. Additionally, the magnitude of TSH suppression in hypothyroid dogs supplemented with levothyroxine is directly correlated with the T<sub>4</sub> serum concentration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim14711-note-1009">7</xref> Because the degree of HTPA suppression is dependent on the dose and frequency of levothyroxine administration, this might explain the serum TSH, T<sub>4,</sub> and fT<sub>4</sub> concentrations normalizing within 1 week after cessation of once daily administration of levothyroxine in the present study. Moreover, the findings of the present study cannot be extrapolated to dogs receiving levothyroxine supplementation at a different dose, frequency of administration, duration, type of product or with nonthyroidal illness.</p><p>Shortcomings of the present study are that dogs acted as their own controls and using client owned animals introduced intrinsic differences in environment and husbandry. However, these effects may be more clinically applicable as it closely resembles the practice setting compared to facility owned and housed dogs. Compliance can contribute a variable that might affect hormone concentrations, particularly given the relatively short half&#x02010;life of levothyroxine in the dog. To circumvent this problem, tablets were counted at every recheck appointment, which has been shown to be the most practical assessment of compliance<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> and the overall compliance was 98.4%. Moreover, once a day dosing demonstrates a higher degree of owner compliance compared to twice or 3 times a day dosing.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Additionally, the canine TSH assay is not sufficiently sensitive to determine when TSH is below the reference interval that would indicate excessive supplementation, which makes it difficult to assess the appropriateness of treatment. We used a wide range of acceptable serum T<sub>4</sub> concentrations that others have considered representative of adequate treatment in this study.<xref rid="jvim14711-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In humans where accurate and precise measurement of serum TSH is possible, it is used as a more appropriate marker of tissue thyroid hormone concentrations.</p><p>In conclusion, suppression of the HPTA occurred during levothyroxine supplementation for 8 or 16 weeks, with mean serum T<sub>4</sub>, fT<sub>4</sub> and TSH concentrations returning to the reference interval by 1 week after discontinuation in both groups. It appears that assessing thyroid function tests 1 week after cessation of once daily levothyroxine supplementation will likely provide an accurate assessment of thyroid function in euthyroid dogs that are otherwise healthy.</p></sec><sec id="jvim14711-sec-0018"><sec disp-level="2" id="jvim14711-sec-0019"><p>
