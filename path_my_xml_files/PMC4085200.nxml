using the abdominal drawing-in method on healthy adults&#x02019; lumbar stability. [Subjects] A
total of 30 subjects were divided into a training group of 15 subjects and a control group
of 15 subjects. [Methods] The training group ran in place using the abdominal drawing-in
method for 30 minutes per session, three sessions per week, for a total of six weeks. For
both the training group and the control group, static lumbar stability (SLS) and dynamic
lumbar stability (DLS) were measured before and after the experiment using a pressure
biofeedback unit. [Results] Pre- and post-intervention measurements were compared within
the training group and the control group. According to the results, the training group
showed statistically significant differences in DLS. [Conclusion] Running in place, which
can be performed easily regardless of time and location, can be recommended as an exercise
that will improve the dynamic lumbar stability of students or office workers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Running in place</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stability</kwd><kwd>Pressure biofeedback unit</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lumbar stability enables movements of the limbs by maintaining the vertebrae properly
during postural changes and in loaded states<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. We reviewed previous studies regarding lumbar stability, and noted
that they primarily investigated whether training of the deep muscles, such as the
transversus abdominis muscle and the multifidus muscles, using diverse exercise apparatuses
and methods such as mats, balls, dumbbells, and balance plates in prone or supine positions
could stabilize the vertebrae<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to the
development of industrial society, individuals today exhibit weakened abdominal muscle
strength, poor postures, and body imbalance, because of increasingly sedentary lives and
lack of exercise<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, previous
studies have reported that excessive biomechanical burdens due to sedentary lifestyles lead
to chronic weakening phenomena, such as abdominal muscle atrophy, declining muscle strength,
and vertebral joint instability, thereby causing pain in the regions around the lumbar
vertebrae, reducing endurance, and restricting the range of joint motion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These conditions may eventually even cause
damage to the vertebrae and physical disabilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. To find out how to improve reduced lumbar stability resulting from
modern people&#x02019;s living habits, this study asked participants to run in place with the
transversus abdominis muscle and the multifidus muscles in contracted states.</p><p>Exercises similar to running in place include plyometric training, circuit training, and
core stabilization. Plyometric training is a method widely used to improve power, explosive
motions are performed while working muscles are swiftly switched from extension to
flexion<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Circuit training involves
arranging many exercises or motions selected in advance in order to continuously train many
muscle groups in turn, following the circuit order, without rest between each exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stabilization exercises can maximize
coordination between and within segments to promote the crossing of the lumbar vertebrae and
the sacral vertebrae in the human body. These exercises induce continuous segmental
movements using mats, slings, Swiss balls, etc. to develop an integrated system
ranging from the tip of the toes to the trunk, eventually resulting in muscle strength
increases<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercises commonly
train the core muscles used to maintain the stability of the vertebrae, improving the muscle
strength and flexibility of the trunk<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, plyometric training, circuit training, and core stabilization exercises require
systematic programs implemented under expert guidance. Moreover, they require appropriate
equipment and a proper location. Because of these drawbacks, these exercises are not
suitable for use by students or office workers trying to improve their trunk stability. On
the other hand, running in place can be done easily, regardless of time or place, and is
expected to stabilize the trunk by improving the stability and strength of the core region,
and thus the abdominal muscles. Therefore, in this research, the subjects performed a
running in place exercise, which can be performed easily without requiring tools or
apparatus or being restricted by location, for six weeks. This was done with a view to
improving lumbar stability and examining the changes in the subjects&#x02019; static lumbar
stability (SLS) and dynamic lumbar stability (DLS).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty healthy men and women were selected and randomly assigned to a training group of 15
subjects (1 male, 14 female) who performed the running in place exercise, and a control
group of 15 subjects (1 male, 14 female) who did not carry out this exercise. Those who had
any problems in their muscles, skeleton, or nervous system; those who felt pain in their
lumbar region or pelvis; and those who could not run in place due to pain in their knees or
ankles were excluded from this study. All the subjects understood the purpose of this study
and provided their written informed consent prior to their participation in this study in
accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The training group had a mean age of 21.5&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years, a mean height of 161.5&#x000b1;6.0&#x02005;cm, and a
mean weight of 51.7&#x000b1;6.2&#x02005;kg; the control group had a mean age of 22.2&#x000b1;1.3&#x02005;years, a mean
height of 162.0&#x000b1;5.5&#x02005;cm, and a mean weight of 53.2&#x000b1;5.2&#x02005;kg. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to
analyze the groups with regard to sex, and the independent t-test was used to analyze the
groups with regard to age, height, and weight. These analyses showed no statistically
significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05), indicating that the two groups were homogenous.</p><p>To help the subjects maintain proper positions while running in place, a 30-cm square was
drawn on the floor and each subject was instructed to stand in the center of the square.
Each subject was instructed to straighten his/her back, look straight ahead, pull in the
chin to maintain the position of the cervical vertebrae, and contract the transversus
abdominis and multifidus muscles through abdominal drawing-in to maintain the neutral
position of the lumbar region and the pelvis. Each subject then placed their foot
approximately 10&#x02005;cm apart, bent one knee to 90&#x000b0; to raise it to the height of the hip joint,
and bent the elbow of the arm on the other side of the raised leg to raise the arm so that
the hand was at the height of the eyes. Each subject ran while crossing the arms and legs in
the sagittal plane, and repeated the running a predefined number of times. During the
exercise, each subject was instructed to pay attention to running in place within the limits
of the square while maintaining his/her posture without swinging forward, backward,
leftward, or rightward.</p><p>To set the appropriate exercise intensities for the subjects and apply gradually increasing
loads, two sets were completed during the first and second weeks, and three sets were
completed thereafter until the end of the sixth week. Each set was composed of 20 running in
place motions followed by a rest for 15 sec, 20 running in place motions, a rest for 15 sec,
30 running in place motions, a rest for 20 sec, 30 running in place motions, a rest for 20
sec, and 30 running in place motions. A rest of three minutes was taken after each set, and
one running in place motion was defined as touching the ground once with each foot. The
speed of running in place was designated as 17 motions per 10 seconds. Light stretching for
five minutes was performed as a warm up before the beginning of the main exercise, and as a
cool down after the main exercise. Therefore, one exercise session took 30 minutes. The
exercise was performed three times per week for six weeks. The members of the control group
did not perform any particular exercise and followed their normal daily lives. Like the
training group, their measurements were taken twice.</p><p>To evaluate SLS, the contractile force of the transversus abdominis (TrA) was evaluated
using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU, Chattanooga Group, Australia). The PBU consists of a
non-elastic inflatable bag connected to a pressure gauge. It is a simple piece of equipment
which is used to record and monitor pressure changes during the movements of the
lumbar/pelvic regions. The bag is 16.7&#x000d7;24.0&#x02005;cm and can be used to measure pressure within
the range of 0&#x02013;200 mmHg. Excessive pressure changes during evaluation indicate that the
movements of the lumbar/pelvic regions are not being controlled. To measure SLS, each
subject adopted a prone position on a hard floor and the PBU was placed at the point below
the subject&#x02019;s navel where the anterior superior iliac spines cross each other. The
measurement began with a baseline pressure of 70 mmHg. The subjects pulled in their lower
abdomens maximally without moving the lumbar region of the hip to reduce the pressure and
maintained the same pressure for 10 sec; the change in pressure was recorded. To measure
DLS, subjects performed the bent knee fall out (BKFO), as explained by Comerford and
Mottram<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this measurement, the
PBU was placed vertically below the lumbar vertebrae, 2&#x02005;cm below the posterior superior
iliac spine in a supine position, and folded towels of the same height as the PBU were
placed on both sides of the PBU in order to minimize trunk sway during movement. The
measurement began with a baseline pressure of 40 mmHg. The subject performed abduction of
approximately 45&#x000b0; in a posture in which the hip and knee of one leg were bent and the foot
was placed in contact with the floor, and then returned to the initial posture; the changes
in pressure during the movement were recorded. Higher SLS scores and lower DLS scores
signify better lumbar stability.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed using the SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) statistical
program, and the collected data are presented as means and standard deviations. The
significance of the differences between before and after the experiment in each group was
tested using the paired t-test and the significance of the differences between the two
groups was tested using the independent t-test. The significance level, &#x003b1;, was chosen as
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The pre- and post-intervention measurement results of the training and control groups were

on healthy adults&#x02019; lumbar stability were examined. Running in place can reduce muscle
fatigue and provide loads to diverse muscles to improve the respiratory and circulatory
systems, thereby simultaneously improving aerobic exercise ability and muscle strength. This
exercise is expected to train the core muscles, which are muscle groups in the trunk and
abdomen that maintain the stability of the vertebrae. Previous studies have reported that
the abdominal drawing-in method is effective at increasing the activity of the abdominal
muscles, particularly the transversus abdominis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercises similar to running in place include plyometric training, circuit training, and
core stabilization in which slings, Swiss balls, mats, etc. are used. Many previous studies
have been conducted using these exercises. Myer<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> instructed female high school student athletes to perform
plyometric training and core stabilization exercises three times per week for seven weeks to
prove that these exercises were effective at improving muscle strength and neuromuscular
control. Moreover, Brill<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that
core stabilization exercises could strengthen the lumbar muscles and improve stability by
maintaining the balance of the vertebrae based on the contraction of the transversus
abdominis. Endleman<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> asked 18 healthy
adult females and 8 healthy adult males to perform Pilates for six months, to exercise the
core region intensively, and measured the thicknesses of the transversus abdominis and
obliquus internus abdominis. According to the results, the TrA showed significant
differences, proving that training the core region affected abdominal muscle strengthening
and abdominal stabilization positively. In this study, the pre- and post-intervention
measurement results of the training and control groups were compared. According to the
results, the training group showed statistically significant differences in DLS, while the
control group did not show any statistically significant differences in either SLS or DLS.
These results indicate that the running in place exercise did not affect static lumbar
stability, but did improve dynamic lumbar stability. These results are similar to those of
previous studies indicating that plyometric training, core stabilization exercises, and
Pilates improve trunk muscle strength and lumbar stability. Our results suggest that running
in place improves dynamic stability, particularly lumbar stability, because the running
exercise was performed without swaying in a defined square space while maintaining the
contraction of the transversus abdominis by the abdominal drawing-in method. Although there
are diverse exercise methods to improve lumbar stability, the exercise methods used in
previous studies involved systematic programs carried out under expert guidance and required
appropriate equipment and locations for their performance. In contrast, running in place can
be easily carried out regardless of time or space. Thus, we recommend it is utilized as an
exercise method for improving the dynamic lumbar stability of students or office
workers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Willson</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Dougherty</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ireland</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Core stability and its relationship to lower extremity
