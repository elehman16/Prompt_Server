To provide more insight into pain treatment during the outpatient period, we examined the use of opioid rescue medication (RM) and described the relationship between pain intensity and RM use in patients with acute pain after bunionectomy. Patients received placebo or 25 mg of a liquid-filled capsule version of the NSAID diclofenac potassium (DPLFC; n=188 patients/group) every 6 hours during the 48-hour inpatient period through the end of outpatient dosing on day 4. Opioid RM (hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets, 5 mg/500 mg) was available as needed, but taken at least 1 hour post-study medication. Fewer patients taking DPLFC versus placebo requested opioid RM during the inpatient period (4.8%&#x02013;44.7% versus 25.0%&#x02013;90.4%) and also during the outpatient period (3.7%&#x02013;16.0% versus 13.1%&#x02013;46.4%). Moderate or severe pain after surgery (<italic>P</italic>=0.0307 and <italic>P</italic>=0.0002, respectively) or at second dose (<italic>P</italic>=0.0006 and <italic>P</italic>=0.0002, respectively) was predictive of RM use. Patients taking RM (placebo/DPLFC) reported more adverse events (RM 55.7%/40.6%; no RM 29.4%/26.0%). Most adverse events in the RM group were opioid-related. In summary, this study shows that DPLFC lowers the requirement for opioids, which is associated with a reduction in the occurrence of treatment side effects, while maintaining adequate analgesia for patients with moderate acute pain in both the outpatient and outpatient periods. Patients with more severe pain are more likely to use RM, but they still use fewer opioids when treated with DPLFC. This suggests that multimodal treatment using DPLFC and an opioid may offer an important clinical benefit in the treatment of acute pain, including in the home environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</kwd><kwd>diclofenac</kwd><kwd>opioids</kwd><kwd>opioid sparing</kwd><kwd>acute pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pharmacologic agents most often used in the treatment of acute pain include acetaminophen (known as paracetamol outside of the USA), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The choice between these medications is guided by the intensity of pain. Generally, acetaminophen and NSAIDs are most often used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate pain, with acetaminophen being the least potent, whereas opioids are recommended for the treatment of severe pain or when other treatments have not provided adequate pain relief.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite the availability of effective treatment options, the management of acute pain is often inadequate and remains an ongoing challenge.<xref rid="b5-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> To address a problem of undertreated pain, the availability of opioids as the preferred treatment has expanded, but has also provided further opportunities for opioid abuse.<xref rid="b4-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Indeed, the misuse and diversion of prescription opioids has reached epidemic levels,<xref rid="b7-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with hydrocodone and oxycodone being the two most often used and abused opioids in general medicine.<xref rid="b8-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> To resolve the issues of undertreated pain and opioid abuse, balanced pain management plans with better utilization of nonopioid agents are needed.</p><p>There is good evidence that, when used in multimodal analgesia during the perioperative period, NSAIDs may reduce the requirement for opioids, thus reducing adverse effects while providing adequate analgesic effect.<xref rid="b10-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, there is little evidence for an opioid-sparing effect of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain in the outpatient setting. This is especially an issue because unsupervised use of opioids faces important challenges, including inappropriate use and/or overuse of opioids after discharge. In addition, patients are likely to be more active in the home environment, which may elevate pain and thus increase use of analgesics.<xref rid="b14-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Also, some patients with acute pain may use opioids for longer than is necessary and develop prolonged postoperative use of opioids after discharge.<xref rid="b15-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> One barrier to dealing with these issues is our poor understanding of how effective NSAIDs are in the treatment of acute postoperative pain post discharge, and how much they may reduce the use of opioids.</p><p>A considerable number of NSAIDs with proven efficacy and safety are currently available for prescription and nonprescription treatment of acute pain, and diclofenac is one of the most widely used.<xref rid="b16-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A low-dose formulation of diclofenac, ie, diclofenac potassium liquid-filled capsules (DPLFCs, 25 mg; Zipsor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Depomed, Inc., Newark, CA, USA), was developed to improve the speed and predictability of diclofenac absorption.

Throughout both bunionectomy studies, use of opioid rescue medication (RM, hydrocodone/acetaminophen tablets) was allowed and documented. To comprehensively characterize the use of opioid RM in patients with post-bunionectomy pain treated with DPLFC versus placebo during the inpatient and outpatient periods, and to describe the relationship between pain intensity and opioid RM use, we analyzed pooled data from the two Phase III studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;65 years who underwent primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy with or without hammertoe repair and internal fixation and had a pain intensity score at rest of &#x02265;4 on a 0&#x02013;10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS; where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain) were enrolled in the studies. Patients were excluded if, following surgery up to the initial dose of study medication, they had taken NSAIDs or opioids that were not specified in the protocol. Patients were also excluded if they had a known allergy or hypersensitivity to diclofenac or other NSAIDs, aspirin, opioids (including hydrocodone or codeine), or acetaminophen.

The outpatient dosing period began upon patient discharge on the morning of day 3, continued through the end of day 4 when patients took the last dose of study medication, and ended on the morning of day 5 (or upon early termination) when patients made the final assessment of their pain intensity on the NPRS and returned to the clinic for the final visit.</p><p>Surgery on day 0 was performed using Mayo block of the first metatarsal with local anesthesia, propofol for intravenous sedation during surgery, and if clinically indicated, fentanyl, morphine, or midazolam. Following surgery, patients received routine standard of care, ie, use of ice packs was allowed on days 0 and 1, but was discontinued at least 1 hour before randomization and not permitted thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-053">Figure 1</xref>). Hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 500 mg (one to two tablets every 4&#x02013;6 hours) was permitted for analgesia but was to be discontinued &#x02265;4 hours prior to randomization.</p><p>The next morning (day 1), patients with a pain intensity score at rest (no activity of the affected toe for &#x02265;10 minutes prior to assessment) of &#x02265;4 on the NPRS were randomized to receive DPLFC 25 mg or matching placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-053">Figure 1</xref>). The second dose of study medication, which marked the beginning of the 48-hour inpatient period, was administered 8 hours after the initial single dose or earlier if the patient was not experiencing adequate pain relief (patients were encouraged to delay the second dose of study drug until 1 hour after the first dose). Following the second dose, patients received the study medication every 6 hours throughout the inpatient period (no more than four doses in 24 hours were allowed). During this period, patients could request opioid RM (the same medication that was used before randomization): hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 500 mg, one to two tablets every 4&#x02013;6 hours as needed, with a maximum of eight tablets per day (patients were encouraged to wait at least 1 hour after receiving the study medication before requesting opioid RM). Patients who took opioid RM recorded their pain intensity and the number of tablets taken. Subsequent doses of study medication were taken on schedule.</p><p>After dose 10 of the study medication, on the morning of day 3, patients were discharged from the clinic (start of the outpatient period), and self-administered the study medication every 6 hours until the end of day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-053">Figure 1</xref>). Patients were provided with opioid RM to be taken on the same schedule as during the inpatient period.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments of efficacy and safety</title><p>Efficacy assessments included pain intensity and use of opioid RM. Pain intensity scores using the NPRS were obtained at the time of study drug administration (ie, every 6 hours), 3 hours after study drug administration, and at the time of any administration of opioid RM. Baseline pain intensity was the last pain intensity score obtained before study drug dosing on day 1. For the use of opioid RM, the number of patients, time, and number of tablets for each dose was determined. Assessments were transcribed onto the case report form during the 48-hour inpatient period, and recorded via an interactive voice response system during the outpatient period. If patients failed to record their information within the specified time period, the interactive voice response system telephoned them and provided a recorded reminder that study information had not been reported. The final NPRS assessment via the interactive voice response system was performed on the morning of day 5.</p><p>Safety assessments included the incidence and severity of AEs and serious AEs, analysis of discontinuations due to AEs, clinical laboratory assessments of serum chemistry and hematology, vital signs, and findings on physical examination. AEs were collected from the time of randomization throughout the study, with the last assessment on day 5 when patients returned to the clinic for the final visit. All AEs were classified according to the System Organ Class and Preferred Term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Baseline safety assessments were performed at the screening visit, within the 21 days prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data from two studies of the analgesic effect of DPLFC in patients with post-bunionectomy pain were integrated prior to this analysis. All patients who received study drug, regardless of whether they recorded a post-dose NPRS score, and who had no major protocol violation that could influence efficacy were included in the efficacy population. The safety population included all patients who received study drug. For the analyses, patients were assigned to one of two subgroups: patients who took opioid RM at any time of the study and patients who did not take opioid RM. For analysis of predictive factors for using opioid RM, patients were assigned to two subgroups: patients with a baseline NPRS score of 4&#x02013;6 (moderate pain) and patients with a baseline NPRS score of 7&#x02013;10 (severe pain); there were no patients with a baseline NPRS score of 1&#x02013;3 (mild pain).</p><p>The proportion of patients who used versus did not use opioid RM was analyzed using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013; Haenszel test with pooled site as strata. One-way analysis of variance with treatment as a factor was used to analyze number of administrations and amount of opioid RM. The Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test with pooled site as strata was used to analyze NPRS scores at various time points for patients who used opioid RM versus those who did not use opioid RM during the 48-hour inpatient period. For analysis of predictive factors, the odds ratio (OR) estimates, confidence intervals (CIs), and <italic>P</italic>-values were from a logistic regression model for the event of using opioid RM. Independent variables in the model were age, sex, race, pain score at baseline, change in pain score from baseline to dose 2, duration of surgery, and time from end of surgery to dosing. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline demographic and disease characteristics. For analysis of AEs, patients who had more than one AE within a System Organ Class and patients who had more than one AE assigned to the same Preferred Term were counted once.

Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the DPLFC and placebo groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-053">Table 1</xref>). Before randomization to receive DPLFC 25 mg or matching placebo, almost all patients (99.5%) used opioid RM (stopped &#x02265;4 hours before randomization), and the majority used ice packs (75.8%; stopped at least 1 hour before randomization). The mean baseline pain score was 7.3, with 66.8% of patients reporting severe (NPRS score &#x02265;7) pain at baseline, and 33.2% of patients reporting moderate (NPRS score 4&#x02013;6) pain at baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-053">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Use of rescue medication</title><p>After surgery, during both the inpatient and outpatient periods, significantly fewer patients treated with DPLFC requested opioid RM compared with patients treated with placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-8-053">Figure 2A</xref>).

For the DPLFC group, the AEs experienced most frequently by patients using opioid RM versus not using opioid RM included nausea (20.8% versus 5.0%), vomiting (10.9% versus 1.0%), headache (9.9% versus 3.0%), dizziness (5.9% versus 1.0%), constipation (5.9% versus 2.0%), and somnolence (4.0% versus 2.0%).</p><p>The incidence of AEs decreased over time for all patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-jpr-8-053">Figure 4</xref>).

Two serious AEs (severe knee pain and left leg deep vein thrombosis) were reported, both in patients treated with placebo and taking opioid RM, and neither was considered related to the study drug (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-8-053">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although opioids are associated with risks for abuse, addiction, and diversion that have resulted in tighter legal regulations regarding their prescription and distribution, their use, especially in outpatient settings, continues to increase.<xref rid="b24-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Concurrently, opioid-related overdoses and deaths remain a widespread concern.<xref rid="b26-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Thus, better management of acute pain exploiting nonopioid agents with distinct mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety is desirable.</p><p>NSAIDs, which are very effective on somatic and breakthrough pain, are one of the most common nonopioid analgesics used for management of postoperative pain.<xref rid="b12-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b27-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Although NSAIDs do not provide sufficient analgesia for severe pain, they are one of the primary agents recommended for multimodal management of acute pain, which includes administration of two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms.<xref rid="b28-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> When used in multimodal treatment during the perioperative period, NSAIDs can reduce the use of opioids, can potentially improve analgesia, and/or reduce opioid-related adverse effects.<xref rid="b11-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b29-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs provides additional benefit for multimodal use with opioids in the short-term management of severe acute pain.<xref rid="b12-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> To better understand the use of NSAIDs and their potential opioid-sparing effect in the treatment of acute pain in the outpatient setting, the current study analyzed the outcomes of treatment of acute, post-bunionectomy pain with DPLFC before and after discharge.</p><p>DPLFC alone appeared to be sufficient to provide adequate pain relief for patients with moderate pain at baseline during both the inpatient and outpatient periods. When used with opioid RM, it provided a significantly greater reduction in pain intensity over time when compared with opioid RM used alone by patients in the placebo group. Significantly fewer patients treated with DPLFC requested opioid RM compared with patients treated with placebo during both the inpatient and outpatient periods. Patients who reported slightly more severe pain at baseline were more likely to request an opioid RM, and continued to use it although their pain intensity scores diminished to moderate and mild levels over time. Consistent with these observations, pain intensity at baseline and early pain relief (change in pain intensity from baseline to dose 2) were significant predictors of using opioid RM in patients treated with DPLFC. Predictors of opioid use for patients treated with placebo included pain intensity scores as well as patient demographics (female sex and non-Caucasian race). However, most of these predictors, especially patient demographics, were not consistent for all patients versus patients divided by the severity of their pain, and had a wide 95% CI, indicating a low confidence level of these predictors and thus little knowledge about their true effect on opioid use by patients in the placebo group. Together, these results indicate that pain intensity is the key driver for use of opioid RM in patients with acute pain, and patients with moderate pain can receive adequate pain treatment with an NSAID alone. The ability of individual patients to tolerate pain and/or what type of analgesic they are accustomed to are important factors, since many patients continued using opioid RM over time, even though their pain intensity levels decreased to mild levels. Better patient education, especially in regard to self-treatment after discharge, will likely further reduce the use of opioids and improve the quality of pain management at home.</p><p>Treatment of acute pain in the home environment poses various challenges. Patients are more active and are self-treating without the supervision of a health care professional, which may result in increased, inappropriate, and/or prolonged use of analgesics.<xref rid="b14-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b31-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Indeed, in the current analysis, use of both opioid RM and DPLFC increased after discharge compared with the last day before discharge. Importantly, after discharge, patients treated with DPLFC experienced adequate pain relief while still using less opioid RM than patients treated with placebo. These results show a clinically important opioid-sparing effect of DPLFC in patients self-treating postoperative acute pain under unsupervised conditions, suggesting that when informed about potential benefits of multimodal treatment using an NSAID and an opioid, they may receive better quality treatment in the home environment, minimizing potential opioid misuse and long-term complications.<xref rid="b14-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b31-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>By reducing consumption of opioid RM, DPLFC reduced the incidence of AEs. Most common AEs associated with opioids (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and constipation) were significantly diminished in patients treated with DPLFC who did not use opioid RM compared with patients who used opioid RM, which is an important clinical benefit. It is important to note, however, that all analgesic agents carry various levels of risk for adverse effects, some potentially serious. NSAIDs are associated with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal AEs.<xref rid="b32-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Potentially serious AEs of opioids include sedation, respiratory depression, and cognitive and motor impairment, as well as other concerns including dependence and addiction.<xref rid="b7-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b25-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b33-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It may be argued that NSAIDs do not incur the same degree of risk as opioids, which are associated with a spectrum of concerns, side effects representing just one of them. Therefore, the potential of NSAIDs such as DPLFC to lower the requirement for opioids while maintaining an adequate analgesic effect offers a range of clinical benefits in the treatment of acute pain.<xref rid="b3-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b10-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jpr-8-053" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the wide spectrum of concerns associated with opioids, including their growing misuse and diversion, better management of acute pain with nonopioid analgesics is of vital importance. Although opioids currently play a leading role in the management of moderate-to-severe pain, NSAIDs (including DPLFC) can provide analgesic benefit, and the multimodal use of NSAIDS and opioids will continue assuming a greater role, especially in the outpatient setting. This is especially important given that patients in the unsupervised environment at home are at higher risk of increased, inappropriate, and/or prolonged use of opioids. No analgesic approach is without risk, but a well-balanced approach using the most effective interventions, while minimizing the risk of harm, will improve recovery profiles for patients with acute pain, including in the home environment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>IB and SB are employees and shareholders of Depomed, Inc., which funded this research.
