The incidence of cesarean section is as high as 25-30% in many areas of the world.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Delivery by cesarean section can cause more complications than normal vaginal delivery. The most common complications documented are primary and secondary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] These in turn increase maternal mortality, the incidence being as high as 20%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] It is a well-known fact that these complications as well as maternal mortality statistics are quite higher in the developing world. Maternal mortality rates in India are estimated at 560/100,000 live births and PPH accounts for 35-56% of these deaths.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Anemia, with its very high prevalence, adds to this mortality. In India, anemia is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of maternal deaths.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] PPH also contributes to morbidity because patients may require blood transfusion with its inherent hazards. Approximately, 1% of women with spontaneous vaginal deliveries receive a blood transfusion, but the rate increases to about 5% for women undergoing lower segment cesarean section (LSCS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] A loss of up to 800-1000 ml is seen on an average during LSCS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] A major contributing factor to this loss is placental delivery, which is known to cause a hyperfibrinolytic state.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] In developing countries like India where prevalence of anemia is as high as 70%, this loss could lead to serious morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent, which causes reversible and competitive blockade of the lysine binding sites in plasminogen molecules. It is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and its action is to reduce blood loss. TXA is widely in use in the field of obstetrics. Both antepartum and PPH are being treated by TXA extensively. In their study, Ducloy-Bouthors <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated for the first time that TXA administered to women with overt PPH decreases blood loss and maternal morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Prevention of PPH is another indication where TXA has been used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Varied doses of TXA ranging from 1 mg/kg to more than 100 mg/kg have been used in various surgeries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Even in studies involving LSCS, the doses used were either a bolus of 1 gm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] or 10 mg/kg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] intravenously.</p><p>In this study, two doses of TXA were compared with placebo to compare their efficacy and safety profile in anemic parturients undergoing LSCS. The prophylactic blood sparing effect of TXA in both the intra-operative and post-operative period (PPH) was evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval from the hospital ethical committee, this monocentre double-blind randomized, case controlled prospective trial was conducted from the year of 2009 to 2011. Inclusion criteria were ASA grade I and II patients, age more than 18 years and anemic patients with hemoglobin 7-10 g%. Any patient belonging to ASA physical status III and IV; patients having a history of coagulopathy or thrombo-embolism, or both; patients who had received Acenocoumerol or platelet antiaggregant such as Aspirin in the week before surgery or NonSteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) 2 days before surgery; patients having pre-operative plasma creatinine greater than 130 &#x003bc;mol/L; patients having a history of Myocardial Infarction (MI) or chronic arteriopathy or unstable angina in the previous 12 months; patients with the mental status preventing them from understanding the study prospectus; patients having a history of renal or hepatic impairment or any hypersensitivity to TXA and any patient refusing to be a participant were excluded from the study. No support from any pharmaceutical company was taken for this study.</p><p>After a detailed pre-anesthetic evaluation of selected patients, laboratory tests including hemoglobin level, hematocrit, blood sugar (fasting), electrocardiogram, blood urea, serum creatinine, prothrombin time, and International Normalised Ratio (INR) were carried out. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were ascertained for every patient on the day before surgery in the hospital laboratory. LSCS was carried out under subarachnoid block using 2-2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine after an informed written consent. Blockade up to T4-T6 level was considered adequate level of anesthesia. After delivery of the neonate, 20 unit of oxytocin in 500 ml normal saline were given at the rate of 8 mU/min intravenously.</p><p>All consenting patients were recruited as a consecutive series to one of the three study groups of 30 patients each, on the basis of block random allocation protocol. Neither the patient nor the investigator was aware of the group assignment. An anesthesiologist not related to the study prepared the drug for every patient.</p><p>Groups were labeled as follows:</p><p>Group C (30) &#x02013; 5 ml of distilled water in 20 ml of 5% dextrose</p><p>Group T1 (30) &#x02013; TXA in the dose of 10 mg/kg in 20 ml of 5% dextrose</p><p>Group T2 (30) &#x02013; TXA in the dose of 15 mg/kg in 20 ml of 5% dextrose.</p><p>The drug in all the groups was given intravenously over 20 min before skin incision.</p><p>Monitoring of the pulse rate, blood pressure, Pulse Oximetry (SpO2) and Electrocardiograph (ECG) was carried out every 2 min up to 10 min of starting the study drug; then every 5 min until the delivery of baby and thereafter every 15 min until the end of the surgery. Blood loss was measured intra-operatively and post-operatively up to 24 h. All material such as sponges, mops, pads, and drapes were weighed with an electronic weighing scale before and at the end of surgery. Volume of blood in the suction bottle was considered only after the placental delivery, to exclude any amniotic fluid volume. The quantity of intra-operative blood loss (ml) = (weight of the abdominal swabs and drapes after LSCS &#x02013; weight of materials prior to LSCS) + (the volume in the suction bottle after placental delivery in ml). Post-operative blood loss was measured by weighing and numbering the vaginal pads used by the patient after completion of LSCS 2 hourly up to 6 h and then 6 hourly up to 24 h.</p><p>Uterine contractility, placental separation, neonatal condition and any side effect caused by TXA were noted. Intramuscular methylergometrine would be used as a rescue uterotonic treatment when required. Post-operative hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum creatinine, prothrombin time, and INR values were recorded at 24 h. All the parturients were encouraged to start early leg exercises and ambulation in the post-operative period.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on a pilot study so as to keep the power of study more than 0.80. Demographic data were compared using the Chi-square test. To compare quantitative data between two groups <italic>t</italic>-test was used although ANOVA was used for more than two groups. To compare the mean for non-parametric data between two groups Mann-Whitney test was used, although Kruskal-Wallis test was used in case of more than two groups. Probability values were considered significant when values were 0.05 or less.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Excepted sample size was 30 patients each in all the three groups.

On searching for similar literature, we found a few studies where TXA has been used in LSCS patients. It has been found to be useful in PPH also, a Cochrane review (2011) regarding this being ample evidence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Various doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to more than 100 mg/kg have been used in various surgeries as we have already discussed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] A double-blind randomized clinical trial by Karski <italic>et al</italic>. used TXA pre-operatively for prevention of bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass in a very high dose of 10 g intravenously over 20 min before sternotomy followed by another 10 g infused intravenously over 5 h.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Even in studies involving LSCS cases, the doses used were either a bolus of 1gm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] or 10 mg/kg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] intravenously. 15 mg/kg doses were used in other surgeries like arthroplasties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The time of administration of the drug in relation to the incision also varied in the different studies. Horrow <italic>et al</italic>. used prophylactic TXA in the dose range of 2.5-40 mg/kg in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries and concluded that the dose of 10 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg/h decreased bleeding after extracorporeal circulation. Larger doses did not provide additional hemostatic benefit in the study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In the study by Karski <italic>et al</italic>. too, a high dose of infusion at the rate of 10 g intravenously over 5 h after a bolus of 10 g showed no additional benefit over placebo infusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Placental delivery being a hyperfibrinolytic state, we decided to conduct a study using two doses of TXA in anemic parturients undergoing LSCS. In this study, there was a significant reduction in blood loss in both the groups using TXA when compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic>=0.00). When the two groups using the TXA, that is group T1 (10 mg/kg) and T2 (15 mg/kg), were compared the difference in reduction of blood loss was again significant, the mean reduction being 115&#x000b1;24 ml. <italic>T</italic>-test was used to analyze this and the <italic>P</italic> value was 0.00. Hence, the inference can be made that 15 mg/kg dose was more efficacious in reducing blood loss during LSCS. Previous studies attempting to find the reduction in blood loss after use of TXA in LSCS and vaginal delivery cases found it to be in the range of 32.5 ml to 92 ml.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Changes in the hemoglobin and hematocrit values in the post-operative period were significantly less in the groups using TXA. Similar finding was shown in a randomized control trial by Sekhavat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] in patients undergoing LSCS in 2009. Blood transfusion requirements were also significantly reduced by both doses of the drug. Postpartum anemia is a public health problem with massive proportions in the world over &#x02013; more so in developing countries like India. This study was conducted in the anemic subgroup of parturients and proved to be a very useful drug to prevent blood loss in these particular patients undergoing LSCS. These blood sparing effects of TXA would definitely be useful in reducing transfusion requirements in the anemic subgroup in which the incidence of transfusion generally tends to be high.</p><p>A study by Movafegh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] in 2011, found that the total oxytocin administration after the delivery of the fetus was less in the TXA group when compared to the control group. This finding was not measured in the present study. Like a similar study by Gungorduk <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] more additional uterotonic agents were needed in the control group in this study also. On cost analysis, TXA use was found to be much more cost-effective in comparison to blood transfusion.</p><p>There were a few limitations in this study. The blood loss that we calculated in our study did not include the amount collected in suction bottle before the placental delivery and hence the volume calculated would definitely be slightly less than the actual loss. Almost all similar studies that we came across have excluded the loss in suction bottle before placental delivery to exclude the amniotic fluid volume. Furthermore, the duration of surgeries in T2 group was significantly higher. The reason for this could be attributed to the fact that the skill and experience of the surgeons varied immensely. Blood loss, on the other hand, was significantly lower in this group in comparison to bothT1 and control group. This could mean that even though the chances of blood loss were increased with the longer duration of surgery, the 15 mg/kg dose was capable of reducing it with no significant increase in adverse events. The third problem that we saw in our study was that anemic patients are more prone to be encountered in unsupervised emergency LSCS cases. However, the timing of administration of the drug that was followed in our study would not be appropriate in cases like fetal distress where emergency LSCS has to be carried out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this study, TXA in doses of 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, was found to be effective in significantly reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in anemic parturients undergoing LSCS. A good safety profile was seen for both the doses. 15 mg/kg dose was more efficacious and without any undue increase in adverse events. Postpartum anemia is a public health problem with massive proportions in the world over &#x02013; more so in developing countries like India. Hence, TXA could prove to be a very useful drug to prevent blood loss in patients undergoing LSCS, especially in the anemic subgroup where transfusion requirements can be brought down significantly. Further studies would however be useful and required to corroborate these findings with different doses of TXA and time of prophylactic administration of this drug in cases of LSCS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital.
