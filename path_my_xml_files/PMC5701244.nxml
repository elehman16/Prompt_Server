Here, we report this first-in-humans clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a repeat dose of NRPT (commercially known as Basis). NRPT was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study in a population of 120 healthy adults between the ages of 60 and 80 years. The study consisted of three treatment arms: placebo, recommended dose of NRPT (NRPT 1X), and double dose of NRPT (NRPT 2X). All subjects took their blinded supplement daily for eight weeks. Analysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in whole blood demonstrated that NRPT significantly increases the concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> in a dose-dependent manner. NAD<sup>+</sup> levels increased by approximately 40% in the NRPT 1X group and approximately 90% in the NRPT 2X group after 4 weeks as compared to placebo and baseline. Furthermore, this significant increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels was sustained throughout the entire 8-week trial. NAD<sup>+</sup> levels did not increase for the placebo group during the trial. No serious adverse events were reported in this study. This study shows that a repeat dose of NRPT is a safe and effective way to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels sustainably.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Natural compounds restore NAD+ levels in humans</title><p id="Par2">It&#x02019;s possible to boost declining levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>, a molecule required for fundamental chemical reactions in the human body, with a dietary supplement.

Metabolic function is dependent on critical choreography between coenzymes and signal transducing proteins acting as integral metabolism sensors. A prime example is the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), and the family of proteins called sirtuins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> NAD<sup>+</sup> has a canonical role in facilitating hydrogen transfer in key metabolic pathways, such as the conversion of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH for mitochondrial metabolism and subsequent ATP synthesis, which is the energy currency of cells. The sirtuin family of enzymes (SIRT1-7) are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylases and key regulators of aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Beyond acting as a cosubstrate for sirtuins, NAD<sup>+</sup> is also a cosubstrate for other key enzymes, notably poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), which are involved in DNA repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes are involved in a wide range of activities including DNA damage repair, mitochondrial function, chromosomal integrity, gene expression, epigenetic and posttranslational modifications, and calcium signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Importantly, when NAD<sup>+</sup> is used as a cosubstrate it is consumed (hydrolyzed), which necessitates constant cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis through pathways that begin with precursors found in the diet, notably vitamin B3<sub>.</sub> There are several forms of vitamin B3: nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR has emerged as an efficient vitamin B3 NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Specifically, when NR was examined head-to-head with NA and NAM in mice, NR exhibited unique pharmacokinetics that resulted in significantly higher peak NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations in the liver as well as producing significantly higher levels of several intermediate NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors including NMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par4">Numerous studies have demonstrated that NAD<sup>+</sup> levels decrease with age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> including two human studies that report reduced levels in the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> As NAD<sup>+</sup> levels decline with age, NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors may have significant value in raising such levels and maintaining robust health. The efficacy of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors in preventing age-related health problems has been borne out in several recent animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> One study demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of aging, was caused by declining NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in old animals leading to a breakdown of communication between the nucleus and the mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Remarkably, one week of NMN administration in old mice was shown to reverse the observed mitochondrial dysfunction in a manner requiring the sirtuin, SIRT1.</p><p id="Par5">In another study, NR was shown to reverse the decline in the number and function of adult stem cells in old wild-type mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> NR was also shown to significantly increase the lifespan of these animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Extension of lifespan and health span by NR was also demonstrated in a mouse with DNA repair defects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> including a model of Ataxia Telangiectasia, in which the ATM gene was knocked out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> In these models, NR replenishment of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels led to improved quality of mitochondria and enhanced DNA repair.</p><p id="Par6">NR treatment has also been shown to boost oxidative metabolism in mice and to protect them from high-fat diet-induced obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> NR-supplemented mice challenged with a high-fat diet did not gain as much weight as the control mice, and displayed increased oxidation of fatty acids, improved insulin sensitivity and increased energy expenditure. In addition, NR increased mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle tissue and enhanced the endurance performance of these animals. Furthermore, mice supplemented with NR showed increased capacity to maintain body temperature during cold exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par7">NAMPT is the rate-limiting step in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, which generates NAD<sup>+</sup> by combining nicotinamide and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. Muscle-specific NAMPT knockout mice showed an 85% decline in intramuscular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and accelerated age-related muscle degeneration resulting in a loss of strength and endurance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Similarly, old wild-type mice also showed reduced levels of NAMPT and muscle decline. Administration of NR rapidly ameliorated the aging-triggered muscle degeneration resulting in increased strength and endurance in both the NAMPT knockout and old wild-type mice. Furthermore, NR was shown to be more efficient than NAM in this model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par8">The first human clinical trial using NR, a crossover study on twelve healthy adults, demonstrated that a single dose of NR significantly increased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in blood over a 24-hour period. This study also showed increases in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolome over this time course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> However, the question remained whether increases in NAD<sup>+</sup> could be sustained over longer time courses by daily administration of NR.</p><p id="Par9">NRPT is a combination of NR and pterostilbene (PT), a naturally occurring analog of the polyphenol resveratrol, which has been found to be a potent SIRT1 activator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Despite the reported physiological beneficial effect of resveratrol, its bioavailability in humans is poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> PT exhibits greater bioavailability due to the presence of two methoxy groups that allow it to have increased lipophilic and oral absorption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as well as a longer half-life due to reduced oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Based on these considerations, the combination of NR and pterostilbene is predicted to synergistically support metabolic health through NR providing NAD<sup>+</sup> to all seven sirtuins and pterostilbene providing additional activation of SIRT1. Sirtuins are known to mediate responses to nutritional and environmental signals including the beneficial health effects of calorie restriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> In addition, NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent activation of sirtuins regulates important physiological processes such as circadian rhythm, glucose and fat metabolism, and normal aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par10">Therefore, we investigated the safety and tolerability of NRPT as well as its efficacy in sustaining elevated NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in an initial randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 120 heathy adults between the ages of 60 and 80. This trial represents the first repeat dose trial for NR as well as the first test of the combination of NR and PT in humans.

A GLP-compliant method was developed to analyze NAD<sup>+</sup> from human whole-blood lysates by Liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the placebo group showed no increase of NAD<sup>+</sup> over the 60-day treatment period. However, NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations did significantly increase in a dose-dependent manner at 30 days; NAD<sup>+</sup> levels increased approximately 40% in the NRPT 1X group and approximately 90% in the NRPT 2X group relative to baseline (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The 40% increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration observed in the NRPT 1X group was sustained at 60 days.

There were no changes relative to baseline at day 30 or 60 in heart rate or blood pressure in any group except in the NRPT 1X group, where diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly at day 60 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>NRPT and mobility</title><p id="Par18">To assess mobility in the study, a 30-second chair stand test and 6-minute walk test were employed. The 30-second chair stand test is used to determine lower body strength in an elderly population where higher numbers are considered beneficial to the individual. The 6-minute walk test measures distance (in meters) an individual can walk at a normal pace for 6&#x02009;min. Interestingly, the NRPT 2X group showed a significant within-group increase in mobility in both the 30-s chair test (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) and the 6-min walk test (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S6</xref>) at 60 days compared to baseline. There were no differences observed in the placebo or NRPT 1X group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>NRPT and other blood markers</title><p id="Par19">After 60 days of daily supplementation, there was no significant difference between groups in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters in participants. Specifically, no significant differences between NRPT 1X, NRPT 2X or placebo were observed in hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, RBC, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, counts of platelet, neutrophil, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, or basophils. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride) concentration and kidney function, as measured by creatinine, was similar between groups throughout the study (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>NRPT and lipids</title><p id="Par20">Analysis of lipids showed across group differences in triglycerides, but this was entirely due to a decline in the placebo group at day 30 and day 60. Levels of triglycerides within the NRPT 1X and NRPT 2X group showed no significant changes from baseline at day 30 or day 60. The decrease in triglycerides in the placebo group at day 60 compared to baseline resulted in a significant difference between the placebo and the NRPT 1X group at day 60 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol showed within-group increases at day 30 (NRPT 2X) and day 60 (NRPT 1X and NRPT 2X) compared to baseline. The increase in total cholesterol in the NRPT 1X group compared to the placebo group was not significant at day 30 or day 60. The increase in LDL cholesterol in the NRPT 1X group compared to the placebo group was approximately 3% at day 30 and 3.5% at day 60. Larger increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were observed in the NRPT 2X group. However, there were significant across group differences in total and LDL cholesterol at baseline mainly due to lower levels in the placebo group, confounding the interpretation of the study data.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Lipid profile of participants at baseline (Day 0), day 30, and day 60 in the ITT population (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;118)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Placebo</th><th>NRPT 1X</th><th>NRPT 2X</th><th>Between group</th></tr><tr><th/><th>Mean &#x000b1;SD (<italic>n</italic>)</th><th>Mean &#x000b1;SD (<italic>n</italic>)</th><th>Mean &#x000b1;SD (<italic>n</italic>)</th><th>

Earlier studies involving a small number of subjects vouched for the safety of the ingredients of NRPT separately, but were not placebo-controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> This rigorous, larger trial showed that AEs were mild and distributed across the NRPT and placebo groups. Thus, NRPT is deemed to be well tolerated. The major efficacy endpoint of the trial was NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration, which drives activities of sirtuins and many other processes that promote cellular health and decline with age. Thus, an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> stands as a key component of how NRPT is envisaged to improve human health. In a small trial of 12 subjects, a single dose of NR was found to raise NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in white blood cells over a time course of several hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Our trial monitored NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in whole blood at day 0 (baseline), day 30, and day 60. There was a robust 40% (NRPT 1X) and 90% (NRPT 2X) increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> at day 30 over baseline, and this was fully sustained at day 60 in the NRPT 1X group and partially declined to 55% over baseline in the NRPT 2X group. The placebo group did not show changes in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. It is not clear why the NRPT 2X group showed the partial decline at 60 days, but it is possible that extraordinarily high levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> can induce homeostatic mechanisms to restrain further increases. One possible mechanism is induction of NAD<sup>+</sup> degrading enzymes, such as CD38.</p><p id="Par23">A previous report has established that NR is metabolized similarly to nicotinamide in humans with the exception of two additional metabolites generated by NR; namely NAMN and NAAD (both known NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, NR exhibits a similar toxicity profile to nicotinamide in rats at very high doses (e.g., 3000&#x02009;mg/kg NR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Since nicotinamide has been studied as a dietary supplement in humans for decades, excellent safety data on long term use is available. The EU Scientific Committee on Food has established an upper limit of 900&#x02009;mg/day as safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Thus, the nicotinamide safety information coupled with our safety data presented here demonstrates that consumption of NR is safe for daily use at reasonable doses.</p><p id="Par24">A series of blood parameters were also measured in all subjects, and most showed no significant changes during the trial. However, three measurements did show differences that reached statistical significance. First, diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced at day 60 in the NRPT 1X group. This finding is consistent with an earlier small trial showing that pterostilbene alone caused a small decrease in diastolic blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Second, the liver enzyme ALT showed a significant decrease in the NRPT 1X group at both day 30 and day 60. A second liver enzyme, AST, showed the same trend at both day 30 and day 60, which did not reach significance. Third, a small increase in total and LDL cholesterol was observed in the NRPT 1X group at day 60 (about 3% over placebo) and larger increases in the NRPT 2X groups. When subjects were stratified by BMI, changes in cholesterol in the NRPT 1X group were absent in the normal BMI subgroup and were confined to the overweight subgroup. One confounding factor in interpreting the cholesterol data is that subjects showed significant differences in total and LDL cholesterol at baseline, due to the vagaries in the randomization of subjects. Furthermore, the normal biological variation for LDL for an individual has been estimated to be 9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Thus, it is possible only natural variations in LDL were observed in this trial.</p><p id="Par25">Changes in the liver enzymes and cholesterol biosynthesis draw our attention to possible effects of NRPT on the liver. One possibility is that NRPT 1X improves liver health (e.g., by reducing hepatocyte cell death) and the healthier liver shows improved functions, including modestly more synthesis of cholesterol. It is unclear if the small increase in LDL cholesterol is due to an increase in particle size, which would be benign with regards to cardiovascular health. As an example, omega-3-fatty acids raise LDL cholesterol via increases in particle size, but may be beneficial for cardiovascular health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Determination of apoB and apoC3 levels may shed light on this question. Another possibility for the small increases in cholesterol relates to the known function of SIRT1 in promoting reverse cholesterol transport from cells. If NRPT 1X upregulates SIRT1 as expected, an increase in reverse cholesterol transport (e.g., export from cells) could account for the slightly higher levels of cholesterol in blood. In this case, the prognosis would be positive, since lower cholesterol in macrophages should slow their progression to foam cells, which are the initiators of atherosclerotic plaques. Future trials will be necessary to determine whether the cholesterol (and ALT) effects are reproducible.</p><p id="Par26">With respect to mobility, the finding that NRPT 2X group demonstrated significant increase in both the 30-second chair stand and the 6-min walk test at 60 days suggests that prolonged supplementation with NRPT may support overall muscle health and/or energy in an older population. While encouraging, further study is warranted to elucidate mechanisms behind this observed increase in mobility. These studies would include a larger study population observed for a longer period of time to reduce the possibility of seeing correlations by chance.</p><p id="Par27">A tangible strength of this study is in the demonstration that NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in whole blood can be significantly increased in humans in a safe and sustainable way by oral supplementation with NRPT. Limitations of this study include that only an older population was examined and that potentially promising results from secondary and exploratory endpoints (with the exception of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels) were not sufficiently powered to make unequivocal conclusions. Still, this study represents an important first step that future clinical studies can build upon.</p><p id="Par28">In summary, we have conducted the first placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blind human trial on NRPT and found that it is well tolerated and significantly raises NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in circulating blood in a sustained way. Other parameters measured in the trial provide a foundation for future trials, for example, by suggesting that NRPT may have salutary effects on liver function and mobility. We note that there is ample preclinical data in mice and rats that SIRT1 activation, including activation by polyphenols and by NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors, has beneficial effects on liver function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> providing further impetus to conduct follow-up trials. The preclinical data also shows beneficial effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors and polyphenols on muscle disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular, and brain health. Whether some of these benefits will be observed in humans is a question now open to investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Clinical trial</title><p id="Par29">This human clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments (clinical trials.gov identifier NCT02678611) This study was reviewed by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD), Health Canada and a research ethics board.
