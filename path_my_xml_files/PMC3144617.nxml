They have demonstrated the deleterious consequences of intraventricular conduction delay, particularly those produced by left bundle branch block (LBBB).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Alternative sites were tested with a view to optimize or stabilize LV function. Septal pacing seemed to better preserve cardiac performance in patients with normal LV systolic function,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] however, its effects in patients with preexistent LV systolic dysfunction are unknown. Neurohumoral factors represent the natural response of the individual to heart failure. Among them natriuretic peptides, especially B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP), have been shown to be reliable and rapid markers for diagnosis in heart failure patients. BNP, which is released primarily in response to increased atrial and ventricular stress, is a marker of the severity of heart failure. Furthermore, BNP levels reflect hemodynamic changes elicited by different pacing modes, and BNP levels are significantly higher during asynchronous ventricular pacing than during atrioventricular sequential pacing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] It has been reported that BNP levels will change in patients with permanent cardiac pacing;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] nevertheless, in fact, we do not exactly know how BNP levels change in different pacing sites, and we do not accurately know if RV septal pacing can really reduce BNP levels.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to demonstrate that RV septal pacing would better preserve ventricular function than RV apical pacing. The primary outcome measure is the change in BNP level at the end of the two-month follow-up period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Seventy-four consecutive patients with indications for permanent pacing were enrolled into the present study. Patients were implanted with either a dual or single-chamber pacemaker depending on whether the patient was in sinus rhythm or permanent atrial tachyarrhythmia. Exclusion criteria were symptomatic heart failure and any form of acute coronary syndrome within the previous month. During follow-up, patients were excluded if they had inadequate pacing lead position, or &#x0003c; 90% ventricular pacing (<italic>n</italic>=9).</p><p>To provide for the possibility of appropriate subgroup analyses, patients were stratified according to their pacing mode into two groups: Those with DDD/VDD pacemakers and those with VVI pacemakers. Group I consisted of 33 patients with implanted VVI (R) pacemakers (mean age 60.6 &#x000b1; 18.4 years) and Group II had 41 patients with DDD (R)/VDD pacemakers (mean age 54.1 &#x000b1; 18 years). The hospital Ethical Committee approved the present study and all patients gave written informed consent prior to enrollment into the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective single-blinded randomized design was used in both groups. Randomization (1:1 way) was between lead placement on the RV septum or RV apex and occurred during the implant. An implanted RV pacing lead was implanted at the RV septal position or RV apex using any commercially available active fixation lead via an axillary or subclavian puncture and in the case of dual-chamber pacemakers, an active atrial lead was fixed for the right appendage. The procedure for implantation of the RV septal lead was defined in the study protocol as to be performed by advancing the lead out the pulmonary artery, withdrawing the lead until it dropped below the pulmonic valve, and then advancing the lead into the high septum. The distal electrode was placed at the junction between the upper and middle septal segments, in a position to obtain the shortest pace-mapped QRS. Proper lead positioning was confirmed by multiple fluoroscopic views and surface electrocardiogram ECG.</p><p>Post-implantation chest X-ray and ECGs were given to confirm appropriate lead positions. The lower and upper pacing rate limits and sensor settings were individually programmed according to patient needs. All the implanted RV pacing leads were positioned at a stable position to obtain a satisfactory pacing threshold value (mean: 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.7 V, at a pulse width of 0.5 ms). All study patients had successful device replacement procedure without any complication.</p><p>Among patients with VVI pacemakers, the final positions of the RV leads were at the septum in 15 patients and at the RV apex in 18; in patients with DDD/VDD pacemakers the final lead positions were at the septum in 24 and at the RV apex in 17.</p><p>Plasma samples for the determination of plasma BNP were drawn before and two months after pacemaker implantation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>B-type natriuretic peptide measurement</title><p>Venous blood was taken from an antecubital vein in gel-filled tubes after the patient had been in a supine position for at least 15 min. At randomization and at the end of each study period, a venous blood sample was collected in tubes containing potassium Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA. Specimens were centrifuged at 3000 rpm (15&#x000b0;C for 10 min) and separated plasma was immediately assayed. All samples were plasma natriuretic peptide concentrations were measured with a specific immunoradiometric assay for human BNP using a highly sensitive, commercially available, enzyme-linked immunoassay (Biomedica Gruppe, Austria) and reported in pg/ml.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SE. A paired Student's <italic>t</italic> test analysis was used for comparison within groups and a non-specified Student's <italic>t</italic> test analysis for comparison between groups; all were done as two-sided tests. Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact tests and summarized by proportion in each category. Covariance analyses were used to compare variables between the two groups with adjustment for the pre-pacing values of these variables. We compared clinical characteristics including BNP levels between two groups using the X<sup>2</sup> and Mann-Whitney U tests. Factors associated with BNP levels were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression analysis. Factors with a probability of &#x0003c;0.1 on univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were completed using the SPSS 15 software package. A two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline characteristics of patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The primary implant indication was sick sinus syndrome in 14 patients, high-degree atrioventricular AV block in 35 patients, and a combination of these two disorders in 25 patients.

Similar results come from the ROVA study. This study showed that in patients with congestive heart failure CHF, LV dysfunction and chronic AF undergoing permanent pacing, RVOT and dual-site RV pacing shorten but do not normalize paced QRS duration and do not consistently improve quality of life QOL or other clinical outcomes after three months as compared with RVA pacing. In contrast, Mera <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] reported that in 10 patients with LV dysfunction, who underwent AV junction ablation, LVEF was higher after two months of high septal RVOT than RV apex pacing. More recently, Tse <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] randomized 24 patients, none of whom had CHF or LVEF &#x0003c;50%, to long-term RVOT or RV apex pacing. Between months 6 and 18 after initiation of pacing, LVEF declined (55% &#x000b1; 3% to 47% &#x000b1; 3%) and myocardial perfusion defects increased during RV apex but not RVOT pacing.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to assess if RV septal pacing, compared to RV apex pacing, would impact cardiac function using the parameter BNP. It is well known that different cardiac pacing modes have different effects on patients&#x02019; hemodynamics; however, it is not yet known how BNP levels change in different cardiac pacing sites.</p><p>In this small randomized study, we showed that plasma concentrations of BNP were higher in patients with a VVI pacing mode compared with a DDD mode [<italic>P</italic>=0.02, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] which is consistent with previously published studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Our main result showed no significant differences between pacing sites and concluded that hemodynamic improvement could be substantially influenced by pacing mode, more than by pacing site.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The main limitation of this study was the small number of patients. Potential limitations in the study design may have affected our results. Beneficial or deleterious effects of longer pacing durations from alternative RV sites could not be addressed by this study.
