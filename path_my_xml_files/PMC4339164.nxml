exercises on the thickness of the internal and external oblique abdominal muscles, the
transverses abdominis, and the multifidus muscles. [Subjects and Methods] Forty healthy
adults were enrolled and randomly allocated to four groups. Ten participants performed
bridge exercises (BE) while lying on their back; 10 others performed the same exercises
with their right legs up (BERL); another 10 performed the same exercises on their side
(SBE); and the remaining 10 performed them in a quadruped position with left arm and right
leg lifts (QLARL). The participants performed the exercises three times a week for five
weeks. The thicknesses of the muscles before and after the interventions were measured
using ultrasound. [Results] The results show that the normal bridge exercise significantly
thickened the TrA; BERL, the LM; QLARL, the IO; and SBE, the EO and the IO. [Conclusion]
All four spine stability exercises were effective. The normal bridge exercise and BERL
selectively strengthened the local muscles at the early stage of the treatment. We
consider SBE and QLARL should be used in the later stages of treatments because they
strengthen both the local and global muscles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Trunk muscle thickness</kwd><kwd>Trunk stabilization</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonograpy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In people with chronic malfunction due to back pain, the trunk muscles are weak, which
interferes with the functioning of the spine and increases the risk of further damage to it.
Thus, the stabilization of the trunk muscle plays an important role in the prevention and
rehabilitation of spine damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
crucial for therapists to find ways to relieve the pain and minimize the malfunction.</p><p>Bergmark<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that local muscles
stabilize the spinal segments from their direct or indirect origin to their point of
insertion into the spine, and global muscles control the movement of the trunk from their
origin to their point of insertion into many spinal segments. In general, local muscles such
as the transverse abdominis muscle (TrA) and the multifidus muscle (LM) must be selectively
contracted, and the actions of global muscles such as the rectus abdominis or the muscles
around the spine need to be minimized to stabilize the body against external resistance in
the neutral zone of the spine<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, because
the local muscles, including the internal oblique muscles (IO) and the transverse abdominis
muscle, increase the tensile force of the thoracolumbar fascia and contribute to the
stabilization of the spine<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
multifidus muscle stabilizes the spinal segments<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hodges et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> performed a study using
healthy subjects and subjects with chronic or acute back pain to find out how to selectively
strengthen the local muscles for trunk stability. The TrA of the healthy subjects activated
before its movement, regardless of the movement or direction of the limbs. The TrA of the
subjects with chronic back pain activated with a delay before movement, and that of the
subjects with acute back pain showed selective weakness of the LM, and the strength and
thickness of the muscles were not restored after the back pain disappeared<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stabilization of the spine through the
selective muscle strengthening exercise should be improved to prevent pain, malfunction, or
a relapse of acute and chronic back pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies of trunk stabilization exercises have been conducted, but most of them have
been short studies focusing on the change in muscle strength as measured by electromyograpy
(EMG). Non-invasive ultrasound has recently been adapted to measure the thickness and
cross-section of local muscles, and has been used in studies of trunk stabilization
exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was conducted to investigate the changes in muscle
thicknesses after five weeks of four different trunk stabilization exercises.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was performed from March to May 2012. Forty healthy university students were
enrolled who had, had no back pain within the previous three months, no structural
abnormality of the spine, and no neurological disorders. The objective and methodology of
this study were fully explained to all of the subjects, and each understood the
information before voluntarily agreeing to participate in this study, based on the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The 40 participants were randomly allocated to four groups of 10 participants each. They
were familiarized beforehand with each exercise method. They were also asked to use a
lumbar stabilizer for the abdominal drawing-in maneuver. The thickness of the trunk muscle
at rest was measured twice using ultrasound before and after the intervention (intraclass
correlation coefficient: range (0.85&#x02013;0.92).</p><p>For the stabilization exercise program, four modified bridge exercises were used. All the
participants were asked to use the abdominal drawing-in maneuver while they performed
their respective exercises. Each exercise session consisted of three sets of holding the
posture for 10 seconds with the trunk straight, resting for five seconds, which was
repeated 10 times. The trunk stabilization exercises were a bridging exercise (BE) in
which the participants lay on their backs with their feet fixed, and lifted their pelvis
until their hips had a 0&#x000b0; angle;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> a
bridging exercise with a right leg lift (BERL) in which the participants lay on their
backs with their feet fixed and lifted the right leg until it was parallel to the left
thigh, and then lifted the pelvis until their hips had a 0&#x000b0; angle;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> a side bridging exercise (SBE) in which the participants
lay on their side using an elbow and the feet for support and lifted their pelvis until
their spine became straight<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup><sub>,</sub> and a quadruped position with left arm and right leg
lifts (QLARL) in which the participants assumed a quadruped position with a straight spine
and lifted their left arm and right leg at the same time until their trunk formed a
straight line<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The TrA and the IO were measured using a SonoAce X4 ultrasonograph (Medison, Seoul,
Korea) with a 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;MHz straight head with the subjects lying straight on their backs with
their knees at a 50&#x000b0; angle and their hip at a 90&#x000b0; angle. The measurement was performed
parallel to the fibers of the TrA at the right axillary midline, in the middle of the
iliac crest and the costal angle, and at the 25&#x02005;mm anterior lateral margin when the
participants completed exhalation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The LM was measured with the participants lying prone with a pillow under the abdomen to
minimize the curve of the spine. Using 5&#x02013;9&#x02005;MHz curved head ultrasonography, the head was
placed longitudinally on the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, with the facet joint
appearing at the center of the monitor<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0. The effects and interactions
of the four different exercises and the thicknesses of the trunk muscles before and after
the exercises were investigated using mixed-model ANOVA. Scheffe&#x02019;s test was performed as a
post hoc test. The level of statistical significance used was &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the participants were as follows: mean&#x000b1;SD age (BE group

different trunk stabilization exercises which were performed three times a week for five
weeks, and to investigate which exercise selectively strengthened the trunk muscles. The
abdominal drawing-in maneuver is an exercise that selectively activates the TrA and the IO.
All the participants were asked to perform the abdominal drawing-in maneuver when they
performed their respective exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of the present study show the greatest increase in the thickness of EO,
129%,was in the SBE group, followed by 120% in the QLARL group, 119% in the BERL group, and
116% in the BE group. In a study of 11 trunk stabilization exercise Okubo et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that, the greatest activation of
the muscles was observed in the group that performed the side bridge exercise, as measured
by needle-EMG. They explained that EO is a global muscle that controls the movement of the
spine rather than stabilizing it. Lehman et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that EO about 45% maximal voluntary muscle contraction
during the side bridge exercise. Ekstrom et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that activation of EO on the supporting side was about 69%
of MVC during the side bridge exercise and 20% of MVC on the non-supporting side. We
consider the greatest change in muscle thickness of EO occurred in the SBE and QLARL groups
because EO is involved in controlling the rotation of the trunk.</p><p>IO thickened by 125% in the QLARL group, by 118% in the SBE group, by 116% in the BERL
group, and by 113% in the EB group. TrA thickened by 147% in the SBE group, by 137% in the
QLARL group, by 132% in the BERL group, and by 129% in the EB group. The results for IO and
TrA were similar; however TrA thickened more significantly in the QLARL group than in the
SBE group, unlike IO. Imai et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> used
needle EMG to measure the effects of different stabilization exercises, and reported an
activation of 10% of MVC in an EB group, 30% in a QLARL group, and 35% in a SBE group.
Hodges and Richardson<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
weight-bearing and the provision of an unstable support surface were required for
neuromuscular control of trunk stabilization muscles. The present study also showed higher
activation of the TrA in the SBE group than of the QLARL group because the support surface
in the QLARL exercise is smaller than that of the SBE exercise.</p><p>LM thickened by 131% in the BERL group, by 124% in the QLARL group, and by 119% in the SBE
group. Okubo et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
muscle activation in a BERL group was about 51% of MVC. Ekstrom et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported higher activation of LM in a BERL group.
Richardson et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported high
activation of LM and attributed it to the bridging exercise requiring extension of the spine
against gravity.</p><p>TrA and LM thickened most in all the groups after each intervention. In particular, TrA
thickened greatly in the SBE group, and LM, in the BERL group. However, EO significantly
thickened by 129% in the SBE group, which shows that cannot selectively strengthen the local
muscles. The reason for this was explained by Rodebold et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> who reported that the activation of the global muscles increases in
the patients with back pain and that back pain was aggravated due to compression of the
spine because of the action of the global muscles. EO thickened least significantly, by
116%, and TrA, by 129%, in BE group, which could be attributed to the early stage of
rehabilitation, because the early rehabilitation of patients with an unstable lower back
requires minimizes contraction of the global muscles and selective contraction of the local
muscle. The present study had several limitations that prevent the generalization of the
results. First, it had an insufficient number of healthy subjects and that limits the
interpretation of the results. Second, as only four trunk stabilization exercises were used
from among many possible exercises, it is difficult to generalize the superior efficacy of
the side bridging exercise and the bridging exercise with the leg lifted in strengthening
the TrA and the LM. Third, the relative ratio of the global muscle actions to the local
muscle actions was uncertain because only the thickness of the EO, from among the global
muscles in the trunk, changed. In the future, a further study to investigate the ratio of
the global muscle actions to the local muscle actions during spine stabilization exercises
should be conducted with patients with unstable spines rather than in healthy people. The
thickness of the rectus abdominis and the erector spinae muscle should also be
investigated.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Comerford</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mottram</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Functional stability re-training: principles and
