The primary outcome was proportion of patients achieving A1C &#x02264;7.0% and weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg at end point, analyzed by means of logistic regression. Secondary outcomes included measures of glycemic control, cardiovascular risk factors, and safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 216 patients (intent-to-treat population), 111 received EQW and 105 received detemir. Overall, 44.1% (95% CI, 34.7&#x02013;53.9) of EQW-treated patients compared with 11.4% (6.0&#x02013;19.1) of detemir-treated patients achieved the primary outcome (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Treatment with EQW resulted in significantly greater reductions than detemir in A1C (least-square mean &#x000b1; SE, &#x02212;1.30 &#x000b1; 0.08% vs. &#x02212;0.88 &#x000b1; 0.08%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and weight (&#x02212;2.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 kg vs. +0.8 &#x000b1; 0.4 kg; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Thus, treatments that improve both hyperglycemia and body weight&#x02014;with a low risk of hypoglycemia&#x02014;may be more desirable in the treatment of type 2 diabetes than treatments associated with weight gain. Over time, many patients do not achieve adequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) and additional therapies are required to achieve A1C targets of &#x02264;6.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) or &#x02264;7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). After OADs (i.e., metformin) fail or if OADs are contraindicated, algorithms recommend the use of add-on therapies including insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Exenatide once weekly (EQW), the extended-release formulation of exenatide, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for use in the United States and Europe to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. EQW administered by subcutaneous injection has been shown to provide sustained glycemic control and does not have the undesirable effects of weight gain and hypoglycemia that are typically associated with insulin and some OADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Further, weekly dosing may improve adherence to treatment, as suggested by improvements in patient-reported outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and therefore may improve therapeutic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>At present, there have been no comparisons between EQW or other GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin detemir, which is the most weight-neutral, long-acting insulin available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Compared with other basal insulin regimens (e.g., NPH insulin and insulin glargine), insulin detemir produced similar or greater improvements in glycemic control, was associated with less weight gain, and, in some trials, was associated with fewer events of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>This study is the first to compare EQW and insulin detemir (administered once or twice daily) with respect to glycemic control, body weight, lipids, safety, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes was inadequately controlled with OADs.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This 30-week (4-week screening and 26-week intervention), phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, active-comparator study (NCT01003184) was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving adequate glycemic control using metformin or a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea (SU). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to exenatide 2 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly or insulin detemir injection once daily or twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks, in addition to continuing current OAD therapy.</p><p>Detemir was initiated as once daily and titrated according to manufacturer labeling and a published &#x0201c;treat-to-target&#x0201d; titration algorithm described by Holman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), with an aim of target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of &#x0003c;5.5 mmol/L (&#x0003c;99 mg/dL) before breakfast and before dinner. Patients initiated treatment using calculations described in the algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and then titrated their doses weekly, as instructed by the investigator, based on daily self-monitored capillary fasting blood glucose measurements. Detemir dosages were reduced if hypoglycemia occurred or if the patient had a blood glucose measurement of &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L (&#x0003c;70.2 mg/dL). Patients added an insulin injection before breakfast if glucose readings were at target before breakfast but not before the evening meal (and if nocturnal hypoglycemia limited an increase in dosage before bedtime).</p><p>Randomization was stratified according to baseline A1C level [&#x02265;7.0 to &#x0003c;8.5% (&#x02265;53 to 69 mmol/mol) or &#x02265;8.5 to &#x02264;10.0% (&#x02265;69 to &#x02264;86 mmol/mol)] and SU use, and was centrally determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive voice-response system. Oral metformin therapy was continued unchanged, whereas SU dosages were reduced by 50% at initiation of study treatment and further reduced or discontinued if hypoglycemia occurred or if A1C &#x02264;7.0% (&#x02264;53 mmol/mol) was achieved.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, appropriate Ethical Review Board consents, and the International Conference on Harmonization guideline on good clinical practice and ethical principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study population</title><p>Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes and had A1C levels &#x02265;7.1 to &#x02264;10.0% (&#x02265;54 to &#x02264;86 mmol/mol) despite use of OAD, BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and stable weight (&#x02264;5% variability) for 3 months. Patients were required to be using a stable dose of metformin (&#x02265;1,000 mg/day) alone or in combination with a stable dose of SU (as a separate formulation) for at least 3 months before randomization.</p><p>Women of childbearing potential were ineligible unless using a reliable form of contraception throughout the study. Patients were excluded if they had a clinically significant medical condition that could preclude safe participation in this study, had more than three major hypoglycemic episodes in the past 6 months, or had been treated with a drug that promotes weight loss within 3 months of screening. Lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications were allowed with appropriate dose adjustments (per investigator decision).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients performed 7-point self-monitored blood glucose profiles at baseline and again between weeks 18 and 26. At baseline and week 26 (or the early termination visit for patients who discontinued before week 26), blood samples were taken to measure A1C, FPG, fasting plasma lipids, and other cardiovascular risk markers. Body weight, waist circumference, and vital signs were measured at each study visit.</p><p>Episodes of hypoglycemia, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications were recorded at each study visit and during telephone calls between visits. Events of nausea were recorded as spontaneous or solicited; only spontaneous reports were included in this analysis. A nausea evaluation questionnaire (e.g., nausea duration, timing, intensity, and others factors) was completed for patients who spontaneously reported nausea. Laboratory samples including clinical chemistry, hematology, and antiexenatide antibodies were collected at baseline and at week 26 (or the early discontinuation visit). Major hypoglycemia was defined as either any hypoglycemic episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia that led to loss of consciousness or seizure, with prompt recovery in response to glucagon or glucose administration, or documented hypoglycemia [plasma glucose &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L (&#x0003c;54 mg/dL)] requiring the assistance of another person because of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior (whether or not symptoms of hypoglycemia were detected by the patient). Minor hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia that were treated by the patient or resolved on their own, with documented plasma glucose &#x0003c;3.0 mmol/L (&#x0003c;54 mg/dL).</p><p>Patient-reported quality of life was assessed at all visits from baseline onwards using the Psychological General Well Being index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Patients who withdrew from the study completed these assessments at the discontinuation visit.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to compare the effect of 26 weeks of EQW treatment to a titrated dosage of detemir once daily or BID with respect to the composite outcome of proportion of patients achieving A1C &#x02264;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg at end point; the cut-off of &#x02265;1.0 kg was chosen to reflect the variation in sequential measurements of weight and the margin of error for essentially no weight gain.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcomes reported include the proportion of patients achieving the following: A1C &#x02264;7.4% (&#x02264;57 mmol/mol) with weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg at end point; A1C &#x02264;7.0% and &#x02264;7.4% with any weight change &#x02264;1 kg at end point; A1C &#x02264;7.4%, &#x02264;7.0%, and &#x02264;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at end point; changes in A1C and body weight from baseline to end point and from baseline to weeks 12, 18, and 26; changes in FPG and cardiovascular risk parameters [BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, lipid profiles, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and adiponectin] from baseline to end point; and the incidence of AEs. At the time the study was designed, A1C of &#x02264;7.4% was the recommended target in the United Kingdom for reimbursement in general practice. A1C values also were reported in International Federation of Clinical Chemistry units (mmol/mol).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>A total of 170 patients (85 per treatment) were required to provide 90% power to detect a difference between treatments, with 5% significance, assuming the week 26 response rates (primary end point) were 50% in the EQW group and 25% in the detemir group. The study was not powered for a noninferiority analysis. Likely response rates were based on results from previous clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Assuming a drop-out rate of 20% resulted in a final overall sample size of 214 patients.</p><p>The last observation carried forward method was used for missing data for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis; end point was defined as the last study visit (between and including the baseline and week 26 visit). Study outcomes including final A1C concentration and change in weight used the last postbaseline measurement set of both nonmissing A1C and weight (measured at the same visit). All tests of treatment effects were conducted at a two-sided &#x003b1; level of 0.05. CIs were computed as two-tailed using 95% level, and differences were based on the EQW estimate minus the detemir estimate.</p><p>Reasons for discontinuation and drop-out rates were compared between treatment groups using Fisher exact test. For baseline characteristics, all categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean and SD.</p><p>The primary outcome was analyzed for the ITT population (defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug) using a logistic regression model that included treatment group, use of SU, baseline A1C, and baseline weight as main factors. Hypothesis testing was based on the maximum likelihood estimate for the treatment main effect with corresponding 95% CI.</p><p>Secondary outcomes also were analyzed using the ITT population. Proportion of patients achieving A1C concentration &#x02264;7.0% with weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg at 12 weeks, A1C &#x02264;7.4% with weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg at end point, A1C &#x02264;7.0% and &#x02264;7.4% with weight change &#x02264;1.0 kg at end point, and A1C &#x02264;7.4%, &#x02264;7.0%, and &#x02264;6.5% were analyzed using the same methods as the primary outcome. The incidence of hypoglycemia was analyzed using logistic regression and categorized by use of concomitant SU. Exposure-adjusted incidence of hypoglycemia per 100 patient-years was reported.</p><p>Continuous variables with repeated measurements (A1C, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, SBP, and DBP) were evaluated using the likelihood-based mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis that included the corresponding baseline value as covariate; study treatment, use of SU, baseline A1C, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction were fixed effects; patient and error were random effects. MMRM results are reported as least-square (LS) mean (&#x000b1; SE and 95% CI). An ANCOVA model was used for A1C, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, SBP, DBP, FPG, heart rate, lipid profiles, PAI-1, and adiponectin, in which the dependent variable was the last observation carried forward change from baseline to end point and independent variables were treatment group, corresponding baseline value, use of SU, and baseline A1C. LS means, SE, and 95% CI were reported for treatment group differences and differences from baseline to end point. Change in hs-CRP was analyzed using log transformation (ANCOVA model adjusted for treatment, baseline log value of A1C, use of SU, and corresponding baseline value); values &#x02265;10 mg/L were excluded. Results are presented as geometric LS mean ratios of baseline to end point and EQW to detemir. The incidence of all treatment emergent AEs and serious AEs were summarized.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 325 patients screened, 222 patients were randomized to treatment, 216 received at least one dose of study drug (ITT population), and 191 completed the study to week 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

For the primary outcome, patients who received EQW were 6.6-times more likely to achieve A1C &#x02264;7.0% with weight loss &#x02265;1.0 kg than patients who received detemir. Overall, 44.1% and 11.4% of patients in each treatment group, respectively, achieved the composite primary outcome. A greater proportion of patients treated with EQW also achieved A1C &#x02264;7.4% with weight loss and A1C targets of &#x02264;7.4%, &#x02264;7.0%, and &#x02264;6.5% compared with insulin detemir.</p><p>Consideration of treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with metformin or metformin and SU should take into account the potential advantage of weight loss or weight neutrality in individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Therefore, a combination of glycemic control with weight loss was selected as a clinically relevant primary end point, and insulin detemir was chosen as an appropriate comparator for EQW because it is a long-acting insulin analog that has been associated with less weight gain than NPH insulin or insulin glargine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). EQW treatment resulted in significantly greater improvements compared with treatment with detemir in A1C (as early as 3 months) and body weight (as early as 4 weeks), and these improvements were maintained throughout the trial. Further, measures of psychological well-being and weight-related quality of life were improved in both groups, with greater improvements in weight-related assessments with EQW compared with detemir.</p><p>The present results build on previous experience comparing exenatide with insulins. Despite treatment with OADs and insulin, the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes have difficulty achieving or maintaining target glycemic control without associated weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Initiating insulin therapy is often the next step, but many patients still do not achieve optimal glycemic control with insulin, partly because of weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Exenatide BID has been shown to be more effective than insulin glargine for improving the composite outcomes of glycemic control with minimal weight gain when used as add-on therapy in overweight patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease and with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by two or three OADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In another trial, exenatide BID and insulin glargine similarly reduced A1C levels and similar proportions of patients in each treatment group achieved A1C targets, but weight was significantly lower in exenatide-treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>EQW also recently has been compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled using maximum tolerated doses of OADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). EQW produced significantly greater reductions in A1C than insulin glargine (LS mean, &#x02212;1.5 vs. &#x02212;1.3%) at 26 weeks and significantly more patients who received EQW achieved target A1C &#x02264;6.5% (43% vs. 28%). Additionally, at 26 weeks, treatment with EQW resulted in mean reduction in body weight of &#x02212;2.6 kg compared with an increase of 1.4 kg with insulin glargine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). At 84 weeks, patients treated with EQW continued to have significantly greater reductions in A1C from baseline than those who received insulin glargine (LS mean, &#x02212;1.16 vs. &#x02212;0.98%) and the difference in body weight between groups was maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>The current study also measured the effects of EQW and detemir on a number of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Both treatments were associated with improvements in several markers of cardiovascular risk from baseline, with EQW treatment resulting in significantly greater improvements in SBP, PAI-1, and hs-CRP than with detemir treatment. There was a significant improvement from baseline in LDL cholesterol in EQW-treated patients and in HDL cholesterol in detemir-treated patients, although the differences between treatments were not significant. Similarly, studies by Drucker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and Davies et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) have shown improved lipid profiles and SBP with EQW and exenatide BID; effects on lipids and SBP also were maintained after 3 years of follow-up in a study by MacConell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The increase in heart rate observed in patients treated with EQW was consistent with increases seen in previous trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), although the significance of this increase is unknown. The underlying mechanisms of these effects have yet to be established, and potential cardiovascular effects of EQW are undergoing investigation in an ongoing prospective trial (EXSCEL).</p><p>The incidence of hypoglycemia was generally low with both treatments in the present trial, especially without concomitant SU use. The incidence of hypoglycemia was not different between the EQW and detemir groups, which differs from previous trials that compared insulin with GLP-1 receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, other trials showed inconsistent results, including a lower incidence of hypoglycemia with exenatide BID versus insulin aspart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) or EQW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) versus insulin glargine, and no difference between exenatide BID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) or liraglutide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) versus insulin glargine. Furthermore, the incidence of hypoglycemia with detemir (5.7% overall) was lower than the incidence reported in other trials of detemir (confirmed minor hypoglycemia, 16% to 56%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). However, the current study was not powered for an assessment of hypoglycemia, and the small number of events reported limits potential inferences that can be drawn from these data.</p><p>As has been reported previously, the most common adverse event experienced by EQW recipients was nausea. However, this event did not appear to be associated with additional weight loss and few patients discontinued the study because of nausea. The incidence of nausea with EQW in this study (18%) was similar to the incidence reported in other trials (11% to 26%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Approximately half of the patients were antibody-positive for exenatide, most of whom had low titers. Overall, change in A1C was lower in patients with higher titers than in patients with low titers or those who were antibody-negative; however, antibody titers were not predictive of individual A1C changes, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study was that forced titration of detemir was not strictly enforced and patients reduced the dosage if hypoglycemia occurred, leading to a mean titrated dose of detemir at end point 0.51 IU/kg, which is at the lower end of the range of mean doses of detemir used in other trials of type 2 diabetes (0.4 to 0.9 IU/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Consequently, lower than average insulin doses may have affected the potential magnitude in A1C change or masked treatment-related differences in hypoglycemia events.</p><p>This trial is the first to compare EQW and insulin detemir, which is associated with less weight gain than other insulins. The results showed that treatment with EQW resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving target A1C than with insulin detemir, with the added benefit of weight loss not seen with detemir. We conclude that EQW represents an alternative treatment option to insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes using OADs with inadequate glycemic control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical Trial reg. no.
