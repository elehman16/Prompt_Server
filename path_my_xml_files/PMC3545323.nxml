In these two groups, relative risk (RR) was 21 and 8,5% respectively; Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) was 74 and 86% respectively, and Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was 1 for both groups, while chi-squared (X2) test has shown that there is no statistically significant difference between these two drugs when it comes to their effect. In the Butylscopolamine group, RR was 81; ARR 18%, while NNT was 5.

Most often, patients constantly try to find unusual positions in order to ease the pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"> 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"> 8</xref>). These movements are opposite to the restricted movements of bed-ridden patients with peritoneal signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). A vast majority of urinary stones with acute pain attack are a consequence of acute obstruction and distension of the upper urinary tract. Intervention in renal colic has to be based on the awareness of the origin of pain, renal damage suffered, and it has to protect the kidney from any damage caused by prolonged obstruction. Many drugs have been proposed for the treatment of renal colic pain of which most commonly used are antiholinergic drugs and antimuscarinics. Given that all authors do not agree that muscarinic receptors are involved in urethral mobility, their use is disputable, particularly since ureteric peristalsis is necessary for stone passage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Considering the contradictory results of studies related to the efficacy and side effects of tested drugs, the question arises as to how the effect and safety of the tested drugs can be scientifically quantified and qualified. The answer lies in the use of evidence based medicine and meta-analyses related to the treatment of renal colic.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODOLOGY</title><p>During 2009-2010, a prospective open, comparative and randomized ITT (Intention To Treat) study on a sample of 400 adult patients, divided into 4 groups. Group A (100 patients) was administered Metamizol 2 g i.v., group B (100 patients) was administered Diclofenac 75 mg. i.m., group C (100 patients) Butylscopolamin amp. i.v., while placebo group (100 patients), received distilled water (<italic>aqua redestilata</italic>) i.v., as a control group. All the patients completed pain scale from 1 to 10 (VAPS, Visual Analogue Pain Scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. The patients were evaluated before the drug administration and half an hour after the therapy. In case the pain was not relieved, within 30 minutes an additional dose of the drug was administered or Tramal amp. 50 mg. i.v. (ITT), and if the patient did not respond to either drug, a more invasive urological treatment was applied (urethral catheterization, stenting or ESWL treatment). The patients were alternately administered the therapy from the groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, and then the cycle was repeated until all 400 patients were treated. Also, possible side effects of the tested drugs were monitored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><label>3.</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>The testing was statistically processed based on the principle of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).

During their work, cliniciansresearchers have dilemmas and differences regarding the results obtained from various sources of evidence; they are not sure which results are the most optimal ones for a given study. It is by using current best evidence for the treatment of a disease and acquiring practical and critical judgment, as well as developing IT skills that a more rational and practical approach to the unknown will be developed, while the explicit use of incorporated evidence, as well as patients&#x02019; state and preferences in making medical decisions will make a clinician &#x0201c;an evidence expert&#x0201d;. At the same time, it involves continuous tracking down the evidence, based on which medical decisions are made, and further develops the ability to look for and select the best evaluations from primary and secondary sources of available evidence in order to achieve the optimal treatment for the patient. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"> 9</xref>)</p><p>EBM came about based on the idea that the decision about the care of patients should involve the conscientious and equitable use of current best evidence related to the health of both individual patients and population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"> 11</xref>). From ethical perspective, the strongest arguments supporting the EBM are that it identifies and provides for the best evaluated methods of health care (including those useless, and those causing detrimental effect) while enabling both patients and doctors to make proper decisions. Medical informatics and EBM are closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Based on EBM principles, some parameters evolved that practically define the efficacy of a certain medical treatment. These parameters have been applied in this paper in order to investigate the efficacy of medications from the experimental group. For all parameters the CI (Confidence Interval, degree of probability) of 95% was used. Since all groups were monitored for up to 30 minutes following the administration of therapy, VAPS values prior to and after treatment were taken as a basis for the calculation of parameters. The parameters monitored are RR (Relative Risk), ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction) and NNT (Number Needed to Treat), NNH (Number Needed to Harm), ARI (Absolute Risk Increase), and RRI (Relative Risk Increase). For these calculations, the placebo group was used as a control group. The results obtained for X<sup>2</sup> test suggest to a statistically significant difference between the Diclofenac/Butylscopolamine group, p&#x0003c;0.0001, Metamizol/B utylscopolamine p&#x0003c;0.0001, Diclofenac/Aqua (p&#x0003c;0.0001), Metamizol/Aqua (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Also, it was shown that there is no significant difference in terms of effect between the groups Metamizol/Diclofenac (p&#x0003e;0.0001) and Butylscopolamine / Aqua (p&#x0003e; 0.0001). In the group where Metamizol was tested, the relative risk of a weak therapeutic response (RR) is 8.5%, while the absolute risk reduction of a weak therapeutic response (ARR) in this group is 86%. The number of patients needed to treat with Metamizol in order to achieve a 100% successful outcome in the whole group (NNT) is 1. In the group of patients receiving Diclofenac, the RR is 23%, the ARR is 74%, while the NNT is 1. Therefore, there is a high degree of probability regarding the efficacy of these two medications and a low degree of probability that they fail to have effect. In the group of patients receiving Butylscopolamine, the RR is 81%, the ARR is 18%, while the NNT is very high&#x02013;5. The comparison between the Butylscopolamine group as a control group and Diclofenac Na group as an experimental group, showed the following values: the RR&#x02013;26%, the ARR&#x02013;56%, and the NNT&#x02013;1. The comparison between the Butylscopolamine group as a control group and Metamizol group as an experimental group, showed the following values: the RR &#x02013; 10.5%, the ARR&#x02013;68%, and the NNT&#x02013;1. Also, in the Butylscopolamine group, a high degree of transitory side effects was shown (diplopia, dry mouth and dizziness, for which no medical treatment was indicated), and it was shown that the RRI was 84%, therefore, in 84% of the patients the relative risk of a side effect was increased, while the effect of the medication in terms of pain relief was equal to that in the placebo group. Having analyzed the whole paper and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) available, and taken into account pain relief statistical results and data on serious life-threatening side effects that may appear during the administration of Metamizol, which have not been verified during this study, one can say that Metamizol and Diclofenac are equal for the treatment of renal colic, however the medication of choice is Diclofenac Na, applied i.m. in the dosage of 75 mg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><label>5.</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The objective EBM is to use the evidence obtained using scientific methodology as an important element of medical practice. The EBM is about the quality of evidence relevant for a specific trial or treatment, including both the risk and benefit of the treatment, as well as the absence of a specific treatment. For the treatment of renal colic, meta-analyses evaluated 40 randomized control studies that fulfilled all the requirements for their results to comply with evidence-based medicine parameters. The results of this study are shown directly, through new statistical indicators, as a contribution to clinical decision-making on the optimal therapeutic approach.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tanagho</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name><name><surname>McAninch</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Urinary Stone Disease</article-title><source>Smith&#x02019;s General Urology</source><year>2004</year><edition>16th</edition><publisher-loc>San Francisco</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lange Medical Book</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Van Laecke</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Oosterlinck</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physiopathology of renal colic and the therapeutic consequences</article-title><source>Acta Urologica Belgica</source><year>1994</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>18</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7913574</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heid</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Jage</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The treatment of pain in urology</article-title><source>BJU International</source><year>2002</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>481</fpage><lpage>488</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12175384</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jamison</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name><name><surname>Gracely</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comparative study of electronic vs. paper VAS ratings: A randomized, crossover trial using healthy volunteers</article-title><source>Pain</source><year>2002</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>341</fpage><lpage>347</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12237213</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lorig</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sobel</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effect of a Self-Management Program on Patients with Chronic Disease</article-title><source>Eff.
