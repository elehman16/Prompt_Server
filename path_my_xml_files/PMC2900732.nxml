It has, in addition to Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway (CLMA), a drainage tube for providing a bypass channel for gastric contents to prevent regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. A randomized prospective study was performed comprising of 60 ASA &#x02013; I/II patients, between the age groups of 3 and 10 years, of either sex. All the patients were premedicated with oral Midazolam and Glycopyrollate. General anaesthesia with caudal epidural analgesia was given in all the cases. Inhalation with 8% Sevoflurane was used as a sole induction agent in all the patients. They were randomly divided into two groups. PLMA was inserted in patients of Group P and Endotracheal Tube (ETT) in patients of Group I. In all cases, after PLMA / ETT insertion; caudal epidural analgesia was given and general anaesthesia (GA) using Sevoflurane was provided for maintenance of anaesthesia. Muscle relaxant was not used in our study. We studied parameters such as number of attempts, ease of insertion and conditions during insertion, haemodynamic parameters, changes in SpO<sub>2</sub>, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, gastric insufflation, regurgitation, pulmonary aspiration, postoperative airway complications and so on. We found that insertion of PLMA as well as ETT was performed in the first attempt in all the patients. Ease of insertion and conditions during insertion were comparable in both the groups. Changes in SpO<sub>2</sub> and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were comparable. However, highly significant changes in haemodynamic parameters were observed in the ETT group. Complications such as sore throat (13.33% cases), coughing (40% cases), vomiting (3.33% cases) and hypoxia (3.33% cases) were observed in the ETT group. No gastric insufflation or regurgitation was noted in our study. Thus, we concluded that PLMA could be used as an effective and safe airway device in children compared to ETT undergoing general anaesthesia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anaesthesia: general anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>equipment: proseal laryngeal mask airway (plma)</kwd><kwd>endotracheal tube (ett)</kwd><kwd>patients: children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Laryngeal mask airway developed by Dr. Archie Brain is relatively non-invasive in comparison to endotracheal intubation and causes minimal disturbances in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

Stabilise the head with the help of the non-dominant hand. Under direct vision, press the tip of the cuff upward against the hard palate and flatten the cuff against it. There should be flexion at the wrist joint. As the index finger passes further into the mouth, the finger joint begins to extend. Advance the device into the hypopharynx until a definite resistance is felt. Full insertion is not possible unless the index finger is fully extended and the wrist is fully flexed. Before removing the finger, the non-dominant hand is brought from behind the patient's head to press down on the airway tube).

It has become an entity by itself and a speciality with the availability of various new airway devices.</p><p>Paediatric CLMA has gained wide popularity in paediatric anaesthesia since its introduction into clinical practice. Although at first it was used only as a replacement for the face mask, it is now used as an alternative to ETT.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>PLMA is a modified form of classic LMA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] The modifications were designed to enable separation of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract, improve the airway seal, enable controlled ventilation and diagnose misplacement.</p><p>We decided to compare PLMA with ETT for the safety and efficacy of the airway device in children (Primary goal). We also studied induction time, effective airway time, attempts and conditions during insertion of device, changes in haemodynamics, SpO<sub>2</sub> and EtCO<sub>2</sub> as well as airway-related complications (Secondary goal).</p><p>Sevoflurane was used as the inhalation agent for induction because, the uptake of the inhalation agent was more rapid in children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] Furthermore, oral premedication with Midazolam helped us in the smooth and rapid induction of Sevoflurane in the children, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>.</p><fig id="F0004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Acceptance of mask and ease of induction with sevoflurane after oral midazolam</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-54-109-g004"/></fig><p>We used PLMA according to the weight of the child (size 2 for 10 &#x02013; 20 kg, and 1.5 for 5 &#x02013; 10 kg) and ETT according to the age of the child for providing ventilation.
