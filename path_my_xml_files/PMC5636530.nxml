Placement of Kirschner wires for hand fractures is a deceptively difficult technique which requires significant experience to master. A simulator to aid in visualizing the anatomy would help trainees more rapidly advance their skills. We describe the design, creation, and preliminary validation of a 3D-printed hand simulator for Kirschner wire placement.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> Computer aided design (CAD) software was used to create a hand model based on anatomic measurements. 3D-printing was used to manufacture the separate components. Simulated bones were created from polyurethane, with imbedded graphite to render them radiopaque. The overlying soft tissues were made from silicone. Both a transparent and opaque soft tissue envelope were created. Resident physicians and staff both evaluated the model, and then a semi-structured questionnaire was used to assess their experiences.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> An anatomically correct model was manufactured with multiple metacarpal and phalangeal fractures. Articulations at the interphalangeal joints were mobile within normal limits. Two variations of the model were created: one with transparent skin allowing visualization of the underlying bones, and one with opaque skin. This transparency allowed for a graded difficultly for novice surgeons, and correlation between tactile and visual feedback. Visualization under fluoroscopic C-arm demonstrated visible discernment of the bones.</p><p>Five residents and five staff evaluated the models. Experiences analyzed included: simulation realism, educational utility, and overall reaction. Responses in all domains were favorable, suggesting the positive utility of this model.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Using 3D-printing, we developed an anatomically correct and realistic simulator for Kirschner wire placement in hand fractures. Initial feedback has been favorable, suggesting its potential as an effective educational tool.</p></body></article>
