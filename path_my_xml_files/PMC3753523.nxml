Previous studies showed early mobilisation of medical ICU patients improves clinical outcomes. The Surgical ICU Optimal Mobilisation Score (SOMS) trial aims to test whether a budget-neutral intervention to facilitate goal-directed early mobilisation in the surgical ICU improves participant mobilisation and associated clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The SOMS trial is an international, multicentre, randomised clinical study being conducted in the USA and Europe. We are targeting 200 patients. The primary outcome is average daily SOMS level and key secondary outcomes are ICU length of stay until discharge readiness and &#x02018;mini&#x02019; modified Functional Independence Measure (mmFIM) at hospital discharge. Additional secondary outcomes include quality of life assessed at 3&#x02005;months after hospital discharge and global muscle strength at ICU discharge. Exploratory outcomes will include: ventilator-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay and 3-month mortality. We will explore genetic influences on the effectiveness of early mobilisation and centre-specific effects of early mobilisation on outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Following&#x000a0;Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval in three institutions, we started study recruitment and plan to expand to additional centres in Germany and Italy. Safety monitoring will be the domain of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The SOMS trial will also explore the feasibility of a transcontinental study on early mobilisation in the surgical ICU.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results of this study, along with those of ancillary studies, will be made available in the form of manuscripts and presentations at national and international meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Registration</title><p>This study has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01363102).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>REHABILITATION MEDICINE</kwd><kwd>RESPIRATORY MEDICINE (see Thoracic Medicine)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Early mobilisation is important for critically ill patients who are at risk of developing intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICU-acquired muscle weakness is associated with increase in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay and mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the surgical ICU, contraindications to early mobilisation exist in subsets of patients.

The non-polar questions which involve clinical judgment (ie, no excessive predicted mortality within the next 24&#x02005;h) are discussed with the assistance of the SOMS facilitator.</p><p>Once the mobilisation goal has been determined, a sign will be posted at the participant's bedside with the goal for the day. The bedside nurse will work with the participant to achieve the goal. Prior to afternoon rounds, the nurse will document the highest achieved SOMS for the day. If the goal SOMS was neither met nor exceeded, the nurse documents barriers to mobilisation. These barriers will be discussed and attempts will be made to mitigate these barriers (ie, pain, anxiety, haemodynamic or respiratory concerns) in order to meet the SOMS goal for the following day.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Blinding</title><p>Given the design of the SOMS trial, blinding to the primary outcome is impossible.

The SOMS algorithm is designed to carefully and incrementally advance mobilisation. On the basis of the knowledge gathered in the medical ICU, early mobilisation leads to improved clinical outcomes such as fewer days in the ICU and better functional mobility at discharge. However, while using the bridge of goal-directed early mobilisation, possible complications and side effects of mobilisation must be considered like pain and increased oxygen consumption.

SOMS-guided goal-directed early mobilisation is straightforward, progressive and intuitive. It was created with input from the fields of nursing, physical therapy, physiatry and critical care to ensure safety and function. It is written in clinically precise and mutually comprehensible language. The process of setting a mobilisation goal should add minimal time to morning rounds. The role of the SOMS facilitator to assist in goal setting and assess the participant's progress will require a few minutes spread throughout the day. The results of this study will be generalisable to the broader clinical community such that the study finding will be externally valid and should guide clinical standards for early mobilisation, or &#x02018;prehabilitation,&#x02019; in the surgical ICU.</p><p>The SOMS algorithm allows nurses to readily contribute to goal setting on rounds and it provides structure for the nurses to mobilise the participants. The act of delivering the intervention, mobilising participants from the bed to sitting and so forth, takes time. While we believe the SOMS algorithm makes efficient use of existing resources, we acknowledge that shifting resources towards mobilisation may be associated with opportunity costs under certain circumstances.</p><p>SOMS is a thoughtful and uncomplicated intervention. However, owing to the nature of the research, there are notable limitations. One limitation in the study is the inability to blind the assessor of a participant's achieved SOMS. For study participants, the achieved SOMS is obtained daily from the participant's nurse who is unblinded and part of the intervention. The achieved SOMS is checked against the nursing documentation. For control participants, the achieved SOMS is obtained by the clinical SOMS facilitator during regular afternoon rounds. The numbers obtained by the nurses and the SOMS facilitator are again checked against the nursing chart.</p><p>A second limitation is that we do not add any additional personnel resources to accomplish the daily SOMS goal and this is an environment which occasionally has difficulty meeting its current mobilisation goals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> We believe the SOMS algorithm for goal-directed early mobilisation is complementary to the philosophy of nursing and will be fluidly incorporated into their systems with limited effect on their workload. Foremost, the SOMS algorithm should improve mobility-related communication between providers, and thus lead to more frequent mobilsation of patients and a change in mobilisation culture in the surgical ICU. However, there is the possibility that this budget-neutral intervention may not improve mobilisation adequately to draw conclusions, and a dedicated mobilisation specialist or team, as applied in other medical ICU studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref> may be necessary.</p><p>The adoption of patient mobilisation into the surgical ICU prompts a third limitation: culture shift from immobilised patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> to mobilised patients. As nurses gain more experience mobilising critically ill patients due to their patients&#x02019; participation in our study, they will become more comfortable applying this same concept to all of their patients: intervention, control and other. Consequently, we expect mobilisation in the standard of care group to increase with time, which may lead to a type II error. The multicentric trial design with a high sample size utilising individual randomisation may help minimise contamination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></p><p>Furthermore, throughout the world and even in the most affluent nations, mobilising patients in the surgical ICU is performed by a variety of different healthcare providers with different training backgrounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>: nurses, nursing assistants, students, respiratory therapists, physical therapists and physicians of different specialties. Additionally, the availability of resources, both assistive equipment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> and personnel, differs between a tertiary care hospital in Europe and in the USA. Accordingly, a specific algorithm with decision points explicitly requiring &#x02018;yes&#x02019; and &#x02018;no&#x02019; answers to advance, stall or regress the mobilisation goal must accommodate cultural, linguistic and resource-based variation. Therefore, our goal-directed early mobilisation algorithm will be identical across all centres relative to the stages of mobilisation and the focus on promoting early and clinically appropriate mobilisation, but the algorithm will have minor, local adaptations.</p><p>Finally, in consideration of the minor effect that genetic differences in sleep, circadian rhythm and muscle homoeostasis may have on variance in surgical ICU outcomes, our study may be underpowered to identify genetic influence on surgical ICU outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This manuscript provides a description of our study protocol and analysis plans for the SOMS multicentre randomised control trial. Beyond evaluating the effects of goal-directed early mobilisation on clinical outcomes and patient mobility, this study is designed to maximise the efficiency of existing resources without requiring any new personnel or funding. Furthermore, the design of this study lends itself to ancillary studies related to the cultural issues associated with mobilisation of surgical ICU patients. This trial is an opportunity to use goal-directed early mobilisation to improve surgical ICU clinical outcomes safely without adding to the hospital expenses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e347" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003262.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e348" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003262.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ME, KW and CR conceived the study and initiated the study design.
