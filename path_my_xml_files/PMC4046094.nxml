Ignorance among healthcare professionals and a failure to recognise patients suffering from delirium have been identified as the possible causes of poor care. The objective of the study was to determine whether e-learning can be an effective means of improving implementation of a quality improvement project in delirium care. This project aims primarily at improving the early recognition of older patients who are at risk of delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial an e-learning course on delirium was introduced, aimed at nursing staff. The trial was conducted on general medical and surgical wards from 18 Dutch hospitals. The primary outcome measure was the delirium risk screening conducted by nursing staff, measured through monthly patient record reviews. Patient records from patients aged 70 and over admitted onto wards participating in the study were used for data collection. Data was also collected on the level of delirium knowledge of these wards&#x02019; nursing staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Records from 1,862 older patients were included during the control phase and from 1,411 patients during the intervention phase. The e-learning course on delirium had a significant positive effect on the risk screening of older patients by nursing staff (OR 1.8, p-value &#x0003c;0.01), as well as on other aspects of delirium care. The number of patients diagnosed with delirium was reduced from 11.2% in the control phase to 8.7% in the intervention phase (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). The e-learning course also showed a significant positive effect on nurses&#x02019; knowledge of delirium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nurses who undertook a delirium e-learning course showed a greater adherence to the quality improvement project in delirium care.

Approximately 25% of patients aged 65 and over experience delirium during a hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The incidence is significantly higher among specific patient groups, such as surgery patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Delirium in older patients is associated with a longer stay in hospital, functional decline, admission to long-term care, and higher mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, studies show that healthcare professionals often fail to recognise delirium during a hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This might be explained by a lack of knowledge of delirium among physicians and nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The Frail Elderly Project (FEP) is part of a national patient safety programme launched in the Netherlands in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The FEP seeks to improve care for patients aged 70 and over, and includes a delirium care guideline for older hospitalised patients. The project and its guidelines are based on existing evidence regarding care for older patients, as well as expert opinion. The FEP delirium guideline primarily aims to improve early recognition of older patients at risk of delirium through risk screening (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

A review by Cook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] has shown that the use of e-learning or &#x02018;internet-based education&#x02019; is associated with a positive effect on the knowledge, skills, and behaviour of healthcare professionals, as well as on patient outcomes. Computer-assisted learning aimed specifically at nurses has produced less clear-cut results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether e-learning can be an effective means of improving the implementation of a quality improvement project. The primary objective was to investigate whether offering nursing staff an e-learning course in delirium care increased the adherence to the FEP guideline.

We selected an e-learning course which offered the hospitals participating the opportunity of supporting their own implementation process with a course that educates nurses in delirium care.</p><p>The e-learning course had two goals: to create or increase awareness about delirium and the associated risks; and to increase knowledge about delirium care. The nurses on the wards which participated received online access to the course for a period of three months. The estimated time needed to complete the course and the test of knowledge that preceded and followed the course, was four hours.</p><p>The e-learning course was introduced to the nursing staff during meetings in each hospital in order to optimise the nurses&#x02019; participation. In order to stimulate participation further, e-mail reminders were sent to nurses who had not completed the course within one month and again to nurses who had not completed the course within two months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, each ward was provided with a monthly overview of the use and completion of the e-learning course. All the nurses who completed the knowledge test successfully by following the course and answering 80% of the questions correctly received a certificate. If nurses scored less than 80% on the test following the course, they had one opportunity to re-take the test.</p></sec><sec><title>The study setting and its participants</title><p>Nineteen of the 81 hospitals that were invited initially were enrolled in the trial. The hospitals that responded to the invitation within the inclusion period were included, provided they had already started implementing the FEP. One hospital declined to participate after initially being enrolled in the study. The remaining 18 hospitals participating included two university hospitals, five teaching hospitals, and eleven general hospitals, varying in size and geographical location.</p><p>Data were gathered from two wards in each hospital, typically a general medical and a surgical ward. The e-learning trial required data from two groups of participants from each hospital: patients aged 70 and over admitted to one of the participating wards; and the nursing staff employed on these wards. Nursing staff could not blinded as to whether they received the intervention. Patients and data collection staff (research nurses) were blinded to the trial condition. However, it is possible that they were informed of the trial condition through verbal comments from nursing staff.</p><sec><title>The study design and its randomisation</title><p>The study was a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], lasting 11&#x000a0;months. The hospitals that participated crossed over from the control to intervention phase, as illustrated in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. At the start of the study in May 2011, no hospital had access to the intervention, while at the end in March 2012 all but one hospital had been given access. The order in which the hospitals received the intervention was randomised by assigning computer-generated random numbers to each hospital and subsequently sorting hospitals from the lowest number to the highest. At the start of the study period, all hospitals were informed of the date on which the participating wards would receive access to the e-learning course.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Diagrammatic illustration of the stepped wedge design.</bold> Each cell represents a moment of data gathering.

This reduced contamination bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The initial power calculation for the part of the study focused on the effect of e-learning for nurses on provided care (i.e., screening for delirium risk) resulted in a power of 0.8, based on the following assumptions: 18 participating hospitals (36 wards); an improvement of delirium risk screening of 20% after introduction of the intervention; an alpha of 0.05; a total of 360 patient records for reviewing per month; an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and data collection</title><p>The primary outcome used to determine the effectiveness of e-learning was the percentage of older patients screened for delirium risk. We also looked at the number of nursing interventions received by patients identified as at-risk, as well as the use of the Delirium Observation Screening scale (DOS scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in this patient group (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This data was gathered through monthly reviews of patient records, from May 2011 to the end of March 2012. Records were included if the length of stay of the older patient, at the time of data collection, was at least 24&#x000a0;hours. The aim was for research nurses to review ten records per ward per month during the study period. These research nurses did not work for the hospital where they conducted record reviews. Risk screening for delirium was defined as: having used the screening instrument provided by the FEP (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) or an alternative instrument, such as the Groninger Frailty Indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and the Identification of Seniors At Risk or ISAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Data on the demographic characteristics of the patients were also gathered.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included the percentage of nurses participating in the e-learning course and changes in nurses&#x02019; knowledge of delirium after completing the course. These data were gathered using the web-based course itself. Data collection through the e-learning course ended after the final hospitals completed their three month period of access, at the end of June 2012. The characteristics of the nurses working on the wards, such as their age and level of education were collected through the ward managers.</p><p>The research nurses conducting the record reviews were blinded for the trial condition of the hospitals. Because the e-learning tool was used by nurses working on the wards participating in the study, the hospitals and wards could not be blinded to the trial condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 12 and MLwiN 2.25. We compared delirium care in the intervention phase with that of the control phase. We calculated absolute differences and odds ratios using multilevel logistic regression analysis, adjusting for clustering on the ward and hospital level. The outcome were adjusted for hospital type (general or non-general); ward type (general medicine or surgical); patients&#x02019; age and sex. Multilevel logistic and linear regression analysis was used to calculate the percentage of nurses participating in the e-learning course, the percentage of participants successfully completing the course, and the changes in the knowledge of delirium, adjusting for hospital type; ward type; and nurses&#x02019; age.</p><p>If a nurse failed to pass the second test on the first attempt, and made use of the opportunity to re-take the test, results from the second attempt were used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study had been granted ethical approval by the Vrije Universiteit (VU) University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The adjusted screening rate was 50.8% in the control phase, compared with 65.4% in the intervention phase. The e-learning course also showed a significant positive effect on nurses&#x02019; knowledge of delirium. An e-learning course on delirium appears to be a valuable addition to the efforts of hospitals to improve delirium care. However, the goal of the FEP, to ensure all older patients were screened for the risk of delirium and all at-risk patients were observed using the DOS scale, was still not achieved.</p><p>Our study found a significant increase in the knowledge of delirium after nurses completed the e-learning course. Many experts have emphasised the lack of knowledge regarding delirium in healthcare professionals as a cause of poor delirium care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. One study has indicated that nurses do not understand the need for preventive measures because the negative outcomes associated with delirium are not understood well enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Some experts have suggested that the same is true for clinical and strategic leaders in healthcare, leading to a low priority being awarded to improving the recognition of delirium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Besides the e-learning, and the improvement in knowledge accompanying it, other factors - at the organisational level - might have influenced the delirium care in the hospitals participating. An evaluation of the Dutch patient safety programme found several factors that influenced, positively, the implementation of the patient safety projects. These included, among other things, the presence of an enthusiastic project leader, having the project fit in well with existing guidelines and procedures, and the presence of an electronic patient record [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These factors could, and did, differ between the hospitals participating in our trial, and could, potentially, have influenced their adherence to the FEP and the effect of e-learning. This might explain the high ICCs we found.</p><p>We did not include a time variable in the model to account for a time effect as suggested by Hussey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The time variable is an important point in stepped wedge designs. One should include the time variable in the model if it can be assumed that delirium is subject to change over time. Balan et al. found a possible seasonal influence on diagnosis of delirium in a geriatric hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, we did not find a seasonal influence on the diagnosis of delirium. This may be due to the relative low amount of events. Besides, several calendar-related effects, change in staff, change in clinical management are hospital dependent and reflected in the clustering on hospital level. Therefore we decided not to include the time variable in the model. Besides, by including several measurement points over time, the timeframe is included in the model itself.</p><p>The intervention may be associated with competing events, such as discharge. As the association between delirium and length of hospital stay can go two ways (a longer hospital stay can increase the risk of delirium, while a delirium will likely increase the length of stay) authors felt that such an analysis was beyond the scope of this article. However, it would be an interesting subject for further research in delirium care.</p><p>The main strengths of this trial include its large sample size, both of patients and nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], high participation rates for the e-learning course and the inclusion of both surgical and general medical wards. The stepped wedge design enabled a practical evaluation of the effects of an e-learning course, while offering the methodological advantage of using the participating wards as their own control.</p><p>The limitations of the study include a potential delay in the intervention effect, resulting from the relatively late uptake of the e-learning course by nurses. All wards were given access to the e-learning course for the period of three months, but most nurses participated in the course only at the end of this period. This would mean that although the wards had entered, officially, the intervention phase of the trial, minimal effects of the intervention could be expected in the first and second month. This could mean that the effect of e-learning on delirium care was actually larger than was calculated. Another limitation is that the first date of delirium diagnosis was not recorded. Therefore it was not possible to study if the intervention reduces the delirium (hazard) rate.</p><p>In addition, the nurses were dependent for data collection on information written in the patient record, which might not always have been complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Nonetheless, screening without proper registration would have the same results for the patient as not screening at all because the screening of patients for increased risks or the presence of delirium can only benefit patients when all the relevant care professionals are aware of the outcome. Also, there was no indication that the documentation in patient records differed between the control and intervention phase.</p><p>The FEP was part of a national patient safety programme which ended in December 2012, when all hospitals were expected to have implemented, successfully, all aspects of this programme. This external deadline could have had a positive influence on the implementation of the FEP, which could have had an impact on our findings. However, the evaluation of the patient safety programme, has shown that despite this deadline, several of its projects did not show an increase in implementation during 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, any role the external pressure played in hospitals was present both during the control and the intervention phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that an e-learning course on delirium aimed at nurses from general medical and surgical wards of Dutch hospitals improved the delirium care provided by nurses, and decreased the number of older patients diagnosed with delirium. It showed that by following an e-learning course nurses could build upon their existing knowledge of delirium care. Our findings support the view that educational approaches focussed on increasing awareness of delirium and increasing knowledge on delirium management, are a valuable tool for healthcare organisations in promoting better delirium care for their older patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>FEP: Frail elderly project; DOS scale: Delirium observation screening scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CW, ML, and LS collectively developed the study design.
