A community randomized controlled trial (CRCT) of 60 health facility catchment areas (HFCAs) will be used to evaluate the impact of two rounds of MDA and fMDA interventions, relative to a control of no mass treatment, stratified by high and low transmission. Community residents in MDA HFCAs will be treated with DHAp at the end of the dry season (round one: November to December 2014) and the beginning of the rainy season (round two: February to March 2015). Community residents in fMDA HFCAs will be tested during the same two rounds for malaria parasites with a rapid diagnostic test; all positive individuals and all individuals living in their household will be treated with DHAp. Primary outcomes include malaria parasite prevalence (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,640 children aged one month to under five-years-old), as measured by pre- and post-surveys, and malaria parasite infection incidence (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,250 person-years among individuals aged three months and older), as measured by a monthly longitudinal cohort.

The Zambian government, through its National Malaria Control Centre (NMCC), has successfully scaled up the main World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended malaria control interventions (for example, long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and prompt effective treatment of malaria) over the past decade and is considering alternative strategies to further reduce malaria prevalence and burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While recognizing that eliminating malaria from the country may require many years to achieve, malaria elimination is a realistic milestone for Zambia in light of recent successes in reducing the malaria burden through a collaborative effort among the NMCC and its partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>During the 2012 dry season (June to November) in Southern Zambia, the effectiveness of three large-scale malaria mass test and treatment (MTAT) intervention rounds were assessed with a community randomized controlled trial (CRCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The MTAT intervention consisted of testing all individuals in intervention areas with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); all positive individuals were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL; MTAT-AL), which is the first-line drug for treating uncomplicated malaria in Zambia. The MTAT-AL intervention aimed to reduce community-wide malaria transmission by targeting persons infected with the asexual stage, and treating both asexual (blood) stage and immature sexual stage (immature gametocytes) infections of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite, thereby preventing onward transmission from infected individuals.</p><p>The results of the Zambia MTAT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as those from a recent trial of MTAT-AL in Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Zanzibar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], suggest that the use of MTAT-AL will likely be insufficient to achieve malaria elimination in many settings, for several important reasons. The generally short terminal elimination half-life of AL (less than three days), combined with the short duration of the treatment regimen (taken over three days), may provide little chemoprophylactic or chemo-suppressive protection against reinfection of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Shifting to a longer lasting antimalarial therapy, such as dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DHAp), will extend the chemo-prophylactic period and thereby help to extend the duration of transmission suppression during mass treatment interventions. DHAp has shown better efficacy compared to AL at clearing asexual blood stage malaria infections, but while DHA has a similarly short elimination half-life to AL, piperaquine has a significantly longer terminal elimination half-life of up to 63&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The results from the previous MTAT trials also suggest that alternatives to the MTAT antimalarial delivery strategy are needed. One alternative strategy to avoid some important limitations of MTAT involves treating all individuals within a specified target area with an effective antimalarial, irrespective of having a parasite infection identified by an RDT, which would constitute community-wide mass drug administration (MDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are several potential advantages of using MDA, especially if coupled with DHAp (MDA-DHAp), over MTAT-AL. First, RDTs used for diagnosis in the previous MTAT strategy have been shown to miss up to 50&#x000a0;% of low-density malaria parasite infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and thereby leave a substantial reservoir of infection in the community untreated, which may then sustain continued transmission. Such individuals with low-density parasite infections missed by RDTs under the MTAT will receive treatment under MDA. Second, because MDA-DHAp may also provide effective chemoprophylaxis against new infections for the entire target population (irrespective of RDT result), it is expected to provide a larger chemoprophylactic and chemo-suppressive effect to the community than limiting drug administration to only those individuals testing positive for a malaria infection by RDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As a result, MDA-DHAp is potentially more effective and cost-effective than MTAT, due both to clearance of low-density infections and by prevention of new infections in the entire population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>An alternative to community-wide MDA is focal MDA (fMDA), which combines aspects of both MTAT and MDA. fMDA, in this trial, consists of testing all individuals in the community for parasites using RDTs and treating those that are positive. But in households where anyone had a positive RDT, all household members are treated with an effective antimalarial, such as DHAp (MDA-DHAp), irrespective of each person&#x02019;s RDT result. As such, fMDA uses real-time information from RDT results to focus MDA activities to populations at greatest risk of having, as well and perhaps acquiring, an infection. Results of the 2012 MTAT-AL data analysis in this study site of Southern Province shows considerable clustering of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections identified by RDTs at the household level, suggesting that if one person tests positive, there is a higher chance (than random) that others in the house are also infected, potentially including those with low-density infections missed by RDTs. Such spatial clustering of infections in other settings has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. FMDA-DHAp may therefore provide a substantial advantage to MTAT-AL, in that it would clear more infections among individuals with parasite infections clustered in households, even among those with low-density infections missed by RDTs. Additionally, DHAp given to individuals in households using fMDA should provide sustained prophylactic protection for those individuals against new infections for up to two months, perhaps among those in the community most at risk of acquiring a new infection. At the same time, fMDA would limit drug exposure to those most at risk.</p><p>MDA and fMDA using DHAp represent two potential strategies to achieve greater clearance of human infection and reduction in the parasite reservoir, and both provide longer chemoprophylactic protection against new infections. The primary aim of this study is to quantify the relative effectiveness of MDA and fMDA with DHAp against no mass treatment for reducing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite prevalence, confirmed out-patient malaria case incidence, and monthly infection incidence in areas stratified by high and low malaria transmission. It is hypothesized that two rounds of fMDA and MDA with DHAp will be significantly more effective than no mass treatment (standard of care) at reducing these health outcomes. A secondary objective of this study is to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of the fMDA and MDA strategies with DHAp compared to no mass treatment.</p><p>Other outcomes related to the quality of program implementation will also be measured during this study to help understand why the MDA and fMDA with DHAp interventions were, or were not, found to be effective in this setting. These outcomes include: participant adherence of taking a full course of DHAp by the fMDA and MDA interventions; clearance of asexual stage parasites at day seven following the administration of DHAp; population coverage of the fMDA and MDA interventions in the study areas; and community acceptability of participating in the fMDA and MDA interventions.

To encourage participation, several activities were conducted in advance of and during the treatment campaigns in order to broaden and strengthen community awareness. First, information about the campaigns, the treatments, and the process were shared through the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health structures, including among community health workers to begin discussions at local levels. Second, community sensitization meetings were held throughout campaign areas across nine districts to inform leaders at the district level, including district councilors, religious leaders, and lead educators, and at the chiefdom level, with special outreach to chiefs, village headmen, local community health workers, and community members gathered for village entry meetings. Information, education, and communication materials were developed with the Zambia NMCC on malaria and pretested in campaign areas, containing behavior change communication messages for community members and community leaders. These were translated into the local language and distributed at these community sensitization meetings. Third, radio spots were developed and aired in the local language in target areas, along with a series of radio group episodes in which community members engaged with campaign health experts to learn about the program and discuss the benefits of participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Standard of care and control group</title><p>Standard of care in Zambia, including the study area in Southern Province, consists of identification of malaria infections and clinical cases through passive case detection at local health facilities or community health workers. Zambian national policy stipulates that individuals seeking care for a fever be given a malaria diagnostic test by RDT or microscopy. Individuals with confirmed malaria are then treated with the first-line antimalarial in Zambia, which is AL. When no diagnostic test is available at a health facility, a clinical diagnosis is made based on signs and symptoms, and treatment follows the identical protocol as with RDT-confirmed malaria cases. Standard of care does not include any kind of active surveillance for malaria parasite infection or mass treatment of the population with antimalarials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study design</title><p>A CRCT will be used to evaluate the impact of two rounds of the MDA-DHAp or fMDA-DHAp (the two intervention arms) at reducing malaria parasite infection prevalence and incidence, as well as malaria-related morbidity, compared to a control group receiving standard of care. Communities, or clusters, are defined by HFCAs and serve the unit of randomization. A total of 60 health facilities and their catchment areas are included in the study.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Stratification</title><p>As the impact of the MDA and fMDA interventions are expected to vary across malaria transmission strata, the 60 HFCAs included in the study have been stratified into high and low transmission strata. To do this, parasite prevalence in each HFCA was estimated with a kriged continuous surface of parasite prevalence from data from the baseline 2014 parasite survey. Catchments were then ranked from highest to lowest parasite prevalence. The top 30 HFCAs were included in the high transmission strata, while the bottom 30 were included in the low transmission strata; the resulting cut point between the high and low transmission strata was approximately 10&#x000a0;% parasite infection prevalence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Randomization sequence generation and allocation concealment</title><p>Pre-existing maps of HFCAs were used to classify households as belonging to a specific HFCA, which serve as the unit of randomization. To ensure balance across large and small HFCAs, which could potentially affect the quality of program implementation and other related unobserved confounding factors, HFCAs were characterized as having either a large or small population catchment size. This classification was based on a cut-point obtained from the mean population catchment size across the 60 HFCAs. Within the high and low transmission strata and the large and small population catchment size classifications, the random allocation rule will be used to assign HFCAs to the fMDA-DHAp, MDA-DHAp, or control group. As a result of this process and the stratification outlined above, the 60 total HFCAs are split into 10 HFCAs per treatment group (MDA, fMDA, and control) in the high transmission strata (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 HFCAs), and 10 HFCAs per treatment group (MDA, fMDA, and control) in the low transmission strata (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30 HFCAs).</p><p>After allocation, the appropriate intervention will be implemented in the entire catchment area according to treatment group assignment.

All children under six-years-old that slept in the house the night before the survey will be included in the sample. A complete enumeration and geo-referencing of all households in the study area serves as the sampling frame. To mitigate contamination between exposure groups (MDA, fMDA, and control) in the household sampling frame, sampling buffers of at least 1.5&#x000a0;km were derived for all HFCAs using GIS, in order to maintain an adequate distance between households in HFCAs with different exposure assignments (resulting in a gap of at least 3&#x000a0;km between sampled households in different HFCAs). A simple random sample of 47 households was then drawn within each of the 60 HFCAs (equal allocation sampling), to obtain the total sample size of 2,820 households in the 2014 baseline survey, after restricting the sampling frame for sampling buffers in GIS.

Toward that end, this study will assess the relative effectiveness of two mass treatment approaches at reducing the malaria burden beyond already implemented interventions of LLINs and IRS. The relative effectiveness of MDA and fMDA with DHAp will be established against a comparison of no mass treatment (standard of care) in areas with higher and lower malaria parasite prevalence using a community randomized control trial. The findings of this study will provide the Zambia NMCC and their partners with guidance on the most effective and cost-effective strategies to further reduce the size of the malaria parasite reservoir, malaria transmission, and the incidence of clinical disease in southern Zambia, and will hopefully show evidence of local transmission interruption.</p><p>The strengths of this trial include the fact that a rigorous study design (a CRCT) will be used to assess the impact of the MDA and fMDA interventions, as compared to a control of no mass treatment (standard of care). The study is also powered to assess differences between each treatment group (MDA and fMDA) and the control group, within areas of high and low transmission, with 80&#x000a0;% statistical power. The study uses robust measures of malaria parasite infection at the point of contact using RDTs, as well as PCR, for detecting low-density parasite infections, as part of the parasite surveys and the longitudinal cohort. The study also uses multiple methods for measuring malaria-related outcomes, including malaria parasite infection prevalence ascertained from a pre- and post-parasite survey, malaria parasite infection incidence using a longitudinal cohort of individuals selected randomly from within each HFCA, and confirmed malaria case incidence throughout the study using routine health management information system (HMIS) data in the study area. Buffer areas between contiguous HFCAs with different interventions are being used to limit contamination and misclassification bias. Measures of the quality of the implementation of the MDA and fMDA interventions will be obtained to help with the interpretation of results; these include MDA and fMDA population coverage, adherence to DHAp, parasite clearance after DHAp, community perceptions and acceptability of the MDA and fMDA interventions, and multiple measures of operational coverage. Lastly, a rigorous analysis plan will be followed, for assessing the impact of each intervention compared to a control group, while accounting for potential contextual and confounding factors within random-effect regression models.</p><p>Noted weaknesses of this trial include a less than ideal number of community randomization units (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;60), especially when stratified by high (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) and low (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) transmission strata. The sample size within the high and low transmission strata will only allow the detection of approximately a 50&#x000a0;% reduction in parasite prevalence and infection incidence between intervention groups, with 80&#x000a0;% statistical power; the threat of a type two error is therefore higher than ideal. The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle; there is potential for misclassification of exposure using this approach. Secondary analysis using a per-protocol approach will be used mitigate any misclassification of exposure. And lastly, there is always the potential for error in the measurement of outcomes, exposure to the interventions, and potential confounding factors in such a large and complex trial. We have gone to considerable length to try and minimize such error through the use of electronic data capture systems in the field and robust diagnostic methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study is ongoing.
