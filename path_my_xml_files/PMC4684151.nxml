In the absence of antiemetic prophylaxis, the risk of emesis with antineoplastic agents classified as moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) is 30%&#x02013;90%, and &#x0003e;90% with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). CINV can occur within the acute (0&#x02013;24 h) or delayed (25&#x02013;120 h) phases of chemotherapy, with increased severity in the delayed setting [<xref rid="MDV482C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Antiemetic treatment guidelines indicate that 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (RAs) effectively prevent and control CINV during the acute phase in subjects receiving MEC or HEC [<xref rid="MDV482C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV482C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but are generally less effective in preventing CINV in the delayed phase [<xref rid="MDV482C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="MDV482C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Aprepitant and fosaprepitant dimeglumine, the water-soluble prodrug that is rapidly converted to aprepitant after intravenous (i.v.) administration, are potent and selective neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) RAs that are effective against CINV in both acute and delayed phases when added to a standard antiemetic regimen (a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA and dexamethasone) in subjects receiving HEC and AC-based chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDV482C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV482C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

Another phase III trial also reported CR improvements with the NK<sub>1</sub> RA, rolapitant, in a large MEC population stratified based on AC and non-AC regimens; &#x0003e;50% of subjects in the study received AC-based regimens [<xref rid="MDV482C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large, global, randomized, controlled superiority trial to prospectively evaluate treatment with a single-dose i.v.

Taken together, the overall efficacy findings support the clinical benefit provided by the fosaprepitant regimen in a non-AC MEC population.</p><p>The fosaprepitant regimen was generally well tolerated in the current study, and no new safety signals were noted compared with previous fosaprepitant studies [<xref rid="MDV482C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDV482C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. AE profiles for the two treatment regimens were similar and consistent with those in subjects receiving emetogenic chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDV482C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An imbalance in deaths between the treatment arms was observed, but a careful review of each case suggested that these were likely to reflect progression of the underlying disease process, and no deaths were assessed as likely to be related to the study drug by the investigators. Finally, although higher infusion-site AE rates have been previously observed with fosaprepitant [<xref rid="MDV482C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MDV482C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="MDV482C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], only three cases of infusion-site thrombophlebitis were reported in the fosaprepitant group for this study.</p><p>This study included a large, well-balanced non-AC MEC population regarding the types of chemotherapy regimens and agents administered. While these findings indicate that a single-dose fosaprepitant regimen can potentially offer the convenience of completing all antiemetic treatment before MEC initiation in a single day, the study was not designed to evaluate treatment differences among subgroups across the full heterogeneity of the MEC population. Unlike HEC regimens, which are generally homogeneous in terms of emetogenic potential (&#x0003e;90%), the risk of emesis in MEC populations ranges from 30% to 90% and is complicated by factors such as chemotherapy sequence and dosing, as well as multiday treatment regimens [<xref rid="MDV482C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV482C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, in this trial, the majority of subjects received a single-day, non-AC MEC regimen by design, with carboplatin being the most commonly used MEC agent. Although less emetogenic than the classic HEC agent, cisplatin, carboplatin is likely to be in the &#x02018;upper end&#x02019; of the current MEC emetogenicity classification. Additionally, MEC&#x02013;LEC combination regimens may increase the risk of emesis versus MEC or LEC alone. Antiemetic guidelines advise that additional antiemetic treatment may be needed for chemotherapy regimens that extend beyond day 1 because the risk periods for acute and delayed emesis overlap after the first day of chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDV482C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="MDV482C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The role of NK<sub>1</sub> RA, such as i.v. fosaprepitant, in the non-AC MEC setting may be better defined through additional subgroup analyses of this study population to identify specific MEC subpopulations that are more likely to respond to antiemetic treatment and to determine whether additional prophylactic antiemetic treatment is warranted for multiday chemotherapy regimens. While it is recognized that additional studies may be needed to fine-tune future antiemetic guidelines within the heterogeneous MEC population (e.g. exploring differences between carboplatin and noncarboplatin-containing regimens and between single-day versus multiday antiemetic regimens), our findings clearly demonstrate the benefit of fosaprepitant for the prevention of CINV in a well-defined MEC population. This adds to the available evidence for aprepitant in non-AC-based MEC regimens [<xref rid="MDV482C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and suggests that the role of adding an NK<sub>1</sub> RA in the overall MEC setting, such as aprepitant/fosaprepitant, in all antiemetic guidelines warrants further discussion.</p></sec><sec id="mdv482_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This study was not supported by a grant.
