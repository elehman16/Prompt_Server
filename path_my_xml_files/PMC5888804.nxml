The research was nonequivalent control groups pre and post study. A total of 54 patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (control = 28, experimental = 26) were recruited from 3 setting locations in South Korea. Test measures were completed before and after the 16 sessions. The experimental group received two 80-minute evaluations per week for 8 weeks. Demographic information: hand dexterity, self-expression, mood depression, and quality of life measurements. There were significant differences in hand dexterity (<italic>t</italic> = 4.96, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), self-expression (<italic>t</italic> = 3.74, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), mood depression (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;11.85, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), and quality of life (<italic>t</italic> = 8.07, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) between the 2 groups.

The number of PD patients is rapidly rising proportionately compared with a growing senior population. Currently, PD is diagnosed in 428 cases per 100 000 individuals between the ages of 60 and 70 years and 2990 cases per 10 000 in those aged 70 years and older.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> As of 2014, PD patients are estimated at 7.5 million people worldwide and projected to double by 2030.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>PD is a chronic muscular condition that leads to progressive muscle deterioration, induces dementia and decreases mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Common physical symptoms include hand tremors, stiffness, and difficulty walking.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, PD patients can appear cold, unfeeling, and angry, which can lead to restriction of activities and interaction with others.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Lyons et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported that due to physical impairments, individuals with PD tend to have a more negative personality, decreased quality of life, and limited interaction with their environment. An individual&#x02019;s psychological responses to these physical limitations can include loss of independence, depression, obsessive compulsive thinking, phobia, and stress.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>PD is a noncurable condition that requires constant patient support and treatment. There are complementary therapies such as speech, occupational, physical, and creative art to relieve PD symptoms. Each therapy offers distinct advantages and resources for patients to alleviate their symptoms; however the other therapies do not combine the imaginative and stimulating elements of art. This study concentrates on clay art versus other therapies because the art making process is creative, interactive, and allows patients to cope with physical or mental limitations.</p><p>Clay is a frequently used art material because of its accessibility and adaptability. It is a very supple material for PD patients to work with. Clay is neutral, and through tactile manipulation, the hands move and perceive the textures and qualities of the clay.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This process can stimulate all of the body senses and is known to hold regressive qualities.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>(pp127-142)</sup> Clay art making process is interactive between the patient, materials, and their environment.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> More specifically, clay art provides a perceptible vehicle by which something is created with imagination and skill, enabling expression of important ideas or feelings.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p><p>The physical activity is the key facilitator. Through interaction with clay, kinesthetic experiences of physical actions and movements release energy and sensory focuses on the experiences of both external and internal sensations.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> PD patients can establish a sensory dialogue between themselves and their surroundings with clay art therapy.</p><p>Free clay manipulation is an effective sensorimotor solution in rehabilitation,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and can reduce physical symptoms of tremors and stiffness in PD patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> To support this point, clay art therapy is an alternative treatment that promotes the enhancement of various aspects of mental and physical health in long-term care.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p><p>In short, this study suggests that patients are having a &#x0201c;dialogue&#x0201d; with the clay, which can create a bridge between themselves and their surroundings. This connection allows individuals to reflect back positive aspects of their &#x0201c;core self&#x0201d; despite the adversity of their condition. The study will examine the data compiled from the 2 groups and attempt to establish evidence for clay art therapy as a clinical treatment for PD patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2515690X18765943"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2515690X18765943"><title>Design</title><p>This observational study used a nonequivalent group pre-post design for 8 weeks.

The study findings revealed statistically significant: improved hand dexterity, better mood, elevated self-expression, and enhanced quality of life. Creating art can help distract PD patients from thoughts of the disease, and stimulating a relaxed, peaceful state of mind.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
</p><p>Clay manipulation involves tactile sensations, which stimulates and coordinates physical sensorimotor hand usages along with ocular movements. With hand manipulation and direct contact with clay, &#x0201c;skin sense&#x0201d; is instantly reflected back, as a sensory perception to an individual&#x02019;s mind. Clay art therapy creates, both a psychological and physiological environment, for PD patients to experience and cultivate a better quality of life.</p><p>In a study by Elkis-Abuhoff et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> a PD group engaging in the clay medium had a greater decrease of emotional stress and somatic symptoms than a non-PD group. Goldblatt et al<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> has also reported that using clay art therapy reduced negative ruminating thoughts in 22 PD patients. All of the above referenced participants, showed significantly lower measures of depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and phobic anxiety as a result of the manipulation of modeling clay. This research shows how PD patients can engage in creative expression to value individuality, bolster creativity, promote memories, maintain motor skills, and expand their overall aesthetic experience while in treatment.</p><p>The aforementioned research,<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> coincides with the results of this study, to reveal similar statistics that support the use of clay manipulation for PD patients. This study&#x02019;s experimental group using clay art therapy produced significant beneficial effects in scores of depression compared with the control group. This result found that clay art should be further pursued as a complementary therapy to discharge negative emotionality, subjectivity and physicality in PD patients.</p><p>In 2013, Abramowitz<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> reported that 4 females, ranging in age from 86 to 93 years, participated in a clay art therapy course for 15 months, and conducted posttherapy interviews about their experiences. Their feedback indicated that each individual experienced higher levels of self-expression through &#x0201c;tactile applications of clay&#x0201d; versus other forms of art like dancing, painting, or singing.</p><p>This study showed significant improvement in PD patients&#x02019; self-expression after 8 weeks of molding clay. The evidence suggests that clay art work allows people to connect their internal and external worlds. PD patients can release emotions, by applying control over their feelings through their hands. In effect, they can experience relaxation, pleasure and fulfillment because working with the clay simultaneously creates something for personal satisfaction as well as reveals inner emotions to themselves and others.</p><p>In addition, based on this study, the pre-post test scores highlighted statistically significant in hand dexterity. The findings revealed that the clay medium lends itself best to manipulation with both hands. Each patient can squeeze, roll, and form clay to experience a form of self-expression that overcomes their physical limitations.</p><p>Previous studies<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> have reported that clay art work allows kinesthetic motor impulses to emerge and introduces sensory body awareness through the sense of touch. Consistent with our findings, clay manipulation stimulates hand dexterity. Patients can squeeze, roll, and form clay to experience a form of self-expression that helps alleviate psychological, physical, neurological, and cognitive impairments.</p><p>In summary, clay art is an empowering tool for PD patients to strengthen their inherent abilities through a creative process. The process is impulsive and imaginative. With clay art therapy, PD patients can gain perspective, value, and reality to their inner self. With this study, we suggest continued research with clay art to develop strategic methods that will improve hand dexterity, enhance patient interaction, refine testing/data collection systems, and introduce it as a potential component of standard rehabilitation.</p><sec id="section15-2515690X18765943"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, to strengthen this evidence-based study, the PDQ-39 scale versus PDQOL-37 scale Korean version could have been used. Second, research on the effects of clay art therapy with PD patients has been limited because previous studies<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2515690X18765943" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> also included physical exercise or training as test measures. Third, patient diversity in the study sample was limited by geography, all participants came from the same city, Busan, despite attempts to recruit candidates from different cities. Fourth, the effects of anti-Parkinson&#x02019;s medication were not considered. Dosage evaluations would have affected results. Fifth, this study did not factor in minimal clinically important difference values. Minimal clinically important differences would have analyzed the impact of clay art therapy on PD patient&#x02019;s functional abilities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section16-2515690X18765943"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study&#x02019;s results indicate that clay art therapy can affect PD patients overall mental and physical condition in long-term care centers. Clay art therapy can even allow PD patients to experience and possibly develop new interpersonal or social relationships with in a group setting.</p><p>Social interaction or activities can boost self-confidence, increase emotional stability, and enhance the quality of life for PD patients. Clay modeling also helps alleviate the physical symptoms of PD such as muscle rigidity, tremors, fatigue, impaired speech, and sleep disorders.</p><p>These findings have important implications for clay art as a nonpharmacological form of therapy. Therefore, this study suggests that clay work&#x02019;s potentiality for implementation as a clinical model should be explored and advanced for PD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank all staff, PD patients, and volunteers participating in this research study conducted at Sungshim, Inchang, and Joeunaein long-term care centers.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2515690X18765943"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> Y-SB was involved with understanding the original research articles, writing of the reviews, and editing.
