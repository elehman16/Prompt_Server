This study evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) pretreatment on the
incidence and severity of etomidate-induced myoclonus. Ninety patients undergoing
elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated to three groups (n=30 each) for
intravenous administration of 10 mL isotonic saline (group I), 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX in 10 mL
isotonic saline (group II), or 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX in 10 mL isotonic saline (group III)
over 10 min. All groups subsequently received 0.3 mg/kg etomidate by intravenous push
injection. The incidence and severity of myoclonus were recorded for 1 min after
etomidate administration and the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events that
occurred between the administration of the DEX infusion and 1 min after tracheal
intubation was recorded. The incidence of myoclonus was significantly reduced in
groups II and III (30.0 and 36.7%), compared with group I (63.3%). The incidence of
severe sinus bradycardia was significantly increased in group III compared with group
I (P&#x0003c;0.05), but there was no significant difference in heart rate in groups I and
II. There were no significant differences in the incidence of low blood pressure
among the 3 groups. Pretreatment with 0.5 and 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX significantly reduced the
incidence of etomidate-induced myoclonus during anesthetic induction; however, 0.5
&#x000b5;g/kg DEX is recommended because it had fewer side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>Etomidate</kwd><kwd>Myoclonus</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="25"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When introduced in 1973, etomidate was a novel induction agent with a stable
cardiovascular profile and minimal respiratory side effects, and as such is still widely
used for hemodynamically unstable patients (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
However, it has two well-known and disturbing side effects, injection pain and
myoclonus, that have been widely discussed in the literature. Injection pain has been
minimized by a new lipid formulation of etomidate (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, suppression of myoclonus continues to be a clinical problem as a
common side effect of etomidate administration during induction of anesthesia. The
incidence of myoclonus has been reported to be as high as 50-80% (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The consequences of this side effect can be serious in nonfasted
emergency patients, patients with open eye injuries, or patients with limited
cardiovascular reserves (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanism of etomidate-induced myoclonus is still not clear, a number of
drugs have been investigated for their ability to suppress these myoclonic movements.
Pretreatment with benzodiazepines (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), opioids
(<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and rocuronium (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) have been shown to reduce myoclonus to some extent.
Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a strong, highly selective &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist with a wide
spectrum of pharmacological properties. It provides sedation, anxiolysis, and hypnosis,
as well as analgesia, and has sympatholytic properties. However, few studies have
evaluated the effects of DEX on myoclonus after etomidate injection. This study aimed to
investigate the effects of DEX pretreatment on the incidence and severity of myoclonus
during anesthesia induction with etomidate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>This study was approved by the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, China;
eligible participants gave written informed consent. The study population consisted
of 90 patients of both genders, aged 18 to 60 years, classified as American Society
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, and scheduled for elective
surgery under general anesthesia. Inclusion criteria were a body mass index &#x02264;35
kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no bradycardia, no upper respiratory infection during the 2
weeks before surgery, no history of asthma, no chronic cough, and no routine use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Patients with adrenal cortex dysfunction,
neurologic disease, psychiatric disorders or drug allergy, or who had received
sedatives, analgesics, or opioids within the previous 24 h were excluded.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups of 30 patients each using a
computer-generated table of random numbers, and given isotonic saline (group I), 0.5
&#x000b5;g/kg DEX (group II), or 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX (group III).</p></sec><sec><title>Anesthesia induction and data collection</title><p>None of the patients received any premedication. After entering the operating room,
all patients were given an electrocardiogram (ECG), and their pulse oxygen saturation
(SpO<sub>2</sub>), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and bispectral index
(BIS) were monitored. A 20-gauge cannula was inserted into the dorsum of the
patient's hand and connected to a T-connector for drug administration; Ringer lactate
was infused at a rate of 4-6 mL/min. Before anesthesia induction, 0.5 or 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg
dexmedetomidine (batch #13070534; Hengrui Medicine, China) in 10 mL isotonic saline
was infused in groups II or III, respectively, over 10 min. In group I, 10 mL
isotonic saline was infused over 10 min. When the infusion was completed, 0.3 mg/kg
etomidate (batch #20131106; Enhua Medicine, China) was injected intravenously over a
period of 1 min.</p><p>Patients were observed continuously for myoclonus for 1 min by a physician who was
blinded to all group treatments. Myoclonic movements were defined as involuntary
short muscle contractions leading to short observable movements in parts of the body.
The intensity of myoclonus was graded as 0, no myoclonus; 1, mild myoclonus (short
movements of a body segment, e.g., a finger or a wrist only); 2, moderate myoclonus
(mild movements of two different muscles, e.g., face and leg); and 3, severe
myoclonus (intense clonic movements in two or more muscle groups, e.g., fast
adduction of a limb).</p><p>After administration of etomidate and evaluation of myoclonus, all patients were
injected with 3 &#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl. When the BIS index was less than 50, 0.15 mg/kg
cisatracurium was given to facilitate tracheal intubation. Maintenance anesthesia was
provided by sevoflurane with 50% oxygen and 50% air to achieve a BIS value of 45-55
and a 1 &#x003bc;g/kg remifentanyl bolus followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>-1</sup>.
Mechanical ventilation was administered to maintain an end-expiratory carbon dioxide
concentration of 35-40 mmHg.</p><p>Between DEX infusion and 1 min after tracheal intubation, an intravenous injection of
50 &#x000b5;g phenylephrine was administered if blood pressure was low (systolic blood
pressure &#x0003c;90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x0003c;60 mmHg), or an intravenous
injection of 0.5 mg atropine was administered if severe sinus bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50
bpm) occurred. Occurrences of low blood pressure and severe sinus bradycardia were
recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The incidence of myoclonus in the isotonic saline group (group I) was expected to be
80% based on previous studies (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A minimum
of 28 patients in each group was required to detect a 50% difference in the incidence
of myoclonus at a significance level of 95% and a power of 80%. We included 30
patients in each group.</p><p>Data are reported as means&#x000b1;SD or number and percent. Statistical analyses were
performed using the Statistical Product for Social Sciences (SPSS) software 16.0
(Chicago, SPSS Inc.). The frequencies of myoclonus, low blood pressure, severe sinus
bradycardia, and proportions of gender as well as ASA (American Society of
Anesthesiologists) class were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact
test with Bonferroni correction. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
compare the ages and weights among the 3 groups. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p>There were no significant differences among the 3 groups with regard to age, gender,

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrated that DEX pretreatment significantly reduced the incidence of
etomidate-induced myoclonus in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on the severity
of myoclonus. Pretreatment with 1 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX increased the risk of severe sinus
bradycardia during anesthesia induction, but intravenous injection of atropine 0.5 mg
was useful for reversing that condition.</p><p>Etomidate is widely used as an anesthetic induction agent in clinical practice. Several
desirable properties, such as rapid onset (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>),
brevity of action (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), lack of cardiovascular
depression (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and protection of intracranial
pressure (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), make it an attractive agent for
rapid sequence intubation. However, etomidate is also associated with two side effects,
injection pain and myoclonus. Pain on injection has been largely eliminated by use of a
lipid formulation of etomidate, but myoclonus remains a common problem during anesthesia
induction. Etomidate-induced myoclonus can have serious consequences, such as vitreous
prolapse in a patient with open eye injury (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).
Moreover, ECG leads may become detached during myoclonic movements, and decreased oxygen
saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry, has been reported (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain myoclonus. For example, it was reported
that myoclonus resulted from temporal subcortical disinhibition similar to irritable leg
syndrome, which is characterized by uncomfortable legs, irritability, inability to
sleep, and numbness, but not related to epileptic activity (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Many physical methods and drugs have been reported to prevent
myoclonus associated with etomidate. Schwarzkopf et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) observed decreased myoclonic incidence after intravenous administration
of 0.015 mg/kg midazolam. However, intravenous midazolam injection could induce
respiratory depression and sedation. Pretreatment with high doses (greater than 100 &#x000b5;g)
of fentanyl before etomidate could effectively decrease the incidence of myoclonus, but
also caused an increase in apnea incidence during anesthesia induction (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Choi et al. (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported that pretreatment with rocuronium significantly reduced the
frequency of myoclonus after etomidate injection by blocking transmission at the
neuromuscular junction; however, it was accompanied with some disadvantages associated
with muscle relaxants, such as airway obstruction, regurgitation, and aspiration. An
ideal drug for preventing myoclonus should be short-acting, not produce significant
depression on respiration and hemodynamics, and not prolong recovery from
anesthesia.</p><p>DEX, an &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist having analgesic and anxiolytic activity, is widely used
for anesthesia and intensive care (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Salman et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) reported that 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX could be used for pretreatment with etomidate
without significant cardiovascular side effects, especially in patients with low cardiac
reserve. Mizrak et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) reported that 0.5
&#x000b5;g/kg DEX was effective in reducing the incidence and severity of etomidate-induced
myoclonic muscle movements. In our study, we used two doses of DEX, 0.5 and 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg,
to evaluate its effect on the myoclonus induced by etomidate. Both doses of DEX
significantly reduced the incidence of myoclonus from 63.3% without pretreatment to
36.7% at 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg and 30.0% at 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg, which is similar to the results reported by
Mizrak et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). At the higher dose of DEX,
the incidence of hypotension and severe sinus bradycardia was increased, but there were
no significant differences in low blood pressure among the 3 groups. Compared with
groups I and II, the incidence of severe sinus bradycardia in group III increased
significantly. Bradycardia and hypotension are the major side effects observed following
DEX infusion, and bradycardia is attributed to a reflex response to transient
hypertension at the beginning of infusion. Transient hypertensive responses have been
observed with higher DEX doses (1-4 &#x000b5;g/kg). This is attributed to initial stimulation of
&#x003b1;-2B adrenergic receptors present in vascular smooth muscles. A subsequent decrease in
heart rate is due to a decrease in central sympathetic outflow. Koroglu et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) reported that a high dose of DEX (a bolus of 2-3
&#x000b5;g/kg over 10 min or infusion of 1.5-3.0 &#x000b5;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>) in children
undergoing MRI produced bradycardia in 16% of the patients. Hypotension is attributed to
decreased central sympathetic outflow. In our study, there were no significant
differences in the incidence of hypotension among the 3 groups. Our findings suggested
that 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg DEX infusion over 10 min before anesthetic induction may be safer.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that we used only two doses of DEX to evaluate its effect
on myoclonus induced by etomidate. We used only two doses because previous studies
showed that DEX used as a premedicant at doses of 0.5-1 &#x000b5;g/kg had sedative and
anesthetic-sparing effects, as well as attenuating airway/circulatory reflexes during
anesthesia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Further studies are required to
determine the minimal dose of DEX that will suppress myoclonic movements without causing
side effects. Moreover, we infused DEX by an infusion pump over 10 min. Under some
emergency conditions, the time should be shorter; thus it is necessary to find another
way of administering DEX more rapidly and without side effects.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that pretreatment with DEX at 0.5 and 1.0 &#x000b5;g/kg before
etomidate administration during anesthetic induction could significantly reduce the
incidence of myoclonus. DEX at 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg is recommended because it is associated with
fewer side effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><label>Acknowledgments</label><p>Research supported by the Health Bureau Project of Lianyungang (#1401).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>First published online.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ruth</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Burton</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intravenous etomidate for procedural sedation in
