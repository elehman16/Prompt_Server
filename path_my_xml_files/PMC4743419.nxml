Preclinical studies suggest that weight loss from caloric restriction and increased physical activity may suppress hormonal, energy-sensing, and inflammatory factors that drive neoplastic progression; however, exact mechanisms are yet to be determined, and experiments in humans are limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial among 40 overweight or obese, newly-diagnosed prostate cancer patients who elected prostatectomy to explore feasibility of a presurgical weight loss intervention that promoted a weight loss of roughly one kg. week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> via caloric restriction and physical activity, as well as to assess effects on tumor biology and circulating biomarkers. Measures of feasibility (accrual, retention, adherence, and safety) were primary endpoints. Exploratory aims were directed at the intervention&#x02019;s effect on tumor proliferation (Ki-67) and other tumor markers (activated caspase-3, insulin and androgen receptors, VEGF, TNF&#x003b2;, NF&#x003ba;B, and 4E-BP1), circulating biomarkers (PSA, insulin, glucose, VEGF, TNF&#x003b2;, leptin, SHBG, and testosterone), lymphocytic gene expression of corresponding factors and cellular bioenergetics in neutrophils, and effects on the gut microbiome. Consenting patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either: 1) weight loss via a healthful, guidelines-based diet and exercise regimen; or 2) a wait-list control. While biological testing is currently ongoing, this paper details our methods and feasibility outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The accrual target was met after screening 101 cases (enrollment rate: 39.6&#x000a0;%). Other outcomes included a retention rate of 85&#x000a0;%, excellent adherence (95&#x000a0;%), and no serious reported adverse events. No significant differences by age, race, or weight status were noted between enrollees vs. non-enrollees. The most common reasons for non-participation were &#x0201c;too busy&#x0201d; (30&#x000a0;%), medical exclusions (21&#x000a0;%), and &#x0201c;distance&#x0201d; (16&#x000a0;%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Presurgical trials offer a means to study the impact of diet and exercise interventions directly on tumor tissue, and other host factors that are feasible and safe, though modifications are needed to conduct trials within an abbreviated period of time and via distance medicine-based approaches.

Currently, there is consensus that obesity serves as a risk factor for eight different malignancies, i.e., endometrial, colorectal, renal, esophageal, breast (post-menopausal), thyroid, gall bladder, and pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, obesity also serves as a poor prognostic indicator for several other cancers &#x02013; at least 15 in total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In prostate cancer, obesity is not associated with the overall risk for disease, but it does place men at increased risk for more aggressive cancer and disease-specific mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A recent multinational study involving 10,106 prostate cancer cases from eight cohorts with an average follow-up of 8.2&#x000a0;years found that each 5 unit increase in prediagnostic body mass index (BMI: kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with an 8&#x000a0;% increase in mortality (p-trend&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Weight gain after diagnosis and primary treatment was examined in an earlier study among 26,479 prostate cancer patients; here, each 5 unit increase in BMI was associated with 21&#x000a0;% increased risk of biochemical recurrence (Relative Risk: 1.21, 95&#x000a0;% Confidence Interval: 1.11-1.31 P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Despite strong observational evidence that a higher BMI is associated with more aggressive and progressive cancer, major gaps exist in our understanding of that relationship with key research questions being: Are weight loss interventions feasible in populations with cancer? Does intentional weight loss result in improved cancer control? What are the mechanisms by which negative energy balance affects tumor biology and the host environment? Are the effects of caloric restriction and increased energy expenditure through physical activity similar or do they differ?</p><p>To date, there have been roughly 20 weight loss trials among various oncology patient populations that have been completed or are currently in the field that address some of these questions. Most of these trials have been conducted in breast cancer survivors and are modest in size; results show feasibility, safety, and a significant impact on reducing adiposity and improving health-related quality of life - largely focusing on physical functioning and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, many have assessed the impact of weight loss on circulating biomarkers, such as insulin and related entities (insulin-like growth factors and binding proteins), adipokines, inflammatory markers, sex steroid hormones, and related binding proteins. Findings have been compiled in a review by Reeves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and show significant reductions in insulin in 2-of-6 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and leptin in 3-of-3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; however, other results are inconclusive largely due to inadequate statistical power. As of yet, no studies have been completed that assess the impact of intentional weight loss on recurrence or cancer-specific mortality, though there are currently two European trials in the field with this goal, i.e., the Simultaneous Study of Docetaxel-Gemcitabine Combination adjuvant treatment, and Extended Bisphosphonate and Surveillance (SUCCESS-C) and the Diet and Androgens (DIANA-5) trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In prostate cancer, there have been only three reported weight loss studies. The largest of these, the RENEW trial (Reach Out to ENhancE Wellness in Older Cancer Survivors) enrolled 261 prostate cancer survivors within a study cohort that also included 380 other survivors of breast and colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, significant reductions in body weight occurred and were associated with improvements in physical functioning (the primary endpoint of the trial). The two other randomized trials have been modest in size with sample sizes of 8 and 19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and also showed successful weight loss. In the trial by Wright et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] pre-post changes in serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3 were observed between the control (&#x02212;6.9&#x000a0;%) and intervention groups (+2.8&#x000a0;%); though no differences were observed in insulin, c-peptide, IGF-1 and adiponectin &#x02013; again, likely due to inadequate power. Despite the fact that both of these last two trials were conducted in the presurgical setting, neither investigated the impact of caloric restriction on tumor tissue.</p><p>The ability to ascertain the impact of interventions directly on tumor tissue is considered a particular strength of presurgical trials, and it is reasoned that by monitoring intervention effects on Ki-67 proliferation rates (a well-accepted tumor marker used for pharmacologic studies and also one that has shown to be sensitive to changes in diet and nutritional status) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the efficacy of an intervention could be assessed in a much shorter period of time and with much smaller numbers of participants; moreover, the biological mechanisms through which the intervention exerts its therapeutic potential could be ascertained directly. Originally proposed as a resourceful way of testing chemopreventive agents, Kelloff and colleagues proposed the use of presurgical models over a wide range of cancers in a hallmark paper published over two decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since this time, they have been used for the evaluation of therapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but have been used far less frequently to assess the impact of complementary therapies that encompass diet and exercise with the expressed intent of assessing the impact of the intervention on the tumor. While the biological effects of lifestyle interventions are believed to be far less potent than pharmacological agents, a phase II RCT conducted among 161 patients scheduled for prostatectomy found significantly lower Ki-67 proliferation indexes in men randomized to receive a 3-week regimen of 30&#x000a0;g/day of ground flaxseed vs. those who did not receive it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Thus, this trial serves as proof of concept that presurgical trials are indeed viable and valuable for testing lifestyle interventions. However, their use has not been evaluated in studies of energy balance that are aimed at assessing the impact of caloric restriction or increased physical activity on tumor tissue.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to describe a pioneering NIH-funded (R21 CA161263) RCT that utilizes a pre-surgical model to explore the feasibility and effects of a diet and exercise weight loss intervention on tumor proliferation rates (Ki-67), as well as other outcomes in men with newly-diagnosed prostate cancer. Herein, we describe the study design, research protocol, and the necessary adjustments made in order to conduct the presurgical weight loss trial in men who elected prostatectomy as their first line of treatment for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design/Specific aims</title><p>This two-armed (experimental arm: assigned immediately to a healthful energy-restricted diet&#x02009;+&#x02009;exercise intervention to promote a mean weight loss of 2 pounds/week vs. wait-list control arm: assigned to receive the intervention post-surgery) randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 40 overweight or obese men newly-diagnosed with prostate cancer was designed as a feasibility study to explore whether weight loss during the presurgical period was feasible and associated with favorable changes in tumor biology and the host environment. While the basic structure of the trial is almost identical to that of the original NIH application, some modifications were necessary to overcome barriers and to implement the trial in a real-world setting; these modifications are indicated in the subsequent paragraphs. This protocol and all amendments were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (F11051002), in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and registered and reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines (NCT01886677).

<sup>a</sup> This criteria was changed from that of the original study (i.e., 10&#x000a0;weeks), because potential recruits were unwilling to delay their surgery; therefore, we modified this criteria to correspond to that of our previous RCT in which we found significant effects with a 3-week dietary regimen.

To help defray costs associated with study participation and reduce potential barriers to accrual, men were offered a monetary incentive of $15 for each clinic assessment they completed, as well as $15/week to participate in clinic-based physical activity sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomization</title><p>After all baseline data and biospecimens were collected, men were randomized stratified on race (African American vs. others) and baseline BMI (25&#x02013;29.9 vs. 30+) to assure an even balance amongst study arms regarding both factors which have been found previously to influence disease progression or intervention adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Dietitian follow-up occurred twice weekly with counseling either provided face-to-face, via the telephone or through email. In each session, dietary intakes were reviewed, reinforcement provided, and challenges of the upcoming week were discussed in an effort to problem solve and arrive at potential strategies. The overarching theoretical framework for this intervention was provided by Social Cognitive Theory which emphasizes the importance of self-efficacy, skills development, and self-monitoring in producing behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>In addition, exercise physiologists also provided counseling on regimens that ultimately would afford up to an additional 250 to 500 kcal (kcal)/day deficit primarily through aerobic exercise. As per the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines, each training session included not only the work-out, but also a 5-min warm-up and cool down of slow walking and stretching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. An incremental approach for the workout was employed with ramping of intensity and volume from 60 to 80&#x000a0;% of maximum heart rate (MHR) as tolerance permitted. Participants were encouraged to exercise at UAB twice weekly under supervision where they trained on ergometers and treadmills, and 5 times/week at home; they were provided with heart rate monitors and instruction for use during these sessions to enhance and monitor adherence. Trainers employed similar scheduling and approaches to that of the dietitians and downloaded heart rate monitors regularly. Given that some participants resided hundreds of miles from the study site, on-site training was not possible and necessitated a regimen that relied exclusively on regular telephone counseling and/or email exchanges and routinely scheduled downloads of heart rate monitor data. Additional coaching was provided during each contact with the participant, regardless of whether the contact was made by the dietitian or the exercise trainer, since we sought to use every opportunity to reinforce the intervention. The concession to deliver the weight loss regimen through a distance-medicine approach was made when we discovered that most patients who elected to receive their prostatectomies at the two study sites came from a broad catchment area that included Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Wait-listed control arm (delayed weight loss regimen)</title><p>As in the experimental arm, these participants were apprised of suboptimal nutrient intakes that were apparent from 24-h recalls and counseled by dietitians on food sources to correct any nutritional inadequacies with follow-up on a weekly basis.

Self-reported physical activity data were further supported by the collection of objective heart rate monitor data using the Polar RS400 (Polar Electro, Inc., Lake Success, NY) for each 3-day collection period.

Therefore, this trial will be the first to assess the impact of an acute period of negative energy balance directly on the biology of the tumor, as well as within the more global host environment. Given the growing interest in weight control as a complementary therapy to standard cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], such trials can provide the mechanistic evidence needed to justify the incorporation of diet and physical activity into oncologic practice. As such, the methods listed herein can offer a helpful framework for the design of future trials, as well as data on feasibility that can be used to specifically inform recruitment, retention, and the design of presurgical interventions.</p><p>Given the need to collect surgical specimens, presurgical trials dictate collaboration with co-investigators and cancer centers that perform substantial numbers of procedures annually. Physician turnover and changes in practice can cause unforeseen delays and in fact, occurred with this trial. Therefore, partnerships with other institutions are necessary and were instrumental in achieving targeted accrual within the two-year timeframe of this study. Nevertheless, patient indecision regarding surgical treatment and its timing pose substantial barriers to both recruitment and retention. Patients are unwilling to delay their surgery and it was clear that if we were to meet our accrual target, we needed to reduce our initial 10-week intervention period to a shorter period of time. As stated, 3-weeks was selected based on the results of our previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other issues related to presurgical studies are the possibilities that surgeries can be rescheduled and patients can decide to receive their treatment elsewhere or not at all. Therefore, an adequate margin of over accrual is necessary to ultimately meet sample sizes that afford adequate power.</p><p>Our enrollment rate of almost 40&#x000a0;% was relatively good for a diet and exercise intervention trial among cancer survivors where reported rates of participation have ranged from 6&#x000a0;% to 42&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The modifications made to shorten the study period, as well as to deliver the intervention primarily through a home-based approach that relied on telephone counseling and technologic support likely enhanced our participation. Other criteria, such as those set to assure safety are not as amenable to change and the fact that we did not observe any serious adverse events provides further support to the medical exclusions that were made. However, given that distance and travel still were listed as one of the top reasons for refusal, it might be possible to overcome these barriers through an added participant incentive or a higher reimbursement rate for travel. Fifteen dollars was all the current grant could afford and may have been too low a stipend especially if the distance between the patient&#x02019;s home and the study site is substantial.</p><p>Finally, both retention and adherence exceeded the benchmarks established for this trial. Moreover, with the exception of only two men who were dissatisfied with their randomization status, there was solid rapport between the study staff and participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This presurgical feasibility trial met all benchmarks related to accrual, retention, adherence, and safety. As analyses are completed, the potential impact of the weight loss intervention on these biologic outcomes can be determined and subsequently reported.
