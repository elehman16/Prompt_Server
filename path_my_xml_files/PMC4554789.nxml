Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) has been reported to exert an antiatherogenic effect by inducing regression of atherosclerotic plaques in animal experimental studies. In this study, the antiatherogenic effect of GSPE has been investigated in clinical use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Consecutive 287 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic carotid plaques or abnormal plaque free carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) were randomly assigned to the GSPE group (<italic>n</italic> = 146) or control group (<italic>n</italic> = 141). The patients in the GSPE group received GSPE 200 mg per day orally, while patients in the control group were only enrolled in a lifestyle intervention program. Carotid ultrasound examination was performed at baseline and 6, 12, 24 months during follow-up. Mean maximum CIMT (MMCIMT), plaque score, echogenicity of plaques and ischemic vascular events were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As anticipated, after treatment, GSPE resulted in significant reduction in MMCIMT progression (4.2% decrease after six months, 4.9% decrease after 12 months and 5.8% decrease after 24 months) and plaque score (10.9% decrease after six months, 24.1% decrease after 12 months and 33.1% decrease after 24 months) for the primary outcome, while MMCIMT and plaque score were stable and even increased with the time going on in control group. The number of plaques and unstable plaques also decreased after treatment of GSPE. Furthermore, the carotid plaque can disappear after treatment with GSPE. The incidence rate for transitory ischemic attack (TIA), arterial revascularization procedure, and hospital readmission for unstable angina in GSPE group were statistically significant lower (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 0.08, 0.002, respectively) compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>GSPE inhibited the progression of MMCIMT and reduced carotid plaque size in GSPE treated patients, and with extended treatment, the superior efficacy on MMCIMT and carotid plaque occurred. Furthermore, the GSPE group showed lower rates of clinical vascular events.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>Carotid plaque</kwd><kwd>Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of ischemic vascular diseases and is predicted to become the leading cause of global mortality by 2050.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease and the carotid atherosclerosis may reflect atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body, including coronary artery, cerebral artery, renal artery and so on.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Studies have shown that carotid plaque, particularly thick plaque and irregular plaque, is a risk factor for vascular events, especially stroke.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> So, early detection and intervention with atherosclerosis is crucial, for it can significantly reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of the ischemic vascular disease.</p><p>The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), as a part of the conservative treatment of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, has been cited by the National Cholesterol Education Project.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> However, according to guidelines recommendations, only when the lipid level was beyond the normal level, is lipid-lowering therapy with statins recommended.

Additionally, our previous animal experiment has demonstrated that GSPE can slow down the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, clinical trials about the effect of GSPE on atherosclerotic plaques have not been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of GSPE on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid plaque in clinical use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>This research was designed as an open-label, single-center, prospective randomized controlled study over 24 months. Between October 2008 and June 2011, patients were enrolled with diagnosed asymptomatic carotid artery plaques or abnormal CIMT based on carotid ultrasonography performed at the B-mode ultrasonic room of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University.</p><p>Basic entry criteria for the study were as follows: (1) carotid ultrasound examination: presence of carotid plaque or abnormal CIMT of between 0.9 and 1.2 mm; (2) lipid profile: low density lipoprotein (LDL) &#x02264; 3.12 mmol/L, total cholesterol (TC) &#x02264; 5.2 mmol/L; (3) no lipid-lowering treatment within the past six months.

All subjects provided written informed consent before enrollment and the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2</label><title>Treatment</title><p>Eligible participants were randomized to either control group (<italic>n</italic> = 141) or GSPE group (<italic>n</italic> = 146) by using random, permuted blocks within strata. In the control group, all patients were enrolled in a lifestyle intervention including dietary modification permitting a total ingestion of calories by standard body weight of 25 kCal and an individualized home exercise program of a minimum 150 min per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. The patients in the GSPE group received oligomeric proanthocyanidin 200 mg per day (100 mg bid) in addition to the same lifestyle intervention. The patients in GSPE group took two GSPE capsules twice a day.

The common, internal, and external carotid arteries were carefully identified by combining B-mode ultrasonography and color-Doppler duplex examination in the anterior oblique, lateral, and posterior oblique planes. All data were collected in 12 segments: the near (intimal-luminal surface) and far (medial-adventitial) walls of the distal common (1 cm proximal to dilation of the carotid bulb), the bifurcation (1cm proximal to the flow divider), and the proximal internal (1 cm section of the internal carotid artery immediately distal to the flow divider) left and right carotid artery.</p><p>Carotid ultrasound examination was performed at baseline and 6, 12, 24 months after treatment. Each ultrasound examination was performed as an independent study. All carotid ultrasound scans were performed by a single trained and certified sonographer, without knowledge of the previous results and subjects' clinical information. At each visit, three single measurements of CIMT were carried out aimed at recording the maximum CIMT for each of the 12 carotid artery segments. Mean maximum CIMT (MMCIMT), defined as the average of the segment maximum CIMTs across the 12 carotid arterial segments, was used for further statistical analysis. The presence of an atherosclerotic plaque was determined as a localized protrusion of the vessel wall into the lumen with the thickness &#x0003e;1.2 mm. The maximum carotid plaque thickness (MCPT, millimeters) was the greatest actual axial thickness of the plaque and was analyzed in the form of plaque score which was the sum of MCPT of all plaques. Plaque echogenicity was characterized according to the criteria of the European Carotid Plaque Study Group.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Echogenicity was classified as strong (echo-rich), intermediate, or weak (low echogenicity or echolucency).

Atherosclerosis, and it's devastating complications of cerebral and myocardial infarction and gangrene of the extremities, is the leading cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> It is reported that there are more than 20 million people experience a sudden cardiac event (acute coronary syndromes and/or sudden cardiac death) every year, and a large portion of this population has no prior symptom.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Drugs are the foundation of treatment for atherosclerotic diseases, which can prevent the occurrence of restenosis after interventional therapy and the new generation of narrowing in other parts. However, the clinical use of statins is recommended for the patients with abnormal lipid profile. And the reports on the adverse effects of statins, especially liver damage, is becoming more drastic. The urgent demand for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis remains unresolved, especially in the significant proportion of patients who had serious atherosclerosis and plaque formation with multiple lipid measurement in the normal range.</p><p>It is well established that atherosclerosis is a bland proliferative process.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Endothelial denuding injury led to platelet aggregation and release of platelet-derived growth factor that would trigger the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial intima, and form the nidus of the atherosclerotic plaque. Extensive atherosclerosis may be associated with increased blood thrombogenicity, and vulnerable plaques are much more thrombogenic than stable ones. Previous studies have showed that proanthocyanidin inhibited thrombogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation and arterial thrombus formation, enhance platelet-derived NO release, modulate the activity of some enzymes systems including cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase and decrease superoxide production.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> In our study, GSPE showed a great effect on plaque stability, the mechanism may involve direct protective effect on platelets and blood vessels.</p><p>In previous animal experiments and clinical trials, GSPE have been reported to possess a variety of potent properties including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-tumor and so on.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> A series of experiments confirmed that the antioxidant activity of GSPE is 20 times greater than vitamin C, 50 times that of vitamin E and the antioxidant activity is closely related to the effect of scavenging free radicals and inhibiting enzymes activity.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Recent research has shown that OX-LDL was related to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several animal experiments show that GSPE can inhibit LDL oxidative modification.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> One study of GSPE on diabetic rats also showed that GSPE increased the expression of catalase and partly contributed to reducing the aortic lesions in diabetes mellitus (DM), supported that GSPE can prevent aortic atherosclerosis from developing in a hamster atherosclerosis model,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> observations similar to our results.</p><p>In this study, we choose MMCIMT and plaque score as the ultrasound indices to observe the effect of the intervention of GSPE on atherosclerosis and predict the incidence rate of ischemic vascular events. To determinate the lesion properties and degree, carotid artery ultrasound provide a simple, non-invasive, cost-effective and easily reproducible approach for visualizing and quantifying atherosclerotic lesions. On the same hand, there was evidence which proved that the mean maximum estimate was a more precise estimate of an individual's atherosclerosis or cardiovascular risk status.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> Separate characterization of plaque and IMT is prudent in order to derive better information on vascular risk.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> In present study, we observed that GSPE could statistically decrease plaque thickness after treatment of six months, and with the long time treatment, the superior efficacy on carotid plaque occurred.</p><p>Furthermore, the composition of the plaque is one of the key factors affecting the risk of ischemic events in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Research suggested plaque stabilization is a promising clinical strategy to prevent cardiovascular complications in patients with established atherosclerosis disease.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> In our study, after 24-month treatment, there was no further increase in plaque in the GSPE group, but also unstable plaques reduced to fifty-four and thirty-nine plaques disappear.</p><p>This is the first report of the effects of GSPE on carotid plaque and CIMT, and it presents a valuable method to prevent the progression of atherosclerotic plaque and protect the patients without high risks. One important point should also be mentioned, that in our study, vascular events significantly decreased compared with the control group after 24-month treatment with GSPE. Meanwhile, no noteworthy adverse effects were reported.</p><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>GSPE can inhibit the development of CIMT, regress the carotid plaque and promote the stabilization of carotid plaque, and as the treatment of prolonged, the anti-atherosclerotic effect of GSPE becomes more apparent. Finally, after 24-month treatment, GSPE can reduce the cardiovascular event significantly. In the light of our results, we can speculate that GSPE could be an effective therapeutic candidate for the primary prevention programs for the asymptomatic patient with atherosclerotic lesion. Future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are required to investigate the mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><label>4.2</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The small number of enrolled patients is the first limitation of the present study. Previous studies of the relationship between plaque growth and cardiovascular risk factors have required thousands of patients,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> but the statistical power of our study is relatively low. The second limitation is that we could not determine the mechanism of plaque regression. A longitudinal prospective study in a larger number of patients would be required to show an improved outcome.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the personnel in B-mode ultrasonic room of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University.
