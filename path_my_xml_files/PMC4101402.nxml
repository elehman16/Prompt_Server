Participating Operating Engineers completed a baseline survey as well as mailed surveys at 30-days and 6-months. Urinary cotinine tests were used to verify 6-month smoking status. The outcomes were compared using &#x003c7;2 tests, t-tests, mixed models, generalized mixed models, and logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Compared to participants in the 1-800-QUIT-NOW group, significantly more of those in the Tobacco Tactics website group participated in the intervention, received phone calls and found the intervention helpful (p&#x0003c;0.05). Seventy percent of the website group received NRT compared to 5.1% of the quitline group (p&#x0003c;0.001). At 30-day follow-up, the Tobacco Tactics website group showed significantly higher quit rates (26.9%) than the 1-800-QUIT-NOW group (7.7%) (p&#x0003c;0.05), but this difference was no longer significant at 6-month follow-up. There were significantly more positive changes in harm reduction measures (quit attempts, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and nicotine dependence) at both 30-day and 6-month follow-up in the Tobacco Tactics website group compared to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW group (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Tobacco Tactics website showed higher efficacy and reach than the 1-800-QUIT-NOW intervention. Longer counseling sessions may be needed to improve 6-month cessation rates. This intervention has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality among Operating Engineers.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Foundation (BCBSM) Grant Number N011646-1465.RFP and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant Number 5R21CA152247-02.</p></sec></back></article>
