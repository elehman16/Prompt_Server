An oral single dose typhoid vaccine would have major advantages.

Studies in healthy adults demonstrated immunogenicity and an acceptable safety profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>We conducted a randomised placebo controlled, single-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of M01ZH09 in healthy Vietnamese children aged 5 to 14 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a nominal dose of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFU of M01ZH09 or placebo and were followed up for 28 days. The primary safety outcome was the proportion of subjects with any adverse event attributed to M01ZH09. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects who showed a positive immune response to M01ZH09 in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) specific serum IgA and IgG ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>One hundred and fifty-one children were enrolled, 101 subjects received M01ZH09 and 50 subjects received placebo. An intention to treat analysis was conducted. There were no serious adverse events and no bacteraemias.

A positive immune response, defined as 70&#x00025; increase (1.7 fold change) in LPS specific serum IgG (day 14 or 28) and/or 50&#x00025; increase (1.5 fold change) in LPS specific serum IgA (day 7 or 14) from baseline was detected in 98 (97&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; CI, 92&#x02013;99&#x00025;) of 101 M01ZH09 recipients and 8 (16&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; CI, 7&#x02013;29&#x00025;) of 50 placebo recipients. Twenty-eight (100&#x00025;; 95&#x00025; CI, 88&#x02013;100&#x00025;) of 28 vaccine recipients who were evaluated in the LPS specific IgA ELISPOT assay showed a positive response compared to none of the 14 placebo recipients tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This was the first phase II trial of a novel oral candidate typhoid vaccine in children in an endemic country.

Recruitment was carried out by word of mouth and flyers. Families who were interested in the trial were invited to attend one of several information evenings at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. At these meetings the study was presented by the principal investigator (TTH) and all questions could be discussed and answered. Families who remained interested in the trial were invited to attend the screening visit. Children were eligible if they were available during the trial period and at least one of their parents gave written informed consent for their child to participate after the trial procedures and potential risks were carefully explained by the study investigators. All children were invited to give their assent to the study and written informed assent was obtained from subjects starting at the age of 6 years. After informed consent was obtained, screening tests were performed. Children were screened by history, physical examination (including height, weight and vital signs), blood tests (biochemistry, haematology and HIV test), urine dipsticks and pregnancy tests (for female subjects of 11 years and above). Stool cultures were performed to check for the presence of <italic>Salmonella</italic> species.</p><p>Subjects with a history of typhoid fever, Ty21a vaccination in the last 10 years or any other typhoid vaccine in the last 5 years, any clinically significant illness, abnormal blood test results, immune suppression, positive HIV or pregnancy test were excluded.
