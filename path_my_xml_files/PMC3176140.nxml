Although the latter condition may be referred to surgery, drug therapy is usually the first approach to control pain. This study compared the clinical outcome and direct costs of (1) a traditional treatment (carbamazepine [CBZ] in monotherapy [CBZ protocol]), (2) the association of gabapentin (GBP) and analgesic block of trigger-points with ropivacaine (ROP) (GBP+ROP protocol), and (3) a common TN surgery, microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve (MVD protocol). Sixty-two TN patients were randomly treated during 4 weeks (CBZ [n = 23] and GBP+ROP [n = 17] protocols) from cases of idiopathic TN, or selected for MVD surgery (n = 22) due to intractable pain. Direct medical cost estimates were determined by the price of drugs in 2008 and the hospital costs. Pain was evaluated using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and number of pain crises; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Sickness Impact Profile, and satisfaction with treatment and hospital team were evaluated. Assessments were performed at day 0 and 6 months after the beginning of treatment. All protocols showed a clinical improvement of pain control at month 6. The GBP+ROP protocol was the least expensive treatment, whereas surgery was the most expensive. With time, however, GBP+ROP tended to be the most and MVD the least expensive. No sequelae resulted in any patient after drug therapies, while after MDV surgery several patients showed important side effects. Data reinforce that, (1) TN patients should be carefully evaluated before choosing therapy for pain control, (2) different pharmacological approaches are available to initiate pain control at low costs, and (3) criteria for surgical interventions should be clearly defined due to important side effects, with the initial higher costs being strongly reduced with time.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>trigeminal neuralgia</kwd><kwd>carbamazepine</kwd><kwd>gabapentin associated with ropivacaine</kwd><kwd>microvascular decompression</kwd><kwd>clinical outcomes</kwd><kwd>direct costs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a neuropathic pathology considered one of the most painful experiences patients can report, and no universal treatment is capable of reverting completely and definitely its intermittent paroxysmal excruciating pain crises.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-4-233">1</xref> TN is associated with impairment of daily functionality, reduced quality of life,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-4-233">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref> and depression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jpr-4-233">4</xref> to which contributes the overwhelming fear that pain can suddenly return again.

Each 7 days, during their visit to the Unit, the NRS score of the patients was recorded and CBZ dose adjusted if necessary.

At day 0, an ROP block was performed and 100 mg GBP administered at night to each patient. On subsequent days, daily GBP increase followed the rationale described in Lemos et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref> For statistical purposes patients were evaluated at day 0 (arrival to the pain unit) and after a follow-up of 5 months (month 6).</p><p>MVD protocol &#x02013; This technique is thoroughly described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jpr-4-233">37</xref> During pre-surgery, MVD patients undergo tests (blood, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT scan)) several days before surgery. During surgery, patients are anesthetized always using the same protocol (endovenous general anesthesia) and are positioned on their back with their head turned or on their side with the symptomatic side facing up. A vertical incision is made behind the ear, 3&#x02013;5 mm medial to the mastoid notch and extending about the length of the ear. A circular portion of the skull is removed exposing the underlying dura, which is opened to expose the cerebellum and reach the posterior fossa. The cerebellum is allowed to fall out of the way exposing the side of the brainstem. By advancing over the superior surface of the cerebellum, the VII and VIII cranial nerves are avoided. The arachnoid membrane is dissected allowing visualization of the VII, VIII, and finally the trigeminal nerve. The offending loop of blood vessel is then mobilized. Venous vessels above or below the nerve are dissected away from the nerve and are coagulated and divided if needed. A sponge-like material (Teflon) is inserted between the vessel in contact with the nerve (usually the superior cerebellar artery).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-jpr-4-233">41</xref> Frequently a groove or indentation is seen in the nerve where the offending vessel was in contact with the nerve. The sponge-like material is placed between the nerve and the offending blood vessel to prevent the vessel from returning to its native position. If venous vessels alone are in contact with the nerve, no prosthesis is required as they are coagulated and divided.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jpr-4-233">37</xref> After the decompression is complete, the wound is flushed clean with saline solution. The dura is sewn closed. The skull is reconstructed and the overlying tissues are closed in multiple layers. The patient is allowed to wake up and is taken to an intensive care unit or other close observation unit for 3&#x02013;5 days before returning home. For statistical purposes patients were evaluated at day 0 (day before surgery) and after a follow-up of 6 months (month 6).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcome</title><p>The predefined outcome measures were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Evaluation of pain intensity using the NRS scale.

Although the three branches of the present study were randomly obtained at 3 different times, the clinical outcomes obtained and the direct costs associated reinforce the necessity of careful evaluation of the patient before the decision to make an invasive surgical intervention. All protocols, GBP+ROP, CBZ, and MVD, decreased pain behavior significantly in TN patients, as measured by the NRS scale and number of daily pain crises, and total or a high satisfaction with both the treatment and clinical team was achieved. However, the degree of adverse side effects was different between protocols, GBP+ROP showing no side effects and MVD presenting several facial sensorial deficits, with different levels of severity. Additionally, during the first month of treatment, a much higher cost was attributed to MDV protocol due to surgical procedures, hospital stay, and maintenance of drug therapy, whereas pharmacotherapy costs were mainly drug costs. On the contrary, during the follow-up the surgical protocol was the less costly protocol and GBP+ROP was the most expensive, indicating that in longer follow-ups the MVD is less expensive than a prolonged drug treatment.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The rationale of the present study was to compare the efficacy of different therapeutical approaches to TN and evaluate the direct costs associated with each one. The GBP+ROP protocol was chosen due to its improved efficacy as an association of an anticonvulsant and the analgesic block of TN trigger-points,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref> which can constitute a valid alternative whenever the classic first-choice pharmacological treatment, CBZ in monotherapy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-4-233">1</xref> cannot be used.

Thus, the improvements observed in the different outcomes analyzed resulted exclusively from the pharmacological action of GBP+ROP and CBZ and not from the manipulation and liquid introduction at trigger-points.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jpr-4-233">15</xref> The frequency of ROP analgesic block applied subcutaneously to TN patients followed the practice guidelines for the interventional techniques:<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-jpr-4-233">40</xref> a patient received an injection at intervals of no less than 1 week, which was the period chosen to mediate between each ROP (or saline) administration.

These results are in accordance with the literature in terms of efficacy in controlling pain in TN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jpr-4-233">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-jpr-4-233">37</xref> Since this study is a retrospective and observational evaluation of 3 sets of patients who were randomly allocated in 3 different studies, the degrees of reduction of pain values cannot be compared among protocols (both NRS scale values and number of daily pain crises). Another study has compared outcomes in a group of patients who have had both pharmacological and surgical TN treatments. Patients treated with oxcarbazepine and different surgeries (MVD and Gasser ganglion surgery) were compared and patients would prefer to have had surgery before.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-jpr-4-233">60</xref> Although sensory deficits and necessity for repeating surgery have occurred, pain relief was significantly longer after surgery than after pharmacological treatment, recurrence being 10 months after oxcarbazepine and 28 months after surgery. As these data cannot be extrapolated to other anticonvulsivant drugs, similar comparative studies should be performed in the future.</p><p>When comparing the effect of GBP+ROP, CBZ and MVD protocols between baseline (day 0) and month 6, other indications of the clinical outcome can be performed using specific questionnaires. The functional analysis of quality of life measured by the SIP indicated that functional improvement was significant after pharmacological protocols but not after MVD. This may result from the several patients with sensory deficits occurring after the latter, which may counteract the functional improvement resulting from pain control. This study shows that, in addition to GBP+ROP protocol,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref> CBZ improves functionality. Only 1 paper has evaluated SIP in a surgical context,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-jpr-4-233">61</xref> indicating improvement in TN patients after epidural motor cortex stimulation. HADS showed that only patients submitted to MVD showed a significant improvement in both anxiety and depression scores, probably because patients who are hospitalized for surgery have a very high degree of anxiety and expectation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-jpr-4-233">62</xref> On the contrary, all GBP+ROP and CBZ patients were completely satisfied with the treatment protocol and the clinical team, whereas some MVD patients were unsatisfied or acceptably satisfied with the treatment protocol; this may result from the sequelae that were present in a significant number of MVD patients. Finally, CBZ protocol resulted in dizziness only in some patients and GBP+ROP patients showed virtually no adverse side effects.</p><p>Another important therapeutical improvement of GBP+ROP and MVD protocols is the demonstration of a large decrease in the daily dose of anticonvulsivant drug intake from baseline (day 0), both at the end of the treatment (day 29, GBP+ROP protocol) and, even further, after the 5-month follow-up (month 6).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref> On the contrary, in CBZ monotherapy a progressive increase was observed in daily CBZ dosage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jpr-4-233">15</xref> These data show that the clinical results of NT treatment with GBP+ROP and MVD are superior to those for CBZ monotherapy, because the significantly lower dose of drugs used strongly decreased the presence/intensity of adverse side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct costs</title><p>The data presented in this study point to a much higher cost of the surgical approach to TN treatment than the other two pharmacological protocols. This results directly from the high costs of surgical intervention and hospital stay before, during, and after the MVD. However, during follow-up, the maintenance of pain control in TN patients submitted to surgery requires less medical therapy than the other two protocols. Although being clearly the less expensive treatment during the first 4-week treatment period, the GBP+ROP protocol tends to be the most expensive therapy after stabilization of TN pain control (follow-up) due to the higher cost of GBP drug (Neurontin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [Pfizer Laboratories, Porto Salvo, Portugal] or Gabamox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [Pentafarma, Prior Velho, Portugal]) versus CBZ drug (Tegretol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [Novartis Farma, Sintra, Portugal]). Data suggest that larger follow-up periods may reveal that the MVD approach is less expensive than the drug therapies. Only a few studies have evaluated the effects of drugs in the reduction of costs in TN,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jpr-4-233">34</xref> or have compared the cost of different TN surgical protocols.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jpr-4-233">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jpr-4-233">33</xref> In accordance with a less expensive experience resulting from MVD surgery, in a comparison between this surgery, glycerol rhizotomy, and stereotactic radiosurgery, it was shown that in longer follow-up intervals MVD is predicted to be the most cost-effective surgery and should be considered the preferred operation for patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jpr-4-233">32</xref> However, recent data point to cyberknife radiosurgery being a cost-saving alternative to MVD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jpr-4-233">33</xref> The only study showing cost-saving using drug therapy in TN point to the use of pregabalin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jpr-4-233">34</xref> Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first attempt to compare clinical outcomes and costs among pharmacological protocols and the most common surgical approach in TN (excluding radiosurgery centers).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, the rates of pain improvement in the three groups of patients are not directly comparable; although they were randomly selected, patients allocated to the CBZ and GBP+ROP branches were recruited from 2 different studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-4-233">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-jpr-4-233">15</xref> and only the MVD patients were retrospectively selected for this specific study. Second, patients from MVD protocol had pain scores in the NRS scales significantly higher at baseline (day 0) than patients from CBZ and GBP+ROP protocols; the difference in patients&#x02019; characteristics is explained by the fact that MVD is usually not seen as an alternative to pharmacological protocols but, rather, as a second-line strategy whenever first-line or second-line drugs cause intolerable side effects or cannot control TN pain. Accordingly, the group of MVD patients had already failed the pharmacological therapy and thus had also longer pain periods than the patients from the other two protocols. Third, the complication rate of MVD patients may be higher than that in other published series, which is likely to be due to the small number of patients included in the study. Fourth, the cost analysis does not include costs associated with loss of productivity by patients during the admission and evaluation periods at the Hospital/Pain Unit and insurance contributions (indirect costs). Fifth, although the pain intensity and number of paroxysmal crises were significantly improved after 6 months of treatment with CBZ+ROP, CBZ, and MVD protocols, the follow-up period may not have been sufficient to determine the potential long-term effects of the treatments. Consequently, studies with larger numbers of patients, sequential allocation of patients for surgical and pharmacological branches, and longer follow-up periods should be undertaken to verify data obtained in the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although CBZ has long been known, and is still recognized, as the first-line drug choice for pain control in TN, an improvement of second-line drug therapy has been achieved by combining GBP intake with the peripheral analgesic block of TN trigger-points by ROP (GBP+ROP). Whenever pharmacological approaches fail, microvascular decompression is a surgical method of choice (MVD). We show that the three protocols resulted in a clinically significant improvement in pain, as shown by the NRS scale and number of paroxysmal pain crises, which were accompanied by a clear decrease in the daily CBZ/GBP dosage needed for TN pain control, with a consequent reduction in associated adverse side effects. The cost analysis indicates that the first 4-week period of treatment (or admission, surgery, and treatment in MVD patients) results in GBP+ROP being by far the least expensive protocol and MVD the most expensive. However, over time (follow-up), GBP+ROP protocol tended to be the most costly treatment and MVD the least expensive (very similar to CBZ protocol). Longer follow-up periods will potentially indicate that MVD is a less costly approach to TN than the drug treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Clinical Director of the Hospital Center of Alto Ave (Fafe Unit) in 2008 and the Chronic Pain Unit team of the same Hospital for collaboration in this study.
