This is surprising, because many smokers perceive that smoking benefits their mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The misattribution hypothesis explains why smoking is perceived as offering mental health benefits but why stopping smoking will improve mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chronic tobacco smoking leads to periods of withdrawal which are characterized by restlessness, depressed mood, irritability and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The hypothesis recognises that these withdrawal symptoms are also a hallmark of many mental health disorders, but are reliably relieved by smoking despite only occurring because the person smokes in the first place. Thus the tobacco withdrawal cycle mimics symptoms of mental illness, while simultaneously misleading the smoker to believe that smoking offers psychological benefits. The model finally suggests that mental health will improve after cessation once the person who quit has surpassed the withdrawal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and tobacco-induced psychological withdrawal symptoms dissipate.</p><p>Although this provides a neat explanation for the findings, it is at odds with other data. Adolescents with mental health problems are more prone to take up smoking than healthy peers, adjusting for other possible causal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A Mendelian randomisation study suggests that smoking may not cause worse mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Instead, the self-medication hypothesis proposes that smokers get genuine benefits from smoking and thus their mental health would deteriorate on cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is likely that these smokers may be at greater risk of returning to smoking or may even decide to return as their mental health is worse off without cigarettes than while smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is possible that different groups of smokers respond differently and hence both hypotheses might be true. This explanation implies that the finding that cessation improves mental health could apply to only some smokers. Other smokers might remain trapped in persistent smoking by deteriorating mental health when they try to stop. In this paper, we examine evidence for this hypothesis.</p><p>Previous studies have examined this association in the general population. Yong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] prospectively examined the association between emotional experiences after quitting and odds of relapsing versus remaining abstinent over a four year period. After cessation, participants rated questions such as, &#x0201c;Since you quit, has your ability to calm down when you feel stressed or upset improved, gotten worse or stayed the same?&#x0201d; People who perceived their ability to calm down had worsened were at greater risk of relapse to smoking by follow-up. These data were weakened because participants recalled a change, and this may have introduced bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It would have been preferable to assess change in mental health by measuring health on two occasions where people rated their current mental health with a validated tool. Gruder and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] prospectively examined change in depression scores from baseline, when participants were smoking, to two year follow-up, when participants had either relapsed or quit. Results indicated that change in depression scores was not associated with relapse. Similarly, Manning et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] analysed data from a cessation treatment trial to determine if change in stress from baseline (before quitting) to six month follow-up was associated with relapse at six month follow-up. Analyses indicated that there was no association between change in stress scores and relapse at follow-up. However, in these studies mental health was assessed after relapse had occurred, thus the data cannot assess whether deterioration in mental health after cessation predisposes to relapse.</p><p>Therefore, in this analysis we used data gathered prospectively in studies that recorded mental health at entry to a smoking reduction trial, and then for people who quit at four months after trial entry in the expectation that, for many, the acute withdrawal period would have passed. We then assessed whether the change in mental health between trial entry and four months was associated with subsequent relapse to smoking at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study followed STROBE reporting guidelines for observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of prospective individual level patient data from five merged placebo-controlled randomised trials (RCTs) of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking reduction which were conducted in Europe, USA and Australia. These data were provided by McNeil pharmaceutical company, who played no role in analysis, data interpretation or the writing of this paper. All these trials were carried out to a consistent protocol which included adults who smoked for at least three years and were motivated to reduce their smoking, but not to quit during the first month of the trial. Smoking cessation was recommended as the ultimate goal throughout the trials, but was not mandatory. Participants were excluded if they were deemed medically unfit by a practitioner, pregnant or breastfeeding or partaking in another smoking intervention (see reports of trials for further details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

All cessation outcomes were biologically verified by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;ppm). Mental health was measured using the &#x0201c;emotional wellbeing&#x0201d; subscale from the RAND-36/SF-36 item health survey 1.0. Scores range from 0 to 100, an increase on the scale indicates improved mental health and scores of &#x02264;38 indicates presence of a mental health problem.

We inversely scaled change in mental health by subtracting four month follow-up scores from baseline scores. The odds ratios therefore represented the odds of relapsing for a deterioration in mental health. The regression model was repeated with and without adjustment for FTND score, NRT treatment status, baseline mental health (SF-36), trial, sex and age.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>We chose the four-month follow up point so as to maximise opportunity to avoid the acute withdrawal period after cessation, but, given the quit date varied for smokers who stopped, the analysis could have included only recently abstinent smokers whose mental health could have deteriorated because they were suffering withdrawal.

We addressed this in a sensitivity analysis by repeating the analysis excluding recently abstinent smokers and included only those abstinent at both 10&#x000a0;week and 4&#x000a0;month follow-up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Timeframe for measurement of exposure and outcome variables in the sensitivity analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_2473_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Risk of bias</title><p>An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias in observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

The use of a validated tool to measure mental health assessed on two occasions to assess change in mental health added validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this dataset we were able to assess, for a subsample, mental health after the acute withdrawal period following cessation, thereby measuring a more enduring change in mental health. It is possible however, that some people whose mental health deteriorated over and beyond the acute withdrawal stage had already relapsed by four months and hence were not captured in our cohort. In addition, the trials analysed in this study excluded participants if they were under the care of a psychiatrist, thus these findings may not be generalizable to people with a longstanding or severe mental illness.</p><p>Pre-cessation scores were measured at baseline while everyone was a smoker and had no immediate plans to quit, only to reduce. It is possible that smokers who were motivated to reduce had better mental health than those who were not motivated, and this may limit generalisability of the results; however, there are no available studies to support this possibility. Post-cessation mental health scores were obtained at four month follow-up, when smokers had stopped and were proven to have stopped. Use of point-prevalence criteria to ascertain abstinence may have included some people who were not continuously abstinent for at least 6&#x000a0;weeks at the 4&#x000a0;month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]; thus some participants may have been experiencing withdrawal, in-turn influencing mental health scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However a sensitivity analysis confined to people who were continuously abstinent at both 10&#x000a0;week and four month follow-up gave very similar results, therefore it is unlikely that mental health scores were affected. We used biologically-validated point-prevalence abstinence to define relapse between four and 12&#x000a0;months. It is possible that those who were biologically-validated as quit at both time-points may have relapsed but resumed abstinence and this possible outcome misclassification may underestimate the true strength of the association. However, it would be uncommon to find a smoker who was quit at both time points but had smoked in between [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and therefore we believe the degree of underestimation to be minimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The finding of this study concurs with other studies that assessed mental health with psychometrically appropriate measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Gruder et al. found that change in symptoms of depression and stress from baseline to follow-up were not associated with relapse to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and Manning and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] replicated these findings for symptoms of stress. However, these studies assessed mental health after relapse, meaning that it is possible that relapsing and reinstatement of the therapeutic benefits of smoking masked the association between worsening mental health and relapse. We did not have the same difficulty in this study. In addition, these other studies had odds ratios for the association close to one which were not changed much by adjustment, as in our study, but our study provides greater precision. The only data contradicting this study were reported by Yong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which showed that smokers who reported that their ability to cope with negative affect had deteriorated after abstinence were more likely to relapse in the future. However, their study did not assess mental health when smoking and when abstinent. Reports of mental health change were based upon participants&#x02019; memory and this may have introduced bias. Reports of emotional symptoms from memory are well known to become less accurate and more biased over time; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] making the validity of such reports suspect and clouding the reported association. Given we found no evidence of this in a more robust design, we suggest the evidence does not favour this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found no evidence that there is an increased risk of relapse to smoking for those whose mental health worsens. It may be that the apparent improvement in mental health on cessation is likely to apply to all smokers. These findings have implications for cessation treatment in allaying concerns that smokers will not be able to emotionally cope without cigarettes and thus leading them to return to smoking. The findings of Yong and colleagues could suggest that smokers who believe that smoking is stress relieving are at increased risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is now possible to address this belief directly. There is clear evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis that mental health improves in most people who stop smoking and that it does not worsen in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and, even for those that experience a worsening, this may not cause relapse. In addition to this reassurance, providing alternative and well-practised methods to manage stress may prevent relapse caused by this belief.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec24"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12889_2015_2473_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
