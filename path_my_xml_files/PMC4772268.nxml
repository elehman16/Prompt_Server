These behaviors are known as waiting and reflection impulsivity.

These are subtypes of impulsivity known as waiting (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Dalley et al., 2011</xref>) and reflection impulsivity (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kagan, 1966</xref>), respectively. Impulsivity is heterogeneous, with differing subtypes associated with distinct yet overlapping neural substrates.</p><p content-type="indent">Waiting impulsivity or premature responding describes anticipatory responses made prior to a cue predicting reward. It has been extensively investigated in rodent studies using the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time task (5-CSRT) (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Robbins, 2002</xref>) and shown to be both a predictor of compulsive substance use as well as a consequence of drug exposure. The neurochemistry underlying waiting impulsivity in rodents implicates dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic mechanisms (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>). In rodents, methylphenidate (MPH) increases premature responding, an effect mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor and D4 receptor (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Milstein et al., 2010</xref>), and may be influenced by dose (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Navarra et al., 2008</xref>) and baseline impulsivity (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Tomlinson et al., 2014</xref>). MPH infusion into the rodent nucleus accumbens core also enhances premature responding (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Economidou et al., 2012</xref>). Translational versions of tasks assessing waiting impulsivity have recently been developed in humans. These include the 4-Choice Serial Reaction Time task (4-CSRT), which maintains fidelity to the rodent 5-CSRT (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Voon, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>), and the Sussex-5-CSRT task (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Roige et al., 2014</xref>). Premature responding has been shown to be elevated in methamphetamine, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), current smokers, and cannabis users with the 4-CSRT (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>) and in binge drinkers (BDs) with the Sussex-5-CSRT task (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez-Roige et al., 2014</xref>). Potential mechanisms contributing to waiting impulsivity include the role of motivational processes, proactive or tonic inhibition, timing deficits, and sensitivity to negative feedback and delay (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Voon, 2014</xref>). In rodent studies, impulsive responses followed more frequently after errors that resulted in reward omission with excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Christakou et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Reflection impulsivity describes the accumulation of evidence prior to decision (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Kagan, 1966</xref>). In the Beads Task, participants view 2 jars with fixed probabilities of opposing ratios of red and blue beads. Beads are selected from 1 of the jars and shown to the participants. Participants must make a decision from which jar the beads are selected based on viewing the colored beads. The Beads task assesses reflection impulsivity in the probabilistic domain; participants are aware of the explicit probabilities of the alternate options with each piece of evidence accumulated associated with an expected probability (or level of certainty) of being correct. Using this task, elevated probabilistic reflection impulsivity has been observed in substance use disorders, pathological gamblers (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Djamshidian et al., 2012</xref>), BDs (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Banca et al., 2015</xref>), and patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease with medication-induced behavioral addictions (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Djamshidian et al., 2012</xref>). Reflection impulsivity tested using the Beads task is enhanced by dopamine receptor agonists though not by Levodopa (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Djamshidian et al., 2013</xref>) in studies of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.</p><p content-type="indent">In the first study, we focused on MPH, an indirect catecholamine agonist that is commonly used as a cognitive enhancer in healthy individuals estimated at approximately 4% in college-age students in the United States (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Bogle and Smith, 2009</xref>). MPH is also commonly used for the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; this current study focuses on its use in young adult healthy volunteers. Acute MPH in healthy volunteers appears to have multiple influences on enhancing cognition, including enhancing set shifting and memory consolidation (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Linssen et al., 2012</xref>), working memory and planning (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2000b</xref>), and improves motor response inhibition (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nandam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Pauls et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Farr et al., 2014</xref>). However, some effects may be detrimental; MPH increases risk-taking behavior in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2012</xref>). This study thus addresses how MPH affects performance of 2 novel impulsivity tasks in healthy volunteers.</p><p content-type="indent">In the second study, we analyzed data from our previous studies using the 4-CSRT (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>) in subjects with disorders linked with aberrant dopaminergic integrity in order to explore associations between more chronic dopaminergic changes and characteristics of premature responses. For example, abstinent methamphetamine dependent (Stim) have blunted striatal dopamine receptor availability (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2001b</xref>) associated with impulsivity (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), and individuals with AUDs have reduced ventral striatal dopamine transmission (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2005</xref>) associated with alcohol craving (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Heinz et al., 2004</xref>). Changes in dopamine transmission in obese subjects remains unclear with reported reductions in striatal D2 receptor binding that are associated with BMI (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2001</xref>) as well as no difference in underlying Dopamine (DA) capacity (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2009</xref>) in obese with binge eating disorder (BED) but enhanced dopamine transmission at presentation of food stimulus in BED (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). We have also recently reported enhanced premature responding in BDs at elevated risk for the development of AUD (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2015</xref>). Here we extend an examination of the characteristic features of premature responses in these groups by specifically assessing the role of prior feedback. The negative reinforcement model suggests that negative reinforcers such as stress or anxiety may drive addiction processes (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Koob, 2013</xref>). Whether this is relevant as an endophenotype or early or late in the addiction process remains to be established (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Wise and Koob, 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that Stim- and AUD-dependent individuals would have enhanced premature responses following negative feedback but not in healthy volunteers exposed to acute MPH or BDs, suggesting a role for development of negative reinforcement in the later stage of the addiction process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>In the first study, we recruited young healthy volunteers above the age of 18 years who were medication-free and without any history of psychiatric or medical disorders. Participants were tested twice in a double-blind, within-subject, randomized placebo-controlled study with a 1-week cross-over period. A total of 20mg of short-acting MPH was administered, following which participants sat quietly or completed questionnaires. Participants were then tested at 1 hour postadministration equivalent to peak dose. Subjects were tested on the National Adult Reading Test (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Nelson, 1982</xref>) for Verbal IQ. Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1961</xref>), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger CD, 1983), and UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (UPPS-P) (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Whiteside and Lynam, 2001</xref>) to assess for depression, anxiety, and impulsivity.</p><p content-type="indent">In the second study, we reanalyzed data from the 4-CSRT previously reported comparing Stim, AUD, obese subjects with and without BED (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>), and BDs compared with healthy volunteers focusing on novel analyses to examine the influence of prior feedback on premature responding. The recruitment and diagnostic criteria and inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously reported (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>). The study was approved by the University of Cambridge Research Ethics Committee.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Choice Serial Reaction Time Task</title><p>The 4-CSRT task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was developed based on the rodent 5-CSRT (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>). Participants were seated in front of a 10.1 LCD touch screen monitor. When 4 boxes appeared on the screen, the participant pressed and held down the space bar on the keyboard with their dominant index finger, indicating the &#x0201c;cue onset&#x0201d; time. After a specified period (cue-target interval), a green circle target appeared briefly and randomly in 1 of the 4 boxes. Participants released the space bar and touched the box in which the target appeared. Baseline blocks without monetary feedback were used to individualize monetary feedback amounts for subsequent blocks based on the individual&#x02019;s mean fastest reaction time (RT) and SD. The subsequent 4 Test blocks with monetary feedback were optimized to increase premature responding. This included variation of target duration, variability of the cue-target interval, and the presence of distractors. Accurate and timely responses were followed by individualized reward magnitude outcomes depending on the speed of responding. The task lasted 20 minutes and was programmed in Visual Basic with Visual Studio 2005. See <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al.

<italic>Test block feedback</italic>: Each baseline block had 20 trials, with the final 10 trials used to calculate mean RT and SD to individualize feedback and incentivize faster responding in subsequent test blocks.

Thus, MPH may enhance task-specific attentional salience (ie, to the target predicting reward). In participants with low baseline reflection impulsivity, MPH enhanced impulsivity with an opposing effect in participants with high baseline reflection impulsivity.</p><sec id="s13"><title>Feedback Effects</title><p>We have previously shown that premature responding is elevated in Stim, AUD, and BD subjects but not in obese subjects with and without BED (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Voon et al., 2014</xref>).

The influence of premature response was driven particularly by Stim subjects and BED: Stim subjects made more premature responses following a premature response compared with healthy volunteers and with both obese subjects with and without BED, whereas BED subjects made fewer premature responses following a premature response compared with BD and AUD subjects. These findings in Stim subjects of a repeat of premature response following a premature response suggest impaired learning from a prior premature response and an aberrant recognition that premature responses are suboptimal.

In rodents, MPH increases premature responding, an effect blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol and a D4 receptor antagonist but not by central noradrenergic depletion or D1 or D2 receptor antagonists (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Milstein et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that the influence of MPH on premature responding acts specifically via the beta-adrenergic receptor and D4 receptor. Infusion of MPH into the nucleus accumbens core but not the shell enhances premature responding, whereas infusion of atomoxetine, a specific noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, into the nucleus accumbens shell but not the core decreases premature responding (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Economidou et al., 2012</xref>). This indicates neurochemical and anatomical dissociability in the nucleus accumbens on premature responding. The influence of MPH on premature responding may also be related to dose as MPH improves attention (percent correct) in the 5CSRT across multiple doses, but only the highest dose of MPH increased premature responding (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Navarra et al., 2008</xref>). Atomoxetine consistently decreased premature responding and, less consistently, improved attention in rodents on both the 5-CSRT (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Baarendse and Vanderschuren, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Fernando et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Paterson et al., 2012</xref>) and in a rodent gambling task (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Baarendse et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, our finding of elevated premature responses following MPH in healthy adults converges with the rodent literature whereas atomoxetine may be more likely to decrease premature behavior.</p><p content-type="indent">In healthy humans, MPH improves motor inhibition as measured by stop signal task performance, possibly by enhancing salience of the stop signal and increasing attentional capture (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Nandam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Pauls et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Farr et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the influence of MPH on premature responding in this study may be related to enhanced salience of the target, hence hastening RT to the target or enhanced salience of negative feedback and therefore increasing premature responses following negative feedback. Importantly, we show enhanced RT to the target but no overall effect on RT, suggesting a specific mechanism involving the target or negative feedback. In an fMRI study of MPH in healthy volunteers using a 4-CSRT task that did not focus on premature responding, MPH was associated with enhanced activity in attention and preparatory motor regions (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). An influence of task-difficulty and plasma levels was observed with a positive correlation between greater area under the plasma MPH-time curve and activity of attentional and motor preparatory regions only in the condition of greater task difficulty (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). In healthy volunteers, MPH increases activity in a dorsal attentional network, including the parietal and prefrontal cortex (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Tomasi et al., 2011</xref>). Overall these findings suggest the influence of MPH on premature responding may relate to enhanced task-dependent attentional salience and motor preparation.</p><p content-type="indent">Acute MPH in healthy volunteers appears to have multiple influences on enhancing cognition, including enhancing set shifting and memory consolidation (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Linssen et al., 2012</xref>) as well as working memory and planning. Improvements in working memory were related to decreases in cerebral blood flow in lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Elliott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2000b</xref>) and also to baseline-dependent effects (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, not all effects are necessarily positive. MPH increases risk-taking behavior in healthy individuals (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, we show that acute MPH increases premature responding along with causing an enhanced likelihood of a premature response following a prior premature response. This suggests that MPH may also impair the capacity to learn that premature responses are suboptimal responses, possibly by a relative decrease in attentional salience. However, we also note that there were no overall differences in the amount of money won, suggesting that MPH did not impair optimal task performance.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Acute MPH Effects on Evidence Accumulation</title><p>We also show that MPH influences evidence accumulation prior to a decision in a manner that is dependent on baseline impulsivity. These divergent effects of MPH were previously demonstrated for other forms of impulsivity. For example, MPH and atomoxetine were both shown to decrease premature responding in high-impulsive rodents in one study (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Tomlinson et al., 2014</xref>). MPH also enhances motor inhibition as measured using the stop signal task, reducing the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) in slow-responding rodents but increasing SSRT in fast responders (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Eagle et al., 2007</xref>). In humans, individuals with higher baseline impulsivity such as those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may respond differently to MPH (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Caprioli et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, this suggests an influence of baseline on medication effects, thus emphasizing potential differences between medication effects in healthy volunteers and pathological groups with elevated impulsivity. In the current study, there were no differences in levels of uncertainty or objective probability of the correct choice at the time of decision or in subjective confidence, suggesting that the effects were indeed related to reflection impulsivity. In line with the current finding of reduced reflection impulsivity in high-impulsive participants, greater reflection impulsivity as tested using the Matching Familiar Figures Test in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is decreased following MPH (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Sleator, 1979</xref>). However, there were no differences in reflection impulsivity comparing ADHD and healthy volunteers as measured using the Information Sampling Task along with a lack of an influence of MPH (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">DeVito et al., 2009</xref>). We have previously shown that BDs were impaired on the beads task but not the IST (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Banca et al., 2015</xref>), a dissociation similarly shown in studies in schizophrenia (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Fine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Moutoussis et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Huddy et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting underlying task differences. We argue that the beads task, unlike the IST, may be more likely to increase impulsivity, as the task is less visually explicit and requires participants to be reliant on their own internal task representation and future outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Banca et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Limitations</title><p>This current study would benefit from assessment under differing doses at 20 and 40mg to assess dose effects. Furthermore, whereas MPH appears to improve motor response inhibition in healthy volunteers with a possible enhanced effect in ADHD, the role of premature responding in ADHD and the influence of chronic MPH remains to be tested. We also note that baseline scores of premature responding may subtly differ, possibly as a result of differences in the touch screen utilized. In the study of pathological groups (study 2), a larger 12.1-inch Paceblade touchscreen was used, whereas a 10.1-inch touch screen was used in Study 1, which may contribute to differences in baseline responses. We further note that subjects with lower beads accumulated (greater reflection impulsivity) had higher raw scores of total premature responses (greater waiting impulsivity) with the opposite observed in those with lower reflection impulsivity. Although there were no significant differences either with a correlation analysis or a median split, a larger sample size might reveal a relationship between the 2 measures. Thus, those who accumulate less evidence may also have difficulties with anticipatory responding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings are immediately relevant to young healthy volunteers without a history of ADHD. While acute MPH may have positive effects as a cognitive enhancer in healthy volunteers, MPH may also enhance specific forms of impulsivity, including the capacity to wait before acting. Our findings suggest that chronic exposure to stimulants is associated with a failure to learn that premature responses are suboptimal. These findings add to a mechanistic understanding of waiting impulsivity and possible means of therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statement of Interest</title><p>V.V. and N.A.H. are Wellcome Trust (WT) intermediate Clinical Fellows.
