The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) first-aid device has been demonstrated to be highly cost-effective when applied at the referral hospital (RH) level. In this analysis we evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of early NASG application at the Primary Health Center (PHC) compared to later application at the RH in Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We obtained data on health outcomes and costs from a cluster-randomized clinical trial (CRCT) and participating study hospitals. We translated health outcomes into disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using standard methods. Econometric regressions estimated the contribution of earlier PHC NASG application to DALYs and costs, varying geographic covariates (country, referral hospital) to yield regression models best fit to the data. We calculated cost-effectiveness as the ratio of added costs to averted DALYs for earlier PHC NASG application compared to later RH NASG application.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, the cost-effectiveness of early application of the NASG at the primary health care level compared to waiting until arrival at the referral hospital was $21.78 per DALY averted ($15.51 in added costs divided by 0.712 DALYs averted per woman, both statistically significant). By country, the results were very similar in Zambia, though not statistically significant in Zimbabwe. Sensitivity analysis suggests that results are robust to a per-protocol outcome analysis and are sensitive to the cost of blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Early NASG application at the PHC for women in hypovolemic shock has the potential to be cost-effective across many clinical settings. The NASG is designed to reverse shock and decrease further bleeding for women with obstetric hemorrhage; therefore, women who have received the NASG earlier may be better able to survive delays in reaching definitive care at the RH and recover more quickly from shock, all at a cost that is highly acceptable.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Maternal mortality</kwd><kwd>Obstetric hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>Hypovolemic shock</kwd><kwd>Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment</kwd><kwd>NASG</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Ninety-nine percent of the 800 maternal deaths that occur each day are in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While global maternal mortality has been nearly halved from 1990 to 2008, the proportion of maternal deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa has doubled over the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For each woman who dies, an estimated 20&#x02013;30 women survive with morbidities, including infertility, anemia, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Obstetric hemorrhage continues to be the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwideC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Uterine atony, the failure of the uterus to contract after delivery, accounts for a majority of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Delays in transport, diagnosis and adequate treatment of women experiencing severe hypovolemic shock due to obstetric hemorrhage are common in settings where access to resources and care are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) has been studied as a means to stabilize women with hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The NASG is a neoprene compression device that reverses shock by delivering circumferential counter-pressure to the lower body, legs, pelvis, and abdomen (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and decreases blood loss. Use of the garment as a first-aid, temporizing device can reduce the impact of delays in reaching definitive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Scalable health interventions, those that are effective and efficacious when applied to the larger population, are critical in reducing maternal mortalities and morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Information on cost-effectiveness is crucial in planning scale-up and impact of maternal health interventions, but is often lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The NASG is considered a cost-effective intervention for referral hospitals (RH), based on quasi-experimental studies in Egypt and Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For women in severe shock, with a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of less than 60&#x000a0;mmHg, use of the NASG improved health outcomes by averting 2&#x02013;3 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per woman and had a net savings or extremely low cost per DALY averted.</p><p>In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the NASG be used as a temporizing measure for women with PPH until definitive care, blood transfusions, and/or surgery can be obtained. Our aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the payer&#x02019;s perspective of early NASG intervention using evidence from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of early NASG application at the primary health care (PHC) level prior to transport compared to later NASG application at the referral hospital (RH) level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This study was conducted in Zambia and Zimbabwe, where the maternal mortality ratio is 591 and 960 per 100,000 live births respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We used an econometric approach to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of application of the NASG at the primary health care center (PHC) compared to waiting until the patient arrives at the RH. We hypothesized that early application of the NASG at the PHC would be more cost-effective than later application of the NASG at the RH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design of clinical study</title><p>The clinical data for this study was approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) affiliated with the following institutions: University of California, San Francisco; University of Zambia, Lusaka; University of Zimbabwe-UCSF Collaborative Programme on Health Research; and the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organization. The cost data collected for this study did not involve human subjects, and was thus exempt from IRB oversight.</p><p>This cost-effectiveness analysis builds on a previously reported clinical trial, summarized here. The clinical trial data belongs to UCSF and is freely available with a UCSF data sharing agreement. The cluster-randomized controlled trial of 38 PHCs in Zimbabwe and Zambia enrolled patients from 2009 to 2012. Eligible PHCs were peri-urban with at least 500 annual deliveries that referred obstetric hemorrhage (OH) cases (&#x02265;500&#x000a0;mL blood loss) to one of five study regional hospitals. Participants were admitted at the PHC and were consenting women with any obstetric hemorrhage etiology and hypovolemic shock. Women with antepartum hemorrhage with a viable fetus were excluded. PHCs were randomized to either the early application or later application group using a covariate-constrained procedure to ensure balance across intervention arms on number of deliveries, number of deliveries per midwife, distance to referral hospital (RH), and proportion of OH cases expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Women who presented at the PHC at&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;24&#x000a0;weeks gestation (ectopic pregnancy, complications of abortion, or trophoblastic/molar pregnancy) were enrolled in the outpatient department, while women at&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;24&#x000a0;weeks were enrolled in the maternity department. Midwives at the PHC were trained to treat PPH with uterotonics and IV fluids, repair first- and second-degree perineal lacerations, and refer any patient with estimated blood loss&#x02009;&#x0003e; 500&#x000a0;mL to the RH. PHCs were not equipped to provide blood transfusions, surgery, or manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). Each PHC had access to a shared ambulance system to transfer patients to the RH.</p><p>All eligible women had a perineal pad applied at study entry in the PHC to measure blood loss. Women in the early application arm received the NASG (Zoex Corporation, Coloma, CA 95613, USA) at the PHC and women in the later application arm received it at the RH per treatment protocol. All women were referred to the RH and were transported by ambulance, private vehicle, or taxi. Oxygen, IV fluids, uterotonics or uterine massage for uterine atony, suturing of lacerations, manual removal of placenta or retained tissues, MVA, surgery, and blood transfusions were available as needed at the RH. More detailed information regarding the design of the CRCT is provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>We use a per-protocol analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Characteristics of women were similar between early and later NASG application groups (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) except for hemorrhage etiology. The early application group was composed of a higher proportion of women with uterine atony (42.1% vs. 28.7%) and a lower proportion with complications of abortion (15.6% vs. 36.2%) compared to the later application group.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The timeframe of this analysis was the four-year period of the intervention. Disabilities over the women&#x02019;s life were considered. YL was calculated as the difference between the woman&#x02019;s age and her age-adjusted life expectancy within her country of residence for those women who died during the study. YLD was constructed as a composite of the morbidities for each woman who survived. This includes acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, cerebral impairment (seizures, unconsciousness, motor/cognitive loss), and severe anemia. The rate of severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin value less than 7.0&#x000a0;g/dL at hospital discharge.</p><p>There was no evidence of statistically significant differences between earlier and later NASG application across mortality and morbidity outcomes. The odds of death in the early application group were 64% lower (OR 0.36 (95% CI: 0.08 &#x02013; 1.53) than the later application group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). There were no morbidities in the early application group and 0.2% in the later application group. There was no statistically significant difference in severe anemia at discharge between groups.

In Zambia, early NASG application costs $22.00 for each DALY averted compared to late application ($16.04/0.729 DALYs). We do not have enough evidence to determine a statistically meaningful result for Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>First, to assess for potential non-adherence to treatment protocol that might affect a per-protocol analysis, we ran the same models using an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. There were no significant differences in effects between the approaches; the estimates of the per-protocol analysis were attenuated slightly by the smaller sample size, as expected. The low attrition rate and negligible degree of bias suggest that our per-protocol results are what we would expect in a clinical practice setting.</p><p>We reran Models 1&#x02013;8, stratified by shock status. Women who entered the study with mean arterial blood pressure of less than 60 are considered to be in severe shock. There were no differences in estimates in our cost models. However, the DALYs averted rose from 0.712 to 0.844 in the best-fitting effectiveness model. This suggests that, in this sample, early application of the NASG before transport appeared to have greater benefit for women who did not enter in severe shock.</p><p>The ICER of applying the NASG early compared to later was sensitive to the unit cost of blood transfusions and ranged from $9.22-87.85 (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In this case, it appeared less cost-effective when the cost of blood increased because there was a slightly higher blood transfusion rate in the early application group. The baseline odds ratio of death with the late application of NASG is 2.77 times higher than early application. We imputed deaths in the timing groups to create synthetic odds ratios ranging from 1.68 to 3.74, which were selected based on the expected effectiveness. The ICER falls as odds of death in the early application group decreases relative to the group with later application (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In other words, as early application becomes more effective, it becomes more cost-effective.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

In Zambia, early NASG application cost a nearly identical $22.00 for each DALY averted compared to late application ($16.04/0.729 DALYs). This ratio is considered &#x0201c;very cost-effective&#x0201d; by the WHO definition of annual GDP per capita [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In Zimbabwe, point estimate results suggested similar benefits, but were not statistically significant, which may be due to low statistical power from the few events within this site.</p><p>Mean treatment costs were patterned differently by country, where the early application group was associated with somewhat lower but not statistically different costs in Zimbabwe ($17.16), but significantly higher costs ($15.51) in Zambia in our descriptive analyses, and consistent with the random-effects Model 7.</p><p>The difference in costs across the two countries is largely driven by the rate and cost of blood transfusion (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is not surprising given that blood transfusion is the definitive treatment for hypovolemia. In Zimbabwe, very few women received blood (5.8% and 7.9%, respectively in the early and late application groups) compared to Zambia (61.0% and 48.0%, respectively). Some of this difference may be explained by the higher per unit cost of blood in Zimbabwe compared to Zambia ($113 vs. $42). We are not able to directly quantify the extent to which blood availability contributed to this difference in rates. However, our analysis that took into account referral hospital (RH) effects revealed higher costs in the Lusaka RH versus the Copperbelt RHs. Given that the Lusaka RH is co-located with the national blood bank and has better access to blood, we suspect this is likely due to higher proportions of women at the Lusaka RH receiving blood transfusions. Local blood availability and costs should be contextualized to the country and region as lack of blood is common in low- and middle-income contexts and is a major driver of hemorrhage-related mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>We found that mild shock (MAP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;= 60) on presentation was associated with more DALYs averted per women who received the NASG earlier. This may be due to the considerable benefit of early application of the NASG to <italic>prevent</italic> worse shock during transport to definitive treatment. Importantly, this finding is inconsistent with previous results from multiple studies, which found greater NASG benefits for women in severe shock when applied at the RH level only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we found NASG having important value for women in severe and mild shock.</p><p>Results from the previous cost-effectiveness analysis on data from the referral hospital level, which compared NASG application to no application, determined the intervention to be cost saving (Egypt) or extremely cost-effective (Nigeria at $3.13 per DALY averted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As expected, our current analysis of data from Zambia and Zimbabwe of early NASG application at the PHCs compared to later NASG application at the RH indicates that the additional costs associated with expanding the NASG to the PHC level is well within the WHO standards for very cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Our country-level findings suggest that NASG intervention at the PHC may even be cost saving in Zimbabwe; however, the low rate of mortalities and morbidities in that subsample renders the findings imprecise. Although the results of the cluster-randomized trial lacked statistical significance, the large observed reduction in mortality (64%) was consistent with statistically significant outcomes from earlier studies conducted at the RH level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, earlier NASG intervention in the CRCT was significantly associated with faster recovery from shock, which supports the plausibility of a meaningful reduction in mortality (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p>Policy makers with limited resources may need to make decisions about which levels of the health care system to place the NASG. Should NASG be only at the RH? At both the RH and the PHC? Or should it be used at even lower levels of the health care continuum? Should NASGs be on ambulances or other transport?</p><p>Given the strength of the evidence for cost-effectiveness at the referral hospital level, the decision to implement the NASG within the RH level is straightforward. In deciding whether to incur the additional costs of adding the NASG at the PHC level, policy makers may want to consider several factors: 1) the proportion of women who first seek care at the PHC level; 2) the proportion of maternal deaths from hemorrhage which occur at the PHC, during transit, or within the first 2&#x000a0;hours after admission to the RH; 3) the clinical capacity for resuscitation at the PHC level; 4) average transport times from the PHC to the RH; and 5) the length of delays in admission and receipt of quality definitive care including blood transfusions and surgery once at the RH. Greater benefits will be obtained from situating the NASG at the PHC level in contexts where the first contact with care is at the PHC level, or where receipt of definitive care is delayed by transportation, less optimal resuscitation or other time delays faced at the PHC or RH. Data on situating the NASG within emergency transport are not available.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. The major limitation was low power due to a smaller than expected number of deaths in the CRCT. Also, the study was not designed to explicitly study the availability and provision of blood transfusion; thus, we had less reliable information about the availability of blood transfusions. Given that the earlier and later application arms occurred simultaneously and blood transfusions do not appear to be clustered within any set of patients referred from a PHC, we expect non-differential bias across intervention arms.</p><p>The analysis did not include the economic benefits and costs from the patient&#x02019;s perspective. It is likely that early application of the NASG would have health and economic benefits for women and their families.</p><p>The costs for using the NASG will fluctuate, but may continue to decrease, as competitive sales pricing has resulted in prices as low as $57.50. (Personal communication Neil McConnochie, Blue Fuzion to Suellen Miller.) Incorporating training into ongoing Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care, Life Saving Skills, and pre-service training will eventually eliminate a separate price for stand-alone in-service NASG training. The differential costs for blood, medications, and surgery will be highly context specific.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Applying the NASG earlier at the Primary Health Care level for women in hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage instead of waiting until the woman has been transferred to the Referral Hospital has the potential to be a cost-effective decision across many clinical settings. Our evidence from Zambia strongly supports this conclusion. Evidence from Zimbabwe is suggestive but not statistically significant. As the NASG is designed to reverse shock and decrease further bleeding for women in obstetric hemorrhage, patients who have received the NASG earlier may be better able to survive delays in reaching definitive care at the RH and recover more quickly from shock, all at a cost that is highly acceptable. Policymakers and administrators need to consider a variety of factors to determine which levels of their health system will cost-effectively save the most lives.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>NASG</term><def><p>Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RH</term><def><p>Referral hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHC</term><def><p>Primary Health Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DALY</term><def><p>Disability-adjusted life year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Mean arterial blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OH</term><def><p>Obstetric hemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPH</term><def><p>Post-partum hemorrhage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YL</term><def><p>Years of years of life lost</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YLD</term><def><p>Years lost due to disability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRCT</term><def><p>Cluster-randomized clinical trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVA</term><def><p>Manual vacuum aspiration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: SM JD.
