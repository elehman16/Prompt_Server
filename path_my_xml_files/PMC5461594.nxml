The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on PCOS symptoms and metabolic syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This double-blind clinical trial was performed in 2015 in Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti Hospitals, Isfahan, Iran, on 88 patients with PCOS.

In fertility ages, the patient's hief complaint is infertility and irregular ovulation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The risk for endometrial cancer in women almost threefold increased in the presence of PCOS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The pathogenesis of PCOS is not known, both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to the development of the PCOS phenotype. Reproductive disorders such as irregular menstrual cycle, chronic anovulation, and hyperandrogenism manifestation as hirsutism and infertility and metabolic disorders have evaluated as potential contributors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Metabolic syndrome is more frequent in these patients than general population, and 33%&#x02013;50% of US women with PCOS have metabolic syndrome compared with only 12% in a similarly aged in general population.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, in these women, dyslipidemia is more prevalent compared with controls.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The successful treatment in women with PCOS is lifestyle and nutritional interventions along with weight loss.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Metabolic disorders of PCOS may have improved in the presence of dietary factors such as anti-inflammatory foods. Among dietary factors, omega-3 is known off fatty acids that has an important role in immune regulation, insulin sensitivity, cellular differentiation, and ovulation. It reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins through competitive inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) as well as competing with arachidonic acid as the substrate for COX-2.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Fish oil feeding reduces cholesterol absorption and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) synthesis, improves LDL receptor activity in liver, and increases fractional rate of catabolism of LDL-C.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Moreover, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had a beneficial effect on some cardiometabolic risk factors in women with PCOS.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies have evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids in women with PCOS and reported different findings. Results of a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may not have a beneficial effect on improving insulin resistance in women with PCOS.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Other randomized controlled clinical trial showed that omega-3 fatty acids may contribute to the improvement of metabolic complications and had some beneficial effects on serum adiponectin levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profile in patients with PCOS.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Some other studies have different findings, and there are controversial results in studies on patients with PCOS. On the other hand, data about the effect of omega-3 on menstrual status are limited, so the study was designed to evaluate effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation on metabolic syndrome and symptoms in women with PCOS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double-blind clinical trial was conducted from August to December 2015. Patients, who referred to Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti Hospitals, Isfahan, Iran, with diagnosis of PCOS based on the NIH criteria,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were enrolled in the study. Women between 25 and 40 years old were eligible if they were not menopause, did not consumed omega-3 in the last 3 months or followed a special diet, did not used tobaccos, and did not have diabetes or hypothyroidism. Furthermore, patients were not eligible if they consuming contraceptive, were pregnant, had kidney disease, liver disease, cardiovascular disorders, hyperprolactinemia, Cushing syndrome, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Infertile women if they did not receive any treatment and did not infertility treatment plans in the next 6 months were entering to the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they need treatment with oral conceptive or did not desire to continue. This study approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (394057), and all participants signed written informed consent.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomly divided into two 44-member groups of case and control, using random-maker software &#x0201c;random allocation.&#x0201d; Patients in case group received omega-3 supplements (with mercury free from Zahravi Construction Company) with dose of 2 g/day for 6 months (each capsule 1000 g) which contains 180 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid. Patients in control group received two olive oil capsules (Barij Esans Construction Company).</p><p>A checklist was completed for each participant. This checklist contained symptoms of hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinemia, and age, sex, weight without shoes with wearing light clothing, height without shoes, body mass indices (BMIs), number of children, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HipC) (taken with a soft tape in standing position, waist being defined as the narrowest circumference between the costal margin and the iliac crest and hip as the widest circumference between the waist and tight), size of ovary, and the number of ovarian follicle were measured by the same ultrasound device with the same operator. Bleeding volume, the number of interval and bleeding duration, fasting blood sugar (FBS), and lipid profile, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were measured using the standard methods in all participants. All variables were measured before and after treatment periods. All patients in both studied groups were asked to maintain their usual dietary intakes and physical activity during study period and reported any change in their physical activity (cut or increasing the regular physical activity) and nutritional status (cut or increasing a special diet).</p><p>The sample size was calculated using the comparison of means formula with &#x003b1; =0.05 and 80% power for the level of cholesterol; the values used for sample calculation based on a study by Mohammadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were as follows: difference in the mean of cholesterol level between groups was 17.5 mg/dL and standard deviation for groups was 25.9 and 32 mg/dL. Statistical analysis of data was performed using SPSS software for windows, version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To compare qualitative variables between groups, Chi-square test was performed. The normal distribution of all studied parameters was checked with Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used for variables which were distributed in a normal way; besides, Mann&#x02013;Whitney test was performed for variables that have not normal distribution. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the study flowchart.

After 6 months&#x02019; intervention, WC was significantly lower in omega-3 group (81.18 &#x000b1; 2.87) as compared to control group (84.22 &#x000b1; 2.61) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

However, no significant changes were observed in weight, HipC, FBS, number of ovarian follicle, size of ovary, bleeding volume, menstrual bleeding, and hirsutism score between intervention and control groups after intervention.</p><p>Previous studies in patients with PCOS had similar findings for anthropometric measurements. Cussons <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect of omega-3 supplementation in patients with PCOS with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and found that BMI and waist to hip ratio after 8 weeks&#x02019; treatment by omega-3 (4 g/day) were not significantly different from control group.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In other study, Vargas <italic>et al</italic>. found that 6 weeks&#x02019; supplementation with 3.5 g/day fish oil in patients with PCOS did not significantly change weight, BMI, and WC in compare to control group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Results of Hajianfar <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s. study showed that consumption of fish oil reduces BMI, WC, and waist to hip ratio in women with type 2 diabetes compared with the placebo group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study like these studies, most of anthropometric measurements did not significantly changed after study, but BMI in our study in omega-3 group was significantly decreased after treatment in compare to control group, which was different from the results of the previous studies. This controversy can be explained by the differences between studies in regard to studied population and treatment period, whereas Cussons <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] studied population were patients with PCOS with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with 8 weeks&#x02019; treatment, Hajianfar <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] study were patients with PCOS with type 2 diabetes, and Vargas <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] study treatment period was 6 weeks; in contrast in our study, patients with PCOS without type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were treated for 6 months.</p><p>Serum lipid values in patients with PCOS in our study after 6 months&#x02019; supplementation with omega-3 significantly reduced when compared to control group. Some previous studies showed a significant decrease in serum TG levels in patients with PCOS after supplementation with fish oil which was similar to our results.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These findings show the effect of fish oil on TG levels in patients with PCOS, whereas it was shown that effect of fish oil on TG levels is dose dependent.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The effect of omega-3 in patients with PCOS on other serum lipid values reported differently, some studies reported no significant differences in the level of serum TC, LDL, and HDL concentrations after intervention in compare to control group,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] other study by Mohammadi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that cholesterol and LDL decreased after administration of omega-3, while HDL and TG did not change. There were some similarity and differences between the present study results and other studies findings. Dose of omega-3 fatty acids, duration of intervention period, and differences in studied patients can be noted as possible reasons for controversy between results.</p><p>Marshall Keri <italic>et al</italic>. reported that women with PCOS have clinical problems such as disruption of menstrual cycle, infertility, and hirsutism. They mentioned that if the patients were not treated well, they would be prone to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hyperestrogen-related cancer.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] All the participants in our study had irregular period. While after the trial, the percentage of regularity in menstrual status in the omega-3 group was significantly higher. We found that just interval between periods decreased. These results were similar to Nadjarzadeh <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s. study.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] They show that after 8 weeks&#x02019; treatment with omega-3, the percentage of regular menstruation in the omega-3 group was significantly more than the placebo group. The effect omega-3 on regular menstruation can be explained by the decreased in testosterone concentration, whereas in Nadjarzadeh <italic>et al</italic>&#x02019;s. study,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] testosterone concentration was significantly decreased after 8-week use of omega-3 in compare to placebo.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study can be that the information about daily energy intake and physical activity as two main interventions in women with PCOS was not collected before and after intervention. However, patients in the present study were asked to maintain their usual dietary intakes and physical activity during study period and reported any change, but in the lack of this information, we could not the possible effects of nutritional status and physical activity between studied groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Results of the present study showed that, administration of omega-3 decrease lipid profiles, decrease WC, and interval between periods. But weight, HipC, FBS, number of ovarian follicle, size of ovary, bleeding volume, menstrual bleeding, and hirsutism score did not change after administration of omega-3. These data suggest that omega-3 by improving metabolic parameters can make menstrual status regular.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
