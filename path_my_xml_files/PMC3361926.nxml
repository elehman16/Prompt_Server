Among several health problems <italic>Prameha</italic>, is considered as one of the arch enemy of the mankind. <italic>Prameha</italic> comprises a number of diseases with various physical and chemical changes in urine. The manifestation of the disease is described as &#x0201c;<italic>Prabhutavilmutrata</italic>,&#x0201d; which means frequent and copious urine with turbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] It is also believed that, if not cured or treated properly in due course of time, <italic>Prameha</italic> changes in <italic>Madhumeha</italic>, which is very similar to diabetes mellitus, the most debilitating disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by polyurea, polydipsia, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and generalized weakness may be associated with weight loss. This is the disease that affects every tissue and every organ of the body and is responsible for significant morbidity, reduced life expectancy, and diminished quality of life. It has been seen that there is no any organ or system spared from the diabetic complications, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and so on. So there is a need for effective drugs for controlling Diabetes and preventing undesirable complications.</p><p>Although the introduction of many oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin in modern medical science have great importance in the management of Diabetes, the hazardous effects of these drugs after long term use are incurable or proves many times fatal, hence an ideal therapy is still obscure. Ayurvedic management of Diabetes aims not only to achieve a euglycemic state but also to treat the root cause of disease. There are many medicinal plants mentioned in Ayurvedic texts, particularly in Nighantus having <italic>Pramehahara</italic> property. In the present work, the drug &#x0201c;<italic>Rishyagandha</italic>&#x0201d; (<italic>Withania coagulans</italic>) has been used for the management of <italic>Prameha</italic>.
