rehabilitation exercise on ankle joint functional movement screen results and isokinetic
muscular function in patients with chronic ankle sprain patients. [Subjects and Methods]
In this study, 16 patients with chronic ankle sprain were randomized to an ankle
functional rehabilitation exercise group (n=8) and a control group (n=8). The ankle
functional rehabilitation exercise centered on a proprioceptive sense exercise program,
which was applied 12 times for 2 weeks. To verify changes after the application, ankle
joint functional movement screen scores and isokinetic muscular function were measured and
analyzed. [Results] The ankle functional rehabilitation exercise group showed significant
improvements in all items of the ankle joint functional movement screen and in isokinetic
muscular function after the exercise, whereas the control group showed no difference after
the application. [Conclusion] The ankle functional rehabilitation exercise program can be
effectively applied in patients with chronic ankle sprain for the improvement of ankle
joint functional movement screen score and isokinetic muscular function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ankle sprain</kwd><kwd>Functional rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Joint functional movement screen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ankle sprain occurs more often in active movements such as walking, running, and jumping.
Among lower limb injuries, ligament injuries of the ankle account for more than 50% of the
cases. Furthermore, at least 7% of people with ankle sprain had additional repetitive
symptoms, including re-injuries and functional anomalies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Re-injury of ankle sprain triggers chronic ankle instability (CAI),
which acts as a cause for recurrent sprains in 55&#x02013;72% of the cases. These patients with
re-injuries complained of residual symptoms for 6 to 18 months<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this way, many previous studies reported a high recurrence rate
of ankle sprain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and attributed the causes of this high recurrence rate to deformed
tissues around the ankle joint, loss of proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reuse of the ankle joint before complete recovery. Such
repetitive injuries lead to functional ankle and chronic ankle joint instabilities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, chronic ankle sprain is highly
correlated with chronic ankle joint instability. CAI refers to the repetition of lateral
ankle joint instability after an initial lateral ankle ligament sprain, with residual
symptoms such as pain, edema, and giving way of the ankle joint<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the greatest causes of repetitive ankle sprain
were reported to be the muscular weakness of the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, and
the increased ankle instability due to the hypofunction of the proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, when the instability of the ankle joint increases, other motion patterns are
required to compensate for the instability, which causes the motion deformations of the hip
joint and trunk, resulting in the side effect of the changed anatomical arrangement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim Eun-Kyung<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that rehabilitation exercise treatment programs
such as muscle strengthening, kidney, and proprioceptive sense enhancement exercises are
required to prevent and treat the chronic pain and functional ankle joint instability after
ankle joint sprain. A rehabilitation exercise through 4-week balance training has been also
reported to elicit significant changes in the lower leg rotation and hindfoot angle<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. O&#x02019;driscoll et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that functional rehabilitation exercises for 6
weeks, including muscle-strengthening exercise, balancing exercise, and agility and jump
training caused significant changes in balancing ability and hindfoot angle. Therefore, an
appropriate functional rehabilitation program should be applied to improve chronic ankle
joint instability by reinforcing the muscular function of the ankle joint and enhancing the
proprioceptive sense in patients with chronic ankle sprain. Hence, in this study, an ankle
functional rehabilitation exercise was applied to patients with chronic ankle sprain and its
effects on ankle joint FMS result and isokinetic muscular function were examined. This
presents a new alternative to the functional rehabilitation exercise program for the
prevention and rehabilitation of ankle sprain for patients with chronic ankle sprain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 16 patients with chronic ankle pain and chronic ankle
sprain whose chronic CAI had been diagnosed by medical examination, simple radiological
examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. They were randomized to
the ankle functional rehabilitation exercise group (AFREG; n=8) and control group (CONG;
n=8). For the physical characteristics of the subjects, the mean age, height, and weight of
the AFREG were 20.8 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years, 174.6 &#x000b1; 7.1&#x02005;cm, and 69.6 &#x000b1; 9.03&#x02005;kg. Those of the CONG were
20.7 &#x000b1; 1.1&#x02005;years, 174.1 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x02005;cm, and 66.2 &#x000b1; 7.6&#x02005;kg. After receiving an explanation of the
intent and purpose of this study, they voluntarily agreed to participate in this study. The
two groups had no problem in homogeneity because they had no significant intergroup
differences in physical characteristics. The ankle functional rehabilitation exercise
program mainly consisted of a proprioceptive sense exercise program, which was performed in
a total of 12 times, 6 times per week for 2 weeks, with an exercise time of 60 minutes. The
ankle functional rehabilitation exercise program used the exercise tools for proprioceptive
sense exercise, Jumper (TOGU, Germany) and Togu (TOGU, Germany). In detail, the exercise
items were (1) balance squat and (2) supine pelvic lift, performed while standing on the
jumper, and (3) lunge and (4) dorsi and plantar flexion, performed by weight bearing while
standing on the Togu. The exercise time was maintained at 30 seconds per set, during which
isometric training was performed. For the FMS related to ankle joint, deep squat, hurdle
step, and in-line lunge tests were performed in relation to the ankle joint functional
movement in 7 patterns by using the FMS test kit (USA), which is a functional motion
inspection measurement system. For the ankle joint isokinetic muscular function inspection,
the peak torque (Nm) at the angular speed of 240&#x000b0; was measured by using Cybex Humac Norm
(Ankle Joint System, USA). The measured data were analyzed by using the SPSS 21.0
statistical program for Windows. A paired-test was conducted for comparison of the groups
between before and after the application. The significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p><p>All of the subjects understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed

ankle sprains and causes dysfunction in the stability of ankle neuromuscular control and in
musculoskeletal stability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
problems in patients with chronic ankle sprain are decreased function of the proprioceptive
sense and decreased reaction speed<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, Scott<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
functional rehabilitation exercise more effectively reduced pain and edema than surgery and
fixation. Another previous study also reported that functional rehabilitation exercise
through the training of proprioceptive sense decreased the re-injury rate of the ankle<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, active research is being
conducted to present the directions of functional rehabilitation exercise, and studies on
the evaluation of functional rehabilitation exercise are being conducted as well<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was conducted to demonstrate that chronic ankle sprain is caused by chronic
dysfunction and instability of the ankle joint, and the muscular function and stability of
the ankle joint were improved through the application of ankle functional rehabilitation
exercise.</p><p>The AFREG showed significant improvements in all items of the FMS and ankle joint
isokinetic muscular function after application (p&#x0003c;0.05), whereas the CONG showed no
significant changes after application. The FMS (Functional Movement Screen) is known to be
useful for evaluating asymmetries of the body and defects in functional exercise motions
based on the basic motions of the proprioceptive sensory receptor, stability, and mobility,
which are the motion patterns of the body<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it was used as a measurement item
in this study.</p><p>In this study, by using this FMS evaluation method, the functional defects of the ankle
were chosen as the measurement items before and after exercise. Furthermore, the isokinetic
measuring instrument is an effective tool for evaluating muscular function because it can
produce the maximum muscular force according to the resistance within the predefined range
of motion of the joint. It is used to examine the effects of diagnosis and rehabilitation
exercise programs<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, in this
study, an isokinetic instrument was used to measure the effects of the functional
rehabilitation exercise program on the improvement of muscular functions.</p><p>Functional rehabilitation exercise is an integrated form of training for muscular strength,
agility, proprioceptive sense, and special exercise functions and refers to various patterns
of exercise programs. It has been shown to effectively decrease pain and dysfunction.
Furthermore, it has the effect of protecting tissues from many physical burdens applied
during physical activities by increasing the reaction speed of surrounding muscles and nerve
tissues, restoring stability, and reinforcing muscles<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, an 8-week functional rehabilitation program, including proprioceptive
exercise, helped the stabilization of the unstable ankle joint by improving postural sway
and isokinetic muscular function (isokinetic strength)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. An ankle joint balance improvement exercise program was effective
in the rehabilitation and prevention of chronic ankle instability and sprain, and the
control of proprioceptive ability protected the body from injuries<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the application of rehabilitation exercise program for resolving functional ankle
instability, the combined application of muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises
was more effective than muscle strengthening exercise alone<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Besides, because ankle instability is caused by the combination of
the lack of proprioceptive sense and eversion muscle weakening, rehabilitation programs must
focus on the improvement of the proprioceptive sense and muscular strength<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, both improved proprioceptive
sensibility and the functional capabilities of the surrounding muscles of the ankle joints,
thereby providing a coping mechanism for the unexpected inversion of ankle joints<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the ankle functional rehabilitation program applied in this study was mainly
composed of the exercise of proprioceptive sense in order to achieve the stability of the
affected site by recovering the motion control ability while reinforcing the muscular
strength of the patients with chronic ankle sprain. The improvement was achieved as a result
of the improved muscular functions of the muscles comprising the ankle joint and the
improved integrated system of the muscles and nerves that support balance and enables the
exhibition of stable forces through the integration of the proprioceptive receptor and
motion sensory nerves by the muscles around the trunk, pelvis, and abdomen.</p><p>Consequently, the application of ankle functional rehabilitation exercise in patients with
chronic ankle sprain in this study will present a new alternative solution as an effective
rehabilitation program for the reinforcement of ankle joint FMS and isokinetic muscular
function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Kyungpook National University Bokhyeon Research Fund,
