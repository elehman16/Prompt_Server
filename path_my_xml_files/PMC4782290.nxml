Standard care in many countries is induction of labour at 42 GW. There is insufficient scientific support that induction of labour at 41 GW, as compared with expectant management and induction at 42 GW will reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity without an increase in operative deliveries, negative delivery experiences or higher costs. Large randomised studies are needed since important outcomes; such as perinatal mortality and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy are rare events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A total of 10 038 healthy women &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years old with a normal live singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation at 41 GW estimated with a first or second trimester ultrasound, who is able to understand oral and written information will be randomised to labour induction at 41 GW (early induction) or expectant management and induction at 42 GW (late induction). Women will be recruited at university clinics and county hospitals in Sweden comprising more than 65 000 deliveries per year. Primary outcome will be a composite of stillbirth, neonatal mortality and severe neonatal morbidity. Secondary outcomes will be other adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes, mode of delivery, women&#x02019;s experience, cost effectiveness and infant morbidity up to 3&#x000a0;months of age. Data on background variables, obstetric and neonatal outcomes will be obtained from the Swedish Pregnancy Register and the Swedish Neonatal Quality Register. Data on women&#x02019;s experiences will be collected by questionnaires after randomisation and 3&#x000a0;months after delivery. Primary analysis will be intention to treat. The statistician will be blinded to group and intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is important to investigate if an intervention at 41 GW is superior to standard care in order to reduce death and lifelong disability for the children. The pregnant population, &#x0003e;41 GW, constitutes 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of all pregnancies and the results of the study will thus have a great impact.

This definition is arbitrary. Many studies that have analysed risks and management of postterm birth also include pregnancies from 41<sup>+0</sup> GW (late term). Globally, the prevalence of postterm birth is about 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] but the rate varies considerably between and within countries. Factors that influence the prevalence are characteristics of the population e.g. maternal age and number of primiparous women in the population, the rate of preterm birth, interventions such as caesarean section and induction of labour, the prevalence of routine ultrasound dating of pregnancy and pregnancy surveillance routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If ultrasound is performed at 40<sup>+0</sup> or 41<sup>+0</sup> GW, fewer women will reach 42<sup>+0</sup> GW as some pregnancies will be diagnosed as risk pregnancies leading to induction (e.g. because of oligohydramniosis or small for gestational age foetuses). The prevalence of postterm birth (42<sup>+0</sup> GW or more) in Sweden was 8.4&#x000a0;% between 1982 and 1991 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and 6.9&#x000a0;% in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology of postterm birth is largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some rare, known causes of postterm birth are foetal anencephaly, foetal adrenal hypoplasia or insufficiency and placental sulphates deficiency. Risk factors for postterm birth include: primiparity, advanced maternal age, maternal obesity, heredity, previous postterm pregnancy, and a male foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Complications in postterm pregnancies</title><p>Perinatal mortality (PNM) is defined as the prevalence of stillbirth (after GW 22<sup>+0</sup>) and neonatal mortality within 7&#x000a0;days after birth. The PNM in Sweden between 2004 and 2013 was 0.3&#x02030; in GW 39&#x02013;41 and 0.7&#x02030; after 42 GW. A Danish national register study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;125 043 pregnancies) showed that PNM increased in women with postterm pregnancies as compared to women with term pregnancies (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.36; 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.08&#x02013;1.72) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A Swedish register study of deliveries between 1982 and 1991 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;914 702 pregnancies) found significantly higher rates of stillbirth in primiparous women in GW 41 (1.86&#x02030;) and GW 42 (2.26&#x02030;) as compared to GW 40 (1.23&#x02030;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in multiparous women the risk of stillbirth was not significantly different in GW 41 (0.50&#x02030;) and 42 (0.86&#x02030;) as compared to GW 40 (0.53&#x02030;). These figures were calculated based on the number of women delivered in each GW. A recalculation with the number of non-delivered women in each GW (foetuses at risk) as denominator, showed significantly higher incidences of stillbirth in GW 41 and 42, as compared to GW 40, in primiparous women (0.62, 1.26 and 2.27&#x02030;, respectively), as well as in multiparous women (0.73, 1.00 and 1.51&#x02030;, respectively). Risk factors for stillbirth in postterm pregnancies are maternal age and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The risk of perinatal complications such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), umbilical cord complications, asphyxia, pneumonia, sepsis, convulsions, shoulder dystocia, traumatic injuries and peripheral nerve damage is higher in postterm deliveries than in deliveries at term (aOR 1.1&#x02013;2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A case-control study from Australia showed a higher risk of neonatal encephalopathy in children born postterm, (GW 41: aOR 3.3 and GW 42: aOR 13.2 versus GW 39) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A Swedish study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;354 children) found an increased risk for developmental delay at the age of 4&#x02013;4.5&#x000a0;years in children born postterm compared with children born at term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, also increased rates of obesity and early markers of the metabolic syndrome were found in children born postterm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This may not be a result of prolonged pregnancy per se but rather associated with foetal and/or parental genetic factors that also are associated with delayed parturition.</p><p>Maternal complications increase from GW 40. The risk of puerperal infections, postpartum bleeding, disproportion, labour dystocia, emergency caesarean sections, and cervical lacerations was higher for postterm than for term pregnancies in a Danish register study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;125 043 pregnancies) (aOR 1.2&#x02013;1.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Postterm pregnancy: induction of labour or expectant management</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomised controlled studies (RCTs)</title><p>With the increased risks that accompany a postterm pregnancy, the obvious solution would be to suggest induction of labour before the pregnancy becomes postterm. Several RCTs have compared induction with awaiting spontaneous onset of labour, with or without foetal surveillance, but most of the studies are small and of low methodological quality. The largest study so far is a multicentre RCT from Canada (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3407). The women were randomised at 41 GW to induction or to expectant management with monitoring until the start of spontaneous labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PNM was similarly low in the two groups but the induced group had significantly fewer caesarean sections. The study has been criticised because the induction methods were different in the groups. Prostaglandins were not used in the expectant management group, and it is speculated that this may have contributed to a higher caesarean section frequency in this group. In a later Norwegian study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;500 women), women were randomised to induction at 289&#x000a0;days (GW 41<sup>+2</sup>) or monitoring and induction at 300&#x000a0;days (GW 42<sup>+6</sup>) unless spontaneous labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The primary outcome (a composite neonatal outcome) was similar in the two groups. No case of stillbirth occurred, and there was no difference in the rate of caesarean sections. However, the study was too small to assess PNM, a problem accompanied by all RCTs to date. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have been published. In a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) performed at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (SU) in Gothenburg, 13 RCTs were included (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6617 women) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The review showed no difference in PNM but found significantly fewer cases of MAS and a lower caesarean section rate in the induction group as compared to the expectant management group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An updated HTA meta-analysis of 17 RCTs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7223 women) was done in 2012, with a more liberal inclusion of studies (a study from 1969, abstracts and articles in Spanish were added) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It showed a lower PNM in the induction group, fewer cases of MAS, and no difference in caesarean section rate. However, a large number of women need to be induced to prevent one case of perinatal death (NNT&#x02009;=&#x02009;469). A methodological problem in individual studies and systematic reviews is that important outcomes such as PNM and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) occur at a very low frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, very large studies are needed to address these important outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Observational studies</title><p>A recent register study was based on Medical Birth Registry (MBR) data on all pregnancies more than 41<sup>+2</sup> weeks in Sweden between 2000 and 2007 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;119 198 pregnancies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The management of postterm pregnancy in the Stockholm region was changed in 2005 from induction of labour at GW 43<sup>+0</sup> to induction at no later than GW 42<sup>+0</sup>. Decreases in the rates of PNM (by 48&#x000a0;%), MAS (by 51&#x000a0;%) and low Apgar scores (by 31&#x000a0;%) were observed. Sweden was divided into three regions based on the rate of deliveries at more than 42<sup>+2</sup> weeks. It was shown that foetal surveillance differs and that regions with a high rate of deliveries at &#x0003e;GW 42<sup>+2</sup> had a higher rate of neonates with MAS and low Apgar scores.</p><p>A recent population-based retrospective cohort study from Scotland (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 271 549 pregnancies) showed that induction of labour for non-medical reasons at GW 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 were associated with reduced PNM, without an increased risk of caesarean section. However, more children were admitted to the neonatal ward in the induced group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An older observational study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] compared a group of uncomplicated pregnancies between 1997 and 1999 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2176) with a group of uncomplicated pregnancies between 1999 and 2002 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3716). Management was changed in 1999 from induction of labour at GW 42<sup>+0</sup> to induction at GW 41<sup>+0</sup>. There was no difference in neonatal outcome including stillbirth between the two time periods, but there were more prolonged labours and caesarean sections due to failed inductions between 1999 and 2002.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Risks of labour induction</title><p>The RCTs referred to above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the systematic reviews show that induction compared with expectant policy in GW 41<sup>+0</sup> or later did not increase the frequency of caesarean sections or instrumental vaginal deliveries. Earlier observational studies, comparing induction with spontaneous start of labour at the same gestational age, showed higher rates of caesarean section after induction, particularly in women with an unripe cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A retrospective cohort study attempted to mimic the clinical situation by comparing women with induction in a specific GW (GW 38, 39, 40, 41) with women being undelivered in the same GW, who were either subsequently induced or went into spontaneous labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As with earlier studies, a higher frequency of caesarean sections was found after induction, which was statistically significant for GW 38, 39 and 40. At GW 41<sup>+0</sup> there was no difference. A recently published meta-analysis of 31 RCTs (19 studies addressing induction for postterm birth and 12 inductions for other indications) found that induction led to a lower risk of caesarean section (OR 0.83; 95&#x000a0;% CI 0.76&#x02013;0.92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Similar findings are reported in another recent meta-analysis of 157 RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>A register study with data from the Norwegian MBR between1996 and 1998 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;176 591 pregnancies) and the Norwegian Cerebral Palsy Register (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;373 children) found an independent association between induction of labour at term and bilateral cerebral palsy (CP) (OR 3.7, 95&#x000a0;% CI 1.8&#x02013;7.5) after adjustment for maternal disease, gestational age, birth weight, prelabour rupture of the membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the authors concluded that they were only able to speculate on possible mechanisms leading to CP after labor induction due to lack of detailed data. Recently, an association between autism spectrum disorders and induced or augmented childbirth has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Some evidence suggests an oxytocin receptor deficiency in autism and the authors hypothesized that an oxytocin infusion may alter the oxytocin balance in the newborn.</p><p>There is no consensus as to the optimal time of labour induction or the optimal way of antenatal surveillance. Recently, guidelines from the Danish Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (DSOG 2011) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health (2012) have been published. According to DSOG, all pregnant women should be delivered before GW 42<sup>+0</sup>. A clinical examination is recommended in GW 41<sup>+0</sup> including cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound. Induction will be planned for at GW 41<sup>+2</sup>&#x02013;41<sup>+5</sup>, depending on local tradition. In Norway, a check is also recommended in GW 41<sup>+0</sup>&#x02013;41<sup>+2</sup> with a clinical examination, ultrasound, CTG and amniotomy if possible. Induction should be started no later than GW 42<sup>+0</sup>. Induction in GW 41 is recommended for women who are older (&#x0003e;38&#x000a0;years) or obese, who have gestational diabetes or are suspected to have a foetus being small for gestational age (SGA). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) recommends starting monitoring between GW 41<sup>+0</sup> and 42<sup>+0</sup> with CTG and measurement of the amniotic fluid index (AFI) twice a week. In Great Britain, The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommend induction between GW 41<sup>+0</sup> and 42<sup>+0</sup>. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SCOG) recommends antenatal examination in GW 41&#x02013;42, with local guidelines for further action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Health economic considerations</title><p>The Canadian Multicentre Postterm pregnancy trial from 1995 indicated that induction of labour was associated with a lower cost as compared with expectant management of postterm pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, as the study was performed more than 20&#x000a0;years ago the data may not be applicable today. Induction of labor at 41 GW versus expectant management with antenatal testing in nulliparous women resulted in improved obstetric outcomes and was cost-effective when analysed with a decision-analytic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The incremental cost was $10,945 per quality-adjusted life year (QUALY) gained (the range of cost-effectiveness thresholds is commonly set at $ 50,000&#x02013;100,000 per QUALY in the USA). Besides the analyses being based on a theoretical cohort, the authors stated some limitations in the cost-effective analysis.

The primary composite outcome of 2.74&#x000a0;% is based on the following rates of perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity in GW 41<sup>+3</sup> from Region Skane between 2000 and 2010: HIE 0.22&#x000a0;%, MAS 0.36&#x000a0;%, obstetric brachial plexus injury 0.05&#x000a0;%, Apgar score &#x0003c;7 at 5&#x000a0;min 1.58&#x000a0;%, stillbirth and neonatal mortality 0.53&#x000a0;%. We need a sample size of 10 038 women to be randomised, 5 019 to induction of labour at GW 41<sup>+0</sup> and 5 019 to expectant management. Since primary outcome is a serious and rare event, we consider that a 33&#x000a0;% reduction is clinically relevant.

During a 3&#x000a0;year period we calculate with 195 306 deliveries. Given a rate of 18&#x000a0;% of women being undelivered at 41<sup>+0</sup> GW, this will give us 34 755 women during 3&#x000a0;years.

Randomisation will be performed using a computerised module linked to the Pregnancy Register. Such a design has recently been applied successfully in cardiovascular research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and has several important advantages including costs, ease of recruitment and facilitating the translation of the study results to clinical practice.</p><p>Our primary and secondary outcome measures are in the interest of the woman, the expectant partner and the child. There are no high quality studies with adequate sample size investigating if early induction is superior to standard care (expectant management/late induction) in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. The optimal timing of offering induction of labour to women at late term or postterm therefore needs further investigation. Women&#x02019;s experiences and opinions about the choices have not been adequately evaluated. In this study, we also aim to evaluate women&#x02019;s attitudes and experiences with questionnaires. In the early induction group we will have a higher proportion of induction of labour, with possible negative delivery experiences. In the late induction group, the proportion of induction will be lower, but the experience of another week of waiting &#x0201c;post due date&#x0201d; is not evaluated. Further, the foetal growth continues between 41 and 42 GW, leading to an expected higher infant birth weight and more &#x0201c;macrosomic infants&#x0201d; (&#x0003e;4.5&#x000a0;kg) in the late compared to the early induction group. Giving birth to macrosomic infants is associated with more complications, leading to a possible more negative experience in the late induction group. The outcome &#x0201c;women&#x02019;s experiences and opinions&#x0201d; of each intervention (early or late induction) is thus complex and therefore an important outcome of our study. One of the advantages of the register-based design is that the primary and secondary outcomes will be collected continuously through national quality and health registers. These data can be used for implementation after the study has been finalized. The consequences of a new clinical management can be evaluated (reduction in e.g. perinatal mortality, HIE, caesarean section etc.) using national data from the Pregnancy Register and SNQ. The study results will fill several gaps in health care knowledge and contribute to establish good evidence-based routines regarding management of postterm pregnancy. Support for if an early intervention in the natural course of pregnancy is superior for the health of children and mothers is important, to justify an intervention (labour induction) in 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of all women whose pregnancy has lasted &#x02265;41<sup>+0</sup> GW in the future. Sweden is suited to run a high quality RCT: public health care system, almost 100&#x000a0;% of pregnant women attend antenatal care, nearly everybody gives birth at a delivery hospital and there is usually (except the Stockholm region) only one hospital with a delivery ward for a certain geographic region (reduces selection bias), low rates of maternal and perinatal mortality, comparably low caesarean section rates and opposed to many other countries we have not yet started to induce earlier so we still have the possibility to run this RCT. Also, this project is the first study supported by the recently started Swedish National Network on Clinical Studies in obstetrics and gynaecology (SNAKS). The network comprises one member from each university region in Sweden and is supported by the Swedish Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (SFOG). If the intervention, early induction, is shown to be superior to expectant management/late induction, new local, regional and national guidelines may therefore be developed within a short time frame (approximately 3&#x000a0;years).</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Project organization and co-workers</title><p>The following five centres will participate in the study: the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology at South Alvsborg County Hospital (SAS), Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Skane University Hospital (SUS), Karolinska Hospital Solna/Huddinge, Stockholm, Uppsala University Hospital.
