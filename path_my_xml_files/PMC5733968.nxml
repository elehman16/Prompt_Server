Introduction</title><p>Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of<italic> hematopoietic</italic> stem or progenitor cell which is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis of the bone marrow, long-term progressively refractory anemia, and frequent development of leukemia [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Qinghuang Powder (QHP) is made of<italic> indigo naturalis</italic> and<italic> realgar</italic> and realgar is an arsenic-containing mineral with toxicity. Our previous study had reported that QHP was effective in treating MDS [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the clinical efficacy was related to the blood arsenic concentrations when they are higher than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Low arsenic concentration of blood of patients with QHP has poor treatment effect. Compound-Qinghuang Powder (compound-QHP) was a modified prescription based on the traditional QHP that could better ensure the blood arsenic concentrations by decreasing the side digestive effect [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our study tested the blood arsenic concentrations of patients with MDS and increased the dosage of realgar for patients whose blood arsenic concentrations were less than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L. The aim of the present study was to achieve a proper clinical application of compound-QHP that could improve the efficacy and decreased the adverse events by modifying the dosage of realgar and improving the blood arsenic concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Method</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients met the diagnosis and classification of MDS according to the diagnosis of MDS and the WHO MDS criteria in 2007 [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the prognosis standard of MDS adopted the revised international prognosis scoring system (IPSS-R) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. (2) Patients did not use arsenic-containing drugs for the past 2 months before the enrollment. (3) The age of patients is between 18 and 75 years. (4) Patients must have signed an informed consent form.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with severe diseases in heart, liver, kidney, and peripheral nerves; (2) woman with pregnancy or lactation; (3) patients with severe mental illness; (4) patients in other trials.</p><p>A final number of 200 patients who met the diagnosis and classification of MDS were collected; all of them were admitted to the Department of Hematology in Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, ranging from March 2015 to November 2016. The age of them was between 18 and 72 years and the average age was 56.5 &#x000b1; 15.5 years. Patients were orally administered with compound-QHP, prepared by Preparation Laboratory of Xiyuan Hospital, at a daily dose of 2.7&#x02009;g including<italic> realgar</italic> 0.1&#x02009;g,<italic> indigo naturalis</italic> 0.2&#x02009;g,<italic> white peony root</italic> 0.96&#x02009;g,<italic> Atractylodis macrocephala</italic> Koidz 0.48&#x02009;g,<italic> Radix Ledebouriellae</italic> 0.48&#x02009;g, and<italic> Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae</italic> 0.48&#x02009;g.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Experimental Design</title><p>The blood arsenic concentration of 200 patients was detected by atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry (HF-AFS) after one month's treatment with compound-QHP. We adopted randomized, single blind, and case control methods to divide them into group A and group B for patients whose arsenic concentrations were less than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L after the first month of treatment. Daily dose of 0.1&#x02009;g realgar was maintained during the course of treatment in group A, while it was increased by 0.1&#x02009;g each time until the blood arsenic concentrations were more than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L in group B. A period of three months was considered as a course of treatment and the patients received 2 courses of treatments. The blood arsenic concentrations were tested during the course of treatment at 1, 3, and 6 months as three time points. The dose of realgar would be reduced by half when the blood arsenic concentrations were more than 140&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L, and treatment would be discontinued when the blood arsenic concentrations were more than 940&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L, which were determined with reference to the reported peak safe concentrations of patients receiving intravenous injection of arsenous acid. All patients continued to receive the compound-QHP after the end of clinical trials.</p><p>Among 200 patients, 148 cases were only treated with compound-QHP; 26 of them had previously been accepted Stanozolol and had stopped at least one month before the treatment with compound-QHP. Another 52 cases were treated with combination of compound-QHP and Stanozolol (2~4&#x02009;mg/d). Transfusion of blood components was used as the supportive therapy if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Assessment of Response and Safety Analysis</title><p>All patients received assessment of response after the treatment according to IWG 2006 criteria of MDS [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The safety assessment of treatment with compound-QHP included two aspects, which were symptoms and organic functions of adverse reactions. Side effect symptoms included nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, limb numbness, skin keratinization, and swelling.</p><p>Adverse reaction grading standards were in accordance with the 2002 Clinical Guideline of New Drugs for Traditional Chinese Medicine: (1) light grade: the patients could tolerate the side effect of treatment and continue the study without other disposition. And it had no significant damage of health. (2) Moderate grade: the patients' health was damaged and they could not tolerate the side effect. (3) Severe grade: the side effect symptom jeopardized the life of the subjects who were disabled or died. They need to stop the treatment and dispose immediately. The organic functions were analyzed by myocardial enzymes, liver functions, and renal functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Statistical Analysis</title><p>All blood arsenic concentrations were detected in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism software version 6.0.

Discussion</title><p>There has been a long history of treatment with traditional Chinese arsenic-containing medicine [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which mainly consists of arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and realgar (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>). Traditional Chinese arsenic-containing medicine in treating MDS has been a popular area of research recently [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which is characterized by its better curative efficacy, agreeable price, and less side effect that could be tolerated by patients. Data from the research suggested that the oral dose of realgar (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) was usually more than 0.9&#x02009;g/d in the treatment of hematological malignancy, while the dose was normally used as 3&#x02009;g/d with the blood arsenic concentrations ranging from 20 to 110&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L. The mainly adverse reactions of those doses were side digestive effects. The blood arsenic concentration could reach 900&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L with the intravenous drip of the As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at 10&#x02009;mg per day, while no patients appeared to have severe side effect [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>QHP, which consisted of natural indigo and realgar, was the effective drug in treating hematological diseases developed by hematology department of Xiyuan Hospital after a long period of clinical practice [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The properties of realgar were described as warmth, acridity, and toxicity in traditional Chinese medicine. The dose of realgar has been changed several times in Chinese Pharmacopoeia: oral dose of realgar ranged from 0.3 to 1.0&#x02009;g per day according to version in 1977, from 0.15 to 0.3&#x02009;g per day according to version in 1990, and from 0.05 to 0.1&#x02009;g per day according to version in 1995&#x02013;2015 [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that QHP in treating patients with MDS have a great efficacy except some patients with no response [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The side effect increased and particularly the digestive reaction of realgar increased randomly for better efficacy. Further study has suggested that the efficacy on patients with QHP was related to the blood arsenic concentrations [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and enough blood arsenic concentrations were the key to obtain the curative effect in treating MDS. Diarrhea could reduce the absorption of QHP in digestive tract and decrease the efficacy on account of insufficient blood arsenic concentrations.</p><p>Compound-QHP have optimized the component of QHP, and<italic> white peony root</italic>,<italic> Atractylodis macrocephala</italic> Koidz,<italic> Radix Ledebouriellae</italic>, and<italic> Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae</italic> were added in the new prescription in addition to<italic> indigo naturalis</italic> and<italic> realgar</italic> to prevent the gastrointestinal adverse reaction. Our previous research suggested that compound-QHP in treating patients with MDS decreased adverse digestive reactions and increased efficacy compared to those who received QHP. The previous in vitro study suggested the active ingredients of realgar (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) as the monarch drug in compound-QHP that could induce the apoptosis and promote the differentiation in a dose-dependent manner for MDS/AML [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Our previous studies have showed that the lowest blood arsenic concentration of efficacy is 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this study, the patients who received compound-QHP with insufficient blood arsenic concentrations (&#x0003c;20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L) were randomly assigned to group A and group B. Daily dose of realgar was maintained in group A, while that was increased until the blood arsenic concentrations were more than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L in group B. The concentrations after the treatment in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (44.43 &#x000b1; 10.54 versus 21.39 &#x000b1; 3.49&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/L, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The rate of hematology improvement was significantly higher in group B than that in group A (54.2% versus 29.2%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The study suggested that increasing the blood arsenic concentrations is important to develop the efficacy with compound-QHP. The greater dose (0.2&#x02009;g/d) of realgar could increase the concentrations in treating MDS without more side effects. The increased concentration is significantly lower than that in other methods of usage with arsenical in literature [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The patients of the two groups were both followed for 3 months after the six-month treatment.</p><p>There were few adverse digestive reactions with light grade in patients with compound-QHP, and those were gradually decreased with the treatment in some patients. The result suggested that patients with the treatment of compound-QHP could tolerate the side effect and there is no need to stop the therapy. Some patients with liver dysfunction and abnormal cardiac enzyme are related to testosterone and long-term of anemia, respectively, and some of them could recover after the treatment. There is no patient with renal dysfunction before the treatment, and there are no new cases with abnormal liver function, cardiac enzyme, and renal function during the treatment. Overall, compound-QHP is safe for organic function, which is consistent with previous study.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Monitoring the blood arsenic concentration and adjusting the daily dose of realgar in order to increase the effective blood arsenic concentration and improving efficacy without increasing the clinical toxicity are the safe and effective clinical methods in the treatment of MDS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Beijing Municipal Science &#x00026; Technology Commission (no.
