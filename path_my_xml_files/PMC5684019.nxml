exercises on rounded shoulder posture when employing the self-stretch exercise, the
McKenzie exercise, and the Kendall exercise as intervention methods based on previous
studies that reported negative effects of unbalanced posture and musculoskeletal problems
on forward head posture and rounded shoulder posture. [Subjects and Methods] The selected
28 subjects were randomly assigned into the McKenzie exercise group (n=9), the
self-stretch exercise group (n=10), and the Kendall exercise group (n=9). To compare the
forward head posture, the craniovertebral angle was used. To measure the rounded shoulder
posture, the scapular index was used. [Results] There were significant differences in the
craniovertebral angle and scapular index within the groups and no significant differences
between the groups. [Conclusion] The result of this study showed that all interventions
increased the craniovertebral angle and the scapular index, which revealed that the
applied exercises had a positive effect on forward head posture and rounded shoulder
posture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Rounded shoulder</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Muscular and skeletal structures can change into an incorrect shape due to a reduction in
physical activity and inappropriate posture habits in daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Forward head posture (FHP) is defined as excessive anterior
positioning of the head in relation to a vertical reference line<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rounded shoulder posture (RSP) refers to a posture
characterized by acromion protraction in front of the line of gravity, shoulder protraction,
and downward rotation as well as anterior tilt<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, long-term use of smart phones leads to wrong posture such as
forward neck posture, rounded shoulders and slouched posture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in physical functions that occur due to rounded shoulders
can cause one or more abnormal conditions in a complex structure consisting of the head,
neck, and shoulders<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP and RSP deform
the normal relationship of the muscles and the bone structures, which are correlated<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. To improve FHP, many physical therapy
methods can be used. The McKenzie exercise is a self-therapy exercise done by patients
through repetitive motions and includes mobilization, manipulation. Its main focus is on
stretch exercises<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is known to be
effective in neck posture correction<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Kendall exercise strengthens deep cervical flexor and shoulder retraction muscles and
stretches pectoral muscles, thereby correcting unstable FHP and helping to correct the
alignment of the neck<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Self-stretch
exercise consists of Mckenzie&#x02019;s neck exercise for reduced pain and Kendall&#x02019;s strengthens
exercise. Although many studies reported that the McKenzie and the Kendall exercise both
reduced neck pain, few studies have been conducted on the effect of their exercises on RSP.
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of FHP-improving exercises on RSP when
employing the McKenzie exercise, the self-stretch exercise and the Kendall exercise as
intervention methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study chose 28 subjects who were 19&#x02005;years old or older in Daegu city. The selected 28
subjects were randomly assigned into the McKenzie exercise group (n=9, MEG), the
self-stretch exercise group (n=10, SSEG), and the Kendall exercise group (n=9, KEG). The
selection criteria were: 53 degrees or lower according to craniovertebral angle (CVA); those
who had not any regular exercise for the last 6 months; and those who used a smartphone or
computer for 4 hours or more per day on average. Informed consent was voluntarily obtained
from all the subjects prior to participation in the study, and this study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University.</p><p>8-week intervention was applied after a pre-test and a post-test was conducted. To compare
the forward head posture, CVA was used. To measure the RSP, the scapular index was used.
Sufficient explanation was given to the subjects to follow the correct method. The exercise
manual and the exercise logbook were distributed to the subjects to follow the correct
exercise program and to record the exercises once they were done. The subjects were
contacted periodically to check whether they had conducted the exercises.</p><p>McKenzie exercises consist of 7 exercise motions performed for 7 sec at static maximum
muscle strength and 3 sec rest prior to procceding to the next exercise motion. This
exercies repeated 20 times<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The self-stretch exercise methods were as follows: (1)
Place both hands on the shoulders and push out the chest; and (2) Place one hand over the
shoulder and grasp the elbow of the turned hand, with the other hand over the head and
slowly pull it inward until it has reached the full stretched point; and (3) Throw back the
head, and turn it until it has reached the fully stretched point; and (4) Look straight
ahead and slowly turn the head horizontally and stop when the maximum value is reached; and
(5) Throw back the head, and turn it until it has reached the fully stretched point; and (6)
Lower the head, and turn it until it has reached the maximal point<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each motion had to be maintained for 10 sec followed by 5
sec rest. Each subjects performed 10 sets. The Kendall exercise methods were as follows: (1)
stretching pectoralis muscle, placing both hands on theoccipital area and pulling the elbows
back up and performing arm abduction and external rotation; and (2) strengthening shoulder
retraction, putting a TheraBand around a secure object and pulling the band back with both
hands as far as possible to move the shoulder blades toward each other in a standing
position; and (3) Strengthening the deep cervical flexors, lying flat on the back with the
chin down and then lifting the head; and (4) Stretching the cervical extensors, placing both
hands on the occipital area in a sitting position followed by a flexed neck posture with the
head down to stretch the cervical extensors. This exercise was repeated 15 times<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. All exercises consist of total 25&#x02005;min a
day and performed three times a week for 8 weeks.</p><p>CVA was assessed using a digital, lateral-view photograph of the subjects in their usual
standing posture. Markers were attached to the seventh cervical (C7) vertebra, and to the
tragus in the ear and the acromion of each subject&#x02019;s shoulders, and a digital camera was
installed 33 inches away from the ground and 104 inches away from the subject. Each subject
had their eyes to gaze at their eyes reflected at the front mirror then flexed and extended
their head three times in the standing position as much as they could. A picture was then
taken when they stopped at their most comfortable posture <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A photograph was taken
laterally using a digital camera (AlpaNEX-6; Sonny, China). The CVA was calculated using
Adobe Photoshop program CS6. To assess rounded shoulders, subjects were asked to stand
normally with hands hanging beside the body. At their standing position, the coracoid
process (CP), the sternal notch (SN), the posterolateral angle of acromion (PLA), and the
adjacent thoracic vertebral spine (TS) were found and marked. Distance between the coracoid
process and sternal notch, and that between the posterior edge of acromion process and
adjacent thoracic vertebral spine was measured with tape and scapular index was estimated
according to the following formula. The scapular index is CP to SN / PLA to TS &#x000d7;100<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The analysis of the study results was done using the statistical processing program SPSS
20.0 for Windows, and means and standard deviations of all results were calculated. In order
to determine the pre&#x02013;post change within the groups a paired t-test was used, and to
determine the difference in changes between groups ANOVA was used. The post-test was done by
using LSD and its level of significance (&#x003b1;) was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The observational data regarding CVA and scapular index results within the groups is

statistically significant difference and, there was no significant improvement in changes in
the CVA between groups. This result implies that each of the three exercises had a similar
effect on FHP improvement. This study result is consistent with that of Kim<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which the CVA was much improved via
the McKenzie exercise over a period of 4 weeks. Furthermore, a study by Park<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which strengthening exercises of the
neck and chest muscles using elongation and elastic bands was applied and reported a
positive effect of the exercise on the CVA and the RSP. Moreover, another study proved that
the Kendall exercise had a positive effect on the CVA through changes in the CVA by
comparing treatment and control groups where 10-week Kendall exercises with five steps were
applied for 2 weeks<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also the other
study showed a positive effect of horse-riding exercise and Kendall exercise groups on FHP
after an 8-week intervention<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because
the SSEG had no less effect statistically than the other exercise groups, it can be
suggested as another exercise to improve FHP.</p><p>The scapular index results that all three groups had a statistically significant difference
and between the groups before and after the intervention had no significant difference
statistically. The post-test results using the LSD did have a significant difference between
SSEG and KEG statistically. This result seemed that KEG is more focus on shoulder retractors
than SSEG. Mckenzie and Kendall exercises are commonly used for improvement FHP. Also,
self-stretch exercise can suggest new exercise for improvement FHP and RSP because SSEG have
similar effect other groups. A study reported that a positive effect on FHP and RSP by
applying the intervention of chest muscle stretch and scapular protraction exercises using a
foam roller as a chin-in and chest exercise for swimming athletes<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the other study showed that correct alignment and
stability improvements of head, shoulder, and upper extremities as well as muscle
strengthening by applying the stretch exercise of chest muscles and shoulder retraction
muscles for 6 weeks<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, a study
reported positive results on the CVA and the RSP measurements through 2-week chest muscle
exercises and expected that the applied stretching intervention would play a major role in
treating FHP and RSP in the clinical field<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared to the previous studies, our study also increased the CVA
and the scapular index, which revealed that the applied exercises had a positive effect on
FHP and RSP. Also, it is recommended to be included in a large sample size in a future
study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CY</given-names></name></person-group>: Postural patterns of daily life of male high school students by
