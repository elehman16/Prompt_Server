Oral bisphosphonates, first-line therapy for most patients with osteoporosis, are associated with suboptimal adherence to therapy due to factors that include a complex dosing regimen and gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients. Intravenous bisphosphonates address these limitations through infrequent injectable dosing that assures 100% bioavailability. Intravenous zoledronic acid is the newest bisphosphonate to be approved for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims:</title><p>This review assesses the evidence for the therapeutic effects of intravenous zoledronic acid for the treatment of osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence review:</title><p>Zoledronic acid 5 mg administered as an annual 15-min intravenous infusion has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and other fractures in a three-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in women and men with a recent surgical repair of low-trauma hip fracture, it reduced the risk of new clinical fractures and improved survival. In both studies, zoledronic acid was associated with a good safety profile and was generally well tolerated.

It is approved as a single-dose treatment of Paget&#x02019;s disease of bone in men and women. Zoledronic acid is also available as a 4 mg dose (Zometa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA) that is FDA-approved for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma, and bone metastases of solid tumors, given as often as every 3&#x02013;4 weeks.</p><p>Zoledronic acid is an aminobisphosphonate with a high affinity for mineralized bone. Administered as an intravenous infusion over at least 15 min, it rapidly localizes to bone, where it inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting the action of the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase in the mevalonate pathway. The relatively long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity for bone mineral.</p><p>This review addresses the evidence for the use of zoledronic acid in the treatment of osteoporosis in women and men.

There are no symptoms of osteoporosis until a fracture occurs.</p><p>Osteoporosis and low bone mass (osteopenia) are common conditions that affect about 44 million people in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce-4-013">6</xref> Worldwide, osteoporosis is estimated to be present in over 200 million individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ce-4-013">7</xref> While osteoporosis can occur at any age, it becomes more common with aging, predisposing many older individuals to fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-4-013">4</xref> About 55% of adults aged 50 and older are at risk, 80% of whom are women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce-4-013">6</xref> An estimated 50% of women and 25% of men above age 50 will sustain an osteoporotic fracture of the hip, spine, or wrist during the remainder of their lifetime.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ce-4-013">6</xref> Fracture risk increases with decreasing BMD, advancing age, and in the presence of clinical risk factors that include previous fracture, parent with hip fracture, current cigarette smoking, chronic glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, and excess alcohol intake.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ce-4-013">8</xref> The burden of osteoporosis is expected to worsen in the future, in part due to the aging of the population. In 2005 there were an estimated two million new osteoporotic fractures in the US; by 2025, that number is predicted to increase to three million.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ce-4-013">9</xref></p><p>Osteoporotic fractures are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. These fractures may cause acute and chronic pain, diminished quality of life, and high healthcare expenses for the individual and society. Nearly one-third of hip fracture patients enter a nursing home within a year of their fracture, and 20% of osteoporotic hip fracture patients die within that same time period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-4-013">4</xref> Loss of independence is a major fear of the elderly, with 80% of women above the age of 75 preferring death to placement in a nursing home as a result of a hip fracture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-4-013">4</xref> Fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist have been found to affect quality of life measures to a degree that is similar to that seen in other serious chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ce-4-013">10</xref></p><p>The total direct cost of osteoporosis-related medical care is estimated to be $US17 billion annually in the US<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ce-4-013">9</xref> and &#x020ac;31.7 billion in the EU.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ce-4-013">8</xref> Hip fractures account for 14% of incident fractures and 72% of fracture costs, with the number of hip fractures and associated costs expected to double or triple by 2040.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-013">11</xref> Following a fracture, a patient&#x02019;s overall healthcare expenses increase as well. In a population-based study of patients from Olmsted County, Minnesota, US, the direct medical costs in the year following a fracture increased from $US761 to $US3884 per patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ce-4-013">12</xref> Indirect costs due to lost wages and diminished productivity of the patient and/or caregiver were not considered in this analysis. It is likely that the true socioeconomic burden of osteoporotic fractures is greatly underestimated by most studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ce-4-013">4</xref></p><p>In collaboration with numerous medical societies, the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) developed and recently released an updated comprehensive clinicians&#x02019; guide for the management of osteoporosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce-4-013">13</xref> This guide is intended to be used by clinicians to assist in making decisions in the evaluation and treatment of individual patients. It provides indications for BMD testing in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older, and suggests ways to evaluate patients for factors contributing to low BMD and skeletal fragility. NOF treatment recommendations are based on BMD and/or personal history of fracture, or an assessment of 10-year fracture probability according to a US adaptation of the WHO fracture risk algorithm, FRAX&#x02122;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ce-4-013">14</xref> The NOF guide focuses on providing clinical tools for the identification of patients who are at high risk of fracture and most likely to benefit from pharmacologic intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Current therapeutic options</title><p>Universal recommendations for skeletal health in all adults over age 50 include a daily intake of at least 1200 mg elemental calcium with diet, plus supplements, if needed, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 800&#x02013;1000 IU.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce-4-013">13</xref> Regular weight-bearing exercise and muscle-strengthening exercise to reduce the risk of falls and fractures is advised. Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol intake (three or more drinks per day) should be avoided.</p><p>Medications approved for osteoporosis prevention include estrogen, raloxifene (an estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist), and three bisphosphonates, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate, all of which are classified as antiresorptive (anticatabolic) agents that inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption. Those approved for osteoporosis treatment include antiresorptive drugs raloxifene, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid, and salmon calcitonin, and one anabolic (bone-forming) drug, teriparatide [parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1&#x02013;34].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce-4-013">13</xref> Other drugs, such as strontium ranelate, etidronate, and PTH (1&#x02013;84) are approved in some countries but not the US.</p><p>Registration of a drug for the treatment of osteoporosis in the US and the EU requires demonstration of vertebral fracture risk reduction in a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Some approved drugs have been proven to reduce fractures at other skeletal sites as well. For example, there is evidence that alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid reduce hip fracture and nonvertebral fracture risk,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ce-4-013">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ce-4-013">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce-4-013">18</xref> and teriparatide has been shown to reduce nonvertebral fracture risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ce-4-013">19</xref> Estrogen has proven fracture risk reduction at the spine, hip, and other skeletal sties, but is not recommended as first-line therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis due to adverse events associated with long-term use. All of these drugs are approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, while alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and teriparatide are currently approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men.</p><p>The registration trials for alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate were conducted with daily dosing of medication, although the dosing interval most often used now is weekly for alendronate, weekly or monthly for risedronate, and monthly for oral ibandronate. Ibandronate may also be given as an intravenous infusion every three months. Raloxifene, nasal calcitonin, teriparatide, and strontium ranelate require daily administration. The dosing regimen for oral bisphosphonates requires a 30-min postdose fast for alendronate and risedronate, and a 60-min postdose fast for ibandronate. Oral bisphosphonates have been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some clinical practice patients, although in clinical trials there have been no significant differences in gastrointestinal adverse events in bisphosphonate-treated patients versus those on placebo. Rarely, bisphosphonates have been associated with a syndrome of persistent myalgias and arthralgias that may recur on rechallenge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ce-4-013">20</xref> Bisphosphonates, particularly when given intravenously for cancer patients, such as those with multiple myeloma or breast carcinoma, have been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ce-4-013">21</xref> Raloxifene and estrogen share an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ce-4-013">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ce-4-013">23</xref> Raloxifene is also associated with an increased incidence of leg cramps and vasomotor symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ce-4-013">24</xref> while estrogen reduces vasomotor symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ce-4-013">18</xref> Teriparatide has been linked with osteosarcoma in rodent models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ce-4-013">25</xref> Osteosarcoma did not occur when the rodents had exposure of less than 70% of their lifespan,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ce-4-013">26</xref> and does not appear to be a problem in adult humans treated with approved doses for osteoporosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ce-4-013">27</xref> Teriparatide is also associated with transient hypercalcemia 4&#x02013;6 hours after injection and elevation of uric acid not associated with clinical gout.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ce-4-013">19</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Unmet needs</title><p>Despite the availability of excellent diagnostic tools and evidence demonstrating the efficacy of medications to treat osteoporosis and reduce fracture risk, a significant proportion of patients with osteoporosis is undiagnosed and untreated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-013">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ce-4-013">28</xref> Even when patients are treated for osteoporosis, it is common for medication to be taken incorrectly or for too short a time to provide benefit in terms of fracture risk reduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ce-4-013">29</xref></p><p>The multinational IMPACT study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ce-4-013">30</xref> evaluated the accuracy of radiographic diagnoses of vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women with a new diagnosis of osteoporosis based on BMD measurements.

In a study that analyzed hospital records for patients diagnosed with osteoporosis and/or osteoporotic fractures, the annual incidence of osteoporosis in women 50 years or older was estimated to be 58568 per million inhabitants; however, only 4823 cases were diagnosed, representing just 8.2% of the expected figure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ce-4-013">31</xref> In another study of 95 patients aged 65 years or older having surgery for hip fracture, none had a BMD assessment during hospitalization or were scheduled to have it as an outpatient procedure, and only 2% reported receiving pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis at discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ce-4-013">32</xref></p><p>Adherence to treatment is less than optimal.

Previous use of oral bisphosphonates was allowed, provided criteria for a predefined washout period were met. Concomitant use of the following osteoporosis medications was allowed at the time of entry into the study and during follow-up: hormone therapy, raloxifene, calcitonin, tibolone, tamoxifen, dehydroepiandrosterone, ipriflavone, and medroxyprogesterone. Patients were placed into one of two strata according to whether they were taking osteoporosis medications at baseline. Those assigned to stratum 1 were not taking any osteoporosis medications at the time of randomization, while those in stratum 2 were all taking an allowed medication. Patients with previous bisphosphonate treatment who met washout criteria were included in the study. Patients were excluded from participation for any previous use of PTH or sodium fluoride, use of anabolic steroids or growth hormone within six months of trial entry, use of oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids within 12 months, and any previous use of strontium ranelate. Patients with a serum calcium level of more than 11 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L) or less than 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L), a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min at either of two baseline visits, or urine dipstick protein of more than 2+ without evidence of contamination or bacteriuria were also excluded. Patients were randomized to receive a 15-min intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg (n = 3889) or placebo (n = 3876) at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. A treatment window of 90 days (&#x02212;1 month/+2 months from one-year anniversary of prior infusion) was allowed for the administration of repeat infusions. All patients received supplemental calcium 1000&#x02013;1500 mg and vitamin D 400&#x02013;1200 IU per day. Primary endpoints were new vertebral fractures in stratum 1 and hip fracture in both strata. Secondary efficacy endpoints included any nonvertebral fracture, any clinical fracture, and clinical vertebral fracture. Other secondary endpoints were changes in BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine, and changes in bone resorption markers (serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen) and bone formation markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen).</p><p>HORIZON-RFT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 2127 women and men age 50 and older (mean age, 74.5 years) with a recent low-trauma hip fracture. All enrolled patients had both legs and were walking before the hip fracture. Concomitant therapy with nasal calcitonin, selective estrogen receptor modulators, hormone replacement, tibolone, and external hip protectors was allowed. Prior use of bisphosphonates or PTH was allowed according to a prespecified washout period. Exclusions included prior use of strontium ranelate or sodium fluoride, hypersensitivity to a bisphosphonate, potential for pregnancy, calculated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, corrected serum calcium level of more than 11 mg/dL (2.75 mmol/L) or less than 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L), active cancer, metabolic bone disease other than osteoporosis, and a life expectancy of less than six months. The duration of the study was event driven, with 211 clinical fractures required to have a power of 90% to detect a 35% reduction in the rate of clinical fracture in the zoledronic acid group compared with the placebo group. Patients were assigned to receive a yearly 15-min intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg (n = 1065) or placebo (n = 1062), with the first dose administered within 90 days after surgical repair of a hip fracture. If the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 15 ng/mL or less, or if the level was not available, patients received a loading dose of either vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or D<sub>2</sub> (at 50 000&#x02013;125 000 IU, orally or intramuscularly) 14 days before the first infusion of a study drug. Thereafter, all patients received daily supplementation with oral calcium (1000&#x02013;1500 mg) and vitamin D (800&#x02013;1200 IU). The median follow-up was 1.9 years. The primary endpoint was a new clinical fracture, excluding fractures of the face and digits, and fractures in abnormal bone, such as those seen with metastatic cancer.

The NOF lists zoledronic acid as an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of osteoporosis but does not categorize the cost-effectiveness of individual drugs and recognizes that clinical decisions on whom to treat and how to treat must consider factors in addition to cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Resource utilization</title><p>The US Surgeon General<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-013">11</xref> and the NOF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ce-4-013">13</xref> have described osteoporosis as a public health problem of huge magnitude, with clinical consequences and healthcare costs that are expected to increase with the aging of the population. This is likely to extract a large toll in terms of personal suffering, lost productivity for the patient and family caregivers, and higher healthcare costs for individuals and society. The morbidity of osteoporotic fractures, especially those of the hip and spine, are a strain on interpersonal relationships between patients and their families. Osteoporosis-related fractures create a heavy economic burden, causing over 432 000 hospital admissions, almost 2.5 million medical office visits, and about 180 000 nursing home admissions annually in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ce-4-013">11</xref> The cost to the healthcare system associated with osteoporosis-related fractures has been estimated at $US17 billion in 2005; hip fractures account for 14% of incident fractures and 72% of fracture costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ce-4-013">9</xref> Due to the aging population, the Surgeon General estimates that the number of hip fractures and their associated costs could double or triple by the year 2040.</p><p>The use of intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg every 12 months in appropriately selected patients can be expected to substantially reduce the risk of fractures.

The safety and tolerability profile has been generally very good. These groups can expect to benefit from fracture risk reduction with greater convenience and perhaps improved adherence compared with the more frequent oral dosing of other medications with proven fracture risk reduction. Zoledronic acid is an attractive option for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis because of the assured 12-month compliance, but can also be used in women who are not able to take oral bisphosphonates due to gastrointestinal intolerance, gastrointestinal contraindication, or malabsorption.</p></sec><sec><title>Dosage, administration, and formulations</title><p>Zoledronic acid is an injectable aminobisphosphonate with potent antiresorptive activity and high affinity for mineralizing bone. It is administered as a 5 mg intravenous infusion through vented intravenous tubing over no less than 15 min. It is supplied in a prepackaged bottle of zoledronic acid 5 mg/100 mL. After opening the solution, it is stable for 24 hours at 2&#x02013;8 &#x000b0;C (36&#x02013;46 &#x000b0;F). If refrigerated, the refrigerated solution should be allowed to reach room temperature before administration. Storage is recommended at 25 &#x000b0;C (77 &#x000b0;F) with excursions permitted to 15&#x02013;30 &#x000b0;C (59&#x02013;86 &#x000b0;F).</p><p>Patients, especially those on diuretic therapy, should be hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid; drinking several glasses of water before leaving home is probably sufficient for most patients. Zoledronic acid should be used with caution in patients taking other drugs that are potentially nephrotoxic. Since transient increases in serum creatinine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function, zoledronic acid is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min.</p><p>To reduce the risk of hypocalcemia and for general bone health, patients should have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D. The NOF recommends a daily intake of at least 1200 mg elemental calcium with diet plus supplements, if needed, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 800&#x02013;1000 IU/day.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical value</title><p>Osteoporosis is a major public health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality, resulting in a substantial personal burden to patients and caregivers, and an economic burden to individuals and a healthcare system with limited resources. It is underdiagnosed and undertreated, and when treated, many patients do not take medication correctly or do not take it long enough to achieve the expected benefit. Efforts to optimize skeletal health in all patients include regular physical activity, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, and avoidance of cigarette smoking and excess alcohol. When drug therapy to reduce fracture risk is started, it is imperative that patients take medication regularly, correctly, and long enough to benefit from the reduction in fracture risk.</p><p>The use of once yearly intravenous zoledronic acid offers the potential to improve effectiveness in clinical practice by providing 100% bioavailability, eliminating concern of malabsorption of oral bisphosphonates due to intestinal disease or incorrect administration, and providing a drug that reduces bone turnover for at least one year after a single infusion. It has proven antifracture efficacy at all important skeletal sites in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, and has been shown to reduce the risk of new clinical fractures, as well as all-cause mortality, in men and women with a previous hip fracture. It is associated with a favorable safety profile and was generally well tolerated in both large fracture prevention trials. Postdose, flu-like symptoms in clinical trials were transient, and in clinical practice such symptoms may be mitigated by treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
