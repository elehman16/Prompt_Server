Most of the deaths were caused by <italic>Plasmodium (P</italic>.<italic>) falciparum</italic> infections [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Various control measures have helped reduce the number of malaria cases but many of the tools employed such as drugs and insecticides are vulnerable to development of resistance. The availability of an effective vaccine is a critical tool for sustainable control and eventual elimination of malaria from endemic regions [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>During the blood stage of its life cycle, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> merozoites invade and multiply within host erythrocytes. Parasite proteins that mediate erythrocyte binding and invasion are considered attractive candidates for blood stage malaria vaccines since antibodies directed against such parasite ligands may block erythrocyte invasion, limit parasite multiplication and thereby provide protection against malaria [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The erythrocyte binding antigen 175 kDa (EBA-175) is one of the high-affinity ligands that binds sialic acid residues of glycophorin A on the red cell surface to mediate invasion [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The amino-terminal, conserved, cysteine-rich region of EBA-175, referred to as PfF2, contains receptor-binding sites for glycophorin A [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Antibodies directed against the PfF2 region block binding of EBA-175 to erythrocytes and inhibit parasite growth <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Merozoite surface protein-1 (195 kD MSP-1) is also thought to play an important role in RBC invasion [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. PfMSP-1 contains a C-terminal, conserved cysteine-rich region, referred to as PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> that is retained on the surface of merozoites during invasion while rest of PfMSP-1 is proteolytically cleaved and shed [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Naturally acquired antibodies against PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> that inhibit erythrocyte invasion by preventing the proteolytic processing of PfMSP-1 are associated with protection against clinical malaria [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Previous clinical studies to evaluate vaccine potential of PfMSP-1 have tested constructs based on PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> as well as larger C-terminal constructs based on a 42 kD C-terminal fragment (PfMSP-1<sub>42</sub>). A Phase I trial with recombinant PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> fused to T-helper (T<sub>h</sub>) epitopes from tetanus toxoid formulated with alhydrogel demonstrated generation of specific antibodies although the trial was discontinued due to hypersensitivity reactions in some of the subjects [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other trials have utilized a larger C-terminal fragment, MSP-1<sub>42</sub> that exhibits greater immunogenicity [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recombinant PfMSP-1<sub>42</sub> formulated with AS02A elicited high antibody titers but failed to reduce parasite densities and overall incidence of clinical malaria episodes in young children in Western Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In another approach immunization with recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) and modified vaccina virus (MVA) based vectors designed to deliver PfMSP-1<sub>42</sub> in a heterologous prime-boost immunization regime induced PfMSP1-specific antibody responses [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The receptor-binding domain EBA175 has also been tested in a Phase I clinical trial. Recombinant EBA175 binding domain formulated with aluminum phosphate was immunogenic in humans and elicited invasion inhibitory antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>We have conducted a phase I clinical trial with blood stage malaria vaccine, JAIVAC-1, which is composed of a mixture of recombinant PfF2, the binding domain of EBA175 from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CAMP strain, and PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub>, the C-terminal conserved region of PfMSP-1 derived from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> FVO strain, formulated with the adjuvant Montanide ISA720. Montanide 720 is a biodegradable, water-in-oil emulsion composed of mineral oil mixed with surfactant mannide mono-oleate in a 1:1 ratio [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It exerts adjuvant effects by several mechanisms including the slow release of antigen, recruitment and stimulation of antigen presenting cells, and diffusion of oil droplets to draining lymph nodes [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pre-clinical immunogenicity studies have demonstrated that JAIVAC-1 formulated with Montanide ISA720 elicits balanced antibody responses against both PfF2 and PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> and exhibits significant growth inhibitory activity against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [unpublished data].

Exploratory analysis to measure the quality of the humoral immune response by IgG subtyping using ELISA was originally planned for all three cohorts on Days 0, 28, 56, 180, 208 and 365 for both the antigens. But since PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> gave poor immune response, IgG subtyping of antibodies elicited against PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> was not performed. Furthermore PfF2 was significantly immunogenic at higher doses (Cohort 2 and 3 compared to Cohort 1) hence IgG subtyping of antibodies against PfF2 was performed on sera samples for subjects immunized with JAIVAC-1 vaccine in Cohorts 2 and 3. IgG subtyping was not performed for subjects immunized with Hepatitis B vaccine as the control subjects had no antibody response against both <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> antigens.</p><p>In brief, ELISA plates were coated with 5&#x003bc;g/ml of PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> or 2&#x003bc;g/ml of PfF2. After washing, serially diluted test serum samples and reference standard sera were added to the plates. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG or biotin&#x02013;conjugated mouse anti&#x02013;human isotype&#x02013;specific IgG and avidin-peroxide conjugate were added to the plate followed by substrate o-phenylenediamine substrate solution. The plates were read at 492 nm using Versamax ELISA reader. Reference standard hyper-immune sera which gave an optical density (OD) of 1.0 in our standardised assay were included as controls. Duplicates of the serially diluted standard reference hyper-immune sera were included on each test plate in order to generate a standard curve. The standard curve was fitted to a four-parameter hyperbolic function, which was used to convert the absorbances of individual test sera into antibody units using the ADAMSEL software. IgG subtype data was reported as the OD at 492 nm (OD<sub>492</sub>). The relative abundance (percent) of each IgG subclass was estimated based on relative mean OD values.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Assessment of anti-parasite Immunofluoroscence Assay (IFA)</title><p>IFA was used to test recognition of native antigens (PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> and PfF2) in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizonts and merozoites. In brief, synchronised <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 were fixed in ice cold methanol on 12 well immunofluoroscence slides and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. Test sera were added at various dilutions starting at 1:5. Anti-PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> and anti-PfF2 mice sera and reference hyper-immune human sera were used as controls at 1:400 dilution. Na&#x000ef;ve human sera and pre-immune mice sera were used as negative controls. Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-human IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were used. Slides were mounted with a drop of Antifade with DAPI (4&#x02019;-6-Diamidno-2-phenylindole, a nuclear stain) and viewed using a Nikon TE 2000U fluorescence microscope at 100X magnification using an oil immersion objective lens.

GIA against three parasite strains (<italic>P</italic>.<italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7, <italic>P</italic>.<italic>falciparum</italic> CAMP and <italic>P</italic>.<italic>falciparum</italic> FVO) was planned for sera samples collected on Days 0, 56, 208 and 365. But since PfF2 showed highest antibody titres in Cohort 3, therefore, GIA was performed only for samples of Days 0 and 208. Anti-JAIVAC-1-induced IgG were tested in GIA against PfF2 homologous parasite strain, CAMP, and PfF2 heterologous parasite strain, 3D7. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CAMP is dependent on sialic acid residues on glycophorin A for erythrocyte invasion but <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 invades neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes indicating that it can use sialic acid-independent invasion pathways. GIA was performed with PfF2 heterologous strain 3D7 to check whether the antibodies display any potential for growth inhibition of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> strains that use alternative invasion pathways. Since antibody responses to PfMSP1<sub>19</sub> were poor, GIA with <italic>P</italic>.<italic>falciparum</italic> FVO strain, which is homologous to PfMSP1<sub>19</sub>, was not performed. IgGs purified from sera samples of two randomly chosen Hepatitis B vaccine recipients from Cohort 3 were tested for GIA activity as negative controls. The percent GIA activity of purified IgG was calculated as follows: 100 &#x02212; (OD<sub>650</sub> of infected RBCs with test IgG &#x02212; OD<sub>650</sub> of normal RBCs only)/(OD<sub>650</sub> of infected RBCs without any IgG&#x02212;OD<sub>650</sub> of normal RBCs only)&#x000d7;100.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Forty-five subjects who were found eligible after screening assessments were sequentially enrolled into three dose escalating cohorts. Within each Cohort, 15 subjects each were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either JAIVAC-1 or Hepatitis B vaccine. Each subject was assigned a unique, cohort specific, three-digit randomisation number.</p><p>Randomization List was generated by the Biostatistics department of DiagnoSearch Life Sciences (the CRO) using Block Randomization method. Six blocks were used for each Cohort. Of these six blocks, three blocks were used to randomize 15 subjects in a cohort and another three to generate 15 additional randomization numbers. In each of the three blocks, two blocks were of size six and one block was of size three.</p><p>Printed copies of the randomization lists were provided to Bilcare Ltd. (Vendor for IP packaging) for labelling of vaccine packs and correctly assigning a randomization number; to the site for counter checking the correct assignment of the vaccine to a randomization number and for preparation of vaccine according to the protocol using vaccine packs; to the two sponsors, ICGEB and EVI. A printed copy along with a soft copy of the randomization list was maintained by the biostatistics department of DiagnoSearch.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Blinding</title><p>This clinical trial was designed as a single-blind study.

The &#x0201c;vaccine manager&#x0201d; was a qualified and trained pharmacist who was dedicated to vaccine preparation while the &#x0201c;vaccinator&#x0201d; was an independent physician/nurse, who was responsible for administration of the assigned vaccine to the individual subject as indicated in the randomisation list. Though the &#x0201c;vaccinator&#x0201d; was aware of the vaccine being administered to the subject, he/she was not directly involved in evaluation of AEs following vaccination and follow up of subjects.</p><p>Appropriate measures were taken to ensure subject blinding during vaccine administration. The immunization within a Cohort was staggered over three days so that subjects did not get a chance to interact with each other. The vaccine preparation area and the vaccine administration area were physically separated because the study and control vaccines could be distinguished by their appearance and the syringe barrels were covered with opaque tape to ensure subject blinding. Adherence to randomisation list was verified by the study monitor by checking the randomisation list against the study vaccine administration records at each study visit. Post-vaccination there was minimal contact between subjects within a Cohort. Subjects left the study site after three hours of assessment of immediate reactogenicity and did not meet each other for the next 28 days (except for 24 hour housing of the first three subjects of Cohort 1). The adverse events were recorded in the subject diary cards. Further, being a dose escalating study, subjects belonging to different cohorts never met.</p><p>While performing the immunogenicity assessments the scientists involved with ELISA and IFA were also blinded.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>This was a safety and immunogenicity study, and the sample size of 45 subjects was taken based on previous clinical trials with malaria vaccine candidates and to demonstrate the safety and tolerability profile of the investigational vaccine in comparison to the control vaccine.

One interim analysis was performed for data obtained till 28 days after the third dose of the vaccine for each cohort.</p><p>The humoral response to the vaccine antigens PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> and PfF2 was assessed by measuring the primary antibody response, booster response and immune-persistence. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of the antibodies is used for measuring the humoral response along with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). For calculating GMTs the titers are log transformed using base 10. The Log transformed titers are summarised as N, Mean, Median, SEM, Maximum, Minimum and Inter-Quartile Range. Statistical analysis is performed to compare the difference between groups at each time point using the SAS software package. The immune response data is analysed by Wilcoxon test for paired comparison, Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple group comparisons or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to compare categorical variables as appropriate.

Combination B vaccine (proteins RESA, MSP1 and MSP2) formulated with Montanide ISA 720 was highly reactogenic in Australian adults but was very well tolerated in adults and children in Papua New Guinea [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study the maximum antigen dose was limited to 50&#x003bc;g of each antigen and an extended immunization schedule of 0, 1and 6 months was followed, which may explain the absence of delayed reactogenicity. As with other Montanide adjuvanted vaccines, pain at injection site was the most common local solicited event. Additional local reactogenicity symptoms were observed but did not appear to increase with increasing dose of JAIVAC-1.</p><p>Therefore, although JAIVAC-1 was more reactogenic in comparison to Hepatitis B vaccine, it had a good safety profile when compared with the pattern of adverse events reported in literature for recombinant vaccines formulated with Montanide ISA720 [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Montanide ISA720 has been repeatedly used in pre-clinical and clinical trials of different malaria vaccine candidates and in particular of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> AMA-1 [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117820.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Montanide ISA 720 adjuvant formulation is highly immunogenic and is known to induce robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses. Immunisation with JAIVAC-1 formulated with Montanide ISA720 elicited high levels of antibodies against PfF2 with response peaking a month after the third immunisation. However, the antibody response elicited against PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> was poor. In the previous clinical studies, Keitel et al had produced two recombinant MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antigens derived from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 and FVO strains in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> fused to tetanus toxoid T-helper epitopes P30 and P2 [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] They noted no clear dose-response relationship for the FVO MSP-1<sub>19</sub> vaccine groups but had reported a dose-response relationship for the 3D7 MSP-1<sub>19</sub> vaccine groups. Although both vaccines were immunogenic, several subjects in both the groups experienced apparent hypersensitivity reactions after receiving the third dose. In JAIVAC-1 vaccine, PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> was derived from FVO <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> strains and did not induce significant PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> antibody responses.</p><p>A positive dose-response for antibody responses against PfF2 was observed; higher JAIVAC-1 vaccine dose resulted in significantly higher antibody response against PfF2. The number of vaccine responders in the 25&#x003bc;g and 50&#x003bc;g dose groups increased significantly after three vaccinations. The ant-PfF2 and anti- PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> antibodies induced by JAIVAC-1 vaccine recognise the native parasite protein in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> schizonts as studied by IFA. The pattern of recognition was similar to the known punctate localisation pattern of EBA175 at the apical end of merozoites. The anti-PfF2 ELISA titers correlated with IFA titers. Given the poor recognition of PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> by IFA it is not surprising that the pattern of recognition appears to match the pattern of distribution of EBA-175 in schizonts/merozoites. The poor immunogenicity of PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> is unlikely to be due to dominance of PfF2 as this was not observed in pre-clinical studies [unpublished data]. Inclusion of widely recognized T-helper epitopes in the recombinant PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> construct may be required to improve immunogenicity of this candidate antigen. Antibodies generated by JAIVAC-1 vaccine had substantial parasite growth inhibitory activity. Invasion of erythrocytes by the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CAMP strain is dependent on the presence of sialic acids on glycophorin A, while 3D7 parasites invade erythrocytes via alternate pathways that do not involve sialic acids [<xref rid="pone.0117820.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Purified IgG from the sera of JAIVAC-1 vaccinated (50&#x003bc;g dose) individuals inhibited invasion of the CAMP strain (homologous for the PfF2 immunogen tested here). The reduced inhibition of invasion of 3D7 parasite could be due to the ability of 3D7 parasites to invade erythrocytes via sialic acid independent pathway(s). Efficient inhibition of erythrocyte invasion by parasites such as 3D7 may require the addition of other parasite ligands to the antigen combination in the vaccine. In conclusion, in this phase I clinical trial, JAIVAC-1 vaccine demonstrated a good safety profile and was able to induce significant antibody responses in malaria-naive individuals. Additionally, the functional properties of these antibodies were demonstrated by their ability to partially inhibit parasite growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. These observations provide support for the inclusion of PfF2 as a component of a multicomponent vaccine for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria. However, the problem of poor immunogenicity of PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> needs to be addressed. Addition of widely recognised T-helper epitopes to recombinant PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> may provide T cell help and boost antibody responses against PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s002"><label>S1 Final Analysis Listings</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s003"><label>S1 Pre-screening Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s004"><label>S1 Main Subject Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s005"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>A Phase I, Randomised, Controlled, Dose-escalating, Single blind Clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of JAIVAC-1 vaccine (PfMSP-1<sub>19</sub> and PfF2) formulated with Montanide ISA 720 in Healthy Indian Male Subjects between 18 to 45 years of age.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117820.s006"><label>S1 Subject Diary Card</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117820.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Serum Institute of India, Pune, India for providing Hepatitis B vaccine.
