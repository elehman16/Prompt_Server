This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) for the treatment of patients with either a primary anxiety disorder or a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms compared to a placebo, as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-nine patients with a diagnosis of a primary anxiety disorder or a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms were enrolled in this study. Patients with a stable dose of antidepressant therapy were randomized according to a 2:1 probability of receiving either quetiapine XR or a placebo adjunctive treatment for 8 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Clinical Global Impression of severity (CGI-S) score at baseline, week 1, 4, and 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 35 patients were included in this intention-to treat (ITT) population for the efficacy analysis (quetiapine XR: 22 patients; placebo: 13 patients).

Major depressive disorder (MDD) with comorbid anxiety is highly prevalent: ~85% of adults with major depression also exhibit significant anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Comorbid anxiety leads to more severe symptoms, decreased psychosocial functioning, a higher risk of suicide and a more chronic course, compared to a major depressive disorder alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; in addition, it is associated with poorer and slower treatment response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The treatment options for primary anxiety and comorbid anxiety symptoms include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants. However, not all patients equally benefit from the anxiolytic effects of antidepressants.</p><p>Treatment strategies for patients with anxiety disorders and comorbid anxiety symptoms that have not responded to therapy with an antidepressant include: changing the antidepressant monotherapy, augmentation with another agent or combination therapy with another antidepressant agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although augmentation or combination therapy is commonly used in clinical practice, evidence supporting these strategies is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The benzodiazepines are frequently used to treat sleep and anxiety in addition to SSRI therapy for a major depressive disorder with comorbid anxiety; however, cognitive impairment and concerns with regard to potential abuse and/or dependency with these agents has limited their use. In clinical practice, the atypical antipsychotics are commonly used as augmentation therapy in patients presenting with a mood disorder (typically a major depressive disorder) with comorbid anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Support for investigation of atypical antipsychotics in patients presenting with a mood disorder and comorbid anxiety is based in part on preclinical studies suggesting that several atypical antipsychotics are potent 5-HT2A antagonists at low doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and may facilitate the action of serotonin at the 5-HT1A receptor, thereby augmenting the efficacy of antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, certain atypical antipsychotics have other pharmacologic properties that may contribute to antidepressant effects including: &#x003b1;2 antagonism (risperidone), 5-HT1A agonism (aripiprazole and ziprasidone) and monoamine reuptake blockade (ziprasidone). Furthermore, there is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of anxiety symptoms, suggesting their possible clinical utility for major depression and comorbid anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Quetiapine is known as an atypical antipsychotic with a moderate affinity for 5-HT2A serotonergic, &#x003b1;1-adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic receptors, a minor affinity for dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and a low affinity for 5-HT2C, &#x003b1;2-adrenergic and D1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. While atypical antipsychotics have been successfully used for the treatment of mood disorders with comorbid anxiety, comprehensive data on the clinical efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy with quetiapine for patients with a primary anxiety disorder or a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety has not been collected. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a randomized, placebo-controlled study design for testing the safety and efficacy of extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as adjunctive therapy added to antidepressants for the treatment of patients presenting with a primary anxiety disorder or a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design.

No statistically significant changes were observed between the two groups from baseline to week 4 and week 8. Throughout the study, one patient in the quetiapine XR group had a weight gain &#x02265;7% at Week 8, while two patients in the placebo group had a weight gain &#x02265;7% at Week 1, Week 4 and Week 8. The results of laboratory measurements, vital signs, physical examinations, weight change and body mass index were clinically comparable in comparisons between the two groups. Throughout the treatment period, no effect on the AIMS global severity scores was observed in the quetiapine XR or placebo groups. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups according to the BARS and SAS rating scales.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The primary outcome measures (HAM-A and CGI-S) assessed in this pilot study showed no significant differences between the quetiapine XR and placebo groups at week 8. However, treatment with quetiapine XR as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy appeared to provide a short-term benefit at 4&#x02009;weeks in difficult-to-treat patients with primary or comorbid anxiety despite on-going antidepressant treatment. These results should be considered preliminary due to the limitation of a small sample size. Based on a mean change in the HAMA of 9 in the quetiapine XR arm and 4 in the placebo arm (difference = 5) and a deviation of 8 for both treatments, 35 patients in the placebo arm and 75 patients in the quetiapine XR arm would be needed to have a power of 85% at a significance level of 0.05.</p><p>A previous flexible-dose open-label pilot study, reported by Katzman et al., found that adjunctive quetiapine XR significantly reduced HAM-A scores at week 12 in patients with treatment-resistant or non-remitted GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The results of our study showed a significant reduction in the HAM-A score at Week 8 with adjunctive quetiapine XR. However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the treatment and placebo groups. Placebo effects clearly played a significant role in the reduction of anxiety measured in this study. The failure to find a significant difference on the primary efficacy measure at week 8 could in part be explained by the small sample size as well as the heterogeneous study group. Although quetiapine monotherapy has been demonstrated to be effective, demonstrating quetiapine efficacy as adjunct therapy to antidepressant has proven difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The analyses on the subsets of patients with a primary anxiety disorder and those with a mood disorder and comorbid anxiety symptoms revealed no significant difference in the treatment response between these two groups. However, these analyses lacked statistical power due to the small sample sizes after stratification.</p><p>Quetiapine XR was generally safe and well-tolerated as adjunctive treatment in patients with primary or comorbid anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study, EPS-related AEs were not observed with quetiapine XR during the study period. Laboratory data revealed no clinically relevant changes in glucose in the patients receiving quetiapine XR. At week 8, the changes in patient weight were 1.25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.87 and 2.44&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.81 for quetiapine XR and placebo groups, respectively. However, the benign side effect profile, noted in this study, might have been due to the low dose used.</p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned limitations associated with the small sample size, other limitations of the present study include the following. It is difficult to clearly distinguish patients with a primary anxiety disorder from those with a mood disorder and comorbid anxiety symptoms. Therefore, the possibility of misclassification could not be ruled out. Regarding dosing, the dose of quetaipine XR in this study was relatively low, and the flexible dosing schedule might have confounded the results. A similar study in the future should consider a multiple arms design with different fixed doses to determine dose-dependent effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Augmentation of antidepressant treatment with quetiapine XR did not result in clinical improvement in the outcome measures of anxiety using the HAM-A and CGI-S scores at week 8 in patients with either a primary anxiety disorder or a mood disorder with comorbid anxiety symptoms. However, treatment with quetiapine XR as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy appeared to provide a short-term benefit at 4&#x02009;weeks. The results of this pilot study should be considered preliminary due to the limitations of a small sample size and the dosing strategy. A well-powered sample size and a multiple-arms design with different fixed doses to determine dose-dependent effects should be considered for future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>In the past 3&#x02009;years, YCC received lecture fees from Astra-Zeneca Ltd.
