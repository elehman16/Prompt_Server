The subjects aged 68.1&#x000b1;2.1 yrs were randomised into a soccer (SG; n = 9), a resistance (RG; n = 9) and a control group (CG; n = 8). The subjects in SG and RG, respectively, trained 1.7&#x000b1;0.3 and 1.8&#x000b1;0.3 times weekly on average during the intervention period. Muscle function and body composition were determined before and after 16 and 52 weeks of the intervention period. In SG, BMI was reduced by 1.5% and 3.0% (p&#x0003c;0.05) after 16 and 52 weeks, respectively, unchanged in RG and 2% higher (p&#x0003c;0.05) in CG after 52 weeks of the intervention period. In SG, the response to a glucose tolerance test was 16% lower (p&#x0003c;0.05) after 16 wks, but not after 52 wks, compared to before the intervention period, and unchanged in RG and CG. In SG, superoxide dismutase-2 expression was 59% higher (p&#x0003c;0.05) after 52 wks compared to before the intervention period, and unchanged in RG and CG. In RG, upper body lean mass was 3 and 2% higher (p&#x0003c;0.05) after 16 and 52 wks, respectively, compared to before the intervention period, and unchanged in SG and CG. In RG, Akt-2 expression increased by 28% (p&#x0003c;0.01) and follistatin expression decreased by 38% (p&#x0003c;0.05) during the 52-wk intervention period, and was unchanged in SG and CG. Thus, long-term soccer training reduces BMI and improves anti-oxidative capacity, while long-term resistance training impacts muscle protein enzyme expression and increases lean body mass in elderly men.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01530035">NCT01530035</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the FIFA - Medical Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) (F-MARC Project 31964; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.f-marc.com/">http://www.f-marc.com/</ext-link>), The Danish Ministry of Culture (Kulturministeriets Udvalg for Idr&#x000e6;tsforskning) (TKIF 2010-027; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kum.dk/">http://kum.dk/</ext-link>), and Nordea-fonden (Grant code: 02-2011-4360; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nordeafonden.dk/">http://nordeafonden.dk/</ext-link>).

In addition, increased adiposity and oxidative stress are commonly observed in elderly sedentary subjects leading to an increased risk of developing life-style related disease [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Exercise training has repeatedly been shown to counteract these adverse effects [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, exercise interventions designed to preserve muscle function and/or muscle mass, reduce adiposity and enhance antioxidant capacity may prove vital for an independent lifestyle, and successful, healthy aging.</p><p>The physical activity recommendations for aging subjects include a minimum of 150 min of moderate intensity or 60 min of vigorous physical activity per week [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and resistance training recommendations comprise 10&#x02013;15 repetitions of 8&#x02013;10 exercises that involve major muscle groups at moderate to high intensity at least twice per week [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, a combination of resistance and aerobic training seems more efficient than either of the training forms alone [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the health benefits of recreational soccer have been comprehensively investigated [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With respect to the aging subject, recreational soccer has been shown to stimulate both the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, as indicated by high heart rates and elevated blood lactate levels during training for untrained elderly players (+65 yrs) [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In elderly men with life-long participation in soccer, cardiac function, exercise performance and body composition were shown to be superior when compared to age-matched untrained males [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and when untrained, healthy elderly men engage in 16 weeks of soccer training substantial health and performance adaptations have been shown to occur [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, recreational soccer training may serve as an important alternative to training modalities traditionally applied to maintain physical function, health, and longevity in the aging population such as resistance and endurance training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The present study represented an independent part of a comprehensive 52-wks interventional protocol investigating cardiovascular [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], skeletal [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and performance adaptations [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as well as changes in psychological quality of life in the study participants [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As such, studies from our research group have recently compared the performance effect and cardiac adaptations of recreational soccer with that of resistance training in elderly subjects [8;11]. However, the effects of soccer training in comparison to resistance training on variables such as leg muscle mass, fat mass distribution, muscle anti-oxidative capacity and glucose control have not been investigated in elderly untrained male subjects.</p><p>Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term effects of soccer training on body composition, anti-oxidative capacity and glucose tolerance and furthermore, evaluate the response on these variables to a similar period of resistance training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Subjects</title><p>Elderly male subjects were recruited via advertisements in local newspapers.

Medical screening was performed before the start of the intervention period. No subjects took any medication during the study, and none of the subjects were smokers. With the exception of one subject, who was a recreational golfer, none of the subjects had been involved in regular physical exercise training during a major part of their adult life. The participants reported that they had been primarily inactive the past 5&#x02013;10 yrs. Exclusion criteria were symptoms or history of cardiovascular disease, hyperglycaemia, or diagnosed hypertension. During the initial phase of the intervention period, one subject from the soccer training group left the study due to an Achilles tendon tear, and the data from this subject have been excluded.

The subjects in CG continued with their daily routines and did not change lifestyle during the intervention period. In both SG and RG, the training was supervised during the entire intervention period. The soccer training sessions were conducted outdoors from April to November on a 30-45-m-wide and 45-60-m-long natural grass area and consisted of small-sided games (three-a-side, four-a-side or five-a-side). In the event of an uneven numbers of participants, one of the investigators joined in. For the first 12 wks, each training session was initiated with a 15-min low-intensity warm-up, including stretching, and the training was organised as 3x15-min exercise periods with 2-min rest periods. From 13&#x02013;52 wks, the players perform an individual 5-min warm-up prior to the soccer training followed by 4x15-min exercise periods with 2-min rest periods. Due to seasonal weather variations, the soccer training was performed in an indoor gym with a 20 x 40 m wooden floor from November to March.</p><p>In RG, 5 min of low intensity warm-up was followed by resistance training including five exercises: Leg press, seated leg extension, hamstring curl, lateral pull-down and lateral dumbbell raises. Each set of exercises was separated by 1.5 min rest, and at the end of each training session 5 min of core training (crunches, hip extension, side bends, diagonal lifts, and trunk rotation) was performed. The individual training loads were set using the &#x0201c;RM&#x0201d; (repetition maximum) notion for resistance training. The training intensity in each exercise was progressively increased as follows: 3 sets of 16&#x02013;20 RM (week 0&#x02013;4), 3 sets of 12 RM (week 5&#x02013;8), 3 sets of 10 RM (week 9&#x02013;12) and 4 sets of 8 RM (week 13&#x02013;52), and the participants were encouraged to perform the exercises with maximal speed during the concentric phase of the movement. From week 25 and onwards, lunges (performed as standing lunges with dumbbells) and seated row (performed as cable pulls) (4 sets of 8 RM) were added to the training prescription. Determination of 16, 12, 10 and 8 RM was carried out in four week intervals.</p><p>During the 52-wk intervention, the attendance rate for SG and RG was 66&#x000b1;4% (range: 61&#x02013;114 training sessions) and 73&#x000b1;3% (77&#x02013;116 training sessions), respectively. The average number of training sessions per week over the full 52-wk intervention was 1.7&#x000b1;0.3 (1.2&#x02013;2.2) and 1.8&#x000b1;0.3 (1.4&#x02013;2.2) in SG and RG, respectively.

The muscle tissue of dry weight samples (2 mg) was homogenized (1:400) in a 0.3 M phosphate BSA buffer adjusted to pH 7.7 and phosphofructokinase (PFK), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD), and citrate synthase (CS) muscle enzyme activity was determined fluorometrically as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Muscle analysis&#x02013;Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>For determination of muscle fibre cross sectional area, fibre type distribution, and capillarization, the embedded muscle samples were cut using a cryostat, and transverse sections 8 &#x003bc;m in thickness were placed onto glass slides. To verify the cross-sectional orientation of the individual muscle fibre, multiple samples were cut and examined under light microscopy until at cross-section of desirable size, orientation, and uniform polygonal appearance was visible. Only areas without artefacts or tendency to longitudinal cuts were analyzed. Staining targets were visualized pair wise using a standard protocol as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Firstly, capillaries and myofibre type I/IIA were visualized, followed by visualization of myofibre borders and myofibre type slow/type I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t001">Table 1</xref>). Specificity of the staining was assessed by single staining, and by staining without the primary antibody. Three individual muscle fibres types were identified as types I (red), IIA (green), and IIX (unstained/black) [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148236.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Visualization was performed on a computer screen using a light microscope (Carl Zeiss Axio Imager M1, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and all morphometric analyses were performed using a digital analysis program (Carl Zeiss, AxioVision 4.6). Two or more separate sections of a cross-section were used for analyses, and the cross-sectional area was assessed by manually drawing the perimeter around each selected section. The number of muscle fibres and capillaries within each section was counted, and capillary supply was subsequently expressed as capillaries per fibre (C:F-ratio) and capillary density (capillaries mm<sup>-1</sup>). A mean of 143 myofibres (range: 89&#x02013;231) were analyzed per biopsy, and mean fibre area was assessed by manual drawing of the perimeter of each muscle fiber. All analyses were carried out manually by the same blinded investigator.</p><fig id="pone.0148236.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0148236.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Representative immunofluorescent histochemical staining.</title><p>Targets shown are; myofibre borders (top left/blue), capillaries (top right/light green) and myofibre type I/IIA (top right/dark green), myofibre type slow/type I (bottom left/red) and a merged over-lay af the above (bottom right).

In short, the freeze dried and dissected muscle tissue was homogenized before the total protein concentration in each sample was determined by a BSA standard kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL, US.). Samples were mixed with 6 x Laemmli buffer (7 ml 0.5M Tris-base, 3 ml glycerol, 0.93 g DTT, 1 g SDS and 1.2 mg bromophenol blue) and ddH<sub>2</sub>0 to obtain the same total protein concentration. From each muscle biopsy two samples were made, and samples from the same subject were loaded on the same gel and the standard western blot procedure was performed. The intensity of each band were first normalized to the mean intensity of two human standard lysates loaded on the same gel and then normalized to the PRE group mean value separately for SG, RG and CG. As previously described [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] outliers were identified and excluded. The exclusion criteria were set to ratio changes from 0 to 16 wks and from 0 to 52 weeks &#x000b1; 2 SD away from the group mean. As ratios are, by definition, not normal distributed and were log transformed before the statistical analyses and then back transformed to geometric means with the 95% confidence interval. Changes in percent were obtained as the differences in geometric means. The specific antibodies used to determine muscle protein expression are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t001">Table 1</xref>.

Shapiro-Wilk (normality of the distribution) and Levene&#x02019;s (homogeneity of variance) tests were calculated before statistical evaluation for all experimental data to justify the application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics. To meet the assumptions for applying general linear models, logarithmical transformation was applied in the case of a significant normality test. The variables OGTT AUC and TC/HDL-cholesterol ratio were separately analyzed with the application of Friedman&#x02019;s repeated measures ANOVA on ranks. Changes in protein expression were determined using one-way repeated measures ANOVA separately for SG, RG and CG, respectively, based on data being expressed in arbitrary units making comparisons between groups difficult to interpret. When a significant time-by-group effect could be detected a Student&#x02013;Newman&#x02013;Keuls (SNK) stepwise multiple comparisons procedure was applied to determine differences in group means between different time points. Also, Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc test analysis was applied for comparison. Significant and non-significant (NS) Tukey&#x02019;s stepwise multiple comparisons procedure p-values are reported. For missing values the last observation carried forward method was used. All analyses were controlled with two-way repeated measures ANOVA without imputations and no relevant statistical differences were found. Data are reported as mean &#x000b1; SEM. p&#x0003c;0.05 was chosen as the level of significance.

In addition, a 52-wk period of resistance training resulted in higher total and upper body lean mass with no changes in anti-oxidative potential and glucose tolerance. Furthermore, several factors, such as muscle oxidative enzyme activities and fibre type area, did not change in neither the soccer nor the resistance training group during the intervention period, although the training significantly impacted the cardiovascular and muscular systems [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In the soccer training group SOD-2 expression was 59% higher after 52 wks of training. In accordance, it has been observed that basal SOD-2 expression is higher and oxidative stress is lower in endurance-trained compared to untrained elderly [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the soccer training group, the average heart rate during the soccer training was around 80% of HRmax and for 17% of a training session heart rate was above 90% of HRmax [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The high aerobic loading during soccer training may as such have been the driving force for the elevated SOD-2 expression observed in the soccer training group. This is in agreement with a study investigating the effects of 8 wks of high-intensity aerobic training in elderly subjects observing an 30% increase in SOD-2 expression [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, endurance and soccer training appears to be effective in improving skeletal muscle SOD-2 expression in elderly men. In contrary, SOD-2 was unchanged (15%; p&#x0003e;0.05) in the resistance training group after 52 wks. A higher training volume or a longer training period of resistance training may be needed to elicit changes in by SOD-2 expression.</p><p>It was an unexpected observation that the maximal activity of CS was unaffected by training (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t003">Table 3</xref>), despite the fact that the CS activity prior to the intervention period was low and at a similar level to that of other untrained subjects [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The soccer training was performed with a high aerobic loading [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and further, the subjects trained for 1 h per session and training frequency increased from 2 to 3 sessions per week after 16 wks of the intervention period. As such, this finding is in contrast to observed increases in CS activity after 12 wks of soccer training in untrained men [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Generally, a limited muscular response to training was observed in the participating subjects, and also maximal HAD activity and capillary density were the same after 52 wks compared to before the intervention. It might be speculated, that the activity profile during recreational soccer with more than two-thirds of the training time being spent with standing, walking and jogging [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], does not provide a sufficient training stimulus to induce muscular adaptations in old untrained men. Also, 52 wks of resistance training conducted with high loads and relatively few repetitions did not create changes in oxidative capacity. Thus, the muscular training response appears inhibited in elderly subjects [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and stronger and/or different stimuli may be needed to create significant changes in muscle oxidative enzymes.</p><p>The OGTT response in the soccer training group was better after 16 wks compared to before the intervention period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t004">Table 4</xref>). This suggests an improved glucose control. Glut-4 is considered to be the most important glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and is thought responsible for both insulin-stimulated and contraction-induced glucose uptake [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the augmented OGTT response may partly be related to an increase in glucose transport capacity as evaluated by the expression of GLUT-4, even though only a tendency (p = 0.07) was observed in the soccer training group after 52 wks. However, there does not appear to be a close link, as the OGTT response was the same, and the Glut-4 expression was lower in the resistance training group after 52 wks compared to before the intervention period. This is in contrast to findings in other studies assessing the effect of resistance training on glucose tolerance in elderly subjects with impaired glucose tolerance observing increases in GLUT-4 expression and glucose tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Fifty-two weeks of soccer training did not lead to changes in fasting glucose, insulin, and HbA1c (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t004">Table 4</xref>), which may reflect that the subjects at baseline had a HOMA-IR which was close to the ideal level (HOMA-IR = 1) suggesting a normal glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t004">Table 4</xref>). Nevertheless, the soccer training group had a non-significant (p&#x0003e;0.05) 27% reduction in fasting insulin after 52 wks compared to before training, which was greater (p&#x0003c;0.05) than the 12% non-significant (p&#x0003e;0.05) reduction observed in the resistance training group. Lowered fasting insulin may reflect a diminished need for insulin to control the blood glucose concentration. In accordance, the calculated odds ratio of having a positive change in glycaemic control after 24 wks of soccer training was 2.3 (95% CI: 0.34 to 16.2) in middle-aged type 2 diabetic subjects compared to a control group [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Altogether, soccer training appears to be an effective training method to positively change glucose control and favorably impact the response to a standardized glucose challenge during the initial phase of a training period even in elderly men with no established indications of impaired glucose metabolism.</p><p>In the soccer training group, lean body mass after 52 wks was not different from baseline values. Other studies have shown increases in lean body mass ranging from 1.0 to 1.7 kg after 12&#x02013;16 wks of soccer training in untrained [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This was also the case in the initial phase (wks 0&#x02013;16) of the present investigation, and it is unclear why the lean body mass decreased in the soccer training group during the last 36 wks of soccer training. Also, it is not clear why a decrease in BMI was observed in the soccer training group after 52 wks despite a reported positive energy balance, but it may be that the methods used to monitor energy intake and consumptions are inaccurate. After 16 wks of resistance training, total body lean mass was 2% higher compared to baseline levels, with no further changes observed after 52 wks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0148236.t002">Table 2</xref>). The increase in lean body mass was due to a rise in upper body lean mass which is likely to reflect the fact that the resistance training involved a number of exercises specifically confined to the upper extremity. The reason for the lack of improvement in lean mass of the lower body training is not known, however, different muscle groups tend to respond differently to training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Mean fibre size of the vastus lateralis was unaltered in both the soccer training and the resistance training group during the study period. In young men, average muscle fibre size has been shown to increase by 15% after 12 wks of soccer training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which is of similar magnitude to the change observed in old men after heavy resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One of the reasons for the lack of increase in muscle mass may be related to insufficient intake of proteins. The daily protein intake of the participants was higher than the recommendation of the American Dietetic Association of 0.8 g/kg/day for elderly people, but there is evidence that larger amounts of protein are required during a period with exercise training [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The lack of effect on the muscle mass may also have been influenced by the timing of protein intake in relation to the training session, which was not controlled [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Collectively, after 52 wks of regular soccer training, total and leg lean mass were maintained in elderly men, whereas resistance training increased upper body lean mass without any change in body mass.</p><p>The present study also investigated the expression of Akt-2 and mTOR, which are related to muscle tissue hypertrophy signaling [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Akt-2 expression was unchanged in the soccer training group, whereas it was higher in the resistance group after 52 wks. Thus, resistance training may have impacted muscle signaling cascades involved in muscle growth and repair. However, the expression of mTOR, a key hypertrophic regulator and a down-stream target of Akt, was not changed in either group during the intervention period. This might in part explain the absent hypertrophic response in the leg muscles observed in the present study. It should though be underlined that the biopsies were obtained several days after the last training, and it cannot be excluded that Akt-2 and mTOR was transiently elevated after each training session [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Follistatin expression did not change in the soccer training group during the intervention period, whereas it was lower in the resistance training group after 52 wks compared to baseline. This was a surprising finding, as follistatin antagonizes the actions of myostatin, which is known as a powerful negative regulator of muscle growth [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, myostatin abundance may not reflect myostatin activity, and the present study did not distinguish between active and inactive, latent states of myostatin. Thus, in the resting state, the expression of hypertrophic regulators was not altered during a period of soccer training, whereas resistance training changed the basal expression of such proteins.</p><p>The concentrations of HDL, LDL, total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides in the blood did not change during the intervention period in either group. The lack of change may be due to the blood cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations being close to an optimal level before the study [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It should be noted, that the TC:HDL-ratio in the soccer raining group was 8 and 12% lower after 16 and 52 wks, respectively, compared to before the intervention period, with comparable changes observed in the resistance training group. TC-HDL-ratio has been reported to contribute to 32% of the calculated population-attributable risk [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and such changes may therefore play an essential role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, the clinical effect of a reduction in TC-HDL-ratio in a group of healthy elderly subjects without cardiovascular disease is unknown.</p><p>The SNK and Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc analysis approaches were both applied following the finding of a significant ANOVA test. The SNK method uses different critical values for different pairs of mean comparisons unlike the Tukey&#x02019;s test. The SNK procedure is therefore more likely to incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis and to falsely reveal significant differences between group means (known as a statistical type I error). Hence, the former method is considered very powerful but less conservative than the latter [<xref rid="pone.0148236.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. When a more conservative analytical approach was taken, it appears reasonable to state, that longer training periods (+16 wks) is needed to ensure adaptations in some (e.g. blood lipids) but not all of the tested variables of the present study.</p><p>In summary, long-term soccer training positively impacted the skeletal muscle anti-oxidative potential in elderly untrained men with little or no prior experience with soccer training. Also, soccer training favorably altered glucose control in the initial part of the training period, and maintained lean body mass throughout the intervention despite a marked reduction in body mass and BMI. Furthermore, long-term resistance training appeared effective in increasing upper body lean mass and changing the expression of major regulatory signaling proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148236.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148236.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148236.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Original study protocol in Danish language.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148236.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148236.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Translated study protocol in English language.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148236.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0148236.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Minimal data set underlying the findings in the present study including individual values on anthropometric characteristics, as well as on blood and muscle characteristics in elderly subjects after 0, 16 and 52 wks of soccer training (SG), resistance training (RG) and continuation of an inactive lifestyle (CG).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0148236.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to sincerely thank the participants in the study for their efforts.
