Yet, United Kingdom residents have positive feelings about hot summers that may undermine their willingness to protect themselves against heat. We randomly assigned United Kingdom participants to 1 of 3 intervention strategies intended to promote heat protection, or to a control group. The first strategy aimed to build on the availability heuristic by asking participants to remember high summer temperatures, but it elicited thoughts of pleasantly hot summer weather. The second strategy aimed to build on the affect heuristic by evoking negative affect about summer temperatures, but it evoked thoughts of unpleasantly cold summer weather. The third strategy combined these 2 approaches and succeeded in evoking thoughts of unpleasantly hot summer weather. Across 2 experiments, the third (combined) strategy increased participants&#x02019; expressed intentions to protect against heat compared with the control group, while performing at least as well as the 2 component strategies. We discuss implications for developing interventions about other &#x0201c;pleasant hazards.&#x0201d;</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>emotions</kwd><kwd>weather</kwd><kwd>heat wave</kwd><kwd>affect heuristic</kwd><kwd>availability heuristic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Heat waves can pose a threat to health and well-being.

Daily maximum temperatures were higher than 28 &#x000b0;C (or 82 &#x000b0;F) on 19 consecutive days, including eight days when temperatures exceeded 30 &#x000b0;C (or 86 &#x000b0;F; <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-2">Met Office, 2013a</xref>). Although 2013 brought the first United Kingdom heat wave in seven years (<xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-3">Met Office, 2013a</xref>) experts predict that climate change will increase the frequency, intensity, and length of heat waves (<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recommended heat protection behaviors include avoiding the midday sun, drinking plenty of liquids, and reducing alcohol intake (<xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1">Hajat, O&#x02019;Connor, &#x00026; Kosatsky, 2010</xref>). A few studies have suggested that United Kingdom residents may be reluctant to implement recommended heat protection behaviors. In qualitative interviews, United Kingdom residents with risk factors for adverse health effects saw heat protection recommendations as unnecessary because they did not see themselves as being at risk (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1">Abrahamson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1">Wolf, Adger, Lorenzoni, Abrahamson, &#x00026; Raine, 2010</xref>). Tourists from the United Kingdom (and other Northern countries) say that they plan to stay in the sun for many hours, even during midday, when on summer holidays (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1">Evans, Shickle, &#x00026; Morgan, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1">Manning &#x00026; Quigley, 2002</xref>). Interviews with United Kingdom migrants to Spain suggest that they are less likely than locals to follow heat protection practices (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1">Fuller &#x00026; Bulkeley, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we relied on behavioral decision research to promote heat protection intentions. Behavioral decision research posits that people use heuristics to make judgments about the riskiness of events and the need for protection (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1">Slovic, Finucane, Peters, &#x00026; MacGregor, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1">Tversky &#x00026; Kahneman, 1973</xref>). We developed heat protection intervention strategies that built on two well-documented heuristics. The first aimed to invoke the <italic>availability heuristic</italic> (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-2">Tversky &#x00026; Kahneman, 1973</xref>), by increasing the salience of experiences with hot weather. The second strategy aimed to build on the <italic>affect heuristic</italic> (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-2">Slovic et al., 2004</xref>), and was designed to increase negative feelings about hot weather. We tested, separately and jointly, the usefulness of invoking these heuristics for promoting heat protection behaviors.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Increasing the Salience of Risky Events: Interventions Based on the Availability Heuristic</title><p>The availability heuristic refers to using the salience of an example event as a cue for judging the likelihood that a similar event will occur (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-3">Tversky &#x00026; Kahneman, 1973</xref>). For example, people who have recent experiences with floods perceive greater flood risks, likely because floods are more vivid to them (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1">O&#x02019;Connor, Yarnal, Dow, Jocoy, &#x00026; Carbone, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1">Siegrist &#x00026; Gutscher, 2006</xref>). Media coverage has also been associated with higher risk perceptions, perhaps as a result of increasing the salience of adverse events (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1">Combs &#x00026; Slovic, 1979</xref>).</p><p>However, we posit that priming hot summers may not necessarily be effective for promoting concerns about heat protection among United Kingdom residents. A qualitative interview study has suggested that the prospect of increased summer temperatures elicits positive responses among United Kingdom residents, including those who may be more vulnerable to adverse health effects from heat (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2">Abrahamson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-2">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, correlational evidence suggests that feeling positive about heat is related to lower willingness to protect against heat (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1">Lefevre et al., 2015</xref>). These results are consistent with other correlational evidence suggesting that people perceive less risk when they feel good about a hazard&#x02014;a pattern seen for sun exposure (<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1">Br&#x000e4;nstr&#x000f6;m, Brandberg, Holm, Sj&#x000f6;berg, &#x00026; Ull&#x000e9;n, 2001</xref>), wood-burning fireplaces (<xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1">Hine, Marks, Nachreiner, Gifford, &#x00026; Heath, 2007</xref>), and speeding (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1">Rhodes &#x00026; Pivik, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Eliciting Negative Feelings About Risky Events: Interventions Based on the Affect Heuristic</title><p>Research on the affect heuristic finds that negative affect is associated with higher perceptions of risk (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-3">Slovic et al., 2004</xref>). For example, exposure to media reports that elicit negative emotions increases perceptions of risk (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1">Holman, Garfin, &#x00026; Silver, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1">Johnson &#x00026; Tversky, 1983</xref>). Promoting fear also increases perceptions of risk and willingness to take protective action (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1">Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, &#x00026; Fischhoff, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1">Roeser, 2012</xref>). Indeed, fear appeals may lead to behavior change, as long as people know the recommended protection strategies and recognize them as effective (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1">Ruiter, Abraham, &#x00026; Kok, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1">Witte &#x00026; Allen, 2000</xref>). In qualitative interviews, United Kingdom residents have demonstrated knowledge of recommended heat protection behaviors, including drinking plenty of water, staying out of the sun, and delaying physical activities to a cooler time of day&#x02014;but they showed little motivation to implement those behaviors due to not perceiving themselves at risk (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-3">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Even mild negative emotions, such as feelings of unpleasantness, can influence risk perceptions (<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" id="cr2-1">Alhakami &#x00026; Slovic, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1">Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, &#x00026; Johnson, 2000</xref>). For example, negative mood has been linked to gray weather and lower temperatures, especially among people living in cooler climates (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1">Keller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1">Schwarz &#x00026; Clore, 1996</xref>). Negative mood also increases the likelihood of remembering unpleasant experiences in different domains, including weather (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1">Mayer, McCormick, &#x00026; Strong, 1995</xref>). When asked to provide &#x0201c;a description of the weather that starts with the letter c,&#x0201d; people in a negative mood are more likely than people in a positive mood to think of cold and cloudy weather, rather than clear and calm weather (<xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-2">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>However, we posit that priming negative emotions about events that are inherently seen as positive may not be effective for promoting risk protection behaviors. Qualitative studies have suggested that people in the United Kingdom may feel positive about hot summer weather, with negative feelings being directed at low summer temperatures (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-2">Fuller &#x00026; Bulkeley, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1">Harley, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-4">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>). If so, then efforts to evoke negative affect about summer weather in the United Kingdom will increase the salience of unpleasantly cold summers, and be relatively ineffective for promoting heat protection behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Increasing Salience and Negative Affect: Interventions Based on the Availability <italic>and</italic> the Affect Heuristic</title><p>Here, we examine the joint as well as the individual effects of strategies building on the availability and the affect heuristic. That is, we examine United Kingdom residents&#x02019; responses to strategies increasing the availability of experienced hot weather, positive affect about hot weather, or both. We posit that, for focal events that are perceived as positive, warnings that aim to promote risk protection will be more effective if they build on both the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic, rather than on either heuristic alone. Specifically, increasing the availability of hot weather should trigger positive affect unless negative affect with respect to hot weather is explicitly evoked. Conversely, priming negative affect should increase recollections of cold summer weather, unless the availability of hot summer weather is explicitly evoked. Although high and unpleasant temperatures may not be salient to United Kingdom residents, qualitative interviews suggest that United Kingdom residents sometimes do complain when the weather gets hot (<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-2">Harley, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-5">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>We report on two experiments that manipulated availability and negative affect, separately and jointly. We measured effects on recalled temperatures, pleasantness ratings of those recalled temperatures, and intentions to protect against heat. Experiment 1 was conducted after the 2013 heat wave and Experiment 2 during a hot spell in the summer of 2014. Each experiment included four groups of participants. The first group received instructions based on the availability heuristic, asking them to recall the highest temperature experienced during the past summer. The second group received instructions based on the affect heuristic, asking them to recall the most unpleasant temperature experienced in the past summer. The third group received combined instructions, asking them to recall the most unpleasant highest temperature experienced in the past summer. The control group engaged in free recall, with control participants in Experiment 1 receiving no temperature recall instructions, and control participants in Experiment 2 receiving instructions to think about &#x0201c;any&#x0201d; temperatures experienced in the past summer. All groups then reported their intentions to protect against heat. We tested the following hypotheses:

As in Experiment 1, we found that the most unpleasant highest temperature recall instructions was among the most effective in promoting heat protection intentions. It led to greater heat protection intentions than the highest and any temperature recall instructions, possibly due to eliciting thoughts of hot weather that was relatively unpleasant. It was as good as the most unpleasant temperature recall instructions, which, compared with Experiment 1, elicited thoughts of relatively high temperatures.</p><p>In Experiment 1, the greater heat protection intentions in the most unpleasant highest (as compared with the most unpleasant) temperature recall conditions had been partially due to participants reporting higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc3-3" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In Experiment 2, the most unpleasant highest (vs. most unpleasant) temperature recall instructions also led participants to recall higher temperatures, but the significant differences were less pronounced than in Experiment 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" id="fgc1-5" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although we do not know why these differences between experiments occurred, it is possible that they reflect the differential weather conditions experienced during Experiment 1 versus Experiment 2. Experiment 1 was conducted 3 months after the 2013 heat wave, when temperatures had already been cooling down and remembered high temperatures may have seemed especially pleasant. Experiment 2 was conducted during a period of very hot weather, when positive affect about high temperatures may have been somewhat lower. Under the latter conditions, it might be easier to recall more unpleasant hot weather even when it is not explicitly mentioned in temperature recall instructions. Thus, recent weather and time of year may play an important role in motivating heat protection behaviors. Yet, across the weather conditions for the reported experiments, the main conclusion holds that the most unpleasant highest temperature recall instructions were consistently better than or as good as the alternative strategies for promoting heat protection intentions.</p><p>Unlike Experiment 1, the control group in Experiment 2 did receive temperature recall instructions, which asked them to report the magnitude and pleasantness of any recalled temperatures. This control group recalled temperatures that were moderately high for the United Kingdom (25 &#x000b0;C) and pleasant&#x02014;as compared with the other groups in Experiments 1 and 2. Experiment 2 was conducted during a period of hot weather, making moderately high and pleasant temperatures easy to come to mind. It is possible that the control group would have recalled different temperatures if the study had been conducted at a different time of year, or during different types of weather. Although we cannot know what temperatures Experiment 1&#x02019;s control group participants had in mind, like Experiment 2&#x02019;s control group they had lower intentions to protect against heat, as compared with the other temperature recall groups.</p><p>Experiment 2 included two subsamples, including a returning sample that had already participated in Experiment 1, as well as a new sample recruited just for Experiment 2. In both samples, the overall pattern of results was similar. However, the repeat sample reported greater heat protection intentions than the new sample in Experiment 2, perhaps reflecting their repeated exposure to our experimental procedures (as in <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2">Schwarz et al., 2007</xref>). It is unlikely that these results reflect repeat participants&#x02019; greater inherent (prerecruitment) interest in heat protection, because in Experiment 1 they reported similar heat protection intentions as those who did not return for Experiment 2. Thus, messages that aim to motive people to protect against heat may need to repeat primes of unpleasant hot weather over time because in our experiments it was consistently among the most effective.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s26"><title>General Discussion</title><p>Heat waves can cause death, illness, and discomfort, and are expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change.

We therefore developed a strategy that aimed to invoke the availability heuristic by asking participants to remember high summer temperatures. However, it elicited thoughts of pleasantly hot summer weather. Our second strategy aimed to build on the affect heuristic by priming negative affect about summer temperatures, but it evoked thoughts of unpleasantly cold summer weather. Our third strategy combined these two approaches and succeeded in eliciting thoughts of unpleasant hot summer weather. Across two experiments, the third (combined) strategy increased participants&#x02019; expressed intentions to protect against heat compared with the control group, while performing at least as well as the two component strategies. The relative effectiveness may partly depend on the weather and the time of year, with reminders of the unpleasantness of hot weather seeming more important when United Kingdom weather has recently been cooler (and hot weather may be wished for.)</p><p>One limitation of the reported research is its focus on United Kingdom residents, who may be unusual in their positive affect about heat. Indeed, hot summer weather may be associated with negative affect among residents of the southern areas of the United States and Europe (<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-2">Keller et al., 2005</xref>).

In such cases, interventions may be more effective if they combine insights from the availability and affect heuristics, rather than building on either heuristic alone.</p><p>A second limitation is that we relied on participants&#x02019; self-reported heat protection intentions, rather than observations of their actual behavior. Although our temperature recall instructions did affect self-reported heat protection intentions, conclusions about effects on actual behavior would be premature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Our paper does provide the initial evidence that may be needed to convince health agencies to vary the wording of their messages, when aiming to promote heat protection behaviors.

Likewise, responses given on the Celsius response scale that were above the all-time maximum temperature recorded in the United Kingdom between May and September (38.5 &#x000b0;C) were treated as having used the Fahrenheit scale.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><label>2</label><p>Participants were also asked about keeping an eye on the isolated, elderly, and ill, as well as on babies and children. These items were excluded because they were not self-protective, could not be implemented by all participants, and were not included in our previous work on the association between heat protection behavior and positive affect (<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-3">Lefevre et al., 2015</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="fn3"><label>3</label><p>We used the &#x0201c;indirect&#x0201d; macro procedure for SPSS, which is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afhayes.com/spss-sas-and-mplus-macros-and-code.html" specific-use="live">http://www.afhayes.com/spss-sas-and-mplus-macros-and-code.html</ext-link>. Mediation tests were only applied to significant group differences. Mediation tests could not be applied to understand the observed differences in heat protection intentions between the most unpleasant highest temperature recall group and the no-instruction control group in Experiment 1, because the latter did not report temperatures or rate their pleasantness.</p></fn><fn id="fn4"><label>4</label><p>The effectiveness of temperature recall instructions did not vary with age (not shown), even though older age is a risk factor for experiencing adverse health effects from heat. Other studies have also found that older adults and younger adults are similarly responsive to heat protection messages, perhaps because older adults do not like to think of themselves as different from younger adults (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-4">Abrahamson et al., 2009</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="fn5"><label>5</label><p>Before Experiment 1 participants returned for Experiment 2, they received a so-called booster session in April 2014, to remind them of their temperature recall instructions before it got hot. The booster session had the same design as Experiment 2.

However, there was a significant interaction between experiment and temperature recall conditions on intentions to protect against heat, <italic>F</italic>(3, 753) = 3.32, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .02. Most notably, among these repeat participants, the difference between the most unpleasant highest and the most unpleasant temperature recall groups was only significant in Experiment 1 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.86, <italic>SD</italic> = .61 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 3.69, <italic>SD</italic> = .68; <italic>p</italic> = .01) and not in Experiment 2 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.80, <italic>SD</italic> = .54 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 3.75, <italic>SD</italic> = .63; <italic>p</italic> = .39).</p></fn><fn id="fn7"><label>7</label><p>In both experiments, differences in recalled temperatures between these conditions were larger than the just noticeable difference in indoor temperature, which presumably lies in the range of .09--.80 &#x000b0;C (<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1">Lee, Cho, Yun, &#x00026; Lee, 1998</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="fn8"><label>8</label><p>For different research purposes (e.g., <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1">Khare et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-4">Lefevre et al., 2015</xref>), participants in both experiments also rated the frequency of recent heat protection behaviors. Experiment 1 asked participant to rate the frequency of heat protection behaviors &#x0201c;during the heat wave of 2013.&#x0201d; Experiment 2 asked participants to rate the frequency of heat protection behaviors &#x0201c;so far this summer (2014).&#x0201d; Experiment 1 revealed a significant effect of temperature recall instructions on the rated frequency of past behaviors, <italic>F</italic>(3, 1493) = 6.17, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001, as did Experiment 2, <italic>F</italic>(3, 2259) = 5.26, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001. Moreover, Experiment 2 revealed no significant interaction between sample type and temperature recall instructions, such that the repeat sample and the new sample gave reports of past behaviors that were influenced by their temperature recall instructions. Because participants of Experiment 1 and new-sample participants of Experiment 2 had not received temperature recall instructions until <italic>after</italic> those recent behaviors could have been implemented, we conclude that the recall of past behaviors was likely influenced by temperature recall instructions. Although this finding suggests that temperature recall instructions were effective in terms of changing participants&#x02019; motivation for heat protection, conclusions about the effect of temperature recall instructions on actual heat protection behavior should be drawn with caution.
