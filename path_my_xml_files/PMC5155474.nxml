However, there is apprehension among physicians, professional bodies, and patients, that low-cost medicines may be clinically inferior to the high-cost innovator brands (IBs).</p><p>Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It is a silent, invisible killer that rarely causes symptoms. Worldwide, hypertension is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths, about 12.8% of the total of all deaths.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Although this remains a vexing problem, hypertension can be prevented and is controllable.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) widely used as an antihypertensive.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In India, besides IB of amlodipine, various low-cost brands (LCBs) are also available. However, there are no published clinical trials comparing effectiveness and safety of IB versus LCB amlodipine in hypertension. This randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial was conducted to evaluate clinical effectiveness and safety of LCB versus IB amlodipine in hypertension with respect to systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction. Accordingly, our primary study end-points were (a) SBP reduction from baseline to study end and (b) proportion of patients experiencing at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), and our secondary end-points were (a) SBP change at each visit from baseline level and (b) changes of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to study end.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This Phase IV, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, crossover, noninferiority trial was initiated after approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee and was registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2015/01/005390). Recruitment was done from the medicine outpatient department of the hospital. Adult patients (age 18&#x02013;70 years) of either gender, newly diagnosed with Stage 1 hypertension (Joint National Committee 7 - SBP: 140&#x02013;159 mmHg or DBP: 90&#x02013;99 mmHg),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or isolated systolic hypertension with SBP 140&#x02013;159 and DBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg were included in the study. Patients with blood pressure (BP) more than 160 (systolic)/99 (diastolic) or conditions amlodipine were considered contraindicated (history of hypersensitivity to CCB) and pregnant, lactating women, or those on prior antihypertensives were excluded from the study.</p><p>Sample size was calculated assuming a noninferiority margin of 10 mmHg, a true mean difference of 5 mmHg, a standard deviation of 10 mm in SBP, 80% power, 5% level of significance, and considering 15% dropout rate, 28 evaluable patients were required. A fixed block randomization strategy (block size of six) with equal allocation ratio was done using randomization software. Allocation concealment was done by sealed sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The study physician who clinically assessed the patients was aware, but the patients themselves were unaware of the treatment allocation schedule. As it was a 2 &#x000d7; 2 crossover study, so after initial assessment for eligibility, patients were enrolled and randomized to be included either in sequence 1 (LCB/IB) or in sequence 2 (IB/LCB). Each sequence consisted of two periods, 6 weeks each with a wash-out period of 1 week in between. The study drug was amlodipine 5 mg once daily orally at 8 am either IB or LCB, in their respective periods in a crossover manner. Tablet Amlogard (Pfizer Limited) and tablet Amlopen (Morepen Laboratories Limited) were used as IB and LCB of amlodipine, respectively.</p><p>At baseline visit, data regarding age, gender, weight, pulse rate and BP were recorded and electrocardiogram was done. BP was measured using aneroid manometer and standard size cuff. Trough BP and pulse rate were measured in duplicate with the patient in the sitting position; mean values were calculated and recorded. Tolerability was assessed by taking history, and compliance was assessed by pill counts. Both groups received standard treatment for other concomitant diseases if present. Advice regarding lifestyle modification to control hypertension was given to all patients.</p><p>Data were captured at baseline visit and the end of 2, 4, and 6 weeks in each period. An intention to treat analysis was performed for determination of efficacy and safety analysis (i.e., all patients who had taken at least one dose of the study medication). Summary statistics of numeric variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation and categorical data as proportions. Numeric parametric data were analyzed using paired <italic>t</italic>-test, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) according to the condition; categorical data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between means was determined and P; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cost minimization analysis was calculated as percentage of cost difference between LCB and IB amlodipine. Adherence to medication by pill count method was calculated as the number of prescribed pills corrected for the number of returned pills divided by the period (in days) multiplied by 100%. An adherence level of at least 90% was defined as good.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>A total of thirty patients were screened, of which 28 (13 in sequence 1 and 15 in sequence 2) were enrolled.
