After analyzing the result of the questionnaire, 36 infertile women who showed signs
of mild to moderate depression were randomly placed into two following groups: control (n=18) and intervention (n=18). Before the treatment, the members of both groups
answered BDI-II, Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and 12 item Short Form Health

However, there are certain problems which could still inflict a great deal of stress on people. Infertility is a reproductive system disease which is defined as inability to achieve clinical pregnancy 12 months after having sexual intercourse without any prophylactic device (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It has been shown that the prevalence of lifetime infertility is between 6.6 to 26.4% worldwide, of which 9% showed infertility duration of 12 months. In 2007, 72 million women suffered from infertility worldwide (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Also in another study (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), it has been shown that 11.2 to 14.1% of Iranian couples experienced one or another form of subfertility. Infertility is also considered as one of those diseases leading to mental health disorders (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The high prevalence of infertility, therefore, necessitates the treatment for mental health stress of these couples. Approximately, one third of the infertility is associated with factors which are related to women, one third is related to men and one third is related to both men and women (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Despite all this, infertility is still considered as woman&#x02019;s problem, especially in the context of developing countries (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, in Iranian culture, the social implications of divorce, remarriage and separation causes severe mental stress for infertile women (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The infertility is suggested to be associated with bio-psychosocial crisis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), meaning stress contributing to many of the psychological disorders are the side-effects of infertility (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Therefore, along with treatment of infertility, the individuals&#x02019; mental health and social problems must be paid attention as well. Several studies have reported that sexual dysfunction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), eating disorders (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), depression disorder (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) are more common in infertile women as competed to the women with a healthy reproductive system. Furthermore sexual desire and arousal are lower in infertile women (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). </p><p>Another common problem of the infertile women is the decreased levels of life satisfaction and quality of life. Life satisfaction is a cognitive and judgmental process that is based on comparison of the individual&#x02019;s conditions with what is considered as a proper standard (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In a study by Callan and Hennessey (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), they found that the infertile women were less satisfied with their lives than the fertile ones. In addition quality of life as a multidimensional factor includes cognitive, behavioral capacities, emotional well-being and capabilities which are necessary for performing family, social and vocational roles (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Another research showed that health-related quality of life and sexual function are significantly lower in the women with primary infertility (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Also in a research, it has found that quality of life is lower in the infertile women than the men (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). </p><p>Many different methods have been developed for treating the psychological problems of the infertile individuals. For example, interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive psychotherapy (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), as well as emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) have been known as a few of the useful methods. However, positive psychology is a new approach which emphasizes on the individuals&#x02019; strengths that includes the scientific study of positive emotions, positive individual traits and positive institutions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Positive psychology as an intervention technique is applied to promote positive experiences, positive behaviors or positive cognitions (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This treatment method has been shown to be effective due to the following factors: helping those who do not respond positively to drug therapy, cost effective, taking a short period of time to improve positive mood, no stigmatization and no negative side-effects (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Some researchers have shown that since positive psychotherapy and interventions were effective on happiness and depression, it is likely to influence quality of life and life satisfaction (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Since no research has been conducted with regard to this issue in the infertile women, the aim of this research is, therefore, to study the effectiveness of the group positive psychotherapy on elevation of the life satisfaction and the quality of life in infertile women. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>This randomized trial study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. During April and June 2013, the women paying a visit to Motazedi Infertility Treatment Center, Kermanshah, Iran, were selected using the convenience sampling method and asked to answer the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). All the participants were signed an informed consent before entering the study. A total of 121 individuals answered the questionnaire, of whom 115 fully completed the form. Then, a clinical psychologist conducted a diagnostic interview with those who showed mild to moderate symptoms of depression using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSMIV-TR). Ultimately 49 people were found to meet the criteria to be included in the groups, of whom only 40 people were accepted to participate in the experiment. Out of these 40 individuals (four patients due to infertility treatment were dropped from the study), 36 people were randomly placed into two groups of intervention (n=18) and control (n=18) in a pre-test post-test control group design. The intervention group was divided into three subgroups of six individuals who received positive psychotherapy. However, the treatment of those in the control group was delayed until the end of the experiment. Before the treatment began, the participants in both groups were asked to answer the questions in the questionnaire regarding the life satisfaction and the quality of life. </p><p>The inclusion criteria in this study were as follows: i. Filling out the BDI-II, ii. Diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the major depression criteria mentioned in DSM-IV-TR criteria, iii. Not receiving psychiatric medication or any other form of psychotherapy treatment, and iv. Not having any other form of psychiatric disorder. The exclusion criteria in this study were as follows: i. Presence of physical problems interrupting the treatment process and ii. Presence of depression becoming more severe during the treatment period (in the event of intensified depression, the individuals from both groups were referred to a colleague who was a trained psychiatrist). Ultimately three people from the intervention group and two people from the control group were dropped out of the treatment process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><sec><title>Beck Depression Inventory II</title><p>The BDI-II measuring the symptoms for a two week-period contains 21 items. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 and total scores range from 0 to 63 that is interpreted as 0 to 13 for lowest depression, 14 to 19 for mild depression, 20 to 28 for moderate depression and 29 to 63 for severe depression (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This questionnaire has copies in countries such as Japan (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and Brazil (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The Persian version of the questionnaire was evaluated with alpha value of 0.87 and test-retest reliability of 0.74 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). </p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Graphic representation of participant flow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-10-105-g01"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Satisfaction With Life Scale </title><p>This scale was designed by Diener et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) </p><p>that is a very commonly used tool in researches on subjective-wellbeing (SWB) issues consisting of 5 items. Each item uses a Likert scale from 0 to 7 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In Iranian version, the reliability of Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) is 0.83 when using the Cronbach Alpha and 0.69 when using the test-retest method. The structure reliability of this test is reported suitable using two other questionnaires (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>12-item Short Form Health Survey</title><p>The 12-item quality of life questionnaire is the shortened version of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This questionnaire consists of eight sub-scales. Since there are a few questions, only the overall score of the person was used in this study. A research conducted on 5586 people in Tehran determined the validity (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha= 0.72) and the reliability (with factor analysis) of this questionnaire, suggesting the questionnaire is suitable for the Iranian people both in terms of reliability and validity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The participants in this study were randomly placed into two groups of intervention and control. The treatment of the control group was delayed by six weeks, but the intervention group participated in a six-week group positive psychotherapy. This intervention was formulated and studied at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009 by Parks-Sheiner (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Interventions were performed in a hospital room. Each session lasting an hour and half was held in a group therapy format. In each meeting, there were tasks that were completed by the participants for the following meeting. The meetings included the following six positive exercises: i. Using your strengths, ii. Gratitude visit, iii. A active-constructive response, iv. Counting blessings, v. Savoring, and vi. Biography (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The treatment sessions were carried out by a master degree student in clinical psychology program who had received training on positive psychotherapy at the Psychology and Counseling Organization of I.R. Iran. Moreover the intervention sessions were supervised by a tenuretrack professor of clinical psychology at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences. </p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The definition of positive therapy and its sessions </p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Session one</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Opening and positive introductions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preview next session and describe homework: value in action (VIA)/using your strengths</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homework: take VIA strengths assessment to find out how to use one of your strengths every day</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Session two</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discuss homework: using your strengths</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preview next session and describe homework: gratitude</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homework: write and deliver a gratitude letter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Session three</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discuss homework: gratitude letter</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preview next session and describe homework: active-constructive responses</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homework: make an active-constructive responses in social interactions</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Session four</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discuss homework: active-constructive responses</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preview next session and describe homework: blessings</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homework: each night before bed, write down three good things that happened.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Session five</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Discuss homework: blessings</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preview next session and describe homework: savoring/biography</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Homework: pick one thing you usually rush through and take the time to savor it.

physical and emotional factors. A number of
different approaches for infertility treatment have
led to many psychological treatment methods.
The first finding of this study showed that there
was a significant increase in life satisfaction in
the intervention group as compared to the control
group. This finding is in line with the results of
the meta-analysis of Sin and Lyubomirsky (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).
In another study (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), 55 students were placed
into two groups, an intervention group of 28 and
a waiting list of 27. The intervention group underwent
a 10 week-long Wellness Promotion Intervention.
The life satisfaction of these students
showed significant improvement in the post-test,
whereas the well-being of the students in the
waiting list showed a decline, even though this
decline was not significant (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Life satisfaction
could be considered as a cognitive and judgmental
process which is based on comparing the individual&#x02019;s
condition with what is considered as
a proper standard (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Lower life satisfaction in
infertile women is verified in the previous study
(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) that is more likely to be due to the fact that
the infertile women find their conditions hopeless.
Positive psychological interventions are
certain treatment methods cultivating positive
emotions, positive behaviors and positive cognitions
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Considering the fact that these treatment
methods emphasize on positive emotions
and strengths, they both treat depression and enhance
life satisfaction. For example, counting the
blessings teaches the infertile women that even
though they are deprived of having a blessing as important as having a child, they have thousands
of other blessings in their lives which they should
be thankful for.</p><p>Another finding of this study was that the quality
of life showed no significant improvement both in
the intervention and the control group. Since this
study was the first of its kind, it had some limitations.
The first limitation was the short duration
of the treatment period. Although six weeks of the
treatment saved time and expenses, it may not be
enough time for some participants to see a positive
result. It is recommended that the results of
this short-term treatment to be compared with
those of long-term treatments, so the best intervention
method may be determined for the infertile
women. The second limitation was related to
the measurement tools. Due to limited number of
questions regarding the quality of life factor, this
was hard for the researcher to identify and separate
the areas where the treatment was effective or ineffective.
Moreover, life satisfaction in this study
was measured using a five-question questionnaire,
which may not be suitable to study the effectiveness
of the treatment. It is recommended that in
the future researches, a different questionnaire to
be used. The third limitation in the study was that
the sample participants were limited to the infertile
women who were selected only from the residents
of one city in Iran. Therefore, the results of this
study may not apply to infertile women with different
ethnicities. Finally this treatment method
relies mostly on practice. However, those patients
who were used to the structured sessions may not
benefit from it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that group positive psychotherapy
could be beneficial in elevating life satisfaction
in infertile women. Considering the low cost of
positive psychotherapy due to a less number of the
sessions and easy method, this treatment could be
used comprehensively in all the infertility treatment
centers. The results of the study revealed that, for
elevation of the quality of life in infertile women,
other interventions must be used. However, more
research must be carried out and the limitations of
this study must be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was performed in partial fulfillment
