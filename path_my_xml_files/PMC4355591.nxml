Here, we conducted a field trial in Kenya to evaluate the safety and ability to induce protection for a new RVF vaccine, referred to as Clone 13, that was recently registered in South Africa. A total of 404 animals, consisting of cattle, sheep, and goats, were divided two groups and one group was vaccinated with Clone 13 vaccine while the other group was not vaccinated. The animals were followed for one year and analyzed for RVF antibody levels at days 14, 28, 56, 183, and 365 after vaccination. Between 91% and 97% of vaccinated sheep and goats develop antibodies to the vaccine, whereas only 67% of the vaccinated cattle developed antibodies. These finding indicate that the Clone 13 vaccine induces high levels of protective antibodies in sheep and goats and moderate levels in cattle. The vaccine was safe since none of vaccinated animals developed evidence of RVF disease including deformities in newborns, and only 1 out of 120 pregnant animals had an abortion that was not associated with the RVF disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided by the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVMed) and United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In Africa, periodic and severe epidemics have been reported in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Sudan, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Mauritania, Egypt, and Madagascar [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even though determining the actual morbidity and mortality in humans has been difficult, an RVF epidemic in Egypt in 1977 resulted in an estimated 200,000 human cases and 600 deaths whereas the one in East Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania) in 1997&#x02013;98 resulted in over 100,000 cases and over 450 deaths in Kenya alone [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The RVF epidemic in Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2002 resulted in an estimated 4000 human cases and over 200 deaths [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Over 80% of the RVF-infected humans are either asymptomatic or have a mild to moderate influenza-like disease. However most fatal cases develop severe disease characterized by central nervous system complications, retinitis, severe jaundice, haemorrhagic syndrome and death [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The RVF epidemics also result in massive livestock abortions, death of primarily young animals, and devastating economic losses associated with animal quarantines and trade restrictions [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, the economic losses resulting from the 2006&#x02013;07 RVF epidemic in Kenya alone were estimated at US$32 million [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The losses were associated with effects on the livestock value chains such as livestock producers, traders, slaughterhouses, and butchers; and effects on the national income such as decline in the livestock market and other sectors such as transportation, chemicals, petroleum and tourism [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The RVF epidemics occur during years of El Ni&#x000f1;o weather characterized by heavier than usual rainfall, resulting in hatching of a high population of floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquitoes that transmit the virus to susceptible livestock and human populations [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Apart from mosquito transmission, humans can be infected by consuming animal products from infected animals, a transmission pathway that is associated with most of the severe human cases [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For the endemic countries, there is a prediction model that has been improving steadily, which can provide an early warning of a few months prior to an epidemic [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since the RVF outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula in 2000, there has been increasing concern that RVF virus can be spread to other non-endemic regions through movement of infected travellers, mosquitoes, or animals, which would raise major biosafety and biosecurity concerns globally [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Experts agree that the most effective intervention against epidemics and for enhancing preparedness in the face of possible global spread of RVF virus is mass vaccination of livestock in high risk areas, and perhaps humans that may be at immediate risk [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>If carried out effectively before an epidemic, livestock vaccination can either prevent the epidemic or significantly reduce its extent and severity in livestock and subsequent human infections [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, vaccination of susceptible livestock is widely used, but with varying degrees of success. Two vaccines are commercially available for vaccination of animals against RVF; both of them produced from a pantropic Entebbe strain of RVF virus referred to as Smithburn strain, that was isolated from mosquitoes in Uganda in 1944 and attenuated through extensive passaging in mice [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A formalin inactivated Smithburn vaccine is safe for use during epizootics and in pregnant animals; but it is poorly immunogenic and confers only short term immunity, thus requiring booster doses and regular revaccination to achieve and maintain immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The inactivated Smithburn vaccine also confers poor colostral immunity and it requires long production lead time due to the tedious process of inactivation that requires rigorous biosafety and biosecurity measures. The live Smithburn vaccine is more immunogenic and requires only a single dose; however it causes abortion and foetal teratogenicity when administered to pregnant animals [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, there have been reports that the live vaccine can revert to virulence and be transmitted from vaccinated to susceptible animal and humans resulting in RVF disease [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because of these shortcomings of the Smithburn vaccines, there has been need to develop safer and more efficacious RVF vaccines. Presently, there is no commercially available human vaccine against RVF disease.</p><p>There are a number of candidate livestock vaccines that have undergone experimental and field trials. The MP-12 is an RVF virus strain was generated from the wild type parental strain ZH548 (isolated from an infected patient in Egypt) following serial passages with a chemical mutagen. MP-12 is a temperature-sensitive mutant that carries mutations in the M- and L-segments that contribute to the attenuation of virulence [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There are two candidate MP-12 vaccines, one with a deletion at the NSs region of the virus genome, and the other with a deletion at the NSm region of the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In experimental infections in livestock and non-human primates, the MP-12 NSm mutant has shown good immunogenicity and protection from challenge [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Recently, a recombinant RVF virus derived from RVF strain ZH501, an isolate from a human patient in Egypt, but lacking the NSm gene in the M-segment and carrying a green fluorescent protein in place of the NSs gene in the S-segment (&#x00394;NSs-&#x00394;NSmRVFV) was generated by reverse genetics [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The availability of such a vaccine virus lacking virulence-associated genes and insertion of the non-viral GFP gives it the capability for distinguishing vaccinated animals from natural infections, which is an important feature. Experimental studies using &#x00394;NSs-&#x00394;NSmRVFV in sheep showed no virulence even in high doses, accompanied by strong immunogenicity and no teratogeny [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The RVF Clone 13 virus is a plaque isolate of the 74HB59 strain of RVF virus recovered from an RVF-infected patient in Central Africa that lacks approximately 70% of a NSs open reading frame, and is therefore significantly attenuated [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A live RVF Clone 13 vaccine was registered for use in cattle, sheep and goats in South Africa in 2009 and in Namibia in 2011, and over 50 million doses have been sold since [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Studies on safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine carried out in South Africa indicates that the vaccine is highly immunogenic, and it does not cause abortion or foetal teratogenicity in ewes vaccinated during pregnancy [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The vaccine was also found to induce production of neutralizing antibodies that were protective against virus challenge in ewes and calves [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In experimental challenge studies, RVF Clone 13 vaccine protected cattle and sheep to titers similar to those observed for the Smithburn strain [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with a good dose-response effect. More importantly, no abortion or teratogeny were reported in animals vaccinated with RVF Clone 13, in contrast to animals vaccinated with the Smithburn strain vaccine [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Here, we carried out field trials for RVF Clone 13 RVF vaccine in commercial livestock farms in Kenya in order to provide more data that would enable this vaccine to gain broader registration in Africa as an important tool in the prevention and control of RVF. Cattle, sheep and goats in three livestock farms, including those in early and late pregnancy, were vaccinated with RVF Clone 13 to determine the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine at the recommended dose in adult and young animals and in pregnant females at different stages of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Vaccine</title><p>Clone 13 RVF (strain 74HB59) vaccine was provided by Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP, Onderstepoort, South Africa) as freeze dried pellet (Batch # 13).

Approval was also obtained from the United States&#x02019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Veterinary Services, Government of Kenya. The study was conducted at three livestock farms in Kenya; the Kiboko Farm, Kabete Veterinary Farm, and Ngong Veterinary Farm. The Kiboko farm, owned by the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute is located in Makindu division of Makueni County. The farm size is 15,400 hectares mainly covered by pastures, research crops, fodder and pastures, shrubs and woodland. Wild animals found in the farm include elephants, antelopes, and leopards. The domestic animals kept in the farm are cattle (Sahiwal, Borana and Zebu breeds) and gala goats. The farming system is outdoor grazing for the cattle and goats, which are kept separate. Routine vaccination is carried out against Foot-and-mouth disease for cattle and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia for goats. Weekly anti-tick dipping is carried out for cattle. The Kabete farm, owned by the government of Kenya, is located in Westlands District of Nairobi County. The farm size is about five acres and the animal species kept are cattle (Friesian, Ayrshire and Friesian-Ayrshire crosses), sheep (Dopper crosses) and horses. The farm practices outdoor grazing with hay supplementation. The Ngong farm, owned by the government of Kenya is located in Kajiado North District of Kajiado County. The farm is 1,138 acres and has cattle (Friesian, Ayrshire, Charolaise and their crosses) and sheep (Doper, Red Maasai and their crosses). The farm practices extensive outdoor grazing and routine vaccination is carried out against Foot-and-mouth disease for cattle and Enterotoxaemia and Pestes de Petit Ruminant for sheep. The farms were found suitable due to their good record keeping of breeding, health and feeding records for individual animals. The study was conducted in cattle, sheep and goats aged at least 6 months at the start of the study. Cattle and goats were enrolled in Kiboko farm whereas cattle and sheep were enrolled in both Ngong and Kabete farms.

One goat at Kiboko farm was killed by predators and two animals in Ngong farm (a sheep and a cow) died as a result of bloating. There were no RVF-associated mortalities among the study animals. One case of abortion was reported in a vaccinated goat at late pregnancy. However, histopathologic examination and laboratory testing by polymerase chain reaction did not reveal evidence of RVF virus infection. There were no congenital malformations in either the placebo or vaccinated animals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the need for a better RVF livestock vaccine has been recognized for many years, the efforts to generate and manufacture one have been slow and difficult. This is perhaps because of the limited market, which is primarily in Africa, and the fact that RVF cases and epidemics can sometimes be absent for over 10 years even in endemic countries. As a prevention and control measure, livestock vaccination should be used in the context of a national strategy guided by a risk-based analysis [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whether the strategy includes structured regular vaccinations to prevent the disease or immediate action to prevent an imminent outbreak, livestock vaccination needs to be systematic and thorough, targeting all high risk regions in a country and accompanied by other important measures such as monitoring and evaluation to determine coverage and sentinel surveillance (Munyua et al., IN PRESS). The explosive and sequential nature of RVF outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa has often meant that when an early warning for the disease is issued, even in the presence of adequate resources, there are inadequate vaccine reserves globally to cover livestock at risk in one country, leave alone in multiple countries. To mitigate this risk, the idea of creating a shared vaccine bank consisting of epidemic&#x02014;prone countries has been discussed but never implemented.</p><p>The RVF Clone 13 vaccine had undergone testing under experimental conditions but no studies under field conditions had been conducted (31, 32). Therefore, we undertook this field trial in various commercial livestock farms in Kenya in order to obtain data on safety and immunogenicity under various livestock management conditions that can enable the vaccine to be registered broadly in Africa. Our data shows that RVF Clone 13 vaccine is safe to use in pregnant livestock, with the one abortion in a goat in this study not linked to the vaccine based upon histopathological analysis. The RVF Clone 13 safety finding is in agreement with other studies using this natural mutant that lacks 70% of the NSs gene of the virus, and that has been shown to be avirulent to mice, sheep, goats and cattle in various studies [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. More importantly, the virus has undergone many serial passages in a number of laboratories for over 20 years with no evidence of reversion to virulence <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, making it an ideal and safe RVF vaccine that will be acceptable for mass livestock vaccine to farmers during periods of imminent outbreaks. Our data also showed high (&#x0003e;90%) immunogenicity of the vaccine in sheep and goats and moderate (&#x0003e; 65%) immunogenicity in cattle. Even though there was no natural RVF outbreak during the period of the field trials, the Clone 13 vaccinated animals developed high neutralizing antibodies. These results are in agreement with experimental challenge studies with the vaccine in calves and sheep where neutralizing antibodies and prevention from challenge with virulent virus were reported in all vaccinated animal [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The moderate immunogenicity to Clone 13 vaccine observed in cattle in this study is consistent with a previous study that showed cattle tend to mount a weaker immune response to RVF virus vaccine when compared to sheep and goats [<xref rid="pntd.0003550.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>It been suggested that the NSs deletion in RVF Clone 13 vaccine virus gives it capacity for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals. However, we do not have a validated molecular or serological test that can be applied for this purpose. The next steps for RVF Clone 13 are to apply for licensing of the vaccine in Kenya and other African countries. In Kenya, the Department of Veterinary Services is using the data from this study to file for the licensing of the vaccine through Kenya Pharmacy and Poisons Board.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the use of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> pfu dose in cattle, which was informed by controlled experimental studies, was misguided. Therefore, we recommend that for the purpose of registration, the RVF Clone 13 vaccine be administered at 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> in goats and sheep and a higher does (to be determined) in cattle. Another field study to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of this higher dosage of vaccine is planned. Second, there was no evidence of natural RVF infection in any of the three farms that would have enabled us to assess the ability of RVF Clone 13 vaccine to protect from infection. Third, a few placebo animals were seropositive for anti-RVF IgG antibodies suggesting either mild natural infection during the trial or possible RVF Clone 13 transmission within the herds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the Kenya Department of Veterinary Services for leading this study and for allowing us to use Ngong and Kabete farms, and the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute for allowing us Kiboko farm.
