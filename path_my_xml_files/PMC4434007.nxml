defined as the failure of attending to, exploring, and acting upon the contralesional side
of space<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Visuospatial neglect is
considered a barrier to improvement in functional ability and motor recovery after
stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although various strategies
have been used to reduce the symptoms of visuospatial neglect, they are impractical as a
basis for rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Task-oriented training was suggested to be an effective method for improving the
performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and reducing the symptoms of visuospatial
neglect<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The task-oriented approach
involves using the paretic side, with repetitive practice of daily tasks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The task-oriented approach is reported to
have reduced the symptoms of visuospatial neglect by improving motor-sensory processes and
awareness of the paretic side<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Body awareness training (BAT) is a method for improving dynamic balance and postural
stability. BAT is composed of simple repetitive movements within stability limits<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A main component of BAT is making the
person conscious of their movements<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
other words, BAT involves an awareness of one&#x02019;s body and reflection upon how the body feels
during movement. Movements are performed in various positions to find a center line of the
body. BAT targets include postural control, balance, free breathing, and coordination<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> have reported that BAT has positive effects in improving
function.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are no reported studies of BAT being used in stroke patients with mild
visuospatial neglect. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
BAT in acute stroke patients with mild visuospatial neglect using the Motor-free Visual
Perception test (MVPT), Line Bisection Test (LBT), and modified Barthel index (MBI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 12 poststroke individuals admitted to a rehabilitation center at a
university hospital in the Republic of Korea. They were randomized into two groups by a
person not involved in the study: the experimental group underwent BAT before task-oriented
training, with the BAT being performed for 15 minutes; the control group performed
task-oriented training only. The inclusion criteria for the LBT was based on patients who
deviated &#x02265; 15% to the right from the center<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exclusion criteria were (1) severe cognitive impairment making
them unable to understand the instructions given by a therapist; (2) contraindications to
the interventions, and (3) unstable medical or neurological conditions.</p><p>Participation in the study was voluntary, and the subjects fully understood the contents of
the study. Written informed consent, after following an explanation of the study purpose and
the experimental method and processes, was obtained from all patients. The study was
approved by the Daejeon University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>The MVPT<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> is a 36-item multiplechoice
test that evaluates visuospatial neglect.</p><p>The LBT was performed using the method conceived by Schenkenberg et al<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Twenty lines were drawn on A4 white paper parallel to the
long axis. Eighteen of these lines were organized into three sets of six.</p><p>The MBI<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> comprises 10 items: dependent
or independent for feeding, bathing, grooming or dressing; toilet use; mobility on level
surface (immobile, use of wheelchair, walk with help, or independent); and bowels and
bladder continent or incontinent.</p><p>Twelve people fulfilled the criteria and voluntarily agreed to participate in this study.
The participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group (n<sub>1</sub> = 6) or
control group (n<sub>2</sub> = 6). The interventions comprised three weeks of inpatient
treatment. Participants in the experimental group underwent the BAT using the method
suggested by Lindvall et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects
were barefoot to enable contact with the floor during training. The intention was that
participants would experience how the movement felt in their body, and how they could
integrate the movements. Movements were performed in a sitting and standing position. In the
sitting, a pillow wedge was used to ensure the ideal alignment, and the participants were
not allowed to lean on the backrest. The participants were asked to be aware of the changes
of tension in their bodies. The stability limits were experienced by shifting the body
weight forward, backward, and to the left, and right sides. In the standing, the center line
was perturbed by twisting around the center line and gently moving the arms.</p><p>Both groups underwent the task-oriented training for 30 minutes a day, five times a week
for three weeks. The training comprised three weeks of inpatient treatment. The four tasks
incorporated: (1) sitting alone at a table and correcting the body alignment, (2) reaching
in different directions for objects located beyond arm&#x02019;s length using the non-paretic side,
(3) reaching in different directions for objects located beyond arm&#x02019;s length using the
paretic side, (4) bilateral reaching tasks such as throwing a ball, lifting a box, and
putting on a ring.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the baseline data. Categorical variables
(gender, side of stroke) were compared between groups with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Comparisons
of baseline characteristics (age, weight, height, time after stroke, MVPT, LBT, and MBI
scores) between the groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of pre-
and post-test values within each group were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
and comparisons of post-test values between the groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney
U-test. The significance level was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All patients completed the interventions and assessments. There were no significant

following an acute stroke. The results of this study revealed that the BAT group showed a
more significant improvement than the control group in MVPT, LBT, and MBI results.
Task-oriented training effectively reduced the symptoms of visuospatial neglect in both
groups, and the additional effects of BAT suggest that it would be an efficacious method for
treating the symptoms of visuospatial neglect patients.</p><p>There have been no previous reports regarding the improvement of symptoms of visuospatial
neglect following BAT. To our knowledge, this pilot randomized controlled trial is the first
study to demonstrate a potentially beneficial effect of BAT on mild visuospatial neglect in
acute stroke patients.</p><p>Visuospatial neglect may be caused by a disturbance of the balance of both hemispheres
after unilateral cortical lesions. Koch et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the hyperexcitability of the left posterior parietal
cortex, resulting in left neglect, is frequently seen after development of a right
hemispheric lesion.</p><p>In neglect patients, more intensive training is often recommended in order to see changes
in performance and cognition<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
choice of five days a week for the interventions was based on practical reasons. In a study
by Gyllensten et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, participants
undergoing interventions improved their body awareness, attitudes toward their body, and
self-efficacy. Our results are similar to the above results. In our study, the experimental
group showed greater improvements in the MBI than the control group (p &#x0003c; 0.05).
Improvement of MBI has a positive impact in stroke patients. For independent living, stroke
patients have to be able to improve their functional performance of ADLs. We thought that
our results indicated an improved awareness of the body.</p><p>There are multiple factors in addition to visuospatial neglect that affect the ability to
carry out ADLs, including improvements in balance, motor function, and cognition. Therefore,
improvement in the MBI could be due to improvements in these factors. Future study is needed
to assess functional gains in activities according to improvements in these factors in mild
visuospatial neglect patients.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that BAT reduced the symptoms of visuospatial neglect
and suggest the applicability of BAT for clinical rehabilitation. Reducing neglect symptoms
in stroke patients increases the opportunities for improving function and independent
living.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Wonkwang Health Science University Research Fund (2015).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chokron</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dupierrix</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Tabert</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Experimental remission of unilateral spatial
