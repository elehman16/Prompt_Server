The CPP without organic disease is known as idiopathic CPP (ICPP). ICPP is more common in girls, accounts for more than 80&#x02013;90% of ICPP. With the improvement of living level, the incidence of ICPP has been increasing in recent years. Studies indicated that its incidence was between 1/5000 and 1/1000, and it was higher in girls than in boys.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The UK survey from 1860 to 2010 found that the sexual maturity was 6 years advanced in girls and was at least 2 years advanced in boys. American child specialists pointed out that signs and behaviors of current 10-year-old children were equivalent to past 15-year-old teenage youths. The 25% of black girls and 15% of Hispanic girls in America entered puberty at 7-year-old; the data published by the Japanese National Medical Center showed that within 8 years between 1995 and 2003, the age of sexual maturity in girls was 1 year advanced. The incidence of precocious puberty in children in Chinese coastal areas is 0.38%, of them the incidence of precocious puberty in girls is higher (0.67%).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The incidence of precocious puberty in Shanghai is 1%;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the incidence of precocious puberty in Jiujiang city is 0.68%, of them it is up to 1.25% in girls, and 0.11% in boys;[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] the incidence is up to 0.74% in Zhengzhou.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The objectives of CPP therapies are to inhibit premature or excessive sexual development and improve impaired adult height due to advance bone age (BA), to prevent psychosocial problems associated with prematurity and early menarche.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Currently, the preferred drug in the world for treatment of CPP is GnRH analog (GnRHa), which is a high-active derivative of GnRH.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog sustained-release agents are key products in the treatment of CPP, including leuprorelin acetate and triptorelin acetate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Most agents of leuprorelin in China are imported branded products. In 2009, a domestic agent of leuprorelin acetate was marketed, and was studied for the treatment of endometriosis in adults. Its safety and efficacy had no difference compared with an imported agent of leuprorelin acetate. Currently, there is no large multi-center clinical study data on the comparison of domestic and imported leuprorelin acetate. In order to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of domestic leuprolide in the treatment of CPP, and based on specific patient population&#x02013;children, we designed this study with caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>This trial included 236 girls with ICPP who were diagnosed in Beijing Children's Hospital, Tongji Hospital, Harbin Children's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Shanxi Children's Hospital, and Second Hospital of Jilin University between April 2012 and January 2014.

Girls in the control group were treated with leuprorelin acetate microspheres for injection (3.75 mg/vial, produced by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan; trade name: Enantone), the dose in both groups was 3.75 mg, subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 6 months.</p><p>Central randomization was used for grouping in the study. Dynamic randomization system provided by statistical professionals from the Clinical Research Center, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine was used for the centralized randomization procedure. After screening every eligible patient, investigators participated in the study in each site logged in the system, entered the screening information, obtained a random number (e.g., drug number), provided corresponding investigational drug based on the random number.</p><p>The investigational medicinal product in this study is a marketed product. The product could not be designed as a double-blind study because there is the logo of the company on the package. Consequently, this trial was conducted with the investigator-isolated blinded method, in which patients were enrolled sequentially and were provided with the product. Staff who provided and injected the product received the drug according to the random numbers and did not exchange the allocating information with the observing investigators.

Vaginal bleeding usually occurred at 2 weeks after the first dose of the drug, occurred after the second dose in a few cases. This phenomenon is continued after 6 months in rare cases. Its duration is usually 3&#x02013;5 days, even up to 11&#x02013;13 days in a few patients.</p><p>The clinical study, a multi-center, randomized, parallel, positive control, prospective clinical trials, objectively evaluated the clinical effectiveness of the drug, obtained the clinical data of domestic leuprolide in the treatment of ICPP, and provided reference for the treatment of girls with ICPP. Furthermore, domestic drugs of efficacy equivalence, low-cost are very important for the relatively poor families and are also of certain significance for supporting national enterprises.</p><p>The percentage of children with an peak LH &#x0003c; 3.3 U/L at 6 months of treatment in test and control groups were 96.80% and 96.20%, respectively, and the percentage of children with peak LH/FSH ratio &#x0003c; 0.6 were 93.60% and 93.70%, respectively, there were no differences between the two groups, which were consistent with a foreign multi-center clinical study that the percentage of children with an peak LH &#x0003c; 3.3 U/L at 6 months of treatment was 96.3%, and the percentage of children with peak LH/FSH ratio &#x0003c; 0.6 was 94.4%.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the mammary gland mass became softer and smaller, and the breast shrank after the treatment in test and control groups.

The clinical indicators used in the study are the national and international accepted classic indicators for evaluating the degree of gonadal inhibition. The clinical observation period of the imported GnRHa was employed as the observation period of the study, which was 6 months. Therefore, this clinical study has some limitations. First, the duration of observation was short, only 6 months, the further data should be collected. The children should be followedup as long as possible up to their adulthood; second, the sample size was not large enough, the related safety data have been gradually expanded sample size, further analysis should be conducted; finally, there was no updated observation indicator in this clinical study. In future, updated indicators could be added in studies to research their scientific significances.</p><p>In conclusion, in the treatment of girls with ICPP, the efficacy and safety of domestic leuprorelin were comparable with imported leuprorelin.
