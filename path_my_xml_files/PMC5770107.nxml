Clients with at least one of the following indications were tested at the clinic: age, younger than 25 years, men who have sex with men, born in an STI or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) endemic country, having received money and/or goods for sex, having paid for sex, 3 or more partners in the previous 6 months, reporting a sexual partner from an STI and HIV endemic country, notified by a sexual partner, or having STI-related symptoms (ie, symptoms the patient relates to having a possible STI). Clients younger than 25 years without any of the other abovementioned indications were routinely tested for chlamydia only, all other clients were routinely tested for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis, and HIV using an opt-out strategy.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For this study, all heterosexual patients of the Amsterdam STI clinic testing positive for urogenital chlamydia were included in the study between May 2012 and March 2013, and followed up through December 2013.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Randomization, Specimen Collection, and Testing Procedures</title><p>Patients with a positive urogenital CT nucleic acid amplification test were randomized for chlamydia retesting, either 8, 16, or 26 weeks after they received treatment, advised on partner notification, and counselled. The randomization procedure was automated within the electronic patient file, and the moment of clicking a button determined the randomization category, which switched invisibly every 2 seconds. After clicking, the randomization category appeared on the screen, and the patient was informed by the nurse when to expect an invitation for retesting. Patients were free to choose between 2 retest options: either collect a self-sample at home with a home collection kit (urine for men and vaginal swab for women), or return to the clinic for an on-site self-collected sample. Those who chose home collection received an email 7 days before the scheduled time of retest, informing them they would receive a self-collection kit within the next week, with a preaddressed return envelope. To those who chose to return to the clinic, an email with an open invitation was sent 7 days before the scheduled time of retest. Regardless of the chosen option, email and/or SMS reminders were sent 7 and 14 days after the scheduled retest time to all patients who failed to provide a retest sample at the planned date.</p><p>Urine samples and self-collected vaginal swabs were tested using the Tigris direct tube sampling system for the detection of CT rRNA (Hologic Inc., San Diego, Calif). When the retest result was available (approximately 7 days after providing the sample), patients received an online code to obtain their test result.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Patients were included in the study only once. To assess determinants of choice for sample collection location (home collection versus clinic based collection), we performed univariable logistic regression analysis and examined the effect of the following variables: sex, age, ethnicity and assigned retest interval. Age was divided into 4 categories based on the median and interquartile range (IQR); ethnicity was divided into 2 categories (Dutch and non-Dutch). Variables that were associated with sample collection location at <italic>P</italic> values of 0.1 or less in the univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable model. We checked for interactions between age and sex in the final model.</p><p>For each individual, we used the results of their first retest after inclusion regardless whether this retest was at their chosen testing location. For each randomization group, we assessed the number, percentage, and chlamydia positivity proportion of those who: (A) returned more than 1 week before the assigned date, (B) returned at assigned date (this was defined as a visit in the period &#x0003e;1 week before, until 6 weeks after the assigned date), (C) returned &#x0003e;6 weeks after the assigned date but no later than 35 weeks (8 months) after inclusion, and (D) those who did not return within 35 weeks of inclusion. The primary outcomes were (1) the number and percentage retested and (2) the proportion CT positive of all included in the study arm. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of retesting up to 35 weeks after inclusion, stratified by randomization arm. Those who retested more than 35 weeks after inclusion or did not retest were censored at 35 weeks. Among those who retested CT positive up to 35 weeks, the median time to a positive retest was calculated.</p><p>To assess determinants of uptake of retesting till 35 weeks after the assigned date, we performed univariable logistic regression analysis and examined the effect of the following variables: sex, age, ethnicity, and assigned retest interval. Because the choice of test location was influenced by assigned test interval, and may thus be on the causal pathway between assigned test interval and test uptake, we excluded chosen test location from the multivariable model. Variables that were associated with uptake of retesting at <italic>P</italic> values of 0.1 or less in the univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable model. We considered a <italic>P</italic> less than 0.05 as statistically significant.

We show that inviting STI clinic urogenital CT patients to retest for chlamydia is a feasible strategy to identify reinfections. The retest uptake was high, and among those who retested up to 35 weeks after the treatment visit, the positivity proportion was substantial, between 11% and 15%. Because the risk of reinfection is partly determined by the length of the period of exposure, we expected that the positivity proportion would increase with increasing time to retest. Yet, the positivity proportion did not differ significantly between the randomization groups. On the other hand, we anticipated that the invitation time for retesting would be negatively correlated with the uptake proportion. This was confirmed, the uptake proportion decreased with a later invitation time for retesting and was lowest among patients assigned to the 26-week group. The uptake proportion within 35 weeks after the initial visit was 77% in the 8-week group and 64% in the 26-week group. However, even in the 26-week groups, the uptake was considerable compared with 28% uptake of retesting in the same clinic in the year before this study (unpublished data). The median time to actual retest was significantly shorter in the 8-week group compared with the 16- and 26-week groups. We consider 8 weeks the optimal time for an invitation to retest for urogenital chlamydia because this group showed the highest uptake proportion, whereas the median time to retest was shortest and patients had a comparable positivity proportion compared to the 16- and 26-week groups. Moreover, 22% of patients scheduled in the 26-week group retested less than 1 week before their assigned retest moment, indicating that this may be too long.</p><p>National guidelines in several countries differ regarding the recommended timing of retesting varying from 3 to 12 months after the initial positive result<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and also differ regarding the appropriate target population. For example, the UK national guideline restricts retesting to young patients under the age of 25 years due to lack of sufficient evidence for retesting patients over 25 years.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We did subgroup analyses by sex and age and observed that the uptake proportion and positivity proportion were comparable between patients younger and older than 25 years. Therefore, we recommend that retesting should not be restricted to young patients only.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we did not collect data on sexual behavior, or partner change, nor did we verify partner treatment between the initial test and retest, so we cannot assess retesting rates in subgroups defined by perceived risk for reinfection. Moreover, we did not include a randomization group of 3 months (12 weeks), although this cutoff point is used in several guidelines<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and might be a suitable interval for retesting. Because the uptake decreased with prolonged retest intervals and was significantly lower in the 16-week retest group compared with the 8-week group, we advice to invite for a retest to be done no later than 3 months after treatment. On the other hand, the optimal time to detect new infections rather than to detect nonviable material from the initial infection has been debated. A retest of at least 8 weeks after initial diagnosis and treatment has therefore been recommended.<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In addition, prevention of reinfection by effective partner notification and education to minimize chlamydia infections remain paramount.</p><p>Lastly, since this study was performed in a STI clinic setting in the Netherlands serving a high-risk population, the results might not be generalizable to lower risk populations and other regions.</p><p>Compared with previously described efforts to retest chlamydia-positive STI clinic clients,<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> we found a high overall retest uptake (70%), especially when the time to invited retest was short (8 weeks). As opposed to these previous studies, in which patients were not offered a choice between self-sampling at home or sampling at the clinic, we offered patients a choice regarding the location of sample collection (home-based vs clinic-based) and in addition, email and/or SMS reminders were sent. This might explain the high uptake in our setting. Of note, the choice for sample collection location was made after patients were told their scheduled retest date. It is of interest that patients assigned to a shorter interval time to retest more often preferred home collection.</p><p>In conclusion, this clinical trial regarding the optimal timing of retesting, invitation for retesting 8 weeks after initial treatment appears the optimal time to retest heterosexual patients after initial diagnosis and treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection. Patients assigned to the 8-week group showed the highest uptake proportion, whereas the median time to retest was shortest, and patients had a comparable positivity proportion compared with the 16- and 26-week groups.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the research and development fund of the STI clinic of the Public Health Service Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (project no 2385).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Rowley</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vander</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
