Dosing of AZCQ was approximately 30&#x000a0;mg/kg AZ and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg CQ once daily for 3 days (for &#x02265;20&#x000a0;kg weight: AZ/CQ 300/100&#x000a0;mg per tablet; 5 to &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;kg weight: AZ/CQ 150/50&#x000a0;mg per tablet). Study 2 included adults randomized to receive either two AZCQ tablets (AZ/CQ 250/155&#x000a0;mg per tablet) or individual commercial tablets of AZ 500&#x000a0;mg and CQ 300&#x000a0;mg. Serum AZ and plasma CQ concentrations from both studies were pooled. Population PK models were constructed using standard approaches to evaluate the concentration-time data for AZ and CQ and to identify any covariates predictive of PK behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A three-compartment PK model with linear clearance and absorption adequately described AZ data, while a two-compartment model with linear clearance and absorption and an absorption lag adequately described CQ data. No overall bias or substantial model misspecification was evident using diagnostic plots and visual predictive checks. Body weight as an allometric function was the only covariate in the final AZ and CQ PK models. There were significantly lower AZ (0.488 vs 0.745 [mg&#x02022;h/L]/[mg/kg], p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) and CQ (0.836 vs 1.27 [mg&#x02022;h/L]/[mg/kg], p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.00001) exposures (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) normalized by dose (mg/kg) in children compared with the adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PK of AZ and CQ following administration of AZCQ was well described using a three- and two-compartment model, respectively. AZ and CQ exhibited linear absorption and clearance; the model for CQ included an absorption lag. Weight was predictive of exposure for both AZ and CQ. Assuming equivalent dosing (mg/kg), AZ and CQ exposure in children would be expected to be lower than that in adults, suggesting that children may require a higher dose (mg/kg) than adults to achieve the same AZ and CQ exposure.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Population pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>Azithromycin</kwd><kwd>Chloroquine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Worldwide, malaria remains a burden to global health. The World Health Organization reports that approximately 3.3 billion people were at risk of malaria in 2010, with the population of sub-Saharan Africa at the highest risk
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The combination of AZ and CQ exhibits synergistic activity against CQ-resistant strains of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Results from Phase 2 and 3 studies demonstrated that the combination of AZ and CQ had ~95% or more efficacy against symptomatic uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in various geographic areas
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To be useful in combination, anti-malarial agents must not have clinically significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. A lack of a PK interaction between AZ and CQ has been demonstrated
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In healthy adults, CQ did not have any clinically relevant effect on the PK of AZ; AZ also did not have any clinically relevant effect on either the PK of CQ or its active metabolite, desethylchloroquine (DECQ).</p><p>For adults, an investigational AZCQ tablet formulation has been developed containing AZ 250&#x000a0;mg and CQ 155&#x000a0;mg and has been evaluated in a bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers with intensive PK sampling
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this study, the AZCQ tablet was shown to be bioequivalent to the AZ 500&#x000a0;mg (Zithromax&#x000ae;, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA) and CQ 300&#x000a0;mg (Aralen&#x000ae;, Sanofi Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) tablets taken individually in healthy adults using area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) as the criterion of exposure. Two additional paediatric AZCQ tablet formulations (AZ 300&#x000a0;mg/CQ 150&#x000a0;mg per tablet and AZ 150&#x000a0;mg/CQ 50&#x000a0;mg per tablet) were developed and evaluated in paediatric patients with malaria in Africa using sparse PK sampling.</p><p>The population PK analysis approach can be helpful in characterizing drug concentration-time profiles and between-subject variability in the PK. In addition, these analyses are useful to identify factors that are predictive of PK variability. Therefore, this population PK analysis was performed by combining the data from the bioavailability and paediatric treatment studies to evaluate the population PK of AZ and CQ in healthy adults from US and paediatric malaria subjects from sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>PK data from two studies were pooled and analysed. The first study was an open-label efficacy study that compared the efficacy of AZCQ versus artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in children in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, patients were enrolled in two cohorts by age (Cohort 1 [5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years] and Cohort 2 [6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months]) and randomized to either AZCQ or AL treatment. This analysis only includes data from AZCQ-treated patients. In AZCQ-treated patients, dosing of AZCQ was based on weight, with patients receiving approximately 30&#x000a0;mg/kg of AZ and 10&#x000a0;mg/kg of CQ. AZCQ tablets were given once daily for three days based on weight (&#x02265;20&#x000a0;kg weight: AZ/CQ 300/100&#x000a0;mg strength tablet; 5 to &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;kg weight: AZ/CQ 150/50&#x000a0;mg strength tablet).</p><p>The second study was an open-label, randomized, single dose study to estimate the bioavailability of AZCQ tablets in healthy adult volunteers in the US. Subjects in this study were randomized to receive either two AZCQ tablets (AZ/CQ 250/155&#x000a0;mg strength tablet; test treatment) or co-administration of individual commercial tablets of AZ 500&#x000a0;mg and CQ 300&#x000a0;mg (reference treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling and analysis</title><p>In the paediatric study, sparse blood samples were collected from both cohorts to determine AZ concentration in serum and CQ/desethylchloroquine (DECQ) concentration in plasma prior to AZCQ dosing (window: &#x02013;1 to 0 h) on day 0 and day 2. On day 2, blood samples were also collected 3 h (window: 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h) and 8 h (window: 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;h) after AZCQ dosing. In addition, blood samples were collected at a random time point on day 7. Blood samples in the bioavailability study were collected to assess serum AZ and plasma CQ concentrations at 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h post dose.</p><p>PK samples from both studies were analysed in the same bioanalytical laboratories (Centero Research in Houston, TX, USA for CQ and DECQ; Bioanalytical System Ltd in Warwickshire, UK for AZ). Plasma or serum samples were analysed for serum AZ, plasma CQ and plasma DECQ concentrations using validated, sensitive, specific high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assays
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The assays had a lower limit of quantification of 10.0, 1.0 and 0.50&#x000a0;ng/mL for AZ, CQ and DECQ, respectively. In the data analysis, observations that were below the limit of quantification were excluded from the database. The assay accuracy (expressed as % relative error: %RE) of the quality control samples used during the sample analysis ranged from 0% to 6.1% in the paediatric study and from -2.1% to 4.7% in the adult study for AZ, from -3.2 to 9.8% in the paediatric study and from -0.4% to 3% in the adult study for CQ, and from 0.0% to 14.5% in the paediatric study for DECQ. The assay precision data were&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;4.9%CV in the paediatric study and &#x02264;4.7% in the adult study for AZ, &#x02264;11.2% CV in the paediatric study and &#x02264;8.9% in the adult study for CQ, and &#x02264;10.8% in the paediatric study for DECQ.</p></sec><sec><title>Population PK analysis</title><p>Concentration-time data collected in both studies were analysed using the mixed-effects modelling tool, NONMEM&#x000ae; (version 7, level 2; ICON Plc, Dublin, Ireland). All clearance and distribution parameters are reported as the ratio of the parameter and bioavailability since oral dosing was not accompanied by an intravenous dose. All evaluations used a log-transform both sides approach.</p><p>Population PK models were constructed to evaluate the concentration-time data for AZ and CQ and to identify any covariates predictive of PK behaviour using standard approaches. The structural model consisted of a compartmental PK model to describe the observed concentration-time profiles as well as between subject variability in the PK behaviour. For both AZ and CQ, two- and three-compartment models were evaluated. In addition, a one-compartment model was also evaluated for completeness, but did not describe the data well and was therefore not used for either drug.</p><p>The covariate models in this PK model were defined to represent the shift in value of the parameter of interest to a value for a hypothetical patient. The reference patient for this analysis was 40 years of age, weighed 70&#x000a0;kg and had a body surface area of 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> and a body mass index of 15&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Covariates examined as potential predictors of PK activity are listed in Table&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Only those covariates that individually influenced the structural parameters were added to create the full model. The full model then underwent reduction where covariates were removed one at a time and the impact of removal was assessed (backward deletion method).

The final model for CQ in plasma was a two-compartment model with linear clearance and an absorption lag time. Both models included actual body weight with fixed allometric scaling. In the AZ model, shrinkage was acceptable (defined as &#x02264;20%) for clearance (CL/F), but was high (51.8%) for central compartment volume of distribution (V1/F) that is considered likely due to the sparse sampling in the paediatric study. In the CQ model, shrinkage was acceptable for CL/F and V1/F, but was elevated for the absorption rate constant (62%) that could be due to the sparse sampling in the paediatric study. The condition number for the base model was less than 20 (AZ: 13.4; CQ: 5.3) for both AZ and CQ suggesting no notable co-linearity.

These models were in general agreement with models previously published
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the models of the current study, both AZ and CQ exhibited linear absorption and clearance in children and adults, but CQ showed an absorption lag. Due to the sparse PK sampling in the paediatric study, it would be difficult to identify such an absorption delay in the appearance of drug in the paediatric patients, and the ability to identify if an absorption phase exists because of the intensive sampling in the adult study. Consequently, it is not possible to determine if the lag time is the same in the paediatric patients as in the adults. Previously published values for AZ PK parameters were generally consistent with those estimated in the present analysis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For CQ, other studies have found that a two-compartment model best fit data in women
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, neither of these models included an absorption lag or transit.</p><p>A positive correlation between age and CQ clearance was reported by Obua <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but was not confirmed in this analysis, although weight and age are highly positively correlated in paediatric subjects. However, weight was predictive of exposure for both AZ and CQ in this analysis.</p><p>Drug clearance in children was higher than that in adults when evaluated on a weight-normalized basis. Allometric models have been developed to address the higher clearance (L/h/kg) observed in children
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Assuming equivalent dosing (mg/kg), AZ and CQ exposure in children would be expected to be lower than that in adults, suggesting that children may require a higher dose (mg/kg) than adults to achieve the same AZ and CQ exposure.</p><p>In conclusion, pharmacokinetics for AZ and CQ was well described using a three-compartment model and two-compartment model, respectively, in both healthy adult subjects and paediatric patients with symptomatic uncomplicated falciparum malaria following the full three-day course of AZCQ treatment. Both AZ and CQ exhibited linear absorption and linear clearance. In addition, there was an absorption lag in CQ. The effect of body size on PK was described using an allometric function based on normalized weight on primary AZ and CQ PK parameters. Drug clearance (L/h/kg) in children was higher than that in adults when evaluated on a weight-normalized basis. This suggests that exposure (AUC) of AZ and CQ in the paediatric patients would be expected to be lower than that experienced by the adults with equal dosing on a mg/kg basis and higher mg/kg dosing may be required in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>%CV: Percent coefficient of variation; %RSE: Relative standard error expressed as percentage; AL: Artemether-lumefantrine; AUC: Area under the concentration-time curve; AUCinf: Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time infinity; AZ: Azithromycin; AZCQ: Fixed-dose combination tablet treatment of azithromycin and chloroquine; CL/F: Clearance; Cmax: Maximum concentration; CQ: Chloroquine; DECQ: Desethylchloroquine; IIV: Inter-individual variability; Ka: Absorption rate constant; LAG: Lag time; NE: Not estimated; PK: Pharmacokinetic; Q2/F: Inter-compartmental clearance from central to first peripheral compartment; Q3/F: Inter-compartmental clearance from central to second peripheral compartment; Tmax: Time to maximum concentration; V1/F: Volume of distribution; V2/F: Volume of distribution of first peripheral compartment; V3/F: Volume of distribution of second peripheral compartment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>QZ and TT are full-time employees of and own stock in Pfizer Inc.
