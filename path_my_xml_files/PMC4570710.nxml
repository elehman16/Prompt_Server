Both infants and parents suffer, and there is a risk of delayed early attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Eliminating cow&#x02019;s milk protein resolves the colic in 20&#x000a0;% of afflicted infants. Currently, no other conventional treatment exists that is both safe and effective, and the use of complementary medicine is increasing. Acupuncture for infantile colic is used in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] despite weak evidence. The Swedish Council for Health Technology Assessment (SBU) suggests that patients may benefit from acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], although it is rarely provided within the Swedish public health system. To this date no serious side effects have been reported.</p><p>It is plausible that acupuncture can have effect in the treatment of colic, as acupuncture releases different neurotransmitters and hormones, has both calming and analgesic effects, and affects digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The only three published randomized controlled trials were conducted in private clinics and evaluated standardized minimal acupuncture in one single point. Two of the trials used the acupuncture points Large Intestine 4 (LI4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and report a small but significant reduction in crying in the acupuncture groups compared to the control groups. In one of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the needle was stimulated for 20&#x000a0;s; in the other, for only two seconds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A third RCT evaluating the effect of the acupuncture for 30&#x000a0;s in the acupuncture point Stomach 36 (ST36) found no significant difference between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a complex and diverse form of therapy, encompassing several styles of acupuncture, among other medical practices. In clinical practice, most TCM acupuncturists differentiate between syndromes and select acupuncture points and needle techniques according to a diagnosis. Diagnoses can, for example, be based on the patient&#x02019;s pulse, constitution, and signs of &#x0201c;heat&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is a discussion whether the effect of acupuncture depends on the points used or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. TCM acupuncturists claim that point specificity and the choice of points according to patients&#x02019; symptoms and signs are vital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For this reason, TCM practitioners select points at each treatment session to match each patient&#x02019;s most current symptoms. This means that in clinical practice, the same point is rarely chosen for all patients with a specific condition, such as colic, and treatment is rarely given in one single point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. That is to say, the trials conducted so far might not reflect clinical practice. Further research is warranted, and trials evaluating clinical practice should be conducted.</p><p>In earlier trials conducted at private acupuncture clinics, minimal acupuncture in LI4 reduced the crying in infants with colic. If acupuncture to infants is to be implemented in the public health care it should be given at CHC. The aims of the study are 1) to test if results in earlier trials conducted in private acupuncture clinics can be repeated at Child Health Centers (CHC) and 2) to compare the effect of two types of acupuncture and no acupuncture in infants with colic at CHC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A multicenter randomized controlled trial, called ACU-COL, started in January 2013 and will collect data until May 2015. ACU-COL is performed with three parallel arms at Child Health Centers (CHC) in four regions of Sweden, and measures the effect of acupuncture in reducing symptoms in infants with colic. Two of the four study centers are located outside the second and third biggest cities in Sweden and the remaining two in smaller cities. Two types of acupuncture (standardized minimal acupuncture in LI4 and individualized acupuncture) are compared to an untreated group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Otherwise healthy infants not more than 8&#x000a0;weeks at registration and not more than 9&#x000a0;weeks when the intervention begins.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: infants who, according to parents&#x02019; record in the diary, cry and/or fuss more than three hours per day, more than 3&#x000a0;days per week were included and randomized. Infants should have tried a diet excluding cow&#x02019;s milk protein for at least 5&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: being born before week 37, not gaining weight properly, having tried acupuncture, or taking any kind of medication (apart from dimeticone or lactobacillus reuteri).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participant enrollment</title><p>Information about ACU-COL was given to CHC nurses within about 80-km radius of each study center. Parents received information about the trial from nurses and physicians at their ordinary CHC or web-based information via a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.spadbarnskolik.se">www.sp&#x000e4;dbarnskolik.se</ext-link>).</p><p>Parents who wanted to participate in the trial contacted the project leader (KL) for further information. The project leader checked that the infant was suitable for the trial (Form A) and instructed parents to register the infant&#x02019;s fussing, crying, colicky crying, sleeping, feeding, and stooling daily in a validated diary (Form B) during a baseline week used for selection. Infants who according to the diary had cried/fussed more than three hours/day more than 3&#x000a0;days and thereby had fulfilled the criteria for colic were included and randomized provided that the parents signed informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomization</title><p>Infants were randomly allocated into one of three groups in proportions of 1:1:1, following randomization lists performed by an independent center for clinical research and development (R&#x00026;D, Region Skane). The infants were randomized in two strata: infants aged 2&#x02013;5 weeks and infants aged 6&#x02013;9 weeks and therefore two randomization lists were created for each of the four centers. Infants were assigned to the three different treatments by sampling without replacement from a block consisting of, to the investigator, unknown number of labels from each treatment group. Researcher and clinicians had no influence on the allocation of infants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Blinding</title><p>When an infant was included, the project leader informed a project coordinator, who was in charge of the randomization. The coordinator kept the randomization lists confidential and had no contact with or information about the families. The coordinator sent the study number via e-mail to the nurse at the study center and to the project leader, as well as the study number and group allocation to the acupuncturist. The acupuncturist&#x02019;s records, including the group allocation, were stored in a locked briefcase that only was available for the acupuncturists. Essentially, only the coordinator and the acupuncturist knew each infant&#x02019;s group allocation. None of them met the parents or discussed the infants with study nurses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Usual care</title><p>Parallel to the intervention, all infants followed the standard program at their regular Child Health Center (CHC), which includes a weekly visit to a nurse during the first month of life, every second week the second month, and one visit the third month. At these regular visits, the infants are weighed and measured, and the parents get childcare advice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>Parallel to usual care, study participants visited a study CHC where the intervention was conducted twice a week for 2&#x000a0;weeks. Parents met a nurse for 20&#x02013;30 min. Parents described their situation, discussed the infant&#x02019;s symptoms, and got evidence based support and advice. All parents received the information that having a baby with colic can be exhausting, and the nurse attempted to give them hope. The nurse informed parents about normal crying, that a healthy 6&#x000a0;week old infant cries an average of 1.5&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;h per day and that colic does not negatively affect the child&#x02019;s development. Breastfeeding mothers were encouraged to continue to do so.</p><p>At each of the four study visits, the study nurse brought the infant to a separate treatment room where another nurse, trained in acupuncture, was alone with the infant for approximately five minutes. The acupuncture nurse treated the baby according to allocation and recorded treatment provided, as well as whether the baby cried and, if so, for how long. Adverse events and how they were dealt with was also recorded (Form E). After five minutes, the acupuncturist called the study nurse, who then carried the baby back to the parents.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>Group A:</label><p>Infants received standardized minimal acupuncture in LI4.

It allowed acupuncturists to choose any combination of the acupuncture points Sifeng, LI4, and ST36, based on the symptoms reported in the diary. Maximum 5 needles were inserted approximately 3&#x000a0;mm. The point Sifeng was considered as four insertions, needled about one second each.

Other secondary outcomes are change in frequency of stooling per day and change in hours of sleep per day during the same time frames. Adverse events, eventual parallel treatment or medication, how much infants cried from being needled and how well parents are blinded will be reported.

Infants in our study are vulnerable and they can not sign the informed consent themselves. Infants with colic suffer and it is important to involve them in research to be able to find effective treatments. In this trial the infants were separated from the parents for five minutes for blinding reasons. Parents were informed about this and could choose not to participate. The separation was done as gently as possible, and when the parent and the infant were ready. For example the mother could breastfeed before leaving the baby to the nurse.
