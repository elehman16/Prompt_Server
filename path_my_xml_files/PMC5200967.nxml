To obtain a WHO recommendation, LNs must undergo prospective monitoring of insecticidal efficacy against mosquito vectors over 3&#x000a0;years of household use. The retention of bioefficacy and physical durability of a LN is influenced by net usage practices, textile polymer material and insecticide treatment technology. Fabric durability is the critical factor which determines the interval required between LN replacement campaigns. To investigate factors known to affect LN durability and bioefficacy, we describe a three-arm WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) Phase III evaluation of a LN made uniquely from polypropylene (LifeNet&#x000ae;, Bayer CropScience) compared to standard LNs made from polyester and polyethylene, all treated with deltamethrin, over 3&#x000a0;years of use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a prospective three-arm household randomized, equivalence trial of LNs in Tanzania, with nets as the unit of observation. Equal numbers of houses will be randomized to receive deltamethrin-treated polypropylene, polyester or polyethylene LNs; all sleeping spaces in a given household will be provided with one type of net. Bioefficacy (insecticidal activity against mosquitoes), insecticide content of net fibres, and fabric integrity (number, location and size of holes) will be measured every 6&#x000a0;months, using WHO cone or tunnel bioassays, chemical analysis and calculation of hole index, respectively. A cohort of LNs will be surveyed annually to assess survivorship (median LN survival time) and cumulative loss of fabric integrity. Field durability outcomes will be compared with laboratory strength tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first trial to compare the relative durability of three LNs each made from a different textile polymer, treated with the same insecticide, in the same community side-by-side over 3&#x000a0;years of use. Trial findings will 1) guide global health organizations on procurement policy and the type of textile polymer which maximizes the interval between LN replacement campaigns, and 2) stimulate manufacturers to improve product performance and development of longer lasting polymers. A full WHO recommendation may be granted to LifeNet&#x000ae; upon successful Phase III completion.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Long-lasting insecticidal nets</kwd><kwd>Malaria control</kwd><kwd>Phase III</kwd><kwd>Net durability</kwd><kwd>Attrition</kwd><kwd>Bioefficacy</kwd><kwd>LifeNet&#x000ae;</kwd><kwd>WHOPES</kwd><kwd>Deltamethrin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme</institution></funding-source><award-id>V2-TSA-069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowland</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LNs) are one of the key measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for prevention and control of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While considerable progress has been made by many National Malaria Control Programs (NMCPs) and international donor agencies to facilitate free or subsidized universal coverage campaigns (UCCs) for at-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], of increasing concern is how to prolong effective life and field durability of LNs in order to extend the interval between UCCs and improve cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the WHO has developed guidelines to assess the insecticidal efficacy of LNs, net durability and survivorship under operational conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. New LNs are granted a WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) time-limited interim recommendation for use following successful evaluations in laboratory conditions (Phase I) and in small-scale field trials in experimental huts (Phase II), during which a product must retain insecticidal activity for at least 20 standardized washes with respect to vector knock-down, mortality and blood-feeding inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To receive a full WHO recommendation, LNs are required to undergo prospective insecticidal efficacy and net durability monitoring over 3&#x000a0;years of household use (Phase III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. LN durability is measured as a function of net survivorship, fabric integrity and insecticidal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which are all influenced by frequency of use, net care and repair, washing and maintenance practices, duration of transmission season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], as well as the textile&#x02019;s physical features, such as fibre material, knitting or weaving pattern, insecticide type and concentration, and fibre impregnation technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Average effective net life is often assumed to be 3&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] but can vary substantially between products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], endemic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and conditions of use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The potential market for LNs in Tanzania, as in all African malaria endemic countries, is large and significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Since 2004, the NMCP in Tanzania, supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), has scaled up the distribution of LNs through a range of public and private sector mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], most notably the Under Five Coverage Campaign launched in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the UCCs of 2010-11 and 2015-16 to provide full coverage in all households at risk of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>While a WHOPES Phase III recommendation is based primarily on insecticidal efficacy over time, the physical durability of the fabric is the main factor determining the lifespan of a typical LN. Durability is influenced by fibre denier, the bursting strength of the net, the knitting pattern and the polymer material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. All brands of LN in regular use are made from either polyester (43%) or polyethylene (57%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. LifeNet&#x000ae; (Bayer&#x000a0;CropScience, Germany) is a new deltamethrin-impregnated long-lasting net (LN), uniquely made from polypropylene knitted fibres, which received interim WHOPES recommendation in 2011 following successful Phase I and Phase II trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. According to the manufacturer the main advantage over standard polyester and polyethylene LNs is its improved durability for household use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To investigate factors known to affect LN durability, here we describe the study design and methodology of a large scale community-based Phase III evaluation of LifeNet&#x000ae; LN compared to two WHOPES recommended LNs made from polyester and polyethylene respectively, all treated with the same insecticide (deltamethrin), over 3&#x000a0;years of field use in North-East Tanzania.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>To undertake a large scale community-based Phase III evaluation comparing the insecticidal efficacy and durability of polypropylene LifeNet&#x000ae; LN against a deltamethrin-treated polyester LN with full WHOPES approval (PermaNet&#x000ae; 2.0) and a deltamethrin-impregnated polyethylene LN over 3&#x000a0;years of continuous use in a malaria endemic setting of North-East Tanzania.</p><p>Specific objectives<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To assess the insecticidal efficacy of a deltamethrin-treated LN made of polypropylene (LifeNet&#x000ae;) compared with deltamethrin-treated LNs made of polyester and polyethylene over 3&#x000a0;years of household use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the durability (survivorship and fabric integrity) of a deltamethrin-treated LN made of polypropylene (LifeNet&#x000ae;) compared with deltamethrin-treated LNs made of polyester and polyethylene over 3&#x000a0;years of household use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess washing habits and frequency of LN washing by householders over 3&#x000a0;years of household use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To document and compare community perceptions of all three LNs by participants over 3&#x000a0;years of household use.</p></list-item></list>

The district encompasses an area of approximately 4922&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>, ranging from a coastal plain at sea level to the Usambara mountains at 1500&#x000a0;m. The climate is tropical with dense forest covering the mountain region. Muheza District has four administrative divisions comprising 33 wards with 135 villages, mainly inhabited by subsistence farmers. The population of Muheza District was 204,461 residents in 2012 with an annual growth rate of 2.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

</p><p>To assess bioefficacy (insecticidal activity measured by mosquito knock-down and mortality), deltamethrin content (g/kg and mg/m<sup>2</sup>), fabric integrity (location and size of holes) and fabric strength, a series of cross-sectional surveys and destructive sampling of LNs will be undertaken on randomly selected nets every 6&#x000a0;months for WHO cone bioassays, yearly for insecticide analysis using gas chromatography (GC), and physical integrity (hole index) every 6&#x000a0;months up to 18&#x000a0;months and then annually. A longitudinal cohort of LNs will be followed every 6&#x000a0;months to measure survivorship (net attrition rate) and loss of fabric integrity. Community attitudes and practices of LN use will be assessed every 6&#x000a0;months using the standard WHO LN durability monitoring questionnaire. Impact of the interventions on insecticide susceptibility of major malaria vectors will be evaluated each year in study villages and neighboring control areas. Study participants will also be monitored for possible adverse events during the first month post LN distribution using a structured questionnaire. A schematic representation of the trial is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schematic of study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13690_2016_168_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Observer bias will be reduced where feasible. However, there are limits because the material of each type of net is distinct to touch. Manufacturers&#x02019; labels will be removed before distribution and nets allocated using a unique nine-digit numerical identification (ID) code, composed of village (3), hamlet (2), household (3) and net (1) numbers, stenciled directly onto the LN using permanent dye. Separate IDs will be issued to those LNs assigned to the cohort study. Technicians conducting the bioefficacy, fabric integrity assays and survivorship surveys will be blinded to the brand of LN.</p><p>During destructive sampling, it is important to replace LNs with nets of the same brand to measure the true rate of loss of fabric integrity. For example, households using a specific LN may prefer another type of net given freedom of choice and use that in preference to any of the former nets still present in the house. This could result in nets of the former type developing holes less rapidly and appearing artificially more &#x02018;durable&#x02019;, thereby introducing an avoidable bias.</p><p>Fabric integrity will be assessed using two methods, by following a longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional surveys. This should detect any potential user bias resulting from the &#x02018;Hawthorne effect&#x02019;, the possibility that regular visits render participants more inclined to retain or care for their nets and less likely to dispose of them when damaged because they are being observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>LN products and distribution</title><p>LifeNet&#x000ae; LN is a net with deltamethrin-incorporated into 100 denier polypropylene filaments at 8.5&#x000a0;g AI/kg or 340&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (Bayer CropScience, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

The LN piece will be attached to a disposable cardboard frame, placed at one third of the length of a glass tunnel measuring 25&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; 60&#x000a0;cm, exposing 400&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> (20 &#x000d7; 20&#x000a0;cm) of surface netting. Nine holes, each 1&#x000a0;cm in diameter (one in the centre of the square and the other eight equidistant at 5&#x000a0;cm from the border) will be made in the netting to allow for passage of mosquitoes; a netting-covered cage is attached at each end of the tunnel to introduce mosquitoes. In the shorter section of the tunnel, a guinea pig will be restrained and one hundred 5&#x02013;8 day old non-blood fed <italic>An. gambiae s.s.</italic> Kisumu mosquitoes will be introduced from a cage positioned at the longer end of the tunnel. The experiment will begin at 18:00 and end at 09:00 the following morning, after which mosquitoes will be scored according to whether they passed through the netting, whether they successfully blood fed and whether they survived the exposure period. The test will be replicated twice with 50 mosquitoes per test using the piece of netting from the failed LN that gave a cone mortality result closest to the average obtained for positions 2&#x02013;5.

A tunnel with untreated netting will be used as a negative control. Because blood-feeding rate in the negative control influences contact and mortality with the pyrethroid-treated samples, a minimum blood-feeding rate of 50% in the controls is required in the paired treatment-control tunnel tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cross-sectional surveys: chemical analysis</title><p>Samples of the three types of LNs will be subjected to chemical residue analysis at the WHO Collaborating Centre for quality control of pesticides (Gembloux, Belgium) at the beginning of the trial (t0) to ensure that the target dose of deltamethrin is correct and at yearly intervals (t12, 24 and 36) to facilitate interpretation of bioassay data.

Blood-feeding inhibition will be assessed by comparing the proportion of blood fed females (alive or dead) in treated and control tunnels. Overall mortality will be measured by pooling the immediate and delayed (24&#x000a0;h) mortalities of mosquitoes from the two sections of the tunnel, relative to the control. Mortality data in both WHO cone and tunnel tests will be corrected for negative control mortality using Abbott&#x02019;s formula.</p><p>A candidate LN product must achieve the WHO requirement of at least 80% of sample nets meeting the bioefficacy criteria in the WHO cone bioassays or tunnel tests after 3&#x000a0;years of use.</p><p>Chemical analysis results will measure the mean (and standard deviation) target deltamethrin concentration in each type of LN to assist interpretation of the bioefficacy data. Insecticide content reported at each survey time will be used to estimate the average rate of insecticide loss from the original loading dose.</p><p>LN survivorship will be measured at each timepoint as the total number of each LN present in surveyed households (and used for sleeping under) divided by the total number of each LN originally distributed to households and not given away at each time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Median LN survival is the time point at which the estimate of functional LN survival reaches 50%. LN attrition is derived from the total number of LNs missing from each household (classified into categories of nets that have been destroyed or disposed for reasons other than poor fabric integrity, nets used for other purposes and&#x000a0;nets destroyed for reasons of poor fabric integrity) divided by the total number of each LN distributed to households. LNs retained for inspection but no longer used for reasons of poor integrity will be included among the nets lost to attrition.</p><p>Fabric integrity during the field trial will be assessed using various criteria: 1) the proportion of LNs with holes (total number of each LN product with at least one hole of any size, divided by the total number of each LN product surveyed); 2) the proportional hole index (calculated by weighting each hole by size and summing for each net (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; and 3) hole area and circumference.

To our knowledge the present proposed trial is the first to compare three types of LN polymer &#x02013; polyester, polyethylene and polypropylene - in the same location using a prospective randomized controlled trial design.</p><p>WHOPES Phase III bioefficacy guidelines for LNs are currently based on retention of bioefficacy rather than physical durability. To obtain a WHOPES full recommendation at least 80% of the LNs surviving 3&#x000a0;years of household use in malaria endemic countries must retain sufficient insecticidal activity to induce 80% mosquito mortality in bioassay tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Four brands of LN have already achieved this criteria: polyester nets, PermaNet 2.0&#x000ae; and Interceptor&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and polyethylene nets, Olyset&#x000ae; and DuraNet&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A further four LNs have obtained WHO full recommendations on the basis of equivalence to the aforementioned brands, and a further eight have obtained WHO interim recommendation after demonstrating bioefficacy in Phase II experimental hut trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While most brands of LN may achieve the requisite levels of bioefficacy, it is much less clear whether all types of net can physically withstand the wear and tear of 3&#x000a0;years of household use. LN survival will depend on the environment and household conditions of use. A LN stretched over a rustic wooden bed in a cramped traditional mud house will not last as long as a properly fitted LN draped over a bespoke net frame in a rodent free home. The duration of the mosquito season will also affect LN longevity and usage, and this will differ between the tropics and subtropics, highlands and lowlands, and coastal and plain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In practice, few brands of LN have undergone rigorous longitudinal monitoring. The first LNs to obtain WHOPES full recommendation - polyester PermaNet 2.0&#x000ae; LN and polyethylene Olyset&#x000ae; LN - were the subject of annual cross-sectional surveys of random samples of nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] across a number of countries after 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years of use rather than longitudinal monitoring of a documented cohorts of nets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In these surveys it was noted that net integrity (hole index) reached a steady state after 2&#x000a0;years of use indicating that LNs with higher hole indexes were being discarded and not surviving to 3&#x000a0;years. In these countries only one brand of net had been distributed. Unless different types of LNs are tested in the same location, in parallel, in household randomized trials, it will be difficult to determine their relative durability under field conditions. Few LN brands have been evaluated against one another in this way. A recent exception was a household randomized trial in Cambodia between polyethylene Netprotect&#x000ae; LNs and polyester PermaNet 2.0&#x000ae; LNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Net survivorship exceeded 90% in the first 2&#x000a0;years but after 3&#x000a0;years decreased to ~60% for both LNs, indicating that nets of either material were unable to last much longer than 2&#x000a0;years. It is therefore appropriate that the proposed trial of a longer lasting polypropylene LN is assessed alongside and against polyester and polyethylene LNs over 3&#x000a0;years of field use.</p><p>A standard WHOPES phase III trial of a LN normally compares the candidate LN to a reference LN (positive control) made from the same material to determine insecticide bioefficacy after 3&#x000a0;years of field use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While the proposed field trial uses the WHOPES phase III guidelines and may ultimately lead to a WHO recommendation for LifeNet&#x000ae; LN, it is primarily designed as a randomized controlled trial to compare the relative field durability of three types of LN polymer. Increasing the current average lifespan of LNs is a priority for the WHO. LNs with longer life cycles would need to be replaced less frequently, thus reducing the unit cost of LN distribution and replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. A WHOPES evaluation criterion based on durability would also create a stimulus for manufacturers to improve performance of their products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Based on current data, WHOPES has been unable to set a fabric durability threshold that a candidate LN should meet. The WHO Technical Expert Group on malaria vector control has proposed the setting of a median LN survival time based on functional LN survival at a given time after distribution. It is hoped that the present comparative study of polypropylene, polyester and polyethylene LNs would provide evidence to help calculate that criterion for different types of LN. Looking forward beyond current pyrethroid LNs to a future of nets treated with alternative insecticides to combat pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes, more durable fabrics may be necessary to maintain LN unit costs to a reasonable level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>It is not clear whether the physical durability of LNs in the field can be anticipated by laboratory tests of fabric strength. The WHO consultation that recently reviewed the utility of fabric strength tests concluded that their usefulness for predicting LN durability in the field has yet to be determined, and recommended comparative prospective studies with various types of LN in a single study environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is intended that the present study will match the indicators of field durability (hole index and functional survival) with those of laboratory strength tests to predict the durability of LNs in operational settings.</p><p>Experience has demonstrated that net attrition can be due to a variety of reasons other than loss of integrity. In the trial of Netprotect&#x000ae; and PermaNet 2.0&#x000ae; LNs in Cambodia, twice as many nets were lost or stolen, sold or given away, than were no longer used due to loss of integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the WHOPES funded evaluation of ICON&#x000ae; Maxx in Tanzania from 2011 to 2014, only 17% of nets survived 3&#x000a0;years of monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While 32% of nets failed due to loss of integrity, 52% were absent for other reasons, including families moving home, seasonal absences, selling or giving nets away. Such losses reduced power to detect an effect from the intervention, and should be discouraged provided the right to withdraw from the trial remains paramount. To encourage responsible net use, study participants/families were requested before recruitment to the cohort component of the trial not to give away or sell the study LNs. They were afforded the freedom to stop using the LNs at any time but to let investigators know the reasons during the next follow up survey. Study participants were informed that LNs would be replaced after 3&#x000a0;years (at the end of the trial period and not before) regardless of net condition but only on production of the trial net. If participants stopped using the LN for any reason, including accumulation of holes, they were to store the net for replacement, or give it to the investigators who would replace it after the trial period has elapsed.
