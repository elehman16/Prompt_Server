It involves the physiological endeavour of pregnancy, birth and breast-feeding, but also changes in social lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To handle these challenges mothers need both social and professional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Support has been described as an interactive process that affects wellbeing and health of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Social support is offered within individuals own network and then working relationships and trust is required for support to be effective. Professional support, however, is directly available but limited by professional domain and knowledge, for example childbearing and midwifery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. So it is important to differentiate between social and professional support in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Care interventions with professional support should also aim to strengthen social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In childbearing, professional support from nurses and midwives is important for parents&#x02019; childbirth experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; for mother infant interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and for breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Health professionals&#x02019; personal attitudes affect quality of care and support as well as their perception of the support they offer. This will affect professionals ability to meet patients&#x02019; individual needs, however more research is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. So to achieve improved quality of care, a change of attitude among health care professionals is needed. To change attitudes an approach with both fact and reflection has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and reflection is essential for professionals&#x02019; skills development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore an intervention with a process-oriented training including evidence based lectures and reflection was performed to change health professionals&#x02019; attitudes toward breastfeeding and parental support. This intervention resulted in health professionals attitudes becoming more facilitating and less regulating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], mothers experienced improved professional support, improved self-reported relation to and feelings for the baby and breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Due to these positive results there is a need to illuminate the methodological approach further. The overall aim is therefore to describe a methodological approach to improve and evaluate health care professionals&#x02019; attitudes toward breastfeeding and parental support in order to improve quality of care in childbearing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This was a longitudinal randomized control intervention study, in which groups of mothers received care in childbearing from antenatal midwives and child health nurses (here referred to as health professionals).

Approximately 2500 births occurred annually at the two hospitals at this time period. Mothers and their partner would meet a midwife for pregnancy medical check-ups, parental education and support approximately eight to eleven times during pregnancy. Almost all mothers gave birth in hospital, and care in hospital was provided by midwives who were not previously known to the mothers. The average length of hospital stay was between six hours to seven days, and a child-health nurse made a home visit seven to ten days after the birth, and remained in contact until the baby was old enough to start school at six years of age. Visits to the child-health nurse included medical check-ups of the child and information/support in breast-feeding and parenting. Results from a mapping study showed mothers lacked information and support in breast-feeding and parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>This intervention has two phases; the first phase was the process-oriented training to improve health professionals&#x02019; attitudes and the second phase was evaluating whether health professionals improved attitudes had effect on breastfeeding, feeling and relation to the baby and mothers&#x02019; experiences of support.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Phase 1: The process-oriented training for midwives and child health nurses (health professionals) in breastfeeding and parental support</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>First part</title><p>Allocation of municipalities to intervention or control groups. Based on the findings of a baseline study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the ten largest municipalities in the selected area were paired according to their sizes and duration of breastfeeding. For each pair of municipalities, one was then randomly designated to the five-municipality intervention group and one to the five-municipality control group. Then antenatal midwives and child health nurses were allocated to intervention or control depending on whether their work site had been selected as an intervention municipality or as a control municipality. In total 116 health professionals were asked to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A Breastfeeding Attitude Instrument was developed to measure breastfeeding attitudes in health care professionals (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;168), Four attitude dimensions were identified by factor analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Second part</title><p>Thus, all antenatal midwives and child health nurses working at the randomised intervention municipalities accepted to participate in the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;81). A process-oriented training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in breastfeeding and parental support was conducted for midwives and child health nurses (together referred to as &#x02018;health professionals&#x02019; for the remainder of this report) from the intervention municipalities.

Improved attitudes in health professionals lead to mothers being more satisfied with professional support. In addition the improved professional support increased mothers feelings and relation to the baby, earlier initiation and higher frequency of breast-feeding the first 24&#x000a0;h, less breast-milk substitute (without medical reasons), less breast-feeding challenge (despite the use of nipple shields) and as a result of these, longer breastfeeding duration.</p><p>These improved attitudes in health professionals tended to be stable over time and IG mothers reported more satisfaction with emotional and informative professional support during the first nine months after birth than CG mothers. In line with other research, quality of care is improved by enhancing health professionals&#x02019; attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. since health professionals attitudes influence their ability to meet individual needs of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In order to improve attitudes both fact and reflection is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] which is essential for skills development in professional education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is in line with our result that a process-oriented training which integrated facts with reflections on both professional and personal level lead to improved professional attitudes.</p><p>In evaluation of the process-oriented training, health professionals described that they did not have adequate time available to pursue the education during working hours. They described that despite decision making heads expressed an interest in the training the health professionals experienced that they did not have reasonable conditions to pursue the course (unpublished data). This points to lack of understanding among heads of organizations that competent health professionals require reasonable conditions to develop good quality in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Evidence based health care demand possibilities for health professionals to develop their abilities and knowledge during working hours. Heads of health care should not assume that midwives and nurses shall dedicate their free time for professional development.</p><p>IG mothers reported a more positive perception of professional support during childbearing as a result of the intervention. However, our results also highlight the fact that IG mothers reported more positive support from the professionals in the delivery ward and the maternity ward, despite the fact that these health professionals were not involved in the process-oriented training. Social and professional support is affected by earlier experiences of receiving support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and positive memories of a situation influence a friendly approach in a similar situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is possible that mothers who have had a more positive experience of support during antenatal care are more likely to have a positive perception of support from other health professionals as well. Mothers in the IG also reported improved professional support in preparation for the parental role and their partners were more active in parental support groups compared to CG mothers. This result is in line with other researchers that highlights professional support as important for parent&#x02019;s childbirth experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition results from our studies showed that improved professional support increased IG mother&#x02019;s feeling and relation to the baby, including IG mothers with caesarean birth who are particularly vulnerable. Mothers with caesarean birth are more likely to suffer from psychosocial health problems after childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and they seem more self-oriented and less self-confident when caring for the baby two months after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which may negatively influence mother-infant interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These results point to the importance of improving professional attitudes to improve support and quality of care for mothers and families in childbirth.</p><p>As a result of the process-oriented training mothers in the IG reported earlier initiation, higher frequency of breast-feeding the first 24&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">25</xref>], less breast-milk substitute (without medical reasons) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], less breast-feeding challenge despite the use of nipple shields and as a result of these increased breastfeeding duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] compared to CG mothers. Our result is in line with other research showing that when health professionals receive breastfeeding education based on WHO guidelines, they feel more secure and experience an increased ability to support mothers with coherent, evidence-based counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Other research shows that when caregivers have communication skills, their ability to empathize and find individual solutions increases, which reduces the risk that mothers perceive the advice as contradictory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Mothers need to receive realistic, consistent and evidence-based information on breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and a combination of group and individual counselling is more efficient for breast-feeding success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Mothers with higher knowledge of breastfeeding also have more confidence in their ability to breastfeed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].These results may affect mother&#x02019;s ability to manage their breastfeeding problems better, depending on whether the breastfeeding counselling was more suited to their needs and their life situation.</p><p>This longitudinal intervention method with two control groups (CGA data was collected before any effects of the intervention could be measured) was selected as being suitable for the study. This is a design suggested to measure possible spillover effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. More differences were found when the IG was compared with the CGA than when the IG was compared with the CGB (where data were collected simultaneously with the IG). These results show that changes also take place among controls when an intervention is being rolled out. In the professional network of midwives and child health nurses, knowledge and information are shared, which easily leads to spillover effects between intervention and control professionals. These results thus demonstrate the value of using a historic control group, which will provide a baseline against which to evaluate the spillover effect. Strength of the study was that the participating mothers did not know whether they encountered health professionals who had undergone the process-oriented training or not.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A methodological approach as a process-oriented training for midwives and child health nurses, improved their attitudes toward breastfeeding and parental support.

To ensure that the healthcare professionals would be ready to meet the demands of their profession they were trained in problem solving, self-reflection, and decision-making (in terms of competence), and their personal qualifications evaluated (Jerlock, Falk &#x00026; Severinsson (2003)).</p><p>The process-oriented training involved seven days of lectures and its main theme focused on the participants&#x02019; breastfeeding experiences (both private and professional), breastfeeding attitudes, breastfeeding counselling, and collaboration and communication between antenatal centers and child health centers in line with WHO recommendations*. Midwives and postnatal nurses were asked to reflect on different areas relating to breastfeeding support. The training supervisors were chosen to strengthen the process between the healthcare centers and the hospital wards. Both the literature and the lecturers raised parenthood, breast-feeding, relations, attachment, the baby&#x02019;s ability as well as complications around childbearing as well as a common parental education with both midwives and postnatal nurses included. It was the same parental education groups during pregnancy and the babies first year of life.</p><p>The healthcare professionals chose the following topics in order to offer an individualized professional support during childbirth:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x025aa; reflections on how breastfeeding occurred in the participants&#x02019; lives, both private, in education and professional life,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; the woman&#x02019;s physical and mental adaptation to the breastfeeding situation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; the infant&#x02019;s own power, and senses, both as unborn and as newborn,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; parents relations and parental leave, in a gender and cultural perspective,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; protect, promote, and support breastfeeding and family health,</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; parent-infant interaction and</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025aa; in history of a global and organizational perspective.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Different themes were treated in each group, these were then reported in the cross-groups. A written summary was made so that everyone could take part of everyone&#x02019;s work. The entire course ended with the professionals at every municipality did their own suggestions on parental education together. Parental education would be implemented by the professionals together during the pregnancy and baby&#x02019;s first year.</p><p>Jerlock M, Falk K, Severinsson E. 2003 Academic nursing education guidelines: Tools for bridging the gap between theory, research and practice.
