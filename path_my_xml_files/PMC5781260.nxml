Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is the most common symptom of eiMD, whereas histological evidence of disruption of the myofibrillar structure and myofibre necrosis, as well as inflammation, are the ultimate signs of eiMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DOMS is associated with muscle fatigue and muscle soreness, symptoms, which last for a number of days and have a negative impact on the exercise performance of athletes and amateur sports people, especially when they carry out long-term training programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Incomplete regeneration of myofibrillar structures and metabolic processes before the next training increases the risk for secondary injuries. Therefore, it is important for the adherence to training plans and for the training success that regeneration is as effective and as short as possible.</p><p id="Par12">A product that could accelerate recovery from DOMS or muscular fatigue would be beneficial not only for high performance athletes, but also for amateur athletes, enabling them to train more frequently or reduce the risk of injury. As inflammation and ROS (reactive oxygen species) are presumably the main cause of DOMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], it is hypothesized that natural ingredients with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties may help in accelerating or supporting the regeneration after muscle damage inducing exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The use of supplements with antioxidative or anti-inflammatory effects in the sports nutrition is already widespread. Many of these ingredients and products have been investigated in recent years; for example, curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Lemon verbena (<italic>Aloysia citriodora (L.)</italic>) is an annual eatable herbaceous plant native to South America commonly used as tea, refreshing beverage, food, or spice. Traditional medicinal applications are related to digestion and nervous discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A literature search focusing on peer-reviewed publications showed that only limited data are available for lemon verbena in connection with muscular recovery after exercise. PubMed listed over 80 publications in June 2017, that investigated lemon verbena as stand-alone product or in combination with other ingredients in any context (keywords for search were <italic>Aloysia citriodora</italic>, <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic>, <italic>Lippia triphylla</italic>, <italic>Aloysia triphylla,</italic> and lemon verbena).</p><p id="Par14">Analytical references demonstrate that water-based extracts out of lemon verbena leaves are high in polyphenols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Out of six human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], only one human pilot study was published investigating lemon verbena extract on the muscular damage biomarker, creatine kinase and liver biomarker related to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study showed some effects on cytokines and oxidative stress markers in neutrophils, but no functional parameters like muscle strength or muscle soreness were essessed. Furthermore, this study used a high dosage of 1800&#x000a0;mg/day which is not suitable for application in food supplements as it would require the intake of approximatley nine capsules per day. Therefore, further research to observe effects of lemon verbena on muscle damage, muscle soreness, and recovery needs to be performed.</p><p id="Par15">A proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben&#x000ae;), high in polyphenols, was developed and recently identified as an anti-inflammatory agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One mode of action responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. COX inhibition properties have also been shown for curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], which is also an natural ingredient shown to be beneficial in recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Based on these data and on data from literature, we hypothesized that a lemon verbena extract (Recoverben&#x000ae;) could have beneficial effects on exercise induced muscle damage, muscle soreness, and recovery. The aim of this study was to investigate effects on functional, metabolic, and subjective parameters of recovery. Furthermore, parameters indicating antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties were included to document mode of action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par16">This study was a double blind, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design that investigated the effects of a proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben&#x000ae;) supplementation on muscle strength and recovery after exhausive exercise.

Subjects had a usual intake of five or less portions of fruits plus vegetables per day. Detailed inclusion- and exclusion criteria are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Eligibility was evaluated by medical history, concomitant medication, physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and anamnesis. Physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nutrition pattern of subjects was determined during the screening visit using a subjective, retrospective, semi-quantitative nutrition frequency questionnaire. The score ranges from 0 to 100, whereby 0 means a very good nutrition pattern and 100 a very poor nutrition pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The questionnaire was developed for the German-speaking area and tested in a neutral and geriatric collective. Adequate determination of supply of micronutrient was validated by comparing with a detailed quantitative food frequency questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A score around 50 can be interpreted as balanced nutrition. Amount of fruits and vegetables portions taken per day was asked during screening, whereby one portion was specified to be around 150&#x000a0;g. Subjects were requested to refrain from intake of anti-inflammatory or antioxidative drugs or supplements during the study, potentially interfering with this trial. They were asked not to change their dietary habits and physical activity during the study. The evening before the study days, subjects ate a standardized dinner low in polyphenols (noodles with cheese sauce). During the study days, they received a standardized breakfast (cereal bars) and a standardized snack (white wheat roll with butter and cheese). Amount and time were also standardized. Alcohol intake and exhaustive activities were prohibited 48&#x000a0;h before the study days until 96&#x000a0;h after the exhaustive exercise.

Changes within groups were assessed using one way ANOVA or Friedmann test, as appropriate. All efficacy parameters were checked for baseline differences.

We found that consumption of lemon verbena significantly attenuated loss of muscle strength compared to placebo. Muscle strength loss is considered a reliable and valid functional marker for assessing muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest that lemon verbena may reduce exercise-induced muscle damage.</p><p id="Par46">Muscle strength was reduced by 21% in placebo group, which is within the expected range of 20&#x02013;50% and recovery was not completed until two days post exercise. It is generally accepted that two to seven days are necessary for full recovery following exercise induced muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Compared to placebo, lemon verbena extract significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.0311) buffered strength loss after exercise. MVC in the lemon verbena group was reduced by 11%, which is defined as mild muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, complete recovery was reached after 48&#x000a0;h. Based on these findings, lemon verbena appears to not only speed recovery, but also reduce fatigue directly after exercise.</p><p id="Par47">These results were reflected by findings for perceived muscle soreness. Movement induced pain, which estimated actual perceived pain showed discrimination between study groups with slight superiority of lemon verbena extract by trend. The less pronounced muscle damage, seen by significantly less reduction of MVC, seems to be reflected by less perceived pain under lemon verbena extract if compared to placebo. Maximum of muscle soreness was reported 48&#x000a0;h after exercise, fitting to the general knowledge that muscle soreness peaks 24&#x000a0;h or 48&#x000a0;h after damaging exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The extent of muscle soreness was medium for both groups, supporting that the exercise protocol caused mild to moderate muscle damage. After 96&#x000a0;h, subjects were, on average, not completely painless, even if muscle strength at that time was already recovered in this group. However, the same phenomenon has already been observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Increasing concentration of CK in the blood is an indication of muscle damage, being frequently used in sports nutrition studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The time course of CK increase peaked at 24&#x000a0;h after exercise, which is comparable to findings reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Exercise-induced increases in CK are known to exhibit high interindividual variability, with some people showing large increases (responders) and others showing only moderate increases (non-responders) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In our study, high levels of interindividual variation in CK concentrations were present, which could explain why we failed to observe a significant between-group difference despite other markers of muscle damage, such as MVC, favoring the lemon verbena group.</p><p id="Par49">Many research studies have shown that supplementation with dietary polyphenols has the potential to positively influence symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, underlying processes are still unclear and it is not sure if antioxidative effects are the primarily mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, the benefit of reducing oxidative stress has been discussed diversely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Increased of oxidative stress can lead to progressive cell damage and decline in physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, ROS act as biological stimuli in cellular processes of adaption to training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and cells can adapt to repetitive increases of ROS by improving antioxidant capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. During the current study, glutathione peroxidase in plasma was selected as a parameter to supply information about antioxidative capacity. Our results indicate an activation of the antioxidative defense under lemon verbena extract by up-regulating GPxP shortly after exercise. In contrast to this, baseline GPxP was not increased by supplementation with lemon verbena extract. Therefore, it appears, that supplementation with lemon verbena extract strengthens the antioxidative defense system and enables effective counteraction of oxidative stress, but only if needed. Both groups experienced significant exercise-induced increases in IL-6 without significant difference between one another. Some evidence suggests that changes in IL-6 depend in part on exercise intensity and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is possible that the exhaustive exercise protocol used in our study was not intense and/or long enough to elicit meaningful changes in IL-6 that could have been effected by lemon verbena supplementation. Similar results were found in other human studies investigating natural ingredients for effects of muscle strength and muscle damage, such as ashwagandha extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], pomegranate extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and blueberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These natural ingredients are high in polyphenols, a trait shared by lemon verbena. It has been proposed, that polyphenols could be useful to prevent muscle damage or improve recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The major biological functions of polyphenols are as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. Enhanced production of vasodilation factors and the inhibition of synthesis of vasoconstrictors have also been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These could be additionally beneficial by improving tissue oxygen supply and removal of metabolic waste products. The proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben&#x000ae;) investigated in the current study has shown anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and is characterized by a high polyphenol content and high ORAC level. Therefore, the observed reduction in muscle strength loss and indicated accelerated recovery in the present study might be explained by lemon verbenas&#x02019; constituents and their ability to prevent or reduce inflammatory processes or reduce oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par50">In summary, our study showed that ingestion of a 400&#x000a0;mg/day proprietary lemon verbena extract (Recoverben&#x000ae;) resulted in significantly less muscle strength loss in healthy, moderately active adults. Influences by trend on muscle soreness and antioxidative capacity emphasizes the potential of the product accelerating recovery after exhaustive exercise. Larger studies could provide statistical evidence also for the parameter, which only showed improvements by trend in the study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p id="Par1">Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOMS</term><def><p id="Par2">Delayed onset of muscle soreness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eiMD</term><def><p id="Par3">Exercise-induced muscle damage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPx</term><def><p id="Par4">Glutathione peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPxP</term><def><p id="Par5">Glutathione peroxidase in Plasma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p id="Par6">Interleukin 6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVC</term><def><p id="Par7">Maximal voluntary contraction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par8">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p id="Par9">Rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p id="Par10">Visual analogue scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all subjects taking part in the trial.</p><sec id="FPar3"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par52">Despite sponsoring by Vital Solutions GmbH, no further funding was received.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par53">Please contact corresponding author for additional data.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The study was designed by CAR, ES and CS (BioTeSys GmbH) after approach from SBW, IN (Vital Solutions GmbH).
