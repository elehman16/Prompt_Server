Frenum problem most often occurs on the labial surface between the maxillary and mandibular central incisors and in canine and premolar areas. They occur less often on the lingual surface of the mandible.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Depending upon the extension of attachment of fibres, frena have been classified as:[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mucosal: When the frenal fibers are attached up to mucogingival junction</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gingival: When fibers are inserted within attached gingiva</p></list-item><list-item><p>Papillary: When fibers are extending into interdental papilla</p></list-item><list-item><p>Papilla penetrating: When the frenal fibers cross the alveolar process and extends up to the palatine papilla.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Clinically, papillary and papilla penetrating frena are considered as pathological and have been found to be associated with loss of papilla, recession, diastema, difficulty in brushing, alignment of teeth and psychological disturbances to individual.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Frenectomy is the complete removal of the frenum, including its attachment of the underlying bone. There are two techniques for frenectomy. One of these is the conventional technique with scalpels and periodontal knives, and the other is using the soft tissue laser.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] both the techniques has certain disadvantages, conventional scalpel technique causes large rhomboidal wound area where primary closure is not possible in the lower part and healing takes place by secondary intension. It also cause more pain and discomfort to the patient when compared with the laser technique.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] On the other hand laser is a costly instrument, and the use require more precision and control, if the beam touches the bone surface it will cause necrosis of the bone.</p><p>In this study a new technique has been invented for the frenectomy which is compared with the conventional scalpel technique on the degree of postoperative pain, discomfort, and functional complication like speech problem which is experienced by the patient after frenectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The study sample was selected from patients who had been visited to the Department of Periodontology M.

Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. All subjects were systemically healthy, did not use medications, with gingivitis and had good oral hygiene at the time of surgery. Only maxillary frena extending to the interdental papilla were considered in the study. Twelve male and eight female patients aged between 20 and 35 years were included in the study.</p><p>For the conventional technique, the frenum was held with a pair of hemostats [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>], and the whole band of the tissue together with its alveolar attachment was excised with a number 15 blade [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

In the era of periodontal plastic surgery, more conservative and precise techniques are being adopted to create more functional and aesthetic results. The management of aberrant frenum has travelled a long journey from Archer's[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Kruger's[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] &#x0201c;classical techniques&#x0201d; of total frenectomy to Edward's[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] more conservative approach. Recent techniques added frenal relocation by Z-plasty,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] frenectomy with soft-tissue graft[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and laser[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] applications to avoid typical diamond-shaped scar and facilitate healing. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>In our study patient treated by paralleling technique had significantly less postoperative pain and functional complication when compared with the conventional technique. Conventionally, a frenectomy procedure involve holding of frenum with the hemostat, incising above and below the hemostat, creating a large diamond shape wound, often with copious bleeding. Patient often experience postsurgical bleeding and pain mainly because of the open area at the base of the frenectomy site [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], where primary closure is not possible because large part of mucosa has been removed. To overcome these problems a new paralleling technical is used in this study for frenectomy.</p><p>In case of paralleling technique two paralleling incisions are made on the side of ridge of the frenum this will reduce the removal of excess mucosal tissue [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. After that deep dissection for the muscle fibers are done to remove the attachment. This will decrease the chances of recurrence. Then the thin incised tissue is removed by making sharp cut above and below frenum. Primary closure is possible in this case throughout the length of frenum because of close approximation of margin produced by thin paralleling incision [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. Primary closure and less removal of gingival and mucosal tissues could be the reason for less postoperative pain and speech discomfort [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>].</p><p>Oral hygiene evaluation was done after 1, 7 and 30 days. Both the technique showed improvement in the oral hygiene in upper anterior region at the end of 30 days [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>]. Oral hygiene was not improved at 7 days of evaluation, which might be because of sutures or pain that makes it difficult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Paralleling technique provides better patient perception in terms of postoperative pain and speech when compared with conventional technique. High frenum causes hindrance in oral hygiene maintenance and the measures for oral hygiene improves after frenectomy.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><nlm-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Takei</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Azzi</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Takei</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Carranza</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal plastic and esthetic surgery</article-title><source>Carranza's Clinical Periodontology</source><year>2002</year><edition>9th ed</edition><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.B.
