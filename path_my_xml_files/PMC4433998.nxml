combined exercise program on pain, flexibility, and static balance in chronic low back
pain patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty persons diagnosed with chronic low back pain
were divided into a trunk stability exercise group and a combined exercise group and then
conducted exercise for six weeks. [Results] VAS and sway lengths decreased significantly
in both groups. A comparison of sway lengths after the intervention between the two groups
revealed that the trunk stability exercise group had a bigger decrease than the combined
exercise group. [Conclusion] The results of this study indicated that trunk stability
exercise would have bigger effect than combined exercise on the daily activities of
chronic low back pain patients as it strengthens deep abdominal muscles and improves
flexibility and balancing ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Trunk stability exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is classified as acute if the duration of pain is less than 6 weeks, subacute
if the duration is between 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and chronic if the duration is over 12
weeks. Most low back pain lasts for 2 to 3 months. However, recurrence is very common<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though most recurrences can be
treated, 5 to 15% cannot be treated, and the patients continue to experience pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are various causes of low back pain.
The most common causes are the low back structure, biomechanical factors and regressive
changes in surrounding tissues, psychological factors, various types of infections,
metastatic osteosarcoma, and congenital spinal abnormality<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, low back pain causes changes in low back structure and surrounding tissues. As
a result, the abdominal muscles, which are related to the stability of the trunk, are
weakened, and this causes pain and functional limitations<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. When low back pain gets worse, it limits physical activities. When
it becomes chronic, the cross section of the muscles surrounding the spine decreases and
causes disuse muscle atrophy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the
various causes of low back pain, Panjabi reports<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> that instability of the spine is the most important cause among
biomechanical causes. He mentions that instability of the lumbar vertebrae is recognized as
a very serious factor by chronic low back pain patients<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It causes pain, reduces endurance and flexibility, and limits the
range of motion of the waist<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Panjabi reports that dynamic trunk stability exercise, a muscle strengthening exercise for
the local muscle group located in the trunk core around the lumbar vertebrae that plays an
important role in providing dynamic stability to spinal segments, is useful for reducing
functional disability of the spine. If the muscles lack stability, they make inaccurate
movements<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance control requires well-controlled voluntary movement and reflective muscle
reaction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, the body core is
stabilized by actively controlling physical stability and tension against gravity, bearing
surface, vision, and exterior environment through interaction between various sensory
nerves<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In many studies, special
exercises including trunk stability exercise have been reported to be more effective<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>
and complex exercises including aerobic exercises and resistance exercises have been
reported to have a positive effect on body composition, bone density, and development
neuromuscular development<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although trunk stability exercise and resistance exercise are known to be effective in
stabilizing the spine, there are not enough studies on standardized exercise therapies with
combined exercise and their effect. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of trunk
stability exercise and a combined exercise program on pain, flexibility, and static balance
in chronic low back pain patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study chose 30 adults between the ages of 30 and 40 who had been diagnosed with
chronic low back pain from the members of U-Sport Center, Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do,
Republic of Korea. They were divided into a trunk stability exercise group and a combined
exercise group and exercised 3 times a week for 6 weeks.</p><p>The study subjects met the following conditions; 1) no cardiovascular or orthopedic
diseases, 2) no neurological diseases, 3) no loss of balance ability caused by vestibular
damage or vision damage, 4) no use of medication for low back pain, 5) no experience with
exercise similar to that in this experiment, and 6) chronic low back pain that does not
prevent performance of daily activities. All the subjects understood the purpose of this
study and provided their written informed consent prior to participation in the study in

the study subjects, who had been diagnosed with chronic low back pain. Sway area and sway
length were measured to determine balance ability, and a VAS was used to measure the level
of pain to see the effect of the exercises on pain. Since low back pain patients have
reduced static balance abilities compared with normal people, which causes decreased
postural stability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is necessary to
reduce the shearing force applied to the low back through exercises that improve trunk
stability so that the patients can acquire stability pelvis and trunk.</p><p>This study applied a trunk stability exercise program and combined exercise program to
subjects who were diagnosed with chronic low back pain to determine the levels of trunk
stability acquisition. The sway area and sway length were measured. The two groups showed a
significant decrease, which is a positive result. Trunk stability exercise is an exercise
which improves the balance and stability of the body. It allows simultaneous activation of
abdominal muscles and multifidus, the fine motor muscle of the spine<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The muscles in this part of body are tension and postural
muscles, and they play an important role in trunk stability and posture control when and
individual performs whole body exercise. They also counteract the imbalance of muscles
necessary for maintaining posture<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. When
we measured the VAS after the two groups performed the trunk stability exercise and combined
exercise, both groups showed a significant decrease in pain. It is assumed that the two
exercise programs improved trunk stability and strengthened muscle significantly, and
resulted in reduced pain due to activation of trunk muscles.</p><p>According to the results of this study, chronic low back pain patients can reduce their
pain significantly if they regularly and continuously exercise as shown in our results, even
with different types of exercise as in this study. Considering the matter of effectiveness,
trunk stability exercise would have bigger effect on a chronic low back pain patient&#x02019;s daily
activities, as it strengthens deep abdominal muscles and improves flexibility and balance
ability. There are some limitations to this study. First of all, it did not have enough
subjects. In addition, only a limited number of evaluations were performed, so it was not
possible to verify the effect of the exercises on the chronic low back pain patients.
Moreover, it was not possible to determine whether the subjects continued performing the
trunk stability exercise or combined exercise. Future studies should conduct a follow-up
test to understand how subjects maintain exercise programs so that the results can be
well-used by many chronic low back pain patients who suffer from restrictions due to back
pain and by many therapists who are responsible for therapeutic exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hides</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Jull</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Long-term effects of specific stabilizing exercises for
