Fungal particles act as antigens in mucosa of sensitized individuals, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells- namely eosinophils- and release of MBP (Major Basic Protein), which finally causes mucosal damage and superinfection by shifting other inflammatory cells into the location. It should be mentioned that the process is not an allergic reaction and is not mediated by IgE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Fungal elements have been identified in 82% of specimens of CRS patients undergoing FESS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> In one study in Europe, this rate was as high as 96% of specimens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Different modalities of treatment have been proposed and practiced for nasal polyposis, including prolonged antiobiotics, systemic or topical steroids, intralesional steroid injection, outpatient polypectomy, topical capsaisin, topical furosmide, amphotericine B nasal irrigation, UV phototherapy, etc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> In cases unresponsive to medical therapy, surgical interventions are indicated, with the goal being removal of polyps and pathologic mucosa and opening of osteomeatal complex.

Sampling was carried out by simple consecutive type method and assignment to case or control groups was simple randomly performed. Patients suffering from Aspirin sensitivity were omitted, as were patients with contraindications to corticosteroid or amphotericine B administration. Pregnant and lactating women were also excluded. The number of cases was calculated by the formula n = (Z<sub>1</sub>+Z<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; [P<sub>1</sub>(1-p<sub>1</sub>)+P<sub>2</sub>(1-p<sub>2</sub>)]/(P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. Every patient signed a written informed consent following thorough explanation of the study.</p><p>Fifty patients suffering from nasal polyposis entered the study and were assigned to two groups, each consisting of 25 patients: 1) amphotericin B group, 2) normal saline group. All patients&#x02019; data (e.g. age, sex, history of allergies, history of previous sinus surgeries) were recorded in a questionnaire designed for this study. CT Scanning of all patients&#x02019; paranasal sinuses was done preoperatively by appropriate algorithms to stage the disease according to Lund-Mackay staging system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Lund-Mackay Staging system for sinonasal polyposis in regard to CT scan findings</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-16-74-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The physician responsible for staging of pre and postoperative CT scans was blinded to the patients&#x02019; group and patients&#x02019; pretreatment stage. All patients filled out subjective data in questionnaire and were treated by functional endoscopic sinus surgery by one of the first two authors. Postoperatively, all patients received ciprofloxacin tablets (500 mg daily for 2 weeks, Sobhan Co, Iran) and Beclomethason nasal spray (50 microgram each puff, Apotex inc. Toronto, Canada) for 1 month. In the amphotericine B group, patients were instructed to irrigate the nasal cavity with a premade solution of 50 mg amphotericine B (Fungizone, Bristol-Myers Squibb, France) in 500 cc sterile water twice daily for 6 months. In the Normal saline group, patients used the physiologic normal saline for intranasal douching every 12 hours for 6 months.</p><p>Patients were followed in the first week postoperatively and then every month for 6 months. At the end of the treatment period, another CT Scan of paranasal sinuses was performed and the new stage of the disease was recorded. Also, patients filled out the subjective postoperative data in the data sheet.</p><p>Data were analyzed using chi square, Fisher exact, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests according to the different values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The study was carried out on 25 patients in amphotericine B group and 25 patients in normal saline group. Thirty five patients were male and 15 were female.</p><p>Mean age of the cohort was 40.2 &#x000b1; 12.03 years (range: 17-64 years) in amphotericine B group and 40.1 &#x000b1; 10.8 years (range: 23-64 years) in normal saline group. Independent t test failed to show any significant differences in mean age of the two groups (p = 0.971).</p><p>Focusing on history of allergies, 17 patients in normal saline group (68%) and 21 cases in amphotericine B group (84%) reported history of some kind of allergies. Chi square test did not show statistically significant discrepancy between the two groups in this regard (p = 0.160). Similarly, the two groups were com-pared for the history of previous sinus surgeries; 4 cases in normal saline group (16%) and 5 patients in amphotericine B group (20%) had history of previous sinonasal surgery which was statistically insignificant according to Fisher exact test (p = 0.710).</p><p>Preoperative and postoperative CT Scans of paranasal sinuses were staged according to Lund-Mackay staging system and data of each group were compared. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the frequency distribution of different stage scores pre- and postoperatively in amphotericine B group.

This means that FESS in combination with postoperative nasal saline douching results in a statistically significant improvement in CT scan staging (p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Finally, the two cohorts were compared using Mann-Whitney test for negative ranks (a reduction in imaging stage) and the test could not show a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.170).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main aim of the current study was to compare the effect of amphotericine B solution and Normal saline in preventing the recurrence of polyps in sinonasal tract following FESS.</p><p>Based on the results, amphotericine B solution was effective in reducing the stage score of patients on CT Scan after functional endoscopic removal of polyps. Similar results were achieved in the normal saline group and statistical analysis failed to show any significance in this regard. This means that although FESS and frequent irrigation of nasal cavity helps prevent recurrence of polyposis disease, no significant difference can be observed between Physiologic normal saline and amphotericine B solution in CT scan scores. The present study confirmed some of the previously done experiments in this field.</p><p>For example, in a study on 116 patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with polyps, patients were treated with amphotericine B solution for 3 months, but no objective improvement was observed compared to placebo group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> In another experiment, patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were treated by nasal irrigation of either amphotericine B or normal saline solutions for 8 weeks postoperatively. The study could not show any meaningful difference in improvement of signs and symptoms in the two subgroups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Not all researchers agree on the lack of effect of amphotericine B in polyposis. An early study on this dilemma was conducted by Ricchetti et al in 2002/2003 on 74 CRS with polyp patients, who were treated with amphotericine B and placebo for 4 weeks after FESS. The study concluded that amphotericine was more effective than placebo in reducing disease stage, documenting total resolution of polyps in 62% of mild and 42% of moderate polyposis cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Two other studies by Ponikau et al in 2002 and 2005 supported the hypothesis of effectiveness of amphotericine B in reduction of polyposis. Interestingly, these studies documented a significant reduction in inflammation and thickness of sinonasal mucosa and eosinophilic inflammatory markers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>Previous studies, either supporting or denying the use of amphotericine B solution, had a drug administration period of 4 to maximally 12 weeks after endoscopic sinus surgery. This short time span could have masked the effectiveness of the drug. The present study was designed to omit this possible bias factor by expanding the drug administration duration to 24 weeks before a judgment on the drug effects was made.</p><p>Nonetheless, although amphotericine B solution was successful in reducing CT score of polyposis patients in combination to FESS, the present study was unable to show any benefits for this treatment regimen over normal saline. It should be remembered that the probable mechanism of effect for normal saline nasal irrigation is washing out the fungal fragments, depriving the mucosal immune system of the stimulus. In this mechanism, normal saline and amphotericine B solution act similarly.</p><p>Another possible explanation for conflicting results in different studies is that amphotericine B solution might have been more effective in patients suffering from CRS and polyposis, who had a background specific allergic reaction to fungi. This would mean that a subset of polyposis patients with allergies to fungi and concomitant high fungal load in sinonasal tract would actually benefit from this treatment. We were unable to assess the fungal load in sinonasal mucosa. This would be a challenge to be solved by further studies.</p><p>Keeping in mind the side effects of amphotericine B solution such as its high cost, difficult preparation, bothersome maintenance and minor discomfort during administration, it may be a better idea to retreat to the traditional normal saline nasal douching following FESS in the treatment of CRS with polyposis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although antifungal therapy is theoretically an interesting adjunct treatment in management of sinonasal polyposis, our study was unable to document an actual benefit to this regiment in comparison to routine normal saline nasal irrigation. Sticking to the time-tested physiologic saline nasal douching following endoscopic removal of polyps seems a logical and prudent choice for the time being.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>SMH and FM designed the study and introduced most of patients to the study.
