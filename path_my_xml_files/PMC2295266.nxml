About 135 patients with acute sciatica (recruited from May 2003 to November 2004) were randomised in two groups: (1) the intervention group received physical therapy (PT) added to the general practitioners&#x02019; care, and (2) the control group with general practitioners&#x02019; care only. To assess the effectiveness of PT additional to general practitioners&#x02019; care compared to general practitioners&#x02019; care alone, in patients with acute sciatica. There is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in patients with sciatica. The primary outcome was patients&#x02019; global perceived effect (GPE). Secondary outcomes were severity of leg and back pain, severity of disability, general health and absence from work. The outcomes were measured at 3, 6, 12 and 52&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation. At 3&#x000a0;months follow-up, 70% of the intervention group and 62% of the control group reported improvement (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.9&#x02013;1.5). At 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, 79% of the intervention group and 56% of the control group reported improvement (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1; 1.8). No significant differences regarding leg pain, functional status, fear of movement and health status were found at short-term or long-term follow-up. At 12&#x000a0;months follow-up, evidence was found that PT added to general practitioners&#x02019; care is only more effective regarding GPE, and not more cost-effective in the treatment of patients with acute sciatica than general practitioners&#x02019; care alone. There are indications that PT is especially effective regarding GPE in patients reporting severe disability at presentation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sciatica</kwd><kwd>Lumbosacral radicular syndrome</kwd><kwd>GP</kwd><kwd>Physical therapy</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS), also called sciatica, is a disorder with radiating pain in the leg below the knee in one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes, and can be accompanied by phenomena associated with nerve root tension or neurological deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A prolapsed disc is a frequent cause of LRS, but other causes include spinal or lateral recess stenosis, tumours and radiculitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The incidence of LRS in the Netherlands is estimated at 5 per 1,000 persons a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>There is consensus that treatment of LRS in the first 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks should be conservative. The exact content of the conservative treatment is, however not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After the study of Vroomen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] bed rest is no longer regarded as a treatment option for LRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Assessed in a recent systematic review was the effectiveness of conservative treatments of LRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thirty trials were included that evaluated injections (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14), traction (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), physical therapy (PT) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4), bed rest (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), manipulation (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), medication (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) and acupuncture (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) as a treatment for LRS. Because several trials indicated no evidence of an effect it is not recommended to use corticosteroid injections and traction as treatment option. Whether clinicians should prescribe PT, bed rest, manipulation or medication could not be concluded from this review. Therefore, there is no evidence that one type of conservative treatment is clearly superior to others for patients with LRS.</p><p>In an previous observational study it was shown that GPs did not adhere to the guideline regarding the referral to PT; almost half of patients with LRS were referred for PT, although this was not recommended in the guideline. No specific characteristic could be identified to explain this referral to PT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of PT in LRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of PT management additional to GP management compared to GP management alone, in patients with acute LRS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>More detailed information about the methods of the LRS trial is presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

Concealment was ensured because patients&#x02019; unique trial number was typed in a special database, which was not editable for the research assistant and a second randomisation action using the same trial number was not possible. Hereafter, the random allocation appeared on screen. In order to prevent unequal treatment group sizes, block randomisation was used with blocks of ten patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This means that after every tenth patient the number of patients allocated to both treatment groups was equal. The research assistant performed the randomisation after baseline measurement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blinding</title><p>For obvious reasons the GPs, physical therapists and patients were not blinded for treatment allocation.

They acted as coaches and guided the patient in order to stimulate return to activity (type/content of the exercises was left to the expertise of the participating physical therapists), despite the pain experience. Both GP and PT interventions (only in an one to one setting; group settings were not allowed) were restricted to a maximum of nine treatments/consultations in the first 6&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measurements</title><p>Collected at baseline were patients&#x02019; characteristics such as gender and date of birth. Standardised history taking was used to establish whether patients were familiar with LRS in the past, reported more pain in the leg on coughing/sneezing or straining, on sitting, standing, walking and lying down and whether patients reported decreased muscle strength and sensory deficits in the leg. The physical examination included amongst others the straight leg raising test and the test of Bragard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Baseline comparability was investigated by descriptive statistics to examine whether randomisation was successful. Missing (item) values were assigned the last available score. Group differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcome measures with a baseline value. Between group differences were calculated using the Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables and the Chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Results are presented as relative risks (RR) or effect sizes (ES) with corresponding 95% CI.</p><p>Also presented is the number needed to treat, i.e. the number of patients that needs to be treated, resulting in one more &#x02018;improved&#x02019; patient in the &#x02018;GP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;PT care&#x02019; group compared to the &#x02018;GP care only&#x02019; group. There was a statistically significant difference if the <italic>P</italic>-value was smaller than 0.05, and a clinically relevant difference when a 20% difference appeared in one of the outcome measurements between both groups. In addition a per-protocol analysis was performed, analysing only those patients with no serious treatment protocol deviations, e.g. received the allocated treatment. Pre-determined subgroup analyses were performed for patients with severe disability (RDQ&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;17). Supplementary analysis were performed with multivariate regression to examine the possibility of confounding.

However, no significant relevant differences were found in the secondary outcomes: leg pain, functional status, fear of movement and health status. Therefore, adding PT care to GP care is only more effective regarding the primary outcome (GPE) than GP care alone in the long-term, for the average patient with (sub) acute sciatica. Moreover, PT care added to GP care seemed to be especially effective regarding GPE in the subgroup with patients reporting more severe disability at presentation.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Although the control group had three dropouts compared with only one in the intervention group, this did not appear to bias the results because all dropped-out immediately after randomisation, and results of both the per-protocol analysis and the intention-to-treat analysis were similar.</p><p>The loss to follow-up in the study was not very high (&#x0003c;20%); at 12-months follow-up 10% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7) in the intervention group and 16% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11) in the control group. In statistics the missing values were assigned the last available score which could lead to bias towards no differences between the treatment groups, if the loss to follow up is (very) high. However, the per-protocol analysis and the intention-to-treat analysis turned out to be similar.</p><p>There are no indications that not blinding GPs, physical therapists and patients biased the results; at 12&#x000a0;weeks follow-up the within-group improvement of both groups was considerable for GPE, the leg pain on NRS and the RDQ.</p><p>The trial intended to enrol 182 eligible patients. Finally, 135 patients were randomised in the two treatment groups. For practical reasons (time and money) the recruiting period for patients could not be extended. This may have biased the results, i.e. that the study could have underestimated the effect of the intervention because less patients were randomised according to the sample size calculation. Nevertheless, at 12-months follow-up a significant and clinically relevant difference between both groups, in favour of the intervention group, was found on the primary outcome &#x02018;GPE&#x02019;.</p><p>At long-term follow-up a clinically relevant change was found on the primary outcome measure (GPE) between the two groups, in favour of the intervention group; the difference was 23%. A priori was stated that a clinically relevant difference had to be at least 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, recent work of Ostelo and De Vet shows the need for more research on the exact value for the minimal clinically important difference between two groups in this type of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Literature</title><p>A few randomised clinical trials have evaluated PT as a treatment for the LRS. Hofstee et al. focused on bed rest, PT and continuation of activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; their trial included 250 patients with acute sciatica, and the authors concluded after a 6-month follow-up period that bed rest and PT are no more effective than continuation of the activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Coxhead et al. compared four methods of PT (traction, exercises, manipulation and corset therapy) in 322 participating patients with sciatica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; the authors concluded that although active PT appeared to be of short-term value, it did not seem to confer any long-term benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Lidstr&#x000f6;m and Zachrisson compared three methods of PT (massage/exercises, traction and hot packs) in 62 patients with sciatica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; after treatment (1&#x000a0;month after randomisation) they concluded that the traction group showed better results than the other two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The results of our study are not in concordance with the earlier studies, because we found that in the long-term PT care added to GP care is effective.</p><p>There are substantial differences between these clinical trials regarding the study population (e.g. underlying cause of LRS and mix of acute, subacute and chronic patients), control treatments, duration of follow-up, and primary outcome measures. Because of this heterogeneity it is very difficult to compare these studies. Furthermore, the previous studies did not measure the absence from work (or did not report on this outcome). In the present study, there were no significant differences in absence from work between groups at short- or long-term follow-up. The economic evaluation alongside this randomised clinical trial is presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Moreover, for patients with severe disability at presentation, PT care added to GP care seemed to be especially effective regarding GPE. Future trials are necessary to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of PT in patients with severe disability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors appreciate the assistance of Marie-Louise Lenssinck on patients&#x02019; management.
