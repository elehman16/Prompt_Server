Seroma occurs in the axilla, triggering pain and limiting arm movements. Wound seroma may lead to late drain removal and increased long-term morbidity and can also lead to flap necrosis, wound dehiscence, postponed recovery and delayed adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Electrocautery has been widely used for resection purposes in breast surgery, as it significantly reduces blood loss compared with conventional scalpel use; nevertheless, the use of electrocautery may increase the occurrence of seroma following modified radical mastectomy (MRM), as it causes thermal tissue damage in the skin flaps, leading to local inflammatory reaction, subdermal vascular plexus disruption, and incomplete lymphatic and vascular occlusion; these complications often contribute to a higher seroma morbidity rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Ultrasonic wave technology enables blood vessels less than 5&#x000a0;mm in diameter to be sealed in the coagulation mode and has the ability to dissect and create flaps with minimal extensive thermal damage that will not exceed 1.5&#x000a0;mm, making ultrasound dissection devices preferred by many surgeons as harmonic scalpels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The harmonic scalpel has been extensively used in laparoscopic surgery for surgical dissection based on findings from its use in open surgery, namely, that it can significantly reduce blood loss and operative time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Compared with electrocautery, harmonic dissection has several advantages, including less scar formation compared with blades, the narrow circumference of collateral thermal damage to encircling tissue, the lack of smoke (although there is a transient mist), the lack of injury or excitement to motor nerves in the axilla, and the ability to utilize the technique in patients with pacemakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the harmonic focus scalpel versus electrocautery in reducing seroma formation post-MRM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par17">This study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial that took place at the Surgical Oncology Unit of the Department of Surgery, Suez Canal University Hospital, from 26th April 2014 to 30th June 2016 comparing the clinical outcomes of using harmonic dissection technique using Ethicon Generator G11 and harmonic focus handle (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., NJ, USA) versus electrocautery technique.

Upper and lower skin flaps were raised, and the breast tissue with the pectoral fascia was reflected off the pectoralis major muscle using electrocautery or the harmonic dissection technique according to the randomization. The clavipectoral fascia was opened, and the medial and lateral borders of the pectoralis minor were defined. The pectoralis minor muscle was retracted, and the axilla was exposed. The axillary vein was identified, and all its small tributaries were dissected. Axillary lymph node dissection was initiated from the lateral end of the vein. A plane of dissection was created along the inferior border of the axillary vein. The lymph nodes and blood vessels were dissected off the axillary vein towards the breast. The thoracodorsal bundle and the long thoracic, subscapular, medial and lateral anterior nerves were defined and protected. Level I and II axillary lymph node dissections were performed in all patients, and level III dissection was possibly included if the axillary lymph nodes were grossly involved. The previous dissection, lymph vessel sealing and haemostasis were performed using the harmonic device or electrocautery according to the randomization. The surgical field was douched with normal saline, and two 18-F suction drains were inserted: one in the axilla and the other under the skin flaps.

Electrocautery has been widely used for dissection purposes in breast surgery because it significantly reduces blood loss compared with conventional scalpel use; nevertheless, the use of electrocautery may increase the occurrence of seroma following MRM.</p><p id="Par44">The harmonic dissection technique is currently emerging as an alternative surgical tool for dissection and haemostasis and is thought to reduce morbidities such as seroma and blood loss. Compared with electrocautery, harmonic dissection has several advantages, including lack of scar formation, narrow circumference of collateral thermal damage to encircling tissue, lack of smoke (although there is a transient mist), lack of injury or excitement to motor nerves in the axilla, and ability to utilize the technique in patients with pacemakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Generally, the use of harmonic dissection has proven beneficial in a variety of surgeries; however, its role in breast surgery remains controversial.</p><p id="Par45">Operative time appears longer with the harmonic dissection technique than that with electrocautery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our study, the operative time required for MRM and axillary dissection was significantly longer in patients operated on by the harmonic scalpel compared with electrocautery (2.63&#x000a0;h vs. 1.75&#x000a0;h, respectively). These results are consistent with those of a study conducted by Abul Nagah et al. in Egypt in forty patients with operable breast cancer who reported that the operative time was longer in their first group to undergo surgery using the harmonic scalpel because it was a new dissection device and required an adaptation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Deo et al. in Singapore, also found that the mean operative time was longer in the harmonic scalpel patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, our results contrast with those of a study conducted by Khater in Egypt in sixty females undergoing MRM using the harmonic scalpel or electrocautery, which showed no significant difference between the two groups regarding operative time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

These results can be explained by the ability of the harmonic technique dissection to provide better haemostasis with less lateral thermal injury; thus, undesirable extra injury is avoided when the harmonic technique dissection is used. Moreover, the inflammatory reaction in the operative field is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; fewer lymphatic vessels are injured, with proper sealing for injured lymphatic vessels; and fewer oozing surfaces are produced in the operative field. Together, these factors reduce the postoperative drainage volume and, consequently, may reduce the postoperative hospital stay. Our results are similar to those reported by Abul Nagah et al. who stated that the mean total drainage volume in their harmonic group was significantly lower than that in their electrocautery group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Similar results were reported by Anlar et al.

Our study reported a lower incidence of axillary seroma in harmonic dissection compared with electrocautery in one breast surgery procedure, MRM, and we did not study its benefit in other breast procedures, such as conservative breast surgery and simple mastectomy, because mastectomy is preferred over breast conservation in our country due to the presence of advanced disease at the time of presentation and a lack of resources for long-term follow-up after conservative breast surgery. In addition, the sample size was not sufficiently large to validate these findings; therefore, we recommend a further multicentre trial that includes a larger sample and multiple procedures to compare subtle differences between individual complications, which would broaden the generalizability of the results. Estimating intraoperative blood loss can be a difficult task, especially when blood is mostly absorbed by gauze. Bleeding from both groups was not clinically significant and the method used in our study to estimate bleeding amount was the best way to estimate bleeding as it is much criticized because the towels absorb fluids as a false estimate of amount of bleeding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">In summary, harmonic dissection leads to significant decreases in intraoperative blood loss, total drainage volume and postoperative discomfort. Additionally, harmonic dissection results in a shorter duration before drain removal and a decreased incidence of seroma formation, with a minimal increase in the operative time. Because these are important postoperative care factors, we recommend the harmonic dissection technique for use in MRM.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AJJC</term><def><p id="Par5">American joint committee on cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARR</term><def><p id="Par6">Adjusted relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par7">Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par8">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRR</term><def><p id="Par9">Crude relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRM</term><def><p id="Par10">Modified radical Mastectomy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p id="Par11">Ultrasound</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Pablo Priego from the Department of Surgery, Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, for his support and guidance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par56">No funding resources were used.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par57">The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p><p id="Par58">All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary information files].</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MF carried out the surgical procedures, conceived the study, participated in the study design and the sequence alignment, and drafted the manuscript.
