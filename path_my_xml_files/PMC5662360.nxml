Furthermore, pain, joint contracture, and discomfort exerting by the upper limbs dyskinesia results in limb disuse and hinders the long-term functional recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> As much as 80% stroke patients have upper extremities hypokinesia in the acute phase and only 5% to 20% patients can recover upper extremities function even if accepting rehabilitation therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Hence, it is urgent to find effective ways to improve recovery efficacy in cerebral infarction patients, especially in the acute phase.</p><p>Mirror neuron system (MNS) is a new recovery strategy for upper extremities in cerebral infarction patients. When patients are observing or imitating other's movements, the same neuron system, as their own movements, can be activated in some degrees. Since the discovery of MNS, it has been used in motion and understanding of the behavior intention, speech, empathy, and social interaction.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> The physical therapy intervention has been implemented based on the neural system in cerebral infarction patients because the physical functions such as cognitive, perceptive, visual, and emotional has been damaged in cerebral infarction patients. Relative study<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> has demonstrated mirror neurons were activated in monkeys&#x02019; cerebral cortex, which promoted the current treatments of many diseases with the mirror therapy. Burns<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> applied motor acts observation in rehabilitation recovery of stroke patients and found that it could accelerate the return to functional activities. However, the mechanism of how MSN improves the movement function of cerebral infarction patients has not been well revealed.</p><p>Previous studies have pointed out a relationship between motor evoked potential (MEP) and functional rehabilitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Based on the aforesaid facts, we deduced that MSN may improve recovery efficacy in cerebral infarction patients through mediating MEP. Hence, based on the theory of mirror neurons, this study applied action observation therapy to stimulate the rebuilding of the movement function of upper extremities and activities of daily living in cerebral infarction patients and determined the change of brain excitability using motion evoked potential.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>Stroke patients who were hospitalized in Zhejiang Jiaxing Second Hospital Rehabilitation Center between June 2014 and September 2016 were recruited in this study. Eligible patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: conform to cerebral infarction diagnostic criteria formulated by Chinese Society of Neurology, Chinese Medical Association; unilateral hemiplegia; first-episode of cerebral infarction determined by CT and MRI; stable vital signs; disease course of 2 to 6 months; age of 40 to 75 years; mini-mental state examination (MME) score &#x02265;27 and treatment instructions can be performed; Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) score &#x02265;20 for upper extremity motor function; binocular vision or corrected visual acuity &#x02265;1.0; everyday treatment can be tolerant; and providing informed consent and willingness to participate in the study. Some patients were excluded if they had cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, venous sinus thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, and progressive or reversible ischemic cerebral apoplexy; lesions located in bilateral cerebral hemisphere, cerebellum, or brain stem; joint and other diseases affecting patients sitting or activity; heart, lung, liver, kidney, and other serious diseases; metal implantation in the body; a history of epilepsy; and skull defect.

In addition, traditional rehabilitation treatment such as Bobath, Brunnstrom, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, and daily activity ability training were also used in 2 groups. Patients in experimental group received additional action observation treatment which was carried on 6&#x0200a;d/w, 1&#x0200a;time/d and 20&#x0200a;min/time, including watching action video for 10&#x0200a;minutes and imitating 10&#x0200a;minutes. Action observation therapy was performed as follows (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>): Participants sat before a 42-in color TV with a distance of 2 m and lay their hemiplegia side arm on the table. Participants were requested to watch upper limbs motion video and informed to imitate the action in the video. There were 30 actions in the video, including shoulder joint, elbow joint, wrist joints, forearm, and hand movements in all directions. All the action was recorded by the same model and every action was filmed from 2 different angles for 50 seconds. The action was numbered according to their complexity. No. 1 is the easiest and No. 30 is the most difficult. The action with the similar complexity was set as a group. Action No. 1 to No. 6 was named as group 1. The rest can be done in the same manner. Participants watched the video from group 1 and then imitated the action. If they cannot complete, they would continue to watch the same video and imitate. If not, they would watch the video and imitate in the next group. This treatment lasted 8 weeks. Patients in control group watched different geometric patterns and digit symbol, and did the action picked from the following 30 actions in the video 6&#x0200a;d/w, 1&#x0200a;time/d, and 20&#x0200a;min/time.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Action observation therapies for participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e8080-g002"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Assessment methods</title><p>FMA, Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) were used to assess the motor function and the ability of daily living activities before and after 8 weeks of treatment. FMA items include shoulder, elbow, wrist flexion and extension cooperative movement, wrist joint stability, coordination ability, and speed of small joint movement (such as hand grip and finger side pinched). The assessment was divided into 10 categories and 33 events.

The determination progress was as follows: cerebral cortex M1 area and seventh cervical spinous process was selected as stimulation point. A stimulation intensity of 120% threshold was given to the stimulation point. Five waves with good repeatability and big amplitude were selected to calculate the MEP latency, amplitude, and center-motion conduction time (CMCT). MEP latency is the delay between the onset of stimulation on affected side cortexes M1 phase and the initiation of the MEP in contralateral thumb short abductor muscle. MEP amplitude means potential difference between the highest and lowest motion evoked potential. CMCT indicate the difference between cortexes latency and spinal latency. All these assessments were made by 2 trained professional therapists and the whole process was recorded. Subsequently, the average score from another 2 trained professional therapists was used to be analyzed.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

In this study, we found that a combination of MSN and traditional rehabilitation therapy could significantly elevate extremity motor function in subacute stroke patients and improve the MEP.</p><p>Action observation therapy has been demonstrated to elevate the upper extremity motor function in chronic stroke patients in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> For example, Ertelt<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> applied action observation therapy to cure 8 chronic stroke patients for 4 weeks. The results showed upper extremity motor function was improved remarkably. Through functional magnetic resonance imaging, they found bilateral ventral premotor cortex, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, the supplementary motor area (SMA), and the contralateral supramarginal gyrus were elevated in experimental group than that in control group. Furthermore, action observation therapy also has a positive effect on walking and language ability.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> studied the relative alpha power and relative beta power change after action observation and the motor imagery training. They found action observation induces stronger cognitive activity. Mattia<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and Liepert<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> determined the effects of action observation on damaged motor circuits induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the results indicate action observation might have a positive influence on the recovery of motor functions after acute and chronic stroke.</p><p>With the rapid development of magnetic stimulation technology, the determination of MEP induced by TMS has been a popular method to judge the change of central nervous system plasticity of rehabilitation therapy in stroke patients. MEP abnormal mainly depends on the corticospinal tract conduction function of movement.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> It is closely related to the degree of patients&#x02019; paralysis. MEP latency reflects the transmission from cortex to muscle and the integrity of the conductive pathway.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> CMCT reflects the function of upper motor neuron and motor neuron. In this study, MEP latency and CMCT reflects had no significant difference between 3 groups without intervention. However, MEP latency was improved and CMCT was shortening significantly compared with pretreatment after intervention. Meantime, the experimental groups were superior to the control group. These results indicated action observation therapy could improve motor nerve excitability. In addition, we found a negative relationship between FMA scores and MEP latency and CMCT, and a positive relationship between FMA scores and MEP amplitude. These results also demonstrate MEP could be used to assess upper limb movement. In this study, we applied FMA, WMFT, MBI, and MEP to evaluate the upper limb movement function and daily life activity in patients with cerebral infarction. This method is widely used in assessment of movement function in stroke patients, and its test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability has been investigated. We found motor observation treatment based on mirror neurons theory improves the upper limb movement function and daily life activities in patients with cerebral infarction.</p><p>Mirror neurons theory has been seen as the theoretical basis of motor observation therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Mirror neurons refer to the neurons that encode an action is activated in the observer's cortical motor system when an individual observes another individual performing an action.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> There is a correlation between different mirror neurons. These mirror neurons which have correlation were named as mirror neuron system (MNS). Iacoboni et al<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> found mirror neurons excitability was elevated when participant imitates a finger movement after observing. Buccino<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> also acquired the similar conclusion. Musically naive participants&#x02019; mirror neurons became active during the observation and imitation of the guitar chords. The excitability of premotor cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex contralateral were affected after receiving motor rehabilitation therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup></p><p>The findings suggest that mirror neurons theory could be used in rehabilitation therapy on stroke patients. Through watching and imitating action, the MNS could be activated which could promote the patients to acquire new motor skills. For stroke patients with hemiplegia, by observing the upcoming training movement, mirror neurons which control the same action could be activated and its excitability could be increased. The ability of mirror neurons to complete the training was therefore improved. So learning by imitating can improve the motor function. This study found combination of motor observation and traditional upper limb rehabilitation strategy could effectively improve the upper limb movement function in subacute stroke patients. Meantime, it also indicates that motor observation is an effective way to elevate human motor function. We deduced that MNS is the main mechanism for improving limb movement function in subacute stroke patients.</p><p>This study was aimed at cerebral infarction patients in subacute seizure phase with upper limb dysfunction and made a combination of motion observation and traditional upper limb rehabilitation treatment technology. The results showed that this strategy can significantly elevate the movement function of cerebral infarction patients in subacute seizure phase with upper limb dysfunction, which expanded the application range of motion observation therapy and provided an effective therapy strategy for upper extremities hemiplegia in stroke patients. However, this experiment was restricted by the amount of samples and a further supplement was needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CMCT = center-motion conduction time, FMA = Fugl-Meyer assessment, MBI = Modified Barthel Index, MEP = motor evoked potential, MNS = mirror neuron system, TMS = transcranial magnetic stimulation, WMFT = Wolf Motor Function Test.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The study was supported by Science and Technology Planning Project of Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, Project No. 2014AY21031-9; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Project No. 81201504; and General plan for medical and health research in Zhejiang Province, Project No. 2014KYA212.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cirstea</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group>
