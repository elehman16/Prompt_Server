Introduction</title><p>Studies of cognitive rehabilitation for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have seen exponential growth over the last decade. Most of these studies have sought to determine the utility of either therapist or computer-based interventions for treating memory loss. However, there has been virtually no research into the comparative effectiveness of various cognitive rehabilitation strategies.</p><p>The focus in rehabilitation can be to improve the impaired ability itself (remediation), to learn methods to adapt to the changed ability without attempting to improve the ability itself (compensation), or both simultaneously. The computerized brain training industry has sought to largely fill the space for remediation of cognitive loss in aging and MCI. However, warnings of overstated claims of proof of cognitive improvement from the computerized brain training industry highlight the need for more research into this area [<xref rid="B1-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In terms of cognitive impact, computerized interventions may have a positive impact on measures of attention, executive function, and memory in the limited number of MCI-based studies available [<xref rid="B2-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In terms of transfer to everyday life, computerized studies may benefit mood (depression, anxiety, and apathy) compared to controls [<xref rid="B3-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, a recent meta-analysis showed no impact of computerized interventions on activities of daily living (ADLs) or quality of life [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>Compensation for cognitive loss in MCI is usually taught through therapist-based training in which the patient is taught strategies such as mnemonic techniques or an adaptive system of taking notes or keeping calendars or lists. Studies to date suggest these types of interventions can positively impact one&#x02019;s self beliefs and confidence about memory functioning and improve ADLs, but there is little evidence of benefit to mood or quality of life [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This prior work suggests that computerized remediation and compensation-based interventions may have different outcomes in daily life functioning for individuals with MCI. </p><p>Our study sought to examine the impact of a computerized cognitive intervention program aimed towards older individuals (Brain Fitness (BF); Posit Science Corporation) to a calendar compensation training program (Memory Support System (MSS)) through a randomized trial. Using this particular computer program, researchers have reported that healthy participants and participants with amnestic MCI who trained on BF showed improvement in cognitive functions (overall <italic>d</italic> = 0.33), particularly in working memory and processing speed [<xref rid="B6-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but little was done to assess daily life impact. A previous study of the MSS calendar and notebook strategy found significant effect sizes on memory-based activities of daily living (mADLs) at the end of training (<italic>d</italic> = 1.0) and at 2- (<italic>d</italic> = 0.88) and 6-month follow-up (<italic>d</italic> = 0.56) compared to no-treatment controls [<xref rid="B8-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>The current study was a pilot intervention that sought to examine the relative efficacy of the calendar and computer interventions, and the effect sizes of these interventions for necessary sample sizes in future effectiveness trials was estimated. We hypothesized that the MSS compensatory training would have a greater positive impact on mADLs and memory self-efficacy than the BF program. The compensatory MSS training is meant to teach strategies to directly impact daily functioning, while the restorative BF program is meant to improve the abilities themselves without prior evidence of transfer to daily life. We report the findings of the comparative effect sizes on functional ability, cognitive functioning, and self-efficacy in individuals with amnestic MCI. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-brainsci-07-00112" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Consecutive patients with single or multiple-domain, amnestic MCI from the neurology and neuropsychology clinics across 3 major medical centers (Emory University and the Minnesota and Arizona campuses of Mayo Clinic) were asked to take part in a study comparing the use of a calendar and note-taking system to a cognitive training computer program. Participants were diagnosed with either a single or multiple-domain amnestic MCI [<xref rid="B9-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as these subtypes of MCI are thought to represent individuals with a high likelihood of eventual progression to dementia [<xref rid="B10-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All participants gave their informed consent for inclusion before they engaged in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Emory University and Mayo Clinic. Participants met the following inclusion criteria: (1) had a study partner (as this is a required component of the MSS training as described below); (2) obtained a Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) [<xref rid="B11-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] score of 115 or higher; (3) obtained a Functional Assessment Questionnaire [<xref rid="B12-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] score lower than 6; (4) the partner had a Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) [<xref rid="B13-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] score higher than 24; and (5) was not using nootropic medications or had been stable for at least 3 months. Participants were excluded if they had a visual or hearing impairment or reading or writing disability sufficient to interfere with training or severe depression as defined by Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression (CES-D) [<xref rid="B14-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] of 21 or higher. </p><p>Two hundred individuals and their study partners were contacted across the 3 recruitment sites for possible enrollment in the study, and 126 declined enrollment (37% recruitment). After excluding those who did not meet eligibility criteria, 64 of the 200 individuals originally contacted were enrolled. Enrollment and retention have been further detailed in a separate publication [<xref rid="B15-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.2. Control Group</title><p>Comparisons were made to a standard care control group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) collected using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. This sample was collected at Emory University only. This group was previously utilized in a separate calendar training study examining the efficacy of MSS training to a no-treatment control group [<xref rid="B8-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.3. Intervention</title><p>Participants with MCI were randomized to either computer (BF) or calendar (MSS) training using computer-generated randomization assignment. At enrollment, all participants were given the calendar and notebook and briefly instructed to &#x0201c;begin using the calendar to help with your memory.&#x0201d; At the start of their training program (7&#x02013;10 days after enrollment), baseline use of the calendar was assessed, and MSS training participants began training. BF participants instead performed the cognitive exercises from the computer software and received no MSS training. All participants completed 10 h of each intervention with the therapists at the medical center. Both groups participated in an on-site education hour each day in addition to either the MSS or BF training. The education component was an adaptation and synthesis of the Savvy Caregiver psychoeducational program [<xref rid="B16-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the Memory Club educational program [<xref rid="B17-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><sec id="sec2dot3dot1-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.3.1. MSS Calendar Training</title><p>The MSS is made up of the following 3 sections: (1) appointments, (2) items to be done, and (3) a notes section. In the appointment and items to be done sections, participants write things that need to be done either at a specific time or in a to-do list if not due at a certain time. The notes section allows participants to record meaningful information from that day, such as an interesting discussion or thoughts on a day&#x02019;s event. MSS trainers provide participants with MCI and their study partner with training sessions following a structured curriculum of orientation, modeling, practice, and homework assignments. Program partners learn the intervention alongside the trainer so that they can reinforce proper use of the MSS outside of therapy sessions. Sessions follow a training manual, which is detailed in a previous publication [<xref rid="B8-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3dot2-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.3.2. BF Computer Training</title><p>The BF computer training group utilized software from the Posit Science Corporation that was built on the principles of brain plasticity and designed for use by older individuals. The BF training program focuses on speech reception to strengthen an individual&#x02019;s auditory memory. It is an adaptive program that adjusts to the individual&#x02019;s performance. The specific &#x0201c;Auditory Brain Training&#x0201d; software used in this study has 6 modules that build upon each other in complexity that require participants to perform exercises to recognize sounds, tell similar sounds apart, match or repeat sounds, remember increasingly difficult directions, and remember details from stories. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.4. Outcome Measures</title><p>Participants and their study partners completed measures of global cognitive status, mADLs, and self-efficacy at baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-ups.

Our study focused on the 8-item Memory subscale as a measure of mADLs. Each item was scored 1 to 4 points, with lower total scores suggesting more intact daily functioning. The informant was the program partner. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4dot3-brainsci-07-00112"><title>2.4.3.

Specific items focused on confidence in managing activities, tasks, and emotional distress caused by MCI; in medication management, chores, and errand ability; and in maintaining hobbies and relationships.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4dot1-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.1. Findings</title><p>Training in the use of the MSS calendar improved mADLs relative to standard care controls, while BF computerized training did not. This is similar to what was found in a recent meta-analysis, suggesting that, while computerized programs may impact cognition and anxiety and not ADLs, compensatory-based programs working with a therapist have more everyday impact on daily life function [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Herein, we report effect sizes for several other comparisons that suggest that larger samples would be needed to attain significance in future studies. Based on the effect size estimates, larger sample sizes might support statistically significant differences, including the fact that MSS is superior to BF, which in turn is superior to controls for positively impacting mADLs, and memory-related self-efficacy may be improved and retained for up to 6 months for the MSS, but not a BF program. </p><p>While initial improvement may occur in mADLs and self-efficacy, these benefits recede over time. Future studies may examine whether cognitive interventions, while not supporting continued gains over baseline, actually help with maintenance of functional ability and self-efficacy over time compared to progression or decline in controls. Additionally, future studies should look at how boosting ongoing practice of interventions may lead to more long-term maintenance of the initial gains. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.2. Challenges</title><sec id="sec4dot2dot1-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.2.1. Impact of Small Sample Sizes</title><p>Repeatedly in the literature involving nonpharmacologic interventions in MCI, a small sample size is highlighted as a limitation (e.g., [<xref rid="B22-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). This is indeed a weakness of this field, and when small samples are combined with the lack of a control group (another frequent limitation), the published findings often fail to show statistical significance and may be of dubious value. The aims of this pilot study were to provide effect and sample size estimates to determine necessary sample sizes for future studies. However, sample sizes for this pilot are larger than many past efficacy studies in the field of nonpharmacologic interventions for MCI. We think it is timely to highlight necessary sample sizes for studies in this area. We would like to emphasize that studies, though well-designed, are often too small to produce significant results. To date, few studies of behavioral interventions in MCI include the 50+ patients in each arm that our results suggest are necessary to attain significance. Admittedly, the need for larger samples relates to the probability that the effect sizes produced by these interventions are modest. However, such modest effects may still be clinically meaningful [<xref rid="B5-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that with multiple interventions, a large number of participants will be required to show significance. We have illustrated in our study that with a small number of participants, potentially meaningful results could have been lost due to lack of significance, even with moderate to large effect sizes. Given that few studies of behavioral interventions in MCI include the 50 or more participants in each arm that our results suggest are necessary to attain significance, efforts are needed to increase the power (i.e., n), including better-funded, large-scale, multi-site trials. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot2-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.2.2. Impact of the Heterogeneity of MCI Diagnosis</title><p>MCI is a diagnostic syndrome that is composed of multiple possible underlying pathologies [<xref rid="B23-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As such, it is likely that the impact of the computer or calendar interventions may differ depending upon the underlying etiology of the MCI diagnosis. We do not have that data for this study. Ideally, cognitive rehabilitation interventions are geared specifically towards the condition and strengths and weaknesses of the individual [<xref rid="B24-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Future research will be needed to define what characteristics of individuals (including underlying etiology for their MCI) relate to the best &#x0201c;active ingredients&#x0201d; of cognitive intervention(s) for a specific person. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot3-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.2.3. Impact of Providing Education</title><p>We provided both groups education about MCI in order to help control treatment diffusion in this domain as many individuals with MCI are seeking information through seminars, web searches, and local community events. Therefore, it is not possible to know how much of the shared improvement between the MSS and BF training was related to the education received by all participants in this study. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2dot4-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.2.4. Impact of Subjective Report Measures</title><p>Our measures of functional change and self-efficacy are subjective reports of performance, with functional ability reported by the care partner and sense of self-efficacy reported by the patient. While the informant report on the ECOG is a proxy for mADLs, these reports may not capture exact functional ability. Both self and informant reports are at risk in outcome studies of bias due to a possible desire to please the evaluator. However, informant and self-reported measures of activities of daily living remain the primary tools for the detection of change in functional ability in MCI in the field, and can be more sensitive than cognitive testing towards predicting progression of disease [<xref rid="B25-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As each treatment arm in the current study completed these measures pre- and post-intervention, we attempted to minimize any positive bias in outcome reporting that would have been more prevalent in examining a single intervention arm. </p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-brainsci-07-00112"><title>4.3. Further Clinical Implications</title><p>In past studies, we have demonstrated that use of a calendar is dependent upon having training in the calendar [<xref rid="B8-brainsci-07-00112" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Individuals with MCI do not use a calendar (even when given the calendar to use) with only a recommendation. The present study helps further support these findings, as individuals in the BF group were given a calendar, encouraged to use it, and knew that the other group (whom they joined for education classes) were trained to do so. While most individuals in the BF training group brought their calendars daily along with their general study information packets, they failed to use them. Thus, recommending a calendar is not sufficient for an individual with MCI, and as providers, we need to keep this under consideration with our patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-brainsci-07-00112"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Calendar training may be more effective in improving mADLs and sense of self-efficacy than computerized intervention. However, this pilot study highlights how behavioral trials with fewer than 30&#x02013;50 participants per arm are likely underpowered. As a result, modest, but still potentially beneficial interventions may be dismissed as null findings. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Nursing Research, NR012419, with further support from the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association, NIRG-07-58843, the Emory Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Research Center, AG025688, and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI-CER-1306-01897.
