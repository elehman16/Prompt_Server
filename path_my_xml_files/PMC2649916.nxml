The vast majority consists of non-specific back and neck pain (BNP) that requires no specific surgical, rheumatological or neurological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>As 93% of the societal costs of back and neck pain are connected with sick-listing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], return-to-work is crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, there is a lack of consistency and comprehensiveness in return-to-work measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While earlier studies compared the return-to-work share at a specific time point, for example one year after baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], later research has evaluated the time of return-to-work in survival analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Another important issue is the health-care utilization needed to achieve certain treatment results. In that respect, a frequently-used outcome measure is the number of health-care visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Concerning treatment of BNP, the 1990s saw a breakthrough for the biopsychosocial model, which pinpoints time off work as an important disabling factor. Acute, subacute and chronic BNP are defined as BNP with full-time sick-listing for 0 &#x02013; 21 days, 22 &#x02013; 84 days and more than 12 weeks, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Acute BNP is managed by continuing ordinary activities as normally as possible, and manipulation if necessary. In cases of subacute and chronic BNP, multidisciplinary rehabilitation should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Multidisciplinary treatment includes a physician's consultation in addition to psychological, social or vocational intervention or a combination of these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The three key components of successful multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes for BNP are: reactivation and progressive increase in activity levels, addressing dysfunctional beliefs and behaviour by a cognitive-behavioural therapeutic approach, and occupational interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Concerning back pain, programmes including these items have shown good results in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Randomized controlled trials have concerned patients with subacute back pain only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], mixed groups with subacute or chronic back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or patients with chronic back pain only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is a serious lack of evidence concerning the rehabilitation of neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We have found no randomized controlled trial in which the same programme was offered to patients who were stratified by subacute and chronic BNP.</p><p>The high frequency of relapses after rehabilitation of BNP is associated with inadequate follow-ups. A short program might fail to achieve long-standing behavioural changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the 1990s the vast majority of rehabilitation programs in Sweden were comparatively short, with a fixed duration averaging six weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Primary care is the appropriate source of treatment for BNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In Sweden, however, notwithstanding clinical guidelines, only a small minority of individuals with subacute and chronic BNP receive multidisciplinary rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One reason might be the relative lack of family doctors. While the total number of Swedish physicians meets international standards, there are proportionately fewer physicians within primary care: the density of family doctors is .5 per 1000 population, compared with an OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) average of .8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our project started in 2000 with the aim of comparing a multidisciplinary programme of cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation for subacute and chronic BNP with primary care. The specific aim of this study was to answer the question: within an 18-month follow-up, will the outcomes differ in terms of sick-listing and number of health-care visits?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sick-listing in Sweden</title><p>In Sweden, publicly provided, tax-financed social insurance compensates loss of income due to illness. The ultimate decisions about sick-listing benefits, including sickness benefit, rehabilitation benefit, temporary disability pension and disability pension, are made by the Social Insurance Agency. For sick-listing exceeding seven calendar days, a physician's certificate is required. The certificate comprises a detailed description of symptoms and signs and a recommendation of the degree (.25, .50, .75 or 1.00 (= full-time)) and duration of sick-listing.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The rehabilitation centre of this study was situated at Haninge, a municipality 25 kilometres south-east of Stockholm city. As the centre was well known to the local residents, the study participants were recruited within the primary care of the adjoining municipalities. One-hundred-and-twenty five patients were recruited by 42 family doctors at 12 health centres.</p><p><italic>The criteria for inclusion: </italic>1. Working age up to and including 59 years. 2. Sick-listed full-time for BNP at least six weeks (42 days) and at most two years (730 days). 3. Able to fill in forms. <italic>The criteria for exclusion: </italic>1. Temporary disability pension or disability pension being paid or in preparation. 2. A primary need for a hospital specialist (for example, operation for slipped disc). 3. Pregnancy and diseases (other than BNP) that might make rehabilitation impracticable (for example, advanced pulmonary disease). 4. Whiplash-associated disorders as a primary obstacle to working. 5. Previous rehabilitation at the rehabilitation centre. 6. Other multidisciplinary rehabilitation current or planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>One treatment group was allocated to cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation at the rehabilitation centre (rehabilitation group). The other treatment group was allocated to continued primary care (primary-care group).</p><sec><title>Cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation</title><p>The rehabilitation centre was opened in 1991 within Stockholm County Council. From 2002 it operated as a private company and the number of rehabilitation teams was decreased from four to one, comprising four team members: a physician (OL), a physiotherapist trained in manual therapy, a psychologist or a social worker trained in cognitive-behavioural therapy and a health-care adviser. Manual therapy includes manipulation, mobilisation and stabilizing training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The centre used a cognitive-behavioural programme with the aim of achieving the maximal degree of work ability lasting for at least 30 consecutive days. Work ability was inversely proportional to sick-listing, which is the definition used by the Social Insurance Agency. Work abilities of 1.00 (= full-time), .75, .50 and .25 corresponded to sick-listings of 0, .25, .50 and .75, respectively. Zero work ability equalled full-time sick-listing. Possible relapses were met by individual and, when needed, long rehabilitation periods.

Data concerning the rehabilitation centre were collected from the medical records of the centre. Primary care and other health-care data were obtained from follow-up forms.

In this retrospective study, 172 consecutive patients with subacute and chronic BNP, who completed rehabilitation at the centre during the period 1996 &#x02013; 2000, were included. The mean rehabilitation period was 266 (SD &#x000b1; 170) days. The <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>was 76%; for subacute and chronic BNP 89% and 73%, respectively (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; .05). The power calculation was based on this preliminary study and a forecast of the probability of return-to-work after traditional care for BNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The forecast probability for the patients in the preliminary study was calculated from their current sick-listing at baseline. It proved to be 49%, i.e. 27 percentage units less than the actual rate of 76%. Including an uncertainty about the application of this forecast to our patient sample, we expected to reach a difference between the rehabilitation group and the primary-care group of at least 22 percentage units. With an alpha of .05 and a power of 80%, this should require the inclusion of 154 patients; or, to allow a reasonable dropout rate, 170 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion procedure</title><p>For the patients who fulfilled the criteria, the family doctor gave verbal and written information about the project. Each patient who gave his or her oral consent to participate to the family doctor was interviewed by telephone by a research assistant within two days. The patients who still qualified for the study saw the assistant at the health centre within five days. At the appointment, the patient signed an informed consent to participate and went through an initial form including, among other items, the baseline characteristics in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.

This differed only marginally from the intention-to-treat analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized controlled trial concerned primary-care patients with subacute and chronic BNP. A programme of cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation was compared with continued primary care. The results were equivalent over 18 months. However, analyses of the three component six-month periods indicated that the rehabilitation programme might be superior to primary care in the longer run, especially for subacute patients.</p><sec><title>Sick-listing</title><p>Why was the <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>substantially lower than expected for the rehabilitation group and higher than expected for the primary-care group? According to Englund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], sick-listing in Swedish primary care might depend more on the patient's wishes than on guidelines: even when the family doctor did not recommend sick-listing, a certificate was issued in 87% of cases. In view of this, what explains the substantial underestimation of the <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>for the primary-care group (49% vs. the actual share of 57%)? One explanation might be a project that was initiated by the Swedish government in 2002 to halve the extent of sick-listing by 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The focus has been on applying more restrictions in the social insurance system, including failing an increasing number of sick-listing certificates, while the resources for multidisciplinary rehabilitation have been even scarcer than before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Anyhow, the low <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>in the rehabilitation group was disappointing, and even if the primary-care group had shown as low a <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>as predicted, the difference between the groups would have remained non-significant.</p><p>However, when subacute and chronic patients were analysed separately, a different picture emerged: the <italic>Return-to-work share </italic>for the subacute rehabilitation-group patients was as expected, but the share for the chronic rehabilitation-group patients was far lower. The significantly better <italic>Return-to-work chance </italic>at 18 months and the more rapid reduction in <italic>Net days </italic>among the subacute rehabilitation-group patients highlighted this. Previous research supports the view that cognitive-behavioural interventions at an early stage of disabling BNP can prevent long-term disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], while the effect on sick-listing is more doubtful for chronic back pain. Schonstein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] concluded that physical conditioning programs with a cognitive-behavioural and work-related approach reduced sick-listing, whereas another Cochrane review revealed that behavioural-rehabilitation programmes had no better effect on sick-listing for chronic back pain than active conservative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>What components of our programme could explain its possible superiority in the long run for subacute patients? Previous research on graded activity had an occupational-care setting and concerned subacute patients only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Two earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] found that graded activity in multidisciplinary contexts decreases sick-listing. Two later studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] contradicted that. Steenstra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found that workplace interventions alone reduced sick-listing, while graded activity alone or in combination with workplace interventions did not. One explanation might be that the earlier studies were performed in specialised in-company clinics by a limited number of physiotherapists, including some of the researchers, while the study by Steenstra et al. also included out-company clinics with many physiotherapists who had received additional training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These six-month results were confirmed at a 12-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Heymans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] found that standard care plus a low-intensity back school of eight hours was superior to standard care alone, while standard care plus a high-intensity graded-activity-like back school tended to be inferior. The follow-up period of those later studies did not exceed 12 months. In our study, however, the better sick-listing trend for the subacute rehabilitation-group patients was not obvious until after 12 months. Thus, the possibility that a longer period of graded activity has a positive effect on sick-listing for subacute patients in a primary-care setting could not be excluded from those later studies. As to the rest of our specific cognitive-behavioural elements (therapy by a psychologist or a social worker and training in applied relaxation), earlier conclusive studies are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>Unlike previous research on graded activity, we also included chronic BNP. Most of the rehabilitation-group patients (43/63 (68%)) had a current sick-listing exceeding 12 weeks at baseline. Our programme did not reduce their sick-listing. Why? One reason could be its comparatively limited extent. Haldorsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that, for return-to-work, light multidisciplinary treatment was adequate for moderately-disabled but not for highly-disabled patients. For the latter group, extensive multidisciplinary treatment totalling 120 hours was required; the light programme was no better than standard care. Jensen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed that an extensive behavioural-rehabilitation programme (fully 120 hours) for long-term BNP in female patients reduced sick-listing while more limited efforts did not. Males, however, achieved no better results from the full-time programme than from a light programme or standard care. Quite recently, Staal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found that moderately disabled subjects benefited more from graded activity than those with higher disability scores. These studies indicate that return-to-work for patients with chronic BNP, if it is ever possible, requires a more extensive concept than our programme.</p><p>Another reason could be methodological defects. Graded activity <italic>by the book </italic>includes: two sessions/week over a maximum of 3&#x02013;6 months until lasting full-time return-to-work, an early agreement with the patient on a return-to-work date regardless of the actual pain on that particular day, and a hands-off approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As our patients were comparatively more disabled, we found it realistic to apply less frequent sessions to increase the likelihood of positive changes at the next session (there was also a lack of resources for more frequent sessions), no upper time limit (which is also in accordance with the original concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), the possibility of part-time return-to-work, an individual agreement about the return date (early in the rehabilitation period for some patients, later for others) and, when needed, manual therapy and cortisone injections early in the rehabilitation period (however, the hands-off approach was applied to most (46/61 (75%)) of our patients). Notwithstanding the logical reasons for most of our modifications, they might have contributed to the failure to decrease the sick-listing of the chronic patients. These discrepancies might also explain why the positive effect on the subacute rehabilitation-group patients was not seen until the third six-month period, while those patients had substantially more <italic>Net days </italic>during the first period. It has recently been pointed out that suboptimal rehabilitation items in the pre-phase of return-to-work entail the risk of a counterproductive effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Health-care visits</title><p>In total, the rehabilitation group had more consultations by a physician, which is more costly than other staff categories. However, the resources spent on the rehabilitation group in the first six-month period were balanced by fewer consultations in primary care and a trend towards fewer <italic>Visits </italic>in the long run. Also, although the differences were not significant, the rehabilitation group tended to experience less surgery and other multidisciplinary rehabilitation. For patients with subacute BNP, this agrees with Linton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whose cognitive-behavioural interventions were followed by a decrease in health-care utilization. For patients with chronic BNP, our findings are consistent with a large review showing that cognitive-behavioural programs have a substantial positive impact on psychological and medical function but only a small impact on sick-listing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths of the study</title><p>The design of our study, a randomized controlled trial, is the gold standard for evaluating treatment methods for back and neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The sick-listing data were complete. We also consider the health-care data to be acceptably representative. The response rate was higher than 80% except at 12 months, when it was nearly 80% for the primary-care group. Even when the missing data for the two deceased patients were included, the rehabilitation group met drop-out criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. For the primary-care group, <italic>Visits </italic>over 18 months should be interpreted with some caution as 32% were non-responders, but in other respects the follow-up rate of the primary-care group was also satisfactory. The non-responders in the rehabilitation group had characteristics that may have increased health-care use (longer sick-listing periods and higher unemployment). In the primary-care group the non-responders were younger, which could have decreased utilization, whereas the lower health-related quality of life could possibly increase utilization. However, for the great majority, there were no significant differences at baseline between the non-responders and responders.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The inclusion plan was not fulfilled. A possible consequence may have been that some differences between the groups could not be demonstrated. However, certain differences in favour of the rehabilitation group were clear with the number of patients actually included.</p><p>Comparison of health-care visits gives only a limited idea of cost effectiveness. A complete health-economic evaluation is planned in a future study, including a cost-benefit analysis in which the direct costs (mainly of the interventions themselves), the indirect costs (mainly of the sick-listing), and the health-related quality of life are compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>The primary outcome measure showed no difference. Notwithstanding the positive trends in favour of the rehabilitation group, especially for the subacute patients, <italic>Net days </italic>and <italic>Visits </italic>were also equivalent over 18 months. As differences in the results of various interventions tend to even out after 12 &#x02013; 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], more conclusive results might require a longer follow-up period than in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For patients with subacute and chronic BNP, cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation was compared with primary care. The results were equivalent over 18 months. However, there were indications that cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation in the longer run might be superior. For subacute BNP, it might be superior in terms of both sick-listing and health-care visits; for chronic BNP, in terms of health-care visits only. More conclusive results concerning this possible long-term effect might require a longer follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>OL was the main investigator, carried out the study, performed the analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
