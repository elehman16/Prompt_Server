AKI is associated with high mortality and cost of hospitalisation. Studies of treatments to reduce this high mortality have used differing renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities and have not shown improvement in the short term.

Chronic kidney disease (caused, for example, by diabetes) gradually destroys the kidneys' filtration units (the nephrons), eventually leading to life-threatening end-stage kidney disease. However, the kidneys can also stop working suddenly because of injury, infection, or poisoning. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is much more common than end-stage kidney disease and its incidence is increasing worldwide. In the US, for example, the number of hospitalizations that included an AKI diagnosis rose from 4,000 in 1996 to 23,000 in 2008. Moreover, nearly half of patients with AKI will die shortly after the condition develops. Symptoms of AKI include changes in urination, swollen feet and ankles, and tiredness. Treatments for AKI aim to prevent fluid and waste build up in the body and treat the underlying cause (e.g., severe infection or dehydration) while allowing the kidneys time to recover. In some patients, it is sufficient to limit the fluid intake and to reduce waste build-up by eating a diet that is low in protein, salt, and potassium. Other patients need renal replacement therapy (RRT), life-supporting treatments such as hemodialysis and hemofiltration, two processes that clean the blood by filtering it outside the body.</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The long-term outcomes of AKI (specifically, death and chronic kidney disease) and the effects of different RRT modalities on these outcomes are unclear. A recent controlled trial that randomly assigned patients with AKI who were managed in intensive care units (ICUs) to receive two different intensities of continuous hemodiafiltration (a combination of hemodialysis and hemofiltration) found no difference in all-cause mortality (death) at 90 days. Here, the researchers extend the follow-up of this trial (the Randomized Evaluation of Normal vs. Augmented Levels of renal replacement therapy [RENAL] study) to investigate longer-term mortality, the variables that predict mortality, treatment with long-term dialysis (an indicator of chronic kidney disease), and functional outcomes in patients with AKI treated with different intensities of continuous RRT.</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>For the Prolonged Outcomes Study of RENAL (POST-RENAL), the researchers extended the follow-up of the RENAL participants up to 4 years. Over an average follow-up of 43.9 months, 63% of patients in the lower intensity treatment group died compared to 62% of patients in the higher intensity group. Overall, a third of patients who survived to 90 days died during the extended follow-up. Among the survivors to day 90, 5.1% and 5.8% of patients in the lower and higher intensity groups, respectively, were treated with maintenance dialysis during the extended follow-up. Among survivors who consented to analysis, 40% and 44% of patients in the lower and higher intensity groups, respectively, had albuminuria (protein in the urine, an indicator of kidney damage). Patients in both groups had a similar quality life (determined through telephone interviews). Finally, increasing age, APACHE III score (a scoring system that predicts the survival of patients in ICU), and serum creatinine level (an indicator of kidney function) at randomization were all predictors of long-term mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that patients with AKI in ICUs who require RRT have a high long-term mortality. They show that few survivors require maintenance dialysis for chronic kidney disease but that there is a substantial rate of albuminuria among survivors despite relative preservation of kidney function. The findings also suggest that the intensity of RRT has no significant effect on mortality or the need for dialysis. Because these findings were obtained in a randomized controlled trial, they may not be generalizable to other patient populations. Moreover, although data on mortality and maintenance dialysis were available for all the trial participants, clinical and biochemical outcomes were only available for some participants and may not be representative of all the participants. Despite these study limitations, these findings suggest that survivors of AKI may be at a high risk of death or of developing chronic kidney disease. Survivors of AKI are, therefore, at high risk of further illness and long-term albuminuria reduction strategies may offer a therapeutic intervention for this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001601">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001601</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/index.aspx">US National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse</ext-link> provides information about the kidneys and about all aspects of kidney disease and its treatment; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nkdep.nih.gov/index.shtml">US National Kidney Disease Education Program</ext-link> provides resources to help improve the understanding, detection, and management of kidney disease (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Mayo Clinic provides information for patients about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kidney-failure/DS00280">acute kidney injury</ext-link>

In brief, it was a parallel group, open-label, randomized-controlled trial in 1,508 ICU patients with AKI requiring RRT from 35 centres in Australia and New Zealand between December 2005 and August 2008. Patients in ICU aged 18 or older, deemed by the treating clinician to require RRT and meeting at least one of the following criteria, were eligible for enrolment: oliguria (urine output &#x0003c; 100 ml in a 6-hour period) that was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, serum potassium exceeding 6.5 mmol per litre, severe acidaemia (pH&#x0003c;7.2), a plasma urea nitrogen above 25 mmol per litre (70 mg per decilitre), a serum creatinine concentration above 300 &#x000b5;mol per litre (3.4 mg per decilitre), or the presence of clinically significant organ oedema (e.g., pulmonary oedema). Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 ml/kg/h (lower intensity) or 40 ml/kg/h (higher intensity) of continuous haemodiafiltration and were followed to 90 days after randomization. Study treatment was ceased when any of five pre-defined criteria were met: withdrawal of consent, death, discharge from ICU, when intermittent dialysis was considered preferable to continuous RRT for the patient, or when the treating clinicians considered that RRT was no longer required.</p><p>The Prolonged Outcomes Study of RENAL (POST-RENAL) was an investigator-initiated, prospective, extended follow-up of the RENAL study, funded by a project grant from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The study was designed and managed by the study management committee and endorsed by the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group. The study protocol was approved by human research ethics committees at each of the participating centres and centrally by the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare Ethics Committee. Statistical analyses were conducted at the George Institute for Global Health.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Study Participants</title><p>All participants in the RENAL study were included in the primary and secondary outcomes of the POST-RENAL study. Tertiary outcomes were obtained in the subset of consenting survivors. Ethics committee approval granted a waiver of the requirement for individual consent to link to state and national registries, whereupon survivors were approached for written informed consent to participate in the collection of the tertiary outcomes for the POST-RENAL study.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Using the RENAL Study database, we identified all participants alive at day 90 following randomization. The initials and study numbers of these participants were provided to all the participating centres who then added patient identifiers to these data. These data were then used to link to mortality registries in all Australian states and nationally in New Zealand, along with the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. In addition, study centres used medical records along with contact details to ascertain the survival and dialysis status of patients.</p><p>The following registries were accessed to contribute to the primary and secondary outcomes of the POST-RENAL study: Data Linkage Unit, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Death Index, Canberra, Australia (accessed July 2010, October 2010, January 2011, and September 2011); NZ Births, Deaths and Marriages Registry, Department of Internal Affairs, Wellington, New Zealand; Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, Victoria, Australia (accessed October 2010 and January 2012); Research and Statistics, Department of Justice, Queensland, Australia (accessed October 2010 and July 2011); NSW Registry Births Deaths and Marriages, New South Wales, Australia (accessed October 2010, April 2011 and October 2011); WA Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, Western Australia, Australia (accessed October 2010); Consumer and Business Services, Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Office, South Australia, Australia (accessed October 2011); Births, Deaths and Marriages &#x02013; ACT, Australian Capital Territory, Australia (accessed October 2011); Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry, South Australia, Australia (accessed March 2011 and January 2012).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality 3.5 years after randomization. This measure was assessed by follow-up from the study centres and by linking to state and national death registries. Causes of death were independently adjudicated by two medical practitioners from death certificate data, with consensus arrived at for any discrepant classifications. The secondary outcome was treatment with maintenance dialysis (defined as entry to a chronic dialysis program and meeting criteria for inclusion in the national dialysis registry) during the 3.5 years following randomization.

We found that patients with AKI treated with RRT in the ICU were at high risk of dying during the 3.5-year follow-up period; overall 31.9% of those surviving to 90 days died during the extended follow-up period. The risk of dying was much greater than the risk of entering a maintenance dialysis program, with neither outcome being influenced by the use of a higher intensity of RRT. The rate of albuminuria in survivors was substantial, despite relative preservation of renal function.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Relationship to Existing Literature</title><p>Existing data on the long-term consequences of an episode of AKI are largely derived from administrative or disease specific cohorts <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Ishani2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001601-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The absolute rates of CKD development and mortality reported from these studies have been highly variable <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Coca1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, likely reflecting the different study designs and selection criteria, with pooled rates of 25.8 per 100 person years and 16.8 per 100 person years, respectively. The pooled relative risks from these studies, compared to non-AKI patients, of any CKD development following an episode of AKI was 8.8, for the development of end-stage kidney disease was 3.1, and for mortality was 2.0 <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Coca1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The nature of these studies and their reporting has contributed to a perception that the risk of renal disease progression should be of primary concern in such patients. Our findings differ from many of these reports and these discrepancies are likely to be due to differences in the populations studied and the methodologies used. In particular, previous reports have not specifically targeted patients with AKI requiring RRT in the ICU, and such patients are at greater risk of dying compared with general hospital patients with AKI, as shown in a Swedish study of similar patients <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The paucity of prospective data has also limited our understanding of the natural history of AKI. Independent of eGFR, chronic proteinuria is a risk factor for death, cardiovascular disease, and the later requirement for dialysis <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Klausen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001601-Astor1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the prevalence of this risk factor following an episode of AKI has remained uncertain. Data from a broader population in Australia report a prevalence of proteinuria of 2.4% in the entire population that increases to 6.6% in those over 65 years of age <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Chadban1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys cite a prevalence of 9.5% for albuminuria <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Coresh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and further data from a provincial laboratory registry in Canada report a prevalence of 25% using the ACR <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Tonelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The degree of proteinuria in our study population prior to their renal injury is not known, but these other reports would suggest it is likely to be substantially less than the rate seen after the AKI in our study. Using recent classifications of CKD that include both eGFR and proteinuria to predict future risk of events <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Tonelli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 13% of the survivors in our study population are in the highest risk group for death or renal functional decline.</p><p>The quality of life of survivors following treatment with RRT for AKI in the ICU has been described in a limited number of centres or shortly following the index hospitalization. Delannoy and colleagues <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Delannoy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> reported quality of life at six months following hospitalisation in seven centres; their results are consistent with ours, with very similar SF-12 physical and mental composite scores. When compared to a general population cohort with an eGFR &#x0003c; 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, the SF-12 physical and mental component scores in our patients were similar. The EQ-5D composite scores in our severe AKI survivors most closely approximate those seen in renal transplant recipients <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Implications of Study Findings</title><p>Our study highlights the increased long-term risk of death associated with AKI treated with RRT in an ICU. Only one-third of randomized patients were alive 3.5 years later, a lower survival than that seen in recognised high mortality conditions such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome <xref rid="pmed.1001601-Angus1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although, in our patients the risk of subsequent maintenance dialysis dependence is low, almost half have evidence of significant proteinuria, portending further risk in the years to come. These findings support the view that survivors of AKI are at increased risk and that closer surveillance may be justified. In addition, our findings suggest that chronic proteinuria reduction strategies, which have shown benefit in some patient groups with proteinuria, may warrant investigation as a therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Study Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strength of these findings lies in the prospective nature of the study along with the scale and completeness of long-term follow-up. The design allows for greater precision in estimates of absolute risk and enhances the clinical applicability of the findings whilst avoiding potential bias from retrospective selection of the study cohort. However, a further consequence of such a study design is that the findings from a randomized trial are not always generalizable to other patient populations, so caution should be applied in extrapolating these findings from an ICU cohort to other patients with AKI. In addition, while data linkage has allowed near complete follow-up of mortality and maintenance dialysis outcomes, the clinical and biochemical outcomes were only available for a consenting sub-group that might not be representative of the broader cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Summary</title><p>In a large cohort of patients with AKI randomized to differing doses of continuous RRT in the ICU, the increased risk of death continues well beyond hospital discharge and is not altered by increased intensity of dialysis. The proportion of patients entering a maintenance dialysis program is small but there is a high prevalence of proteinuria amongst survivors suggesting significant ongoing risk of chronic kidney disease and mortality.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001601.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
