It is usually treated with oral rehydration, zinc and continued feeding. Racecadotril has been in use for over 2 decades; however, there is a paucity of data regarding its efficacy from Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study were: to compare the number of stools in the first 48&#x02005;hours in children with severe gastroenteritis requiring admission and treated with either racecadotril or placebo, to study the impact of racecadotril on duration of inpatient stay as well as duration of diarrhoea and to describe the side effect profile of racecadotril.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. It enrolled children between the age of 3 and 60&#x02005;months who were admitted with severe acute gastroenteritis. They received either racecadotril or placebo in addition to oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc and were followed up daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>120 children were enrolled into the study. There were no differences in the demographics or outcomes between the 2 groups. Stools at 48&#x02005;hours: median (IQR) of 5 (3&#x02013;7) and 5 (2.5&#x02013;7.5), respectively; p=0.63.

Zinc was prescribed at 10&#x02013;20&#x02005;mg/day.</p><p>Participants were recruited within 24&#x02005;hours of admission after initial hydration had been completed. Eligibility was determined by calculating the Vesikari score based on the information recorded by the primary physician in the patients' chart.

These were packed in tamper proof brown bags, sealed and labelled by a study pharmacist based off site.</p><p>The test arm received racecadotril at a dose recommended by the manufacturer: 10&#x02005;mg per dose for children below 12&#x02005;months of age and 30&#x02005;mg for those over 12&#x02005;months of age. This was administered as granules dissolved in 10&#x02005;mL of water and taken three times a day for a maximum duration of 3&#x02005;days. The control arm had a placebo preparation administered in the same way.</p><p>An initial dose of the drug or placebo was given at the time of enrolment.

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref></p><p>The Vesikari score made up part of the inclusion criteria for our study, thus ensuring all children recruited had severe gastroenteritis. This is a composite score that was originally developed by Ruuska and Vesikari.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It incorporates the patient's temperature, level of dehydration, need for hospitalisation as well as the duration and frequency of vomiting and diarrhoea. Although the Vesikari score was originally used to determine severity of gastroenteritis at the conclusion of illness, it was shown by Schnadower <italic>et al</italic> to be useful for grading episodes at the point of first contact and during follow-up. They recommended its use in clinical trials involving acute gastroenteritis disease.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This recommendation was later endorsed by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) in their 2014 update on the guidelines for management of acute gastroenteritis in children.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x000a0;To the best of our knowledge, the incorporation of the Vesikari score in the inclusion criteria has never been performed before in any studies on racecadotril and this may have led to the lack of effect seen with the medication in this study. In their review carried out in 2011, Lehert <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> alluded to the same noting that baseline level of dehydration was a significant negative predictor for duration of diarrhoea after introduction of racecadotril.</p><p>Previous studies on racecadotril have included children with diarrhoea lasting &#x0003c;5&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The WHO defines persistent diarrhoea as that which lasts 14&#x02005;days or longer and children with disease duration less than this are treated for acute gastroenteritis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Almost half of the participants included in this study had diarrhoea of 5&#x02005;days or more (46% in both groups). Continued damage to the intestinal mucosa results in an osmotic effect which contributes to the mechanism of diarrhoeal causation. Racecadotril has a minimal effect on this mechanism of diarrhoea and this may have contributed to the results in this study.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Another difference in the population studied was the inclusion of children with malnutrition. In a trial carried out by Jean <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> children with weight for age &#x0003c;80% were excluded. In this study, children with severe undernutrition made up 15% of the drug group and 26% of the placebo group. However, the mean weight of participants in this study was 7.4&#x02005;kg which was similar to a study carried out by Savitha<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (as quoted in the Lehert <italic>et al</italic>'s<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> review). In both the Jean <italic>et al</italic> and Savitha studies, there was a significant improvement in the stool output for children on racecadotril.</p><p>The difference in the length of inpatient stay between the two groups constituted about half a day. This was not statistically significant but was comparable with other studies carried out at the same site. Osano <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> studied admissions of children with acute gastroenteritis at the Kenyatta National Hospital and noted that the average duration of stay was 4.2&#x02005;days. None of the other inpatient studies carried out in children on racecadotril have described differences in duration of stays for their participants. Cojocaru <italic>et al</italic> stated that the effect of racecadotril on duration of hospitalisation could not be commented on due to the short patient stay and follow-up in his study.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The use of zinc in this study may have contributed to similar durations of illness between the two groups. Previous studies have shown a link between the use of zinc and the duration of illness in developing countries.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In most studies performed, racecadotril has been used alongside ORS although none have incorporated zinc into the treatment protocol.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Clinically significant adverse events were equally distributed between the two groups. The results are similar to those in other studies including the review carried out by Lehert <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Adverse events in this study involved mainly the skin and upper respiratory tract (13%), which are comparable to those found in the literature.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Convulsions were noted in the drug group of this study, a finding that has not been reported in studies with racecadotril thus far. The significance of this finding cannot be commented on due to the sample size.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although the number of stools was recorded on a daily basis, measurement of stool weights may have been a better measure to determine stool output as has been done in similar studies on the subject. The recording of number of stools as reported by the parents/guardians may have introduced a recall bias that affected the results. This may have been avoided by investigators observing the number of stools rather than parents providing information. The presence of comorbid conditions was not considered when the participants were recruited to the trial. Some of these conditions (especially HIV) may have had an impact on the results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study does not demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of stools at 48&#x02005;hours for children admitted with severe gastroenteritis after introduction of racecadotril. Furthermore, it does not reduce the duration of inpatient stay or the duration of diarrhoea when compared with placebo.</p></sec>
