dexamethasone (Dex)-treated dendritic cells (DCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Material/Methods</title><p>Well-grown DC2.4 cells were randomly assigned to receive control, 50 &#x003bc;g/L, 100 &#x003bc;g/L, or 200 &#x003bc;g/L of dexamethasone and then were cultured for 6 days. The expressions of CD80, CD86, galectin-9, and PD-L1 on the surface of DC2.4 cells were analyzed with flow cytometry and the level of IL-12 secreted by DC2.4 cells was determined by ELISA. The stimulating activity of DC2.4 cells on allogeneic T cells was assessed with mixed lymphocyte reaction. Dexamethasone-treated DC2.4 cells were co-cultured with allogeneic splenic lymphocytes and the Foxp3 expression in naive T lymphocytes was determined with flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with the control group, the expressions of CD80, CD86, galectin-9, and PD-L1 on the surface of DC2.4 cells exposed to different doses of dexamethasone showed no significant changes; however, dexamethasone treatment significantly reduced IL-12 secretion and inhibited DC2.4&#x02019;s stimulation on the proliferation of allogeneic T lymphocytes. Moreover, dexamethasone-treated DC2.4 cells effectively promoted FOXP3 expression in naive T lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>DC2.4 is a stable cell line with high expressions of CD80, CD86, and PD-L1. Dexamethasone does not significantly change the cell phenotype of DC2.4 cells, but inhibits the secretion of IL-12 cytokine and attenuates DC2.4&#x02019;s stimulation of the proliferation of allogeneic T cells.

Previous studies have shown that DC-induced immune tolerance is mainly achieved through inducing T cell anergy and T cell clone deletion and promoting immunosuppression of regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-medscimonit-17-5-br125">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-medscimonit-17-5-br125">2</xref>]. Galectin-9, a ligand of Tim3 (Tim-3L), plays an important role in suppressing graft rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-medscimonit-17-5-br125">3</xref>]. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), also known as B7-H1, belongs to the B7 family of costimulatory molecules. Studies have demonstrated that binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 markedly inhibits the function of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-medscimonit-17-5-br125">4</xref>].</p><p>Dexamethasone, an immunosuppressant, is widely used for inhibiting organ-graft rejection in clinical practice. However, the long-term application of dexamethasone has obvious adverse effects on the human body. Thus, it has been a research focus in the field of transplantation immunology to seek new immunosuppressants or immunosuppressive therapies with high curative effects and lower or even no adverse effects. Induction of DC cells&#x02019; tolerance is very important in inhibiting graft rejection. Studies have shown that dexamethasone exerts its effects by modulating the function of DCs in the early stages of immune response. Dexamethasone can promote the generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells that have immune regulatory function, and further induces immune tolerance in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-medscimonit-17-5-br125">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-medscimonit-17-5-br125">6</xref>]. In this study, the phenotype and functional changes of DC2.4 cells after dexamethasone treatment were investigated in order to explore the underlying mechanisms of dexamethasone-treated DC cells in inducing immune tolerance and inhibiting immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>The mouse DC2.4 cell line was provided by the Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Research, Academy of Military Medical Sciences.

Hence, induction of immune tolerance by harvesting the characteristics of DCs has become an area of extensive study in transplant immunology. Studies have shown that pharmacologically-treated DCs significantly prolong the survival of transplanted organs and effectively induce immune tolerance to the transplanted organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-medscimonit-17-5-br125">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-medscimonit-17-5-br125">8</xref>]. The DC2.4 cell line is a mouse dendritic cell line established by transfecting C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow cells with GM-CSF, myc, and raf genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-medscimonit-17-5-br125">9</xref>]. Our present study examined the effects of various doses of dexamethasone on the phenotypes and function of the DC2.4 cell line. Our results showed that dexamethasone treatment resulted in no significant changes in the expressions of CD80, CD86, galectin-9, or PD-L1 in DC2.4 cells. However, dexamethasone treatment significantly inhibited IL-12 secretion by DC2.4 cells and suppressed the proliferation of allogeneic T lymphocytes. Moreover, the expression of FOXP3 in naive T cells was effectively augmented in dexamethasone-treated DC2.4 cells.</p><p>Galectin-9 (Tim-3L) is widely expressed in the human and mouse spleen and lymphoid tissues. Galectin-9/Tim-3 (Tim-3 is a specific surface molecule of Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-medscimonit-17-5-br125">10</xref>]) interaction can trigger negative regulatory signals, downregulate Th1 immune response, and promote the development of peripheral immune tolerance, thus playing an important role in autoimmune diseases and immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-medscimonit-17-5-br125">11</xref>]. Programmed death 1 ligand (PD-L1, B7-H1) is expressed in resting cells and is upregulated in activated T cells, B cells and DCs. Deficiency in PD-L1 is known to accelerate the development of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-medscimonit-17-5-br125">12</xref>]. Programmed death-1 (PD-1), an important protein involved in negative immune regulation, is mainly expressed in activated T cells and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-medscimonit-17-5-br125">13</xref>]. The PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway exerts negative regulation on the activation of lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-medscimonit-17-5-br125">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-medscimonit-17-5-br125">15</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that regulatory T cells exert inhibitory effects on immune response by upregulating PD-L1 (molecular mechanism) via DCs (cytological effect) and that <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> blockade or inhibition of PD-L1 expression abolishes the inhibitory effect of DCs treated by regulatory T cells on effector T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-medscimonit-17-5-br125">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we found that dexamethasone neither increased the expression of galectin-9 in DCs nor reduced the expressions of CD80 or CD86, suggesting that the phenotypes of this cell line are relatively stable. Nevertheless, dosage and duration of dexamethasone treatment may also contribute to the observed stability of this cell line. In addition, our study revealed that dexamethasone suppressed the secretion of IL-12 in DC2.4 cells. IL-12 is an important cytokine involved in immune response. It can effectively induce proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes and elicit specific immune response in Th1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-medscimonit-17-5-br125">17</xref>]. Dexamethasone may suppress T cell proliferation by inhibiting the production of IL-12, which is in agreement with the findings previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-medscimonit-17-5-br125">18</xref>]. Our present study demonstrated that CD80 and CD86 were highly expressed in DC2.4 cells, characteristic of the phenotypes of mature DCs. Although dexamethasone did not reduce the expression of CD80 or CD86 in DC2.4 cells, it resulted in inhibition of IL-12 production and T cell proliferation.</p><p>The interplay between DCs and T cells has an important role in immune response and induction of immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-medscimonit-17-5-br125">19</xref>]. Studies have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-medscimonit-17-5-br125">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-medscimonit-17-5-br125">21</xref>] that dexamethasone-treated DC cells induced the production of regulatory T cells, inhibited the responses of effector T cells, and induced immune tolerance. By using RNA interference to specifically silence the expressions of CD40, CD80, and CD86 in DCs, effector T cell-elicited immune response was effectively suppressed and the development of autoimmune diseases was thus avoided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-medscimonit-17-5-br125">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-medscimonit-17-5-br125">23</xref>]. Allogeneic DCs effectively augmented the proliferation of CD4+ regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-medscimonit-17-5-br125">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-medscimonit-17-5-br125">25</xref>], which in turn inhibited DC-mediated T cell immune response by suppressing proliferation, phenotypic maturation, and IL-12 production of DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-medscimonit-17-5-br125">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-medscimonit-17-5-br125">27</xref>]. Our understanding of which subset of DCs is capable of inducing immune tolerance has recently been advanced by the finding that mature DCs can also induce T cell tolerance in addition to immature DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-medscimonit-17-5-br125">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-medscimonit-17-5-br125">29</xref>]. A study has shown that CD4 regulatory T cells induced by human autologous mature DCs markedly inhibited allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-medscimonit-17-5-br125">30</xref>]. High expressions of CD80 and CD86 on the surface of DCs are beneficial for proliferation of regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-medscimonit-17-5-br125">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-medscimonit-17-5-br125">32</xref>].</p><p>Our study found that DC2.4 cells expressed high levels of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules and that dexamethasone treatment did not cause a notable change in their expressions. Meanwhile, the results of mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that 100 &#x003bc;g/L dexamethasone was more effective in inhibiting allogeneic T cell proliferation than other doses of dexamethasone. To further investigate the underlying cause, we analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the proliferation of regulatory T cells. The results demonstrated that DC2.4 cells co-cultured with allogeneic spleen lymphocytes, irrespective of dexamethasone treatment, could effectively promote FOXP3 expression in naive T cells and that dexamethasone-treated DC2.4 cells were more potent in promoting FOXP3 expression. Accordingly, an elevated FOXP3 expression stimulated by dexamethasone-treated DC2.4 further inhibited T cell immunity, and DC2.4-stimulated allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation was more effectively suppressed. Therefore, there is no strict division between the phenotypes of tolerogenic DC and those of reactive DC. Because of the complexity of the immune system and the conditionality of the regulatory network, a molecular phenotype of DCs may perform different immune functions depending on the stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although dexamethasone treatment did not cause changes in the expressions of cellular phenotypes in DC2.4 cells, it indeed significantly decreased IL-12 production, promoted the production of regulatory T cells, and inhibited the proliferation of allogeneic T cell.
