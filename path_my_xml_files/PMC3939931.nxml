Antimicrobial treatment comprises intravenous drugs for at least 10 days, followed by oral drugs for at least 12 weeks. The standard oral regimen based on trial evidence is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxaxole (TMP-SMX) plus doxycycline. This regimen is used in Thailand but is associated with side-effects and poor adherence by patients, and TMP-SMX alone is recommended in Australia. We compared the efficacy and side-effects of TMP-SMX with TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>For this multi-centre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients (aged &#x02265;15 years) from five centres in northeast Thailand with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had received a course of parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Using a computer-generated sequence, we randomly assigned patients to receive TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for 20 weeks (1:1; block size of ten, stratified by study site). We followed patients up every 4 months for 1 year and annually thereafter to the end of the study.

Randomisation and masking was done at the coordinating centre at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Bangkok, Thailand). The allocation sequence was computer generated with a block size of ten and was stratified by study site. To achieve treatment concealment, TMP-SMX and either placebo or doxycycline were dispensed into sequential, identical, tamper-proof bottles for each participant for 20 weeks. The study drug bottles were labelled with sequential code numbers and distributed to the study sites. TMP-SMX, placebo, and doxycycline were manufactured and provided by the Siam Pharmaceutical Company (Bangkok, Thailand). All patients and study investigators were unaware of the drug allocation throughout the study. The randomisation codes remained sealed until after data collection, data cleaning, and completion of a masked analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients received TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for a minimum of 20 weeks. TMP-SMX (80 mg TMP and 400 mg SMX) tablets were prescribed using a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 40 kg or estimated glomerular filtration rate 15&#x02013;29 mL/min, 160 mg TMP and 800 mg SMX twice daily; bodyweight of 40 kg to 60 kg, 240 mg TMP and 1200 mg SMX twice daily; and bodyweight greater than 60 kg, 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX twice daily.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Doxycycline or placebo was prescribed as a 100 mg tablet to be taken twice daily. Patients were advised to repeat the dose if vomiting occurred within 30 min of their taking the tablet. The minimum duration of 20 weeks was based on a combination of current practice and available evidence. The recommended duration for oral antimicrobials is 12&#x02013;20 weeks in Thailand,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and 3&#x02013;6 months in Australia,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> a discrepancy that shows the uncertainty about the optimum duration. Findings from a retrospective study in Thailand showed that treatment for longer than 12 weeks was associated with lower risk of relapse.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> We therefore chose to use 20 weeks as a minimum duration rather than 12 weeks or an empirically chosen point between the two.</p><p>After enrolment, we followed patients up at weeks 4, 12, and 20 of oral treatment, every 4 months for 1 year after completion of treatment, and annually thereafter to the end of the study. Patients who did not attend scheduled appointments were contacted by telephone. The trial was designed to stop 1 year after the last participant was enrolled. At each clinical visit, we undertook a clinical examination and laboratory analyses, including complete blood count, blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolyte, and liver function tests. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were done at enrolment, and repeated at weeks 12 and 20 if an abnormality was detected on the first test. We asked patients to bring the study drug bottles to follow-up visits, at which drug compliance was checked by pill counts. Treatment with the randomised drugs was extended beyond 20 weeks if clinically indicated because of evidence of residual infection, as decided by the treating physician. Concealed study drug bottles labelled with unique spare sequential code numbers were separately prepared for patients who needed treatment for more than 20 weeks. As needed, the site investigator contacted the coordinating centre by telephone to receive the code number of the extended study drug bottles for a specific study participant.</p><p>Study treatment was stopped immediately if a patient developed symptoms or signs of a severe allergic reaction (grade 4),<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and treatment was completed with the second-line regimen (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Patients who were not able to tolerate the study drugs because of other adverse drug reactions and those who had an inadequate response to the study drugs as judged by the treating physician were also switched to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was prescribed according to a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 60 kg: 1000 mg amoxicillin and 250 mg clavulanic acid three times daily, and bodyweight greater than 60 kg: 1500 mg amoxicillin and 375 mg clavulanic acid three times daily.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes and data management</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, which was defined as the development of new symptoms and signs of infection in association with at least one culture from any site positive for <italic>B pseudomallei</italic> at any time between enrolment and study completion. Secondary endpoints were overall recurrent melioidosis (culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis plus clinical recurrence), mortality, treatment failure, extension of treatment, and adverse drug reactions. The published protocol contains an error and states that mortality was a primary rather than a secondary outcome measure (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Clinical recurrence was defined as the development of new symptoms and signs of infection that were consistent with melioidosis but in the absence of a positive <italic>B pseudomallei</italic> culture from any site. Treatment failure was defined as the clinical decision to change oral treatment as a result of inadequate response. Extension of treatment was defined as a decision by the treating physician to continue the study drug beyond 20 weeks.

Continuous variables are presented as median (IQR). IQRs are presented in terms of 25th and 75th percentiles. Categorical data are presented as number (%). We did survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Time was measured from the day of study enrolment. For the primary analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis as the failure outcome, participants were censored on the day of last follow-up or death due to other causes. We tested non-inferiority of the TMP-SMX plus placebo group by calculating the HR for the efficacy of TMP-SMX plus placebo over the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, and compared the upper limit of the 95% CI to the non-inferiority margin. To accept the non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline, the upper limit of the 95% CI needed to be equal to or less than 1&#x000b7;7. A one sided-test at an alpha error of 5% was also calculated for the non-inferiority margin. For the secondary analyses with treatment changes and treatment failure as the outcomes, participants were censored on the day of recurrent melioidosis or death due to other causes. We calculated the probabilities of event outcomes at each timepoint using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the Cox Proportional Hazard model, we assessed whether the hazard ratio was constant over time using Schoenfeld residuals. The analysis was repeated for the primary outcome in the per-protocol population, in which those who did not complete 20 weeks of study drug were excluded.</p><p>As recurrent melioidosis can be caused by either relapse or re-infection, we also assessed the efficacy of TMP-SMX for culture-confirmed relapse in a sensitivity analysis on the basis that we would not expect antimicrobial treatment to prevent re-infection after treatment has been completed. We did this using culture-confirmed relapse as a failure outcome and excluding patients who had no paired bacterial isolates available for genotyping from the first and recurrent episode and those with paired isolates and genotyping results that confirmed re-infection.</p><p>For safety analyses, we assessed the proportion of patients who had adverse drug reactions by treatment group. We compared proportions using the Fisher's exact test and continuous variables using the Mann-Whitney test. We used STATA (version 12.1) for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The sponsors had no role in data collection, data analyses, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Of 45 participants who died, 14 (31%) died during 20 weeks of oral treatment, 15 (33%) died during the first year of follow-up, six (13%) died between year 1 and year 2 of follow-up, and ten (22%) died after 2 years. Cause of death was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (seven patients), clinical recurrent melioidosis (four patients), unknown causes (11 patients), and other diseases (23 patients). No deaths were attributed to an adverse reaction to the study drugs.</p><p>Overall, 516 (82%) patients received oral treatment for at least 12 weeks (including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid if patients needed switching) and 445 (71%) patients received oral treatment for at least 20 weeks. 37 (12%) of 311 patients given TMP-SMX plus placebo and 59 (19%) of 315 patients given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline switched treatment to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid because of adverse drug reactions. Patients given TMP-SMX plus placebo had about a 40% lower chance of switching to the second-line regimen due to adverse drug reactions than those given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (HR 0&#x000b7;61; 95% CI 0&#x000b7;41&#x02013;0&#x000b7;92; p=0&#x000b7;02). Six patients (2%) given TMP-SMX plus placebo and six patients (2%) given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline switched due to treatment failure (HR 0&#x000b7;92; 0&#x000b7;30&#x02013;2&#x000b7;87; p=0&#x000b7;89). Analysis of Schoenfeld residuals showed that the HR for all outcomes were not variable over time with the exception of switching due to treatment failure (Schoenfeld test, p=0&#x000b7;05). Of all patients who completed 20 weeks of the study drug, nine (4%) of 226 patients in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 12 (6%) of 218 patients in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group needed an extension of treatment beyond 20 weeks (p=0&#x000b7;51).</p><p>The proportion of patients reporting adverse drug reactions was lower in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group than in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Common adverse drug reactions were allergic reactions and gastrointestinal disorders. Serious adverse events (grade 4) were reported in five patients (2%) given TMP-SMX plus placebo and eight patients (3%) given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. These serious adverse events included Stevens-Johnson syndrome (three patients), severe hyponatraemia (&#x0003c;120 mmol/L; two patients), and severe hyperkalaemia (&#x0003e;7 mmol/L; one patient).</p><p>We analysed 226 patients in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 218 patients in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group who completed 20 weeks of the study drug in a per-protocol analysis. Non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis was also shown (HR 0&#x000b7;50, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;19&#x02013;1&#x000b7;32).</p><p>We did bacterial genotyping for 29 (78%) of 37 patients with culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis for whom paired isolates (from the primary and recurrent episode) were available. 14 recurrent cases (48%) were defined as relapse, and 15 recurrent cases (52%) were defined as re-infection. Median time to relapse (7 months, IQR 6&#x02013;13) was shorter than median time to re-infection (29 months; 13&#x02013;37; p=0&#x000b7;0009).</p><p>In a sensitivity analysis (n=603), we excluded 15 patients who developed genotype confirmed re-infection and eight patients who did not have paired isolates for genotyping (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). These results did not differ substantially from the main analysis, although the 95% CIs were wider as a consequence of the inclusion of fewer failure outcomes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Of the 14 patients with culture-confirmed relapse, five were in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group (2% of 300 patients in this group included in the sensitivity analysis), and nine were in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (3% of the 303 patients in the group; HR 0&#x000b7;58, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;19&#x02013;1&#x000b7;73; p=0&#x000b7;33; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). The lower boundary of the 95% CI for the HR for culture-confirmed relapse was slightly greater than the non-inferiority margin (1&#x000b7;73 <italic>vs</italic> 1&#x000b7;70). In this analysis, 14 patients (5%) given TMP-SMX plus placebo and 24 patients (8%) given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline died during the study period (HR 0&#x000b7;61, 0&#x000b7;31&#x02013;1&#x000b7;17; p=0&#x000b7;14; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Patients given TMP-SMX plus placebo also had about a 40% lower chance of switching to the second-line regimen due to adverse drug reactions than did those given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (HR 0&#x000b7;56, 0&#x000b7;3&#x02013;0&#x000b7;85; p=0&#x000b7;01; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cesec110"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that TMP-SMX is not inferior to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline as an oral treatment for melioidosis. Fewer patients given TMP-SMX plus placebo had adverse drug reactions or switched to the second-line regimen compared with those given TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. These findings provide the evidence for a change to the recommended oral regimen for melioidosis to TMP-SMX alone.</p><p>The probability of having culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis within 1 year of enrolment into the study (3%) was lower than that seen in another trial (6%),<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> in which the minimum duration of oral TMP-SMX and doxycycline was 12 weeks.

This finding contrasts with the findings of a retrospective study of 921 patients with melioidosis over an 8 year period, in which 74% of recurrent infections (80 of 116) were due to relapse and 26% (30 of 116) were due to re-infection.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> One possible explanation is that in the retrospective study, 50% of 921 patients were initially treated with non TMP-SMX-based regimens which were associated with a higher rate of relapse.

The first relates to the non-inferiority margin (HR 1&#x000b7;7), which was selected by the scientific committee on the basis of a balance between trial feasibility (completion within 4 years) and statistical robustness. Some investigators have suggested the adoption of a larger non-inferiority margin (HR 2&#x000b7;0), but we considered it unacceptable to adopt a new regimen that could actually have two times the risk of recurrent culture-confirmed melioidosis than the current standard. Some investigators have also suggested the adoption of a smaller non-inferiority margin (HR 1&#x000b7;5), but this would have required an 8 year study period with a sample size of 1200 patients, which we thought to be unfeasible. The scientific committee agreed that an upper boundary of the 95% CI of a HR that was equal to or less than 1&#x000b7;7 would be sufficient to change clinical practice to the use of TMP-SMX alone for oral treatment of melioidosis. Additional limitations were that 11 patients who died at home of unknown cause might have died from recurrent melioidosis, that eight (21%) of 37 paired <italic>B pseudomallei</italic> isolates were not available for genotyping, and that non-inferiority was not shown in a sensitivity analysis. We also acknowledge that CLSI do not provide criteria for the interpretation of disc diffusion and Etest assays for <italic>B pseudomallei,</italic><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but these were used on the basis that they have been described previously,<xref rid="bib12 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12,25</sup></xref> are in common use in Thailand, and were the only feasible option to establish susceptibility in the five study sites. The estimated HR of discontinuation of the study drug due to treatment failure (HR 0&#x000b7;92; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) should be interpreted with caution because the Schoenfeld test provided weak evidence suggesting that the HR for this outcome might not be constant over time.</p><p>In this study, we also assessed the efficacy of TMP-SMX over TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for culture-confirmed relapse. The results from a sensitivity analysis were very similar to the main analysis, except that the lower bound of the 95% CI for the HR for culture-confirmed relapse was slightly greater than the non-inferiority margin. This finding is mainly because the study was not powered to assess the non-inferiority based on this outcome in the sensitivity analysis. Therefore, we would suggest that these potential limitations are unlikely to have affected the conclusions of the study.</p><p>Having established that TMP-SMX is preferable to TMP-SMX and doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>), the next challenge is to establish the optimum duration of this regimen.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group
