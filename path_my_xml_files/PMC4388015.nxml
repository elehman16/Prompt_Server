We fitted a dynamic mathematical model to trial data and explored 1) factors contributing to the lack of population-level impact, 2) the best-achievable impact if all implementation characteristics were increased to the highest level achieved during the trial (&#x0201c;optimized intervention&#x0201d;), and 3) how tuberculosis might be better controlled with additional interventions (improving diagnostics, reducing treatment delay, providing isoniazid preventive therapy continuously to human immunodeficiency virus&#x02013;positive people, or scaling up antiretroviral treatment coverage) individually and in combination. We found the following: 1) The model suggests that a small proportion of latent infections among human immunodeficiency virus&#x02013;positive people were cured, which could have been a key factor explaining the lack of detectable population-level impact. 2) The optimized implementation increased impact by only 10%. 3) Implementing additional interventions individually and in combination led to up to 30% and 75% reductions, respectively, in tuberculosis incidence after 10 years. Tuberculosis control requires a combination prevention approach, including health systems strengthening to minimize treatment delay, improving diagnostics, increased antiretroviral treatment coverage, and effective preventive treatment regimens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mass community-wide isoniazid preventive therapy</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>South Africa experienced the highest tuberculosis incidence globally (800&#x02013;1,200 per 100,000) in 2011 (<xref rid="KWU320C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), with extremely high notification rates among gold miners (3,000 per 100,000 in 2008) (<xref rid="KWU320C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Following the success of mass community-wide isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in Alaska during the 1950s (<xref rid="KWU320C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), researchers undertook a cluster randomized trial (Thibela TB) of mass tuberculosis screening followed by IPT in South African gold mines (<xref rid="KWU320C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The intervention greatly reduced individual-level incidence but had no detectable population-level impact (<xref rid="KWU320C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>): Miners experienced &#x0003e;60% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25, 82) protection while taking IPT, but the relative incidence rate in intervention compared with control clusters was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.48) during the year after the intervention stopped.</p><p>Several factors, including suboptimal IPT uptake and retention, a high annual risk of infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> and population mobility may have helped to reduce the population-level impact (<xref rid="KWU320C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but their relative importance is unclear. Because isoniazid targets actively replicating rather than dormant bacilli (<xref rid="KWU320C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the lack of impact may be partly attributable to IPT's curing a low proportion of latent infections, a possibility which was not appreciated at the study initiation. Understanding the trial's findings and interventions that might control tuberculosis is important, given the extraordinarily high incidence in gold mines and relevance for other high incidence settings.</p><p>Here, we fitted a mathematical model to trial data and explored 1) factors contributing to the lack of population-level impact, including the proportion of infections that were cured by IPT; 2) the best-achievable intervention impact if all implementation characteristics (e.g., IPT uptake, retention) were increased to the highest level achieved during the trial (&#x0201c;optimized intervention&#x0201d;); and 3) how tuberculosis might be better controlled, by estimating the impact of additional interventions (improving sensitivity and screening by using new diagnostics, such as Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Inc., Sunnyvale, California), reducing treatment delay, providing IPT continuously, and/or scaling up antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage) both individually and simultaneously.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Thibela TB cluster randomized trial</title><p>Thibela TB was a cluster randomized trial in sites belonging to 3 South African gold mining companies (<xref rid="KWU320C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) comprising 8 intervention and 7 control clusters, including all miners at participating mine shafts and associated hostel residences. Clusters, stratified into 2 groups (low and high tuberculosis notifications) using data from 2004, were randomized to the intervention or standard of care, balancing for company, province, and workforce size. Trial impact calculations accounted for between-site heterogeneity. Consenting miners in intervention clusters were offered tuberculosis screening, active cases were referred for treatment, and those without active tuberculosis or contraindications were offered 9 months of isoniazid (300 mg daily).</p><p>The primary outcome was &#x0201c;tuberculosis incidence&#x0201d; in all clusters, measured during the &#x0201c;primary outcome measurement&#x0201d; period, lasting 12 months after the last person completed IPT in each cluster (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="KWU320F1">1</xref>), with cases mainly ascertained from treatment records. Tuberculosis prevalence was measured by using culture confirmation among systematically sampled employees at the study's end.

Cluster populations comprise 4 age strata (&#x0003c;30, 30&#x02013;39, 40&#x02013;49, and &#x02265;50 years) because of age-dependent population mobility and 2 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strata (HIV-positive or HIV-negative). Model output is aggregated into 2 age strata (&#x0003c;40 and &#x02265;40 years) or all ages, given insufficient data to further stratify the incidence and prevalence. Clusters are considered independent, because little movement occurred between intervention and control arms.

ART, antiretroviral therapy; TB, tuberculosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="kwu32003"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>General structure</title><p>All miners are infected in the model, joining the workforce recently reinfected (&#x0003c;2 years previously), with active disease (some of whom are detected on recruitment) or latent infection, consistent with miners transferring between mines or, because of much ongoing transmission (<xref rid="KWU320C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="KWU320C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), being recently reinfected. Miners whose most recent (re)infection occurred &#x0003e;2 years previously are considered to be latently infected. Miners leave the cluster through death or out-migration.</p><p>Latently infected miners can develop smear-negative, culture-positive disease through reactivation or following reinfection at estimated rates (see below), depending on the HIV and (radiologically confirmed) silicosis prevalence, CD4 count distributions, and ART coverage, after which they can become smear-positive. Smear status determines their infectiousness. The annual risk of infection, depending on the contact rate among miners and nonminers and the prevalence of infectious individuals, changes with the intervention and is cluster, specific. Cases can die or be detected through self-presenting to mine health services or routine medical examinations. After detection, cases can become lost to follow-up, die, or be treated and recover; disease occurs subsequently only after reinfection.</p><p>Once Thibela TB starts, those latently infected, reinfected, or recovered take IPT for &#x02264;9 months at cluster-specific uptake and retention rates, and cases are detected through screening on study recruitment. The assumed protection (63%) during IPT comes from individual-level estimates (<xref rid="KWU320C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), with increased protection while also taking ART. Scenarios for the proportion of infections that are cleared with 6 months of IPT are described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>The impact of the intervention</title><p>The impact of the intervention on the &#x0201c;measured&#x0201d; tuberculosis incidence (the percentage difference in the measured incidence between intervention and control arms) during the primary outcome measurement period and tuberculosis prevalence at the study end (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="KWU320F1">1</xref>) was calculated for each cluster and averaged across clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Objective 1. Exploring factors contributing to the lack of population-level impact</title><p>After inclusion of all known factors and data (age, HIV, silicosis, ART, population mobility, case detection, initial loss to follow-up after detection, treatment delay, and IPT uptake and retention), the model has several unknown parameters: the rates of disease onset through reactivation and following reinfection and the proportion of infections that are cured by IPT.</p><p>Because isoniazid targets actively replicating rather than dormant bacilli (<xref rid="KWU320C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), IPT may not cure all infections. HIV-negative participants in preventive therapy trials typically experienced low tuberculosis incidence many years thereafter (<xref rid="KWU320C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), suggesting cure of latent infections; those HIV-positive participants in presumed high-transmission settings experienced high disease incidence soon after stopping IPT (<xref rid="KWU320C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="KWU320C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), suggesting that their infections were not cured or that reinfection occurred during IPT, with quick disease progression. When Thibela TB was planned, 6 months of IPT was considered sufficient (<xref rid="KWU320C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), although 9 months was chosen, compromising between recommendations for HIV-infected people (6 months) or silicotics (12 months) (<xref rid="KWU320C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). We explored 3 HIV-specific IPT assumptions:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Assumption 1 (100% cure, 100% protection). Six months of IPT cures <italic>all</italic> infections and reinfection cannot occur during IPT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assumption 2 (estimated percentage cured, 100% protection). Six months of IPT can cure &#x0003c;100% of infections, but reinfection <italic>cannot</italic> occur during IPT. The proportion of infections that are cured by 6 months of IPT is estimated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assumption 3 (estimated percentage cured, estimated percentage protection)<italic>.</italic> Six months of IPT can cure &#x0003c;100% of infections, with &#x0003c;100% protection against reinfection during IPT. Both the proportion of infections that are cured by 6 months of IPT and protection against reinfection during IPT are estimated.</p></list-item></list>For each assumption, we fitted by maximum likelihood cluster-specific model predictions of the measured incidence and prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis during the primary outcome measurement period and final prevalence survey, respectively (each from 1 time point) for the age groups &#x0003c;40 and &#x02265;40 years to observed data, to estimate the unknown parameters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aje/kwu320/-/DC1">Web Appendix 3; Web Table&#x000a0;8</ext-link>). These were used to calculate the best-fitting impact, generating a 95% confidence interval using bootstrapping (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aje/kwu320/-/DC1">Web Appendix 3; Web Figures&#x000a0;8 and 9</ext-link>). This fitting used base-case model parameter values (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="KWU320TB1">1</xref>), which, for IPT assumption 1, facilitate exploring whether factors (IPT coverage, treatment, etc.) explained the lack of detectable population-level impact. By using model predictions of incidence and prevalence, the fitting accounts for correlations between the two quantities.</p><p>The sensitivity of the best-fitting impact to alternative values for the annual risk of infection (10% and 30% per year), HIV prevalence (20%, 35%, and 40%), and prevalence of active tuberculosis among newly employed miners was also explored (differing by 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% from the final prevalence survey estimates), keeping all other parameters at base-case values. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aje/kwu320/-/DC1">Web Appendix 3</ext-link> provides further details.</p><p>The parameters estimated through fitting account for the uncertainty in the intervention's observed impact, assuming that all remaining parameters equaled the values measured in the process data. To account for uncertainty in the latter, we used &#x0201c;Bayesian melding&#x0201d; (<xref rid="KWU320C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="KWU320C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to identify the credible range of key IPT-related parameters. The likelihood of the observed incidence and prevalence was computed for 2.28 million sets of randomly drawn parameter values, comprising 40 parameters each (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="KWU320TB1">1</xref>). Using fewer (1.5 million) parameter combinations gave similar outcomes.

Other contributing factors include suboptimal IPT uptake and retention. The optimized intervention increased impact by only 10%. Tuberculosis control in gold mines requires implementing interventions simultaneously, including health systems improvements reducing treatment delay and initial loss to follow-up, improved diagnostics, scaling-up ART, and providing IPT continuously to HIV-positive workers.</p><p>The model used was complex, which is justifiable, given multiple competing hypotheses for why no population-level impact was detected, including suboptimal IPT uptake and retention, as well as high population mobility. To robustly address why this occurred, we found that the model needed to include all known factors at levels supported by the trial's process data. These factors did not fully explain the lack of detectable population-level impact because, after incorporation of both the known data and the assumption that IPT cured all infections, the model fitted the data poorly. The population-level impact might have changed little even with optimized implementation. A simpler model than that used here would have excluded some factors and could not determine their contribution to the trial's lack of detectable population-level impact.</p><p>Our model did not include drug resistance, which probably contributed little to the study's population-level impact, given the low (&#x0003c;15%) prevalence of isoniazid resistance (<xref rid="KWU320C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and no evidence that IPT's effectiveness is reduced at such levels (<xref rid="KWU320C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="KWU320C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We note that our Bayesian melding analyses suggest that 14% of infections were cured, which would have increased to just 16% (0.14/0.85) by including drug resistance in the model.</p><p>Our finding that isoniazid may not cure latent infections is consistent with observations that it targets actively replicating rather than dormant bacilli (<xref rid="KWU320C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We could not reliably estimate its outcome for HIV-negative workers, given their small contribution to disease incidence and the lack of HIV-specific tuberculosis incidence data.

The lack of detectable impact of preventive therapy elsewhere (<xref rid="KWU320C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="KWU320C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) suggests that ubiquitous silica dust exposure in gold mines, impairing macrophage function (<xref rid="KWU320C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), may have affected the ability to sterilize latent infections or prevent reinfections, even in HIV-negative miners.</p><p>Although improved implementation, including increased IPT uptake and retention, might have helped to increase the impact on tuberculosis incidence, this probably would have been short lived (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/aje/kwu320/-/DC1">Web Figure&#x000a0;19</ext-link>), even with a 3-month curative regimen (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="KWU320F6">6</xref>A), largely because of employees with latent infection or tuberculosis disease joining the workforce and, potentially, developing disease and/or transmitting infection. These factors, the HIV prevalence and IPT coverage/retention, partly explain the different impact in the Alaskan IPT trial and Thibela TB. Providing IPT to new gold mining employees could potentially increase the durability.</p><p>The durable impact predicted with providing continuous IPT (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="KWU320F4">4</xref>) supports recent South African guidelines recommending &#x02265;36 months of IPT for HIV-positive, tuberculin-positive people (<xref rid="KWU320C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We accounted for the minimal IPT-derived benefit for tuberculin-negative individuals (<xref rid="KWU320C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>): The assumed protection was based on all trial participants, irrespective of tuberculin status (<xref rid="KWU320C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, we have not included immune function improvements during prolonged ART, which may help to restore the ability to sterilize latent infections and increase the benefit of providing IPT with ART.</p><p>We may have underestimated the impact of improved dust control because of underascertainment of silicosis. Radiology has low (&#x0223c;30%) sensitivity for detecting nodules (<xref rid="KWU320C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and increasing cumulative silica dust exposure increases the risk of tuberculosis even in miners with normal chest radiographs. In South Africa, 20%&#x02013;30% of gold miners who die from any cause may have histopathological silicosis (<xref rid="KWU320C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="KWU320C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), with 50% and 30% of HIV-positive and HIV-negative miners, respectively, having active tuberculosis (<xref rid="KWU320C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Several factors, including the sensitivity of existing diagnostics and delays in care-seeking, influence the impact of improved diagnostics (<xref rid="KWU320C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This may be small if Xpert MTB/RIF is used to diagnose self-reported tuberculosis symptoms and confirm suspected radiological tuberculosis at routine medical examinations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="KWU320F6">6</xref>). It increases substantially if it <italic>replaces</italic> radiology at routine medical examination, reflecting the relatively high and unusually low sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF and radiological screening, respectively, in gold miners.</p><p>Our analyses suggest that tuberculosis incidence in gold mines may decrease substantially by introducing several interventions simultaneously. Tuberculosis morbidity declined rapidly during the Alaskan IPT trials, which were accompanied by greatly intensified case-finding and treatment (<xref rid="KWU320C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The reductions attributable to any given intervention will be setting specific. The predicted impact of reducing treatment delay could be large in gold mines that have high losses to treatment following tuberculosis diagnosis and high transmission rates, but minimal elsewhere.</p><p>The lack of a detectable impact in Thibela TB strongly suggests that IPT cures a small proportion of latent infections in gold miners. With optimized IPT uptake and retention, as well as case-screening and treatment delays, an increased (albeit nondurable) impact might have been seen. Effective tuberculosis control in gold mines and other high incidence settings requires a combination prevention approach, including health systems improvements to minimize treatment delay, improved diagnostics, increased and improved ART coverage, and effective durable preventive treatment regimens.</p></sec>
