In total, 345 rehabilitation patients (aged 84&#x000b1;7 years, 72% women) were allocated, according to bed availability, to either an intervention or a control ward. Nurses on the intervention ward attended a short class on nutrition and were supervised in nutritional care by trained nurses. In the intervention unit, the nursing staff identified patients at risk of undernutrition through systematic assessment of risk factors, e.g. body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;24 kgm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, and treated them according to individual care plans.

Lack of training and understanding about dietary requirements and food provision were given as reasons for inadequate nutritional care in Danish hospitals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>. Rasmussen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> found that nearly 40% of patients (<italic>n</italic>=590, median age 71&#x02009;years) were at nutritional risk and few of the patients were identified, indicating that no systematic assessment was applied.</p><p>The main goal in geriatric rehabilitation is to improve functional status, e.g. activities of daily living (ADL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>. Therefore, it is important to conduct studies that can clarify whether improvement in nutritional status influences functional status, e.g. as measured by ADL. Several studies have examined the effect of nutritional supplementation in elderly patients. It has been concluded that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref> evidence is weak about the effects of nutritional supplements on improvement in clinical outcome, functional benefit or reduction in length of hospital stay. A recent meta-analysis pointed out that in short-term care supplementation may lead to fewer complications and reduced mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>.</p><p>The present study addresses the issue of nutritional assessment and intervention in patients in a geriatric rehabilitation clinic, examining the effects in terms of nutritional and ADL status of a targeted individualized nursing intervention in patients at risk of undernutrition.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Participants and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Patients</title><p>The study included 345 patients (248 women, 97 men), mean age 83.6&#x02009;years (SD 7.4), admitted consecutively to a Geriatric Rehabilitation Clinic in Copenhagen over 13&#x02009;months. Patients hospitalized for less than 8&#x02009;days (<italic>n</italic>=20), discharged to other clinics (<italic>n</italic>=37) or who died (<italic>n</italic>=29) before discharge were excluded. All patients were admitted to the hospital from their own homes. Seventy-three per cent were discharged to their own homes, 6% to nursing homes and 9% to other departments, 7% died and in 5% discharge destination was unknown. The average hospital stay in the geriatric clinic was 33&#x02009;days (median 26&#x02009;days). Patients were admitted to the geriatric clinic after review by a specialist in geriatric medicine in the acute ward, in other wards in the hospital, or in their own homes. The primary reason for admission was the need for evaluation and rehabilitation (51%). The most frequent medical diagnoses (often in combination) were: sequelae after stroke, cardiac insufficiency, hypertension and pneumonia. Half of the patients had cognitive problems.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Study design</title><p>The design was quasi-experimental using a pre&#x02013;post-test design with non-equivalent groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>. The power calculation was based on (i) the hypothesis that weight gain would lead to improvement in ADL function and (ii) difference in changes between the intervention and control groups. Since a previous study (10, p. 295) had found the same improvement on the Barthel index by geriatric rehabilitation at all basic levels of ADL function (without nutritional intervention), there was reason to believe that this heterogeneous patient population would benefit further from nutritional intervention. Assuming a level of significance of 0.05 and a relative treatment effect of 30% improvement for the predefined outcome variable modified Barthel index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref> and an arbitrary standard deviation of 1.2 (log-scale), this gave a power of 0.9 to detect a treatment effect with 160 patients in each group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>.</p><p>The head nurse allocated incoming patients according to bed availability to one of two similar units, each comprising 22 beds. The nurse had no information about the patient's nutritional status. The intervention and control units did not differ with respect to the nurses&#x02019; age, extent of experience or experience in geriatric nursing, or in the distribution of registered nurses and nursing auxiliaries. To avoid the possible spillover effect from intervention to control unit, the nurses in the control unit were told not to change anything in their procedures and daily practice with regard to nutritional care. There was no interchange of nurses between the two wards. Besides nurses, the interdisciplinary staff comprised physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and social workers. The interdisciplinary staff did not differ between the two units regarding age, gender and experience. They did not take part in the nutritional care unless asked to do so by the occupational therapists who trained patients with functional eating problems or by the physicians who prescribed commercial nutritional supplements at discharge. The authors did not have access to dietitiants in this study.</p></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>Context</title><p>The units were located next to each other with a corridor between the units. The standard nutritional procedures at the start of the study were similar in the two units and comprised five to six, non-preplated meals (three main meals and two or three snack meals) that were prepared in the hospital kitchen and served by the nurses in a dining room. The energy, protein, carbohydrate and fat content of both the main meals and the snack meals was calculated by the kitchen staff. The dinner, served at 18.00&#x02009;h, consisted of a main dish and a dessert. For breakfast and lunch the patients could choose between different types of food, e.g. bread with cheese, porridge, yoghurt, a small warm dish or sandwich spread. The snack meals consisted of, for example, home-made supplements (drinks and puddings) based on milk and eggs, commercial protein and energy drinks and puddings, cookies, ice-cream and cocoa with whipped cream. The meals were served at approximately 08.00, 10.00 and 12.00&#x02009;h, and at 15.00, 18.00 and 21.00&#x02009;h. At-risk patients had a diet consisting of 9000&#x02009;kJ with fat-energy of 50% and protein-energy of 18%. All other patients had a diet with fat-energy of 40% and protein-energy of 18% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>. The dining room was comfortable and aired before meals. The nurses were responsible for the patients&#x02019; nutritional care and for assessment of ADL status.</p></sec><sec id="S20006"><title>Nursing interventions</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">1</xref> shows the nursing actions in the two units. Before the study period, nurses in the intervention unit attended a 90&#x02009;min lecture given individually or in small groups by an experienced nurse (IP), on the symptoms, consequences, risk factors, prevention and treatment of undernutrition. Furthermore, the nurses were trained in assessing nutritional status, including diet registration, examining oral and dental status, and enquiring about nutrition-related problems. Photographs were used to recognize oral and dental problems as well as the portion sizes of hot meals. As two of the authors (IP, HVP) participated in the clinical work the nurses were supervised on a daily basis throughout the study.

Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the interaction between gender and treatment unit. Three-way was used to analyse the effect of intervention: difference in weight, BMI and Barthel index changes.

Thus, nutritional training of nurses showed no benefits. However, there was a positive association between improved nutritional status and enhanced ADL functions.</p><p>The patients matched the description of geriatric patients in the Nordic countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref> and their age and functional status were comparative to other geriatric patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>. However, their nutritional status was better than in most controlled nutritional intervention studies in corresponding patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>. The patients had an average BMI of 24.1 on admission. This relatively good nutritional status and the fact that patients included were selected mainly for rehabilitation purposes may mean that an effect of intervention is less likely than in patients with acute somatic disorders. In most intervention studies in elderly hospitalized patients where effects of supplementation have been reported the patients had a lower BMI, e.g. &#x0003c;20, from the start <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>. Thus, the potential for improvement in elderly patients&#x02019; nutritional status may be influenced by the status on admission. The two units were geographically placed close together. The nurses in the control unit knew what was happening; despite the fact that they were supposed not to change their practices, they may have focused unintentionally on nutritional care, leading to changed practice. The focus on nutritional care in general may also have increased the focus on identifying patents at risk of undernutrition in the control unit. Thus, the intervention may of itself have standardized the level of nutritional care in both units. Compared with observational studies where many patients lose weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>, the control patients in this study were weight stable, which indicates that the quality of the standardized nutritional care might have been above average.</p><p>Randomization of patients to the two units was impossible, for the reasons explained in the methods section. Instead, a quasi-experimental design was used. The strength of this design in comparison with a true experiment, i.e. a randomized trial, depends on the similarities between the experimental and control groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>. To comply with this, the most widely used quasi-experimental design: the pre&#x02013;post-test design with non-equivalent groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>, was used. The pre-test was conducted at baseline to detect whether there were signs of selection bias due to the distribution of patients to the intervention and the control unit. The difference reported occurred at random. The nurses&#x02019; age, years of experience and experience in geriatric nursing, and the proportion of registered nurses and auxiliary nurses were also tested, without finding any significant differences. Thus, the pre-test showed that the two units were comparable in relation to the chosen variables.</p><p>In the power estimation, an estimated standard deviation in the improvement of Barthel index was used in the absence of real values. The real standard deviation in this study turned out to be 24 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0002">2</xref>), indicating a large variation within the sample, and thus a larger sample would have been needed to obtain the assumed power of the intervention. Thus, a post hoc calculation was done based on the observed standard derivation. For an unchanged measure of effect (30% risk reduction) with a power of 0.90, the study should have included 325 patients in each group.</p><p>The cut-off for being at risk of malnutrition, i.e. BMI &#x0003c;24, was chosen as suggested by Beck and Ovesen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>. In the present study, the aim was to prevent undernutrition, therefore lower BMI cut-off limits were not used. According to the Swedish National Board for Health and Welfare, BMI should be 24&#x02013;29 in elderly people and BMI &#x0003c;22 indicates underweight in elderly people <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>. As described above, 55% of the population with BMI &#x0003c;24 on admission had a weight gain of 0.5&#x02009;kg, whereas patients with BMI &#x02265;&#x02009;24 had a weight loss of 0.7&#x02009;kg. This may partly be ascribed to the effect of &#x0201c;regression towards the mean&#x0201d;, but may also indicate that a BMI of 24 is appropriate as a cut-off for at-risk patients. In a randomized controlled trial, where the effect of supplements was examined in a group of elderly discharged patients, BMI &#x02264;24 was also used as the inclusion criterion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>. In that study no significant difference in weight was found between the intervention and the control group, but the intervention group showed a significant increase in handgrip strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref>.</p><p>A weight loss of 5% within the last month was, however, not effective as an indicator of nutritional risk, because the patients in general could not give reliable information. Instead, the diet registration, evaluation of 3&#x02009;days&#x02019; nutritional intake and assessment of nutrition-elated variables, including oral status, were used to identify patients at risk of undernutrition.</p><p>The study excluded only patients who died or were referred to other wards. However, as discussed above, this may mean that less well patients with better chances for benefit from intervention were excluded. Previous studies where food supplements have shown an effect have excluded patients with poor compliance or who declined to participate. Larsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref> excluded 56 patients (11%), Potter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref> excluded 107 (18%) non-participating patients and Volkert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">31</xref> excluded 40 out of 72 patients, reflecting a great risk of selection bias in those studies compared with the present study.</p><p>The improvement in ADL status in both units indicates that, according to Mahoney et al., the patients generally improved from &#x0201c;being in need of some help&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;being able to manage most ADL tasks&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>. No significant difference in improvement due to the intervention was found. However, there was a significant association between weight gain and improvement in ADL status. This was a limited increase of 5.6 points on the Barthel index. For the individual patient this may sound irrelevant; however, it means, for example, an increase in the ability to walk up stairs or visit the toilet, which may contribute to the possibility of living independently and thus have an impact on the patient's quality of life. This observation stresses the need for integrating good nutritional care in geriatric rehabilitation, despite the fact that this study could not demonstrate any difference between patients in the two units.</p><p>In conclusion, this study could not show any effects of tailored nursing focusing on nutritional care that were not already obtained by good routine nursing care in this group of geriatric patients. Contributory factors may be that the patients were in a good nutritional state at the start and that the nurses in the control unit focused on nutrition as much as nurses in the intervention unit. The association between weight gain and improvement in ADL status indicates that good nutritional care should be an integrated tool in geriatric rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all patients and interdisciplinary staff in the geriatric clinic where the study was carried out.
