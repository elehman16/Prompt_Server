The aim of the study was to assess the (a) use, (b) acceptability and (c) impact of booklets for students in primary (10&#x02013;11&#x000a0;years) and secondary school (12&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years) alone and in conjunction with funding for targeted mental health support. This was a 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial, in which 846 schools in England were randomly allocated to receive/not receive: (1) booklets for students containing information on mental health self-management and help seeking, and (2) funding for mental health support as part of a national mental health initiative. 14,690 students (8139 primary, 6551 secondary) provided self-report on mental health, quality of life (baseline and 1&#x000a0;year follow-up) and help seeking (follow-up). (a) Approximately, 40&#x000a0;% primary school students and 20&#x000a0;% secondary school students reported seeing the booklets. (b) Of these, 87&#x000a0;% of primary school students reported that the booklet was &#x02018;very helpful&#x02019; or &#x02018;quite helpful&#x02019;, compared with 73&#x000a0;% in secondary school. (c) There was no detectable impact of booklets on mental health, quality of life or help seeking, either alone or in conjunction with additional funding through the national mental health initiative. Lack of discernable impact of booklets underscores the need for caution in adopting such an approach. However, it is feasible that the impact was obscured by low uptake or that booklets may be more effective when used in a targeted way.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00787-016-0889-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Self-management</kwd><kwd>Help seeking</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>Mental health promotion</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000829</institution-id><institution>Department for Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mental health problems in childhood and adolescence are associated with low quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and poor academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and forecast longer-term difficulties, including mental health problems throughout adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Half of all lifetime mental illness has an onset by age 14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], making the pre- and early adolescent years particularly pivotal for intervention.</p><p>Helping to support positive mental health and resilience in schools is a key priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and finding low-cost means to do so is a particular imperative in times of austerity and cuts in services. Mental health promotion activities in schools&#x02013;&#x02013;particularly those targeted at children at risk of mental health problems&#x02013;&#x02013;have been shown to be effective in improving well-being and mental health, although the quality of evaluations in schools is recognised as being poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Access to these types of interventions may be hindered by low mental health literacy and stigmatising attitudes towards mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The provision of booklets and other forms of information have been recommended as potential low-cost routes for promoting improved recognition of mental health symptoms in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Increased knowledge about mental health problems has also been shown to be associated with improved self-management, such as appropriate help seeking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Given the potential for wide dissemination of information booklets, even very small effects of this type of intervention may translate into meaningful impact on mental health and well-being at the population level. However, rigorous evaluation is needed to determine whether this is indeed the case.</p><p>As part of a major government-sponsored initiative across England to support improved mental health provision in schools, the UK government implemented the &#x000a3;60 million Targeted Mental Health in Schools (TaMHS) programme in 2008. Selected schools in every local (government) authority (LA) in England were funded to provide targeted support for children at risk of developing mental health problems. The initiative did not stipulate how the funds were to be allocated, as long as local programmes were in line with two core principles: choosing interventions informed by evidence, and promoting strategic integration across agencies. As such, a wide range of interventions were implemented, including peer support, individual therapy, training and information for parents, and training and support for school staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The impact of the TaMHS programme was evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which LAs were randomly allocated to immediate TaMHS provision or to a one-year wait-list control condition. Results of the RCT indicated that the TaMHS group had better behavioural outcomes in primary school than the wait-list controls, though no such group differences emerged for emotional outcomes or on any outcomes in secondary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Given the known barriers to children accessing mental health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], this study also examined whether there might be ways to augment the impact of this targeted support. In addition to the main RCT, schools were randomly allocated to receive student booklets that were designed to increase basic psychoeducation and mental health awareness, to draw on evidence about simple self-management approaches, as well as to provide information about how to access support. The self-management content drew on principles and activities from low-intensity evidence-based interventions, including cognitive-behavioural therapy [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and positive psychology interventions [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, activities delineated in the booklets included ways to relax when feeling stressed, such as progressive muscle relaxation, and listing, in writing, three good things that happen each day. These activities were designed to be applicable universally, meaning that the booklets could be used as a general mental health promotion tool, or employed in a more targeted way with children facing particular challenges.</p><p>Two booklets (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were created with young people&#x02019;s input on content and design: &#x0201c;<italic>How to Get Up and Go When You&#x02019;re Feeling Low&#x0201d;</italic> was aimed at young people in primary school (aged 8&#x02013;11) and &#x0201c;<italic>I Gotta Feeling&#x0201d;</italic> was aimed at young people in secondary schools (aged 11&#x02013;14). The hypothesis was that these booklets would themselves increase help seeking (i.e. direct effect) and/or amplify positive effects of TaMHS provision on help seeking in those schools in which the availability of specialist support was being improved (i.e. interactive effect). Thus, the 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 factorial nature of this RCT design (i.e. TaMHS/no TaMHS and booklets/no booklets) positioned us to evaluate the impact of these booklets, both independently and in conjunction with TaMHS provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study was a hierarchical cluster randomised control trial with a 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2 factorial design. Participants were clustered within schools and then within LAs. Randomisation occurred in two stages: first, LAs were randomised in a 1.5:1 allocation to receive or not to receive TaMHS funding; second, schools within those LAs were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to receive or not to receive booklets. The trial protocol was not registered, but details of the full protocol, including outcomes not addressed in this manuscript, are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>Ethical permission for the study was granted by the University College London Research Ethics Committee. Randomisation by random number generator was conducted independently from the research team that enrolled participants and carried out the analysis. Assessments were completed by students at baseline (prior to school level randomization) and post-intervention (1&#x000a0;year later). At all assessment points, students were blind to their condition. Parental consent (opt out) and student assent (opt in) were sought prior to each data collection point. Students completed assessments using a secure online system during their usual school day. Teachers facilitated the completion of the survey by reading a standardised information sheet to participating children outlining what the questionnaire was about, the confidentiality of their answers and their right to decline participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were students from primary to secondary schools in England. Students were eligible to participate if they attended year 4 (age 8&#x02013;9) or year 7 (age 11&#x02013;12) in a participating school, had parental consent and provided assent. Participating schools were selected by the 75 LAs taking part in the TaMHS initiative (i.e. not by the evaluation team). The only inclusion criterion was that schools be state funded.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> outlines the flow of participants through this trial. Of the 75 LAs involved, 45 were allocated to receive TaMHS funding, with the remaining 30 forming a one-year wait-list control group. Two LAs from the wait-list control arm dropped out of the trial at this point. After baseline assessment in 2009, participating schools could then opt out from school-level randomisation to further conditions. Hence, 486 schools were randomly allocated to one of the two booklets conditions. This resulted in four arms of the current evaluation, with schools receiving (1) both TaMHS and booklets (TaMHS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;booklets, 162 schools), (2) just TaMHS (TaMHS only, 162 schools), (3) just booklets (Booklets only, 76 schools) and (4) neither TaMHS nor booklets (No intervention, 77 schools). As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 8139 primary school students and 6551 secondary school students provided both baseline and post-intervention assessments and were, therefore, included in the analysis. No data were collected regarding reason for drop out/non-response from schools or students.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing flow of participants through the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="787_2016_889_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p>Of these 8139 primary school participants, 49.8&#x000a0;% were female, 74.3&#x000a0;% White, 10.9&#x000a0;% Asian, 7.7&#x000a0;% Black, 4.6&#x000a0;% Mixed and 2.5&#x000a0;% other ethnic groups or unclassified. Compared with 2009 national averages for primary school students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this sample slightly over-represented Black students (national average&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.9&#x000a0;%) and under-represented White students (national average&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;79.2&#x000a0;%). As a measure of economic deprivation, 24.8&#x000a0;% were eligible for free school meals (FSM), as compared with the 16.0&#x000a0;% national average for this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Of the 6551 secondary school students included in analysis, 48.9&#x000a0;% were female, 80.7&#x000a0;% White, 6.0&#x000a0;% Asian, 6.6&#x000a0;% Black, 4.5&#x000a0;% mixed, 2.3&#x000a0;% other ethnic groups or unclassified and 18.8&#x000a0;% FSM eligible. The proportion of participants in different ethnic groups is within 2&#x000a0;% of 2009 national norms for secondary school students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The sample, however, over-represented children eligible for FSM (national average&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13.3&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>TaMHS provision</title><p>As described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], TaMHS provision consisted of funding and support to enhance the existing provision for mental health support in schools. The funding could be used in different ways (e.g. to fund training, recruitment of staff), as determined by local agreement, and in accordance with principles of evidence-based practice (though this was not monitored) and organisational collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Booklets</title><p>Booklets (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were sent to an identified pastoral lead in those schools assigned to the booklet condition, along with general advice on how they could be used and the age group for which they were relevant. An electronic version of the booklets was also provided to schools in order to facilitate use in classrooms. Confirmation was received from schools on receiving the booklets. The schools were issued guidance to distribute and use the booklets as they deemed best, including placement in the school library, distribution in class or incorporation into relevant lessons such as personal, social and health education. Although students were asked whether they saw the booklets (to assess uptake, see below), it is important to note that we do not know whether or how they were distributed in school, or the context in which they were used. Copies of the booklets are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ebpu/publications/children">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ebpu/publications/children</ext-link> and hard copies can be requested from http://ebpu@annafreud.org.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measures</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Demographic information</title><p>Student ethnicity, gender and free school meal eligibility, the latter serving as a measure of deprivation, were obtained from the National Pupil Database and matched to self-report outcomes.

Students were shown pictures of five booklets and asked to report if they had seen them. The five booklets included: (1) the primary and secondary intervention booklets from this trial, (2) two other genuine booklets available in the UK but not distributed as part of the current evaluation study (<italic>Young Minds</italic> booklet and <italic>Take Action</italic> booklet), and (3) a sham booklet (that did not exist) constructed for the purposes of determining uptake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Booklet acceptability</title><p>If a student endorsed having seen a booklet, s/he was asked whether s/he had found the booklet to be very helpful, quite helpful or not helpful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Booklet impact</title><p>Mental health, quality of life and help seeking were assessed to evaluate impact. These were measured pre- and post-intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Mental health</title><p>Mental health was assessed at pre- and post-intervention by completion of the Me and My School Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which consists of a 10-item emotional difficulties subscale (e.g. &#x0201c;I worry a lot&#x0201d;, alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.70&#x02212;0.77) and a 6-item behavioural difficulties subscale (e.g. &#x0201c;I get very angry&#x0201d;, alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.78&#x02212;0.80). Students responded to each item by endorsing the response options: never, sometimes, always. Validation studies of the Me and My School Questionnaire, which was developed for the TaMHS evaluation, provide evidence of its robust psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Quality of life</title><p>Quality of life was assessed at pre- and post-intervention, using nine of 10 items from the self-report KIDSCREEN-10 measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. KIDSCREEN-10 measures health-related quality of life and includes items such as &#x0201c;have you felt fit and well&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;have you been able to do the things that you wanted to do in your free time&#x0201d;. (One excluded item concerned parental relations and home life: &#x0201c;Have your parent(s) treated you fairly?&#x0201d;). The full KIDSCREEN-10 has strong psychometric properties in large studies of European children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In these samples, internal consistency of the nine item measure was 0.73&#x02013;0.77. In the current sample, it ranged from 0.75 to 0.78 across measurement occasions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Help seeking</title><p>Helpseeking behaviour was assessed using three items at post-intervention, asking students how frequently they sought help in the past year, because they had been &#x02018;sad, stressed or angry&#x02019;, from (1) a counsellor, (2) a peer mentor or (3) another source in school. Responses were on a four-point scale (never, once, a few times, more than five times).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>All analyses were conducted using STATA12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Use and acceptability of booklets were examined using chi squared analysis comparing the likelihood of (a) seeing the booklets and (b) finding them helpful across the four conditions. Impact outcomes were examined using mixed-effects models that accounted for the nested structure of the data (i.e. students in schools, schools in LAs). In addition to the main effects of the intervention condition, the models included the baseline score for the efficacy outcome and socio-demographic variables that varied between the arms (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Impact on help seeking was examined using logistic mixed-effects models (never sought help vs. sought help at least once). All analyses were based on intention-to-treat (i.e. based on assigned arms rather than receipt of the intervention), and alpha was set to 0.01 in light of the large sample size.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the samples in the different arms of the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left" colspan="5">Primary school</th><th align="left" colspan="5">Secondary school</th></tr><tr><th align="left">TaMHS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;booklet</th><th align="left">Booklet only</th><th align="left">TaMHS only</th><th align="left">No intervention</th><th align="left">Test (<italic>df</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3)</th><th align="left">TaMHS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;booklet</th><th align="left">Booklet only</th><th align="left">TaMHS only</th><th align="left">No intervention</th><th align="left">Test (<italic>df</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Gender (% female)</td><td align="left">50.2</td><td align="left">49.1</td><td align="left">49.8</td><td align="left">50.2</td><td align="left">

</p><p>As outlined in the introduction, because the TaMHS provision was specifically targeted at those experiencing or at risk of mental health problems, we also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore whether effects were different for children above the at-risk threshold for mental health symptoms (as defined by being above the cut-off on either scale of the pre-intervention mental health measure).</p><p>To examine missing data, we compared baseline characteristics of those pupils who did and did not provide data at post-intervention.

The key finding&#x02013;&#x02013;that there was no discernable impact of the booklets on mental health, quality of life or help seeking&#x02013;&#x02013;is of relevance when considering provision of resources to support such an approach and may indicate the need for caution in recommending it. Given the low intensity of this intervention, the lack of impact for booklets alone is perhaps unsurprising. However, there was also no evidence that the booklets enhanced the previously documented mental health benefits of the broader TaHMS initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

The booklets evaluated in this study aimed to promote such self-management by drawing on evidence-based approaches to promoting well-being. The lack of impact suggests that using booklets as a medium to convey these self-management strategies is not effective.</p><p>We should temper our conclusions by highlighting the fact that we did not have direct records regarding booklet usage. An unfortunate, but necessary, compromise in a study of this scale was the limited&#x000a0;depth of data collected from any school or individual&#x000a0;child. This means that the current pragmatic study design cannot untangle the impact of uptake&#x000a0;or the type of use&#x000a0;from the efficacy of the materials themselves. Although students were significantly more likely to report seeing the booklets in the schools where they were provided, we do not know whether the booklets were read or the information in them was used. It may be that the impact of the booklets by those who used them was obscured by limited usage overall. It is also plausible that the booklets would be more effective when used in a targeted way (e.g. with the support of the pastoral care team) rather than simply being made available for students to pick up. Whilst there were no differences in primary schools, in secondary schools, children at risk of mental health problems were slightly more likely to report seeing the booklets compared with low-risk children. However, the absolute differences between the arms were small, thus suggesting that in general the booklets were not being used in a targeted way. Given that we do not have information on how the booklets were used, the results of this trial do not preclude that booklets of this kind <italic>could</italic> be beneficial when used in particular ways (e.g. in some contexts, with some pupils). However, the results do suggest that a universal, non-directed delivery (i.e. sending booklets to schools to be used however is deemed appropriate) is unlikely to be a fruitful approach.</p><p>A second notable finding was that there were clear differences in the uptake and acceptability of the booklets between the primary and secondary school samples. Recall that children in primary school were both more likely to report having seen the booklet, implying perhaps that they were being used more widely, and more likely to endorse the booklets as being helpful compared with their secondary school counterparts. This finding may reflect age differences in responses biases (e.g. potentially younger children are biased towards providing favourable feedback), but could suggest that a booklet-based approach is more suitable for this younger-age group. It could be that younger children are more open to the medium generally, that they liked the content of this booklet specifically, or that the booklets were being used in a different way with younger children that favourably impacted acceptability. In both the primary and secondary samples, the booklets were less likely to be viewed as being helpful by the children at risk of mental health problems. There would seem to be a need for better understanding of what types of support materials might be suitable and acceptable for different children, and whether this finding is specific to the booklets evaluated here or applies more generally.</p><p>This study builds on existing work in a number of ways. First, the use of a rigorous study design and very large sample size provides the statistical power to detect small effects that perhaps should be expected from a universal intervention approach such as information provision. It is thus unlikely that the reported null findings reflect a lack of power. Second, rather than examining changes in knowledge [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we focused on mental health symptoms, quality of life and helpseeking behaviour. This was a conservative approach, as changes in knowledge may take time to translate into behaviour change, but one which does focus on clinically salient outcomes.</p><p>Future work could helpfully explore the potential impact of other low-cost, high-volume initiatives, such as information booklets, on a broader range of outcomes, including increasing awareness and understanding of mental health difficulties, which were not the focus of the current study; utilization of new technologies such as social media is also worth considering. Ensuring that it is possible to monitor the uptake and use of these types of interventions will be essential for interpreting findings (especially null results). It may be worth nesting smaller, more focused, studies within larger evaluations to explore how materials are actually being put into use. In line with calls to better assess harms in evaluations of psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], future work should also assess a wider range of potential harms, such as stigmatisation or bullying. Given the disparity between perceived helpfulness and the efficacy outcomes, at least in the primary school sample, it would also be useful to conduct a more in-depth study examining students&#x02019; views on the booklets than was possible in the current research. This could provide clearer indication as to what underlies the lack of impact in this evaluation. Finally, as noted above, it will be important to explore whether we can identify approaches or contexts in which the use of information booklets is useful, such as when being used in collaboration with pastoral staff, or as part of a broader health promotion curriculum.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results of this RCT suggest that the widespread provision of information booklets aiming to increase self-management and help seeking for mental health problems in young people is not an effective strategy when booklets are simply made available in schools. Instead, alternative low-cost approaches need to be explored. We hope this work will stimulate future rigorous evaluation of similar interventions, to ensure that what appear to be low-cost, high-volume initiatives are not rolled out without suitable evidence for their effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
