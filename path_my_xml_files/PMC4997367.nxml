However, the overnight protein-induced lipolytic actions and mechanism for improved metabolism and body composition have not been fully established. Therefore, in a crossover design, twelve obese men (age, 27.0 &#x000b1; 2.2 years) were randomly assigned to ingest (within 30 min of sleep) casein protein (CAS, 120 kcal) or a non-nutritive placebo (PLA) before going to sleep. Markers of fat metabolism (lipolysis, substrate utilization, growth hormone), insulin, glucose, resting energy expenditure (REE), and appetite (questionnaire and ghrelin) were measured. During sleep and the next morning, interstitial glycerol from the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) was measured using microdialysis. There were no differences in SCAAT glycerol (overnight: CAS, 177.4 &#x000b1; 26.7; PLA, 183.8 &#x000b1; 20.2 &#x003bc;mol/L; morning: CAS, 171.6 &#x000b1; 19.1; PLA, 161.5 &#x000b1; 18.6 &#x003bc;mol/L), substrate utilization, REE, or any blood markers between CAS and PLA. Desire to eat was greater for CAS compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03), but not different from PLA (baseline: 39 &#x000b1; 6, CAS: 62 &#x000b1; 8, PLA: 55 &#x000b1; 5 mm). CAS consumption before sleep did not affect fat or glucose metabolism, REE, or suppress appetite in hyperinsulemic obese men. CAS may be consumed before sleep without impeding overnight or morning fat metabolism in young, obese men.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nighttime eating</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>microdialysis</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>casein</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-nutrients-08-00452"><title>1.

However, recent data on the health impact of nighttime eating suggests that our understanding of this practice may need modification based on the criteria used to identify late night eating (e.g., majority of daily intake solely at night, consumed during a specified time frame at night, includes dinner, or minutes before bedtime), as well as the content (percent carbohydrate vs. fat vs. protein) and quality (glycemic index) of calories consumed during this period [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Recent work [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] suggests that low-calorie (~150 kcals), protein-rich sources may be beneficial or non-detrimental to metabolism, health, and body composition when consumed as a snack ~30 min before going to sleep acutely (one-night) [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and when combined with exercise for a longer duration (i.e., 4&#x02013;12 weeks) [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In general, protein ingestion suppresses appetite, increases energy expenditure and muscle mass, and decreases body fat [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], encouraging support for ingesting protein-rich foods before going to sleep. Casein protein (CAS) has been designated as an optimal bedtime snack because it is slow to digest and augments muscle protein synthesis [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] making it ideal for pre-sleep ingestion. Indeed, data show that acute CAS intake (30&#x02013;40 g per serving), compared to a non-nutritive placebo, is properly digested/absorbed and increases overnight muscle protein synthesis when provided before sleep [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that casein before bed elevates next morning resting energy expenditure (REE) more than a non-nutritive placebo, but does not inhibit fat oxidation, as observed with other proteins and macronutrients relative to placebo, in normal-weight men [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may suggest that casein before bed may not negatively impair fat metabolism relative to fasting and therefore may be appropriate to consume in close proximity to sleep. Studies in obese women have demonstrated that CAS ingestion before sleep can increase next morning satiety and, augment REE from baseline, however no differences were detected between casein and calorically-matched whey protein or carbohydrate ingestion [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, regardless of macronutrient type, acute elevations in insulin and insulin resistance have been observed the morning after pre-sleep caloric intake in obese women [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While the latter finding is not ideal for obese populations, it is important to note that a true non-nutritive placebo was absent and food intake throughout the day was not well controlled [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is possible that the habitual diet during the day could have confounded the effects of nighttime macronutrient ingestion on next morning insulin and, hence, deserves further attention.</p><p>The potential mechanisms for improved metabolism and body composition have not been fully explored. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated mechanisms by which pre-sleep protein ingestion alters body fat (i.e., lipolysis) during sleep. Elucidating these mechanisms may be clinically relevant especially for obese individuals as eating the wrong foods at the wrong time (i.e., late at night before sleep) may contribute to increases in body fat and obesity [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Upper body subcutaneous fat depots are the predominate suppliers of circulating free fatty acids during the overnight postabsorptive period [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and investigating changes in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis with microdialysis during sleep provides a novel opportunity to explore changes in regional fat metabolism that may ensue as a result of bedtime protein ingestion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of CAS consumption before sleep on SCAAT lipolysis, whole-body substrate utilization, growth hormone, insulin, glucose, and REE compared to consumption of a non-nutritive placebo (PLA) in obese men. Based on our earlier work showing no differences in morning fat oxidation following bedtime CAS as compared to PLA ingestion in normal weight men [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we hypothesized that CAS and PLA would yield similar changes in SCAAT lipolysis, whole-body substrate utilization (favoring fat oxidation), growth hormone, insulin and glucose in obese men. We also hypothesized that CAS prior to sleep will increase next morning REE more than PLA, as previously reported [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By measuring SCAAT lipolysis with microdialysis and whole-body fat oxidation, we examined the mechanisms by which CAS consumption before sleep may mediate changes in metabolism and body composition. In addition, we also decided to explore the effect of CAS before sleep on subjective feelings of appetite and explore potential mechanisms for these changes, if any, by measuring ghrelin, an appetite hormone. Others have shown that nutrient ingestion prior to sleep may suppress next morning appetite [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but no studies have explored mediating mechanisms. Likewise, whether this holds true in obese men is unknown. It was hypothesized that CAS will decrease appetite to a significantly greater extent than PLA while its effect on ghrelin is exploratory.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-08-00452"><title>2.

Participants reported to the Institute of Sport Sciences and Medicine at Florida State University on five occasions: once at baseline (morning) and twice (evening and the following morning) during each of the two trial periods. These trial periods were separated by a minimum of 48 h to a maximum of two weeks from one another and the first trial occurred within a week of the baseline visit. All of the morning visits (including baseline), started at 06:00&#x02013;06:30 h while all of the evening visits started at 18:00&#x02013;18:30 h.

An overview of the trial period is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00452-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Participants were instructed to avoid consuming any meal-replacement beverages (described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot3-nutrients-08-00452">Section 2.2.3</xref>) at least one hour prior to their scheduled evening laboratory visit. Upon arrival to the laboratory for their evening visit participants rested in a semi-recumbent position while researchers sterilized an area ~10 cm from the umbilicus (on the side not typically slept on). Thereafter, the sterilized insertion site was numbed with a topical ethyl chloride spray (Gebauer&#x02019;s ethyl chloride<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Gebauer Company, Cleveland, OH, USA), and two sterilized microdialysis probes (CMA 20 Elite, 10 mm membrane length, 20-kDa cutoff, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston, MA, USA) were inserted into the SCAAT (5 cm apart). Following probe insertion, a 60-min equilibration period commenced to allow for the initial disturbance from probe insertion to subside. Each probe was attached to separate portable microdialysis pumps (CMA 107, M Dialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) that were continuously perfused at 2.0 &#x003bc;L/min or 0.3 &#x003bc;L/min with a solution (perfusate) containing 0.9% sodium chloride (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) and approximately 10 mM ethanol (290 &#x003bc;L of 100% ethanol injected into a 500 mL sodium chloride IV bag). The pumped perfusate was collected in vials at the exit end of each probe (dialysate) according to the sample collection schedule outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00452-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Each dialysate sample collection shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00452-f001">Figure 1</xref> represents the time when the vials were attached to the exit end of each probe. The five vials were worn consecutively and for the following durations: (1) worn immediately post-equilibration for 30 min; (2) worn 30 min post-equilibration until &#x02264;30 min before bed; (3) worn &#x02264;30 min before bed until waking (overnight); (4) worn upon waking until arrival at the laboratory (next morning); and (5) worn upon arrival to laboratory until the cessation of their morning visit in which the probes were removed (~1 h after arrival). The dialysate samples of interest were the overnight and immediate next morning samples (sample Collections 3 and 4).</p><p>During the equilibration period, participants were provided with verbal and written instructions for the remainder of the evening and into the next morning with regard to changing their sample collection vials, adjusting perfusion flow rates and consuming their nighttime supplement. Immediately prior to leaving the laboratory, the first sample collection vial was attached to collect dialysate outflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-08-00452-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Upon leaving the laboratory (while the first vial was attached), participants were allowed to go through their normal evening activities, which were self-reported to include watching TV, completing school work, and other sedentary behaviors. They were also instructed not to consume any remaining meal-replacement beverages until 30 min after their departure from the laboratory. Thereafter, participants were instructed to consume any remaining meal-replacement beverages at least two hours before they went to bed to ensure that it would digested prior to them consuming their nighttime supplement. While away from the laboratory, participants were asked to store all collection vials in the refrigerator (storage container provided). The following morning (between 06:00 and 06:30 h), participants returned to the laboratory with their dialysate samples on ice. Samples were stored at 4 &#x000b0;C until subsequent (within 24 h) analysis for ethanol to determine blood flow [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Briefly, the estimated interstitial concentrations were calculated by first plotting log transformed dialysate concentrations measured at 0.3 and 2.0 &#x003bc;L/min against their respective perfusion rates. Linear regression analysis was used to extrapolate the dialysate concentration to that at zero perfusion flow (0 &#x003bc;L/min), which corresponds to the true interstitial concentration. The in vivo recovery rate for each probe was determined as the ratio between the dialysate concentrations at a perfusion rate of 0.3 or 2.0 &#x003bc;L/min and the calculated interstitial concentrations at zero flow [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since the PLA was non-caloric and, hence, mimicked fasting, the in vivo recoveries from the placebo trial for glycerol and glucose were used as a reference point in the calculation of estimate interstitial concentrations for both trials. All interstitial concentrations at 0.3 and 2.0 &#x003bc;L/min were calculated by Equation (2):

During perfusion, ethanol diffuses through the probe membrane and its removal from the local area is related to blood flow in the vicinity of the probe membrane because ethanol is not metabolized in adipose tissue to any significant extent [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Perfusate samples were collected at the evening visit prior to attaching the pump to the participant and at the next morning visit after detaching from the participant.

Discussion</title><p>The present study is the first to examine the effect of acute pre-sleep CAS consumption on markers of fat metabolism (lipolysis, substrate utilization, and growth hormone), REE, insulin, glucose, and appetite (subjective and ghrelin) compared to PLA in obese men. We used microdialysis which, for the first time, allowed us to investigate the mechanisms that may alter metabolism and body composition with pre-sleep CAS ingestion. The primary findings were that SCAAT lipolysis, fat oxidation, growth hormone, insulin and glucose were not significantly different between CAS and PLA (hypotheses supported). In addition, CAS did not result in greater REE or suppression of appetite and ghrelin compared to PLA (hypothesis rejected).</p><p>Previous acute studies in lean men [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and obese women [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have examined next morning substrate utilization and REE as a result of pre-sleep macronutrient intake the night prior. In lean men, bedtime ingestion of calorically-matched macronutrients (CAS, whey protein, carbohydrates) raised REE to a greater extent than the non-nutritive PLA, and, importantly, fat oxidation was not different between CAS and PLA [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In obese women, isocaloric CAS, whey protein, and carbohydrate elevated REE, although not significantly and a true non-nutritive PLA was not used thereby limiting the interpretation of these data [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given that REE is the largest component of daily energy expenditure (60%&#x02013;75%), and that reduced energy expenditure has been linked to weight gain [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], small increments in metabolism through pre-sleep protein intake may be clinically relevant for obese populations. Likewise, if CAS does not blunt lipolysis and, thus, lipolytic rate is not different from a non-nutritive PLA during sleep, then pre-sleep feeding strategies can be developed without concern for effects on lipolysis.</p><p>We have previously compared pre-sleep ingestion of calorically matched macronutrients to PLA in lean men and reported that morning fat oxidation was significantly greater for PLA compared to carbohydrates and whey protein but PLA was not different from CAS [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Potential mechanisms contributing to the protein-related differences in fat oxidation relative to PLA may be due to alterations in postprandial metabolism during sleep. For example, insulin inhibits fat oxidation, and lower insulin responses have been observed following daytime CAS ingestion compared to whey protein [<xref rid="B45-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Insulin is also a potent inhibitor of lipolysis [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] while growth hormone regulates nocturnal lipolysis [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In the present study, we hypothesized that pre-sleep CAS consumption would not significantly alter insulin or growth hormone to attenuate SCAAT lipolysis during sleep (measured in a single overnight sample) more than PLA. Thus, lipolytic rate would likely not differ with CAS compared to PLA during sleep, which is consistent with our findings. It is important to mention that protein intake was adequate (above the recommended dietary allowance of 0.8 g/kg of body weight/day) and not significantly different between participants&#x02019; self-reported habitual diet and the controlled diet consumed prior to bedtime CAS ingestion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-08-00452-t002">Table 2</xref>). Additionally total caloric intake was not different between these diets which allowed us to assess the impact of CAS under well-controlled dietary conditions. No other studies have examined the overnight lipolytic effects of CAS when consumed 30 min prior to sleep. However, our data suggest that postprandial responses following ingestion of low-calorie CAS before sleep may not augment insulin or alter growth hormone concentrations to an appreciable level that would result in lipolytic inhibition compared to the fasted state in obese men. Thus, the additional calories from CAS before sleep did not inhibit lipolysis more than PLA (i.e., fasting) during sleep in obese men and, therefore, likely would not have affected fat oxidation.</p><p>Although our findings suggest that CAS prior to sleep does not influence fat metabolism and REE in obese men, we cannot ignore the influence of circulating hormones. We have previously reported increased insulin and insulin resistance in obese women the morning following acute nighttime protein ingestion [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, prior food intake was not well controlled and it is possible that the habitual diet during the day may have confounded the negative effects on insulin. In the present study, morning insulin concentrations did not differ among CAS and PLA trials when food intake was standardized by providing meal-replacement beverages to match the participants total daily caloric needs, however hyperinsulinemia (fasting insulin &#x0003e; 180 pmol/L) [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and insulin resistance [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] were apparent at all collection periods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-08-00452-t003">Table 3</xref>). Under conditions of normal insulin signaling, high levels of insulin would favor fat storage by increasing lipoprotein lipase activity and decreasing hormone-sensitive lipase activity, thereby promoting triglycerides synthesis [<xref rid="B46-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Plasma fatty acids and glycerol were not measured in the present study (markers of whole-body lipolysis). However, we observed low RER values (~0.76 &#x000b1; 0.01) and a corresponding predominance of estimated fat oxidation (fat oxidation: ~0.13 &#x000b1; 0.01 g/min vs. carbohydrate oxidation: 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.02 g/min) following both CAS and PLA. While the substrate oxidation rates were estimated from RER it must be noted that protein was not accounted for in these calculations and it is possible that these data may be an over-estimation of true values. Nevertheless, this suggests that plasma free fatty acids and glycerol were elevated, as RER has been shown to be inversely related to plasma fatty acid concentrations [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, it is noteworthy that the addition of a CAS beverage prior to sleep did not further augment insulin concentrations.</p><p>It is also possible that the hyperinsulinemia and low RER may be a result of sleep restriction [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Rao et al. demonstrated that sleep restriction (~4 h) for five nights leads to lower RER (increase fat utilization) with no change in RMR but increases insulin resistance, cortisol and catecholamines [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Despite poor sleep efficiency scores (i.e., below 85%) [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] at baseline and during CAS and PLA trials, no differences in the quality or quantity of sleep between trials were present in the subset of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 5). These data demonstrate that neither microdialysis nor bedtime nutrient ingestion affect sleep quality patterns. Although participants were instructed to consume CAS or PLA within 30 min of going to bed, the time spent lying down but not sleeping was ~6 h, while the average time spent sleeping was ~4.5 h (baseline: 4 h and 48 min &#x000b1; 33 min; CAS: 4 h and 21 min &#x000b1; 27 min; PLA: 3 h and 55 min &#x000b1; 42 min). Thus, it is evident that the participants may have been sleep-restricted at baseline and during the CAS and PLA trials resulting in the low RER values and insulin resistance observed. The present study did not screen for irregular sleep patterns. Hence, future nighttime feeding studies in obese individuals should assess sleep quality and/or screen for sleep disturbances (i.e., sleep apnea).</p><p>While other studies have shown that nutrient intake prior to sleep may influence next morning appetite [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whether this holds true in obese men is unknown. We have previously reported that acute pre-sleep ingestion of calorically-matched protein or carbohydrate supplements increased feelings of satiety while concomitantly reducing the desire to eat the following morning, regardless of macronutrient type in obese women [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Likewise, less hunger was reported the following morning in response to CAS compared to PLA administration during sleep in elderly men [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Surprisingly, our hypothesis that CAS would result in greater appetite suppression compared to PLA was not supported. In fact, our participants reported greater desire to eat during the CAS trial relative to baseline but ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone, did not mediate these changes. Despite previous work showing blunted ghrelin concentrations in obesity [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], obese individuals are highly sensitive to ghrelin&#x02019;s orexigenic effects as low dose infusion (1 pmol/kg/min) reportedly increases food intake [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Changes in subjective appetite, however, were only apparent with a high dose infusion (5 pmol/kg/min) [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the present study, we did not standardize dietary intake prior to the baseline visit, however participants were asked to fast for at least 8 h before their baseline visit. In contrast, liquid meal replacement beverages (Ensure Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) were used to standardized dietary intake on the days participants consumed CAS and PLA at bedtime (i.e., the day prior to appetite measurements). It is conceivable that the increased feelings for a &#x0201c;desire to eat&#x0201d; may have been mistaken for a &#x0201c;desire to chew&#x0201d; given that their food intake on those days were in liquid form (different from food intake the day prior to baseline) and their subjective feelings of hunger and ghrelin levels were not altered by either trial. While standardizing meal intake with solid meals as opposed to liquid meal replacements would have been ideal, economically were unable to do this in the present study. Regardless, since food intake was standardized and no differences between CAS and PLA trials were present we feel that the same effect would have been observed. Contrary to the present study, data from our laboratory [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and others [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] have demonstrated a satiating effect of proteins.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-08-00452"><title>5. Conclusions </title><p>In conclusion, pre-sleep consumption of 30 g of CAS did not blunt overnight lipolysis compared to a non-nutritive PLA in obese, sedentary, men. The findings in the present study, however, should be interpreted with caution and in the confines of the participant characteristics and study protocol used. However, data exist to support increased daily protein intake for overall health [<xref rid="B52-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and previous studies demonstrate muscular and overall health benefits to pre-sleep protein ingestion [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00452" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consuming CAS before sleep may be a useful strategy to optimize protein consumption and alter the macronutrient profile in obese, insulin resistant men with no negative acute ramifications on fat metabolism. Future research investigating different types of pre-sleep meals (i.e., liquid vs. solid) and feeding patterns in non-insulin resistant populations are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Eduarda Machado and Ashley Wahl for their assistance with participant recruitment and data collection.
