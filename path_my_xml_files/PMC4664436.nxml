According to these pediatricians, all infants with IgE-mediated allergy and 80% of those with non&#x02013;IgE-mediated allergy are expected to be referred to a pediatric specialist (ie, gastroenterologist or allergist) for further investigations and confirmation of diagnosis. The time from referral to seeing a pediatric specialist would be 2&#x02013;4 weeks.

Between 7 and 9 months of age, infants would receive ~600 mL/day decreasing to ~400 mL/day at &#x0003e;1 year of age. Infants enter the model at a mean age of &#x0003c;6 months. Hence, it was estimated that infants would be prescribed 48&#x000d7;400 g cans of formula in the first 6 months of the models, 36&#x000d7;400 g cans of formula in the next 6 months of the models, and 36&#x000d7;400 g cans of formula after 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), differences in tolerance acquisition between formulae were adjusted for any differences in the following baseline variables: age, sex, presenting symptoms, and baseline values of the diagnostic tests.

Clinical outcomes and resource use estimates were varied randomly according to a log-normal distribution by assuming a 10% standard deviation around the mean values. Unit costs were varied randomly according to a gamma distribution by assuming a 10% standard deviation around the mean values.

Consequently, the total health care cost of initially feeding infants with eHCF + LGG was estimated to be less than that of feeding infants with one of the other formulae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ceor-7-583">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cost-effectiveness analyses</title><p>Of the three formulae, use of eHCF + LGG resulted in a lower 18 months cost and a greater probability of developing tolerance to cow&#x02019;s milk than the other two formulae among infants with both IgE-mediated and non&#x02013;IgE-mediated CMA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ceor-7-583">Table 3</xref>).

Nevertheless, there may have been some differences that have not been accounted for. The inherent variability and uncertainty of using data from this small and unequal sample of patients were addressed to some extent by our extensive sensitivity analyses. The results from the observational study<xref rid="b9-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> are consistent with another study which showed that in both IgE-mediated and non&#x02013;IgE-mediated CMA, the addition of LGG to eHCF resulted in a higher rate of developing tolerance after 12 months of feeding.<xref rid="b13-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The relative cost-effectiveness of eHCF + LGG in Spain is consistent with the findings from our recent study in Italy which also found that initial use of eHCF + LGG as a first-line management for CMA was cost-effective when compared with eHCF alone, soy-based formulae, hydrolyzed rice formulae and AAF.<xref rid="b10-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Additionally, our real-world evidence study in the United States found that more cow&#x02019;s milk&#x02013;allergic infants, who were initially managed with eHCF + LGG in clinical practice, were successfully managed compared with those who were fed with eHCF alone or AAF.<xref rid="b14-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The US analysis also found that initial dietary management with eHCF + LGG instead of eHCF alone or AAF affords a more cost-effective use of health care resources because it reduced costs and released health care resources for alternative use within the system without impacting on the time needed to manage the allergy.<xref rid="b14-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There were no other published studies assessing the health economic impact of alternative formula for the management of CMA, except our previous UK study,<xref rid="b15-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which also used real-world evidence and found that eHCF alone affords a cost-effective use of health care resources in clinical practice when compared with AAF.</p><p>The decision models used for this analysis are based on observational data. Hence, the models may not necessarily reflect clinical outcomes associated with managing a large cohort of infants in clinical practice. Accordingly, the results should be viewed with some caution until more data become available, which can be used to update the models, particularly the findings from a randomized, controlled study measuring the cost-effectiveness of tolerance development in children receiving a probiotic-containing formula compared with other formulae.</p><p>The study has several other limitations. The models were informed with assumptions about treatment patterns from the pediatric authors, who are based at one of seven centers. Hence, the levels of health care resource use incorporated into the models may not be representative of the whole of Spain. There was insufficient published clinical evidence to enable us to extrapolate the models beyond 18 months. Therefore, the analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of managing infants up to 18 months and does not consider the potential impact of managing infants who remain allergic beyond that period. Infants in the observational study<xref rid="b9-ceor-7-583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> were well matched, but those with comorbidities were excluded. Hence, the decision models used resource estimates for the &#x0201c;average infant&#x0201d; and do not consider the impact of other factors that may affect the results, such as co-morbidities, underlying disease severity, and pathology of the underlying disease. Additionally, the analysis does not consider the suitability of infants to receive different formulae. The models only analyzed direct health care costs borne by the SNS and excluded any costs incurred by parents and indirect costs incurred by society as a result of employed parents taking time off work. Also excluded are changes in quality of life and improvements in general well-being of sufferers and their parents as well as parents&#x02019; preferences. Consequently, this study may have underestimated the relative cost-effectiveness of eHCF + LGG.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the models show that over the first 18 months, proportionally more infants fed with eHCF + LGG are likely to develop tolerance to cow&#x02019;s milk than those fed with the other formulae. Consequently, they cost the health service less to manage. This is an expected finding because infants who develop tolerance to cow&#x02019;s milk would no longer require any management or feeding with a hypoallergenic formula. Accordingly, treating the annual cohort of 10,750 new CMA-affected infants in Spain with eHCF + LGG instead of the current mix of formulae could increase the percentage of infants developing tolerance to cow&#x02019;s milk from 60% to 78% and free-up 18,000 visits to pediatricians and reduce health service costs by up to &#x020ac;6.3 million. Clearly, initial use of eHCF + LGG has the potential to release health care resources for alternative use within the system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, within the study&#x02019;s limitations, first-line management of newly-diagnosed infants with CMA with eHCF + LGG instead of eHCF or an AAF improves outcome, releases health care resources for alternative use, reduces costs to the SNS, and thereby affords a cost-effective use of publicly funded resources. Hence, eHCF + LGG is the preferred first-line formula for newly-diagnosed infants compared with the other dietetic choices. A randomized controlled study showing faster tolerance development in children receiving a probiotic-containing formula is required before this conclusion can be confirmed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was supported with an unrestricted research grant from Mead Johnson Nutrition (Spain) S.L., Madrid, Spain.
