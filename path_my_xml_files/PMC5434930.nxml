The treatment was administered in 1 of 2 sequences: in sequence 1, patients received AMG 811 followed by placebo, while in sequence 2, patients received placebo followed by AMG 811. Twenty patients with DLE (with or without SLE) were planned for the study (12 for sequence 1 and 8 for sequence 2).</p><p>A single dose of AMG 811 (180 mg) or placebo was administered subcutaneously on day 1 (start of period 1) and on day 85 (start of period 2). Biopsy specimens of lesional and nonlesional skin were collected at baseline, and biopsy specimens of lesional skin were collected on days 15 and 57 postdosing. The presence of lesions was predetermined by each of the investigators before dosing was initiated. In most patients, the lesions were identified in a similar anatomic region. Nonlesional skin specimens were obtained from regions with similar light exposure as selected lesional sites. Blood samples for pharmacodynamic biomarker testing were collected at the following time points: in period 1, at baseline, predose, 6 hours postdose, and days 2, 15, 29, and 57; in period 2, predose, 6 hours postdose, and days 99, 113, 141, and 197 (end of study). Efficacy outcomes were evaluated at screening, baseline, and days 15, 29, and 57 (period 1) and days 85, 99, 113, 141, 169, and 197 (period 2). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="art40052-sec-0009"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were ages 18&#x02013;70 years at randomization, had a body mass index of 18&#x02013;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and were diagnosed as having DLE with or without SLE based on the Gilliam and Sontheimer classification <xref rid="art40052-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>.

Moreover, all eligible patients had stable disease for 4 weeks prior to screening, had received a stable dose of topical steroids no stronger than medium potency (class I, II, or III) for &#x02265;2 weeks and/or systemic immunosuppressive therapy at a stable dose for &#x02265;8 weeks before randomization, had received oral prednisone at a dosage of &#x02264;20 mg/day (or equivalent), and had a current vaccination history. Exclusion criteria included a history of malignancy, signs or symptoms of viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 30 days of randomization or recent history of repeated infections, an underlying significant medical condition other than SLE, a history of receiving immunosuppressant drugs that predispose to infection, or having received a live vaccine within 3 months of randomization.</p></sec><sec id="art40052-sec-0010"><title>Study outcome measures</title><sec id="art40052-sec-0011"><title>Gene expression profiling in the skin and blood</title><p>Transcriptional differences between lesional and nonlesional skin were assessed using microarray analysis. Frozen skin samples were disrupted with a Multi&#x02010;Sample Bio Pulverizer (Research Products International) and homogenized with a TissueRuptor (Qiagen). Total RNA was isolated using the mirVana Micro&#x02010;RNA Isolation kit (Applied Biosystems), modified to include on&#x02010;column DNase treatment with RNase&#x02010;free DNase (Qiagen). The integrity of the RNA samples was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Bio&#x02010;Rad). The total RNA concentration was measured on an ND&#x02010;1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). Labeled complementary DNA was generated using a NuGEN Ovation kit (NuGEN Technologies) and hybridized to GeneChip HT_HG&#x02010;U133+PM microarrays using a GeneTitan instrument (Affymetrix). Analyses were conducted with log<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;transformed intensities that had been normalized at the array level to have comparable intensity spectrum. Only samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) of &#x0003e;7 were used.

The IGBS was derived from 2 microarray experiments. First, whole blood from healthy volunteers was stimulated in vitro with IFN&#x003b3; and used to identify genes that were up&#x02010;regulated by IFN&#x003b3;. Second, whole blood from patients in a phase Ia study <xref rid="art40052-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> was used to identify genes that showed reduced expression following AMG 811 treatment.

For reference, the keratinocyte IFN&#x003b3; RNA score was measured in a set of 30 skin samples from healthy volunteers, as was the covariance of the expression of each gene. The numeric score for each disease skin sample from DLE patients was the Mahalanobis skin, which is similar to a multidimensional Z score and increases with changes in the expression of each gene in the signature set. The scores for each gene's contribution in the inverse covariance matrix were adjusted for the gene set in the reference normal samples.</p><p>Serum CXCL10 protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available enzyme&#x02010;linked immunosorbent assay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (R&#x00026;D Systems).

Additional exploratory clinical outcome measures included the CLASI score for damage (CLASI&#x02010;D; score range 0&#x02013;56), the physician's assessment of skin disease, the patient's self&#x02010;assessment of skin disease, and the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 <xref rid="art40052-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> (for patients with underlying SLE). In period 1 (baseline to day 84), baseline was defined as day 1 predose, while in period 2 (day 85 to day 197), baseline was defined as day 85 predose. The sole placebo group was the sequence 2, period 1 group (having first received placebo during period 1), since the sequence 1, period 2 group may have had potential confounding by exposure to AMG 811 (having received AMG 811 first).</p></sec></sec><sec id="art40052-sec-0014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary goal of CLASI&#x02010;A and keratinocyte IFN&#x003b3; RNA analyses was to provide estimates of effect size (with uncertainty), and statistical significance, although the study lacked sufficient power to achieve statistical significance. Percentage changes from baseline in CLASI&#x02010;A scores did not follow normal distribution; therefore, Hodges&#x02010;Lehmann estimates of the median values with associated 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) were provided. Corresponding <italic>P</italic> values were based on exact Wilcoxon&#x02013;Mann&#x02010;Whitney tests.</p><p>Global transcriptional analyses were performed on log<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;transformed and normalized fluorescence intensity values of gene expression.

Patients with DLE have an elevated IFN signature in the blood, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanisms are similar in patients with SLE and those with cutaneous lupus <xref rid="art40052-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. AMG 811 is a monoclonal antibody that blocks IFN&#x003b3;. In this study of patients with DLE, treatment with AMG 811 demonstrated clear pharmacologic activity in both the blood and lesional skin, as measured using the IGBS score. Notably, after treatment, the IGBS score did not reach the levels seen in nonlesional skin, suggesting that either incomplete blockade of the pathway or partial activation by other cytokines may occur.</p><p>When IFN&#x003b3; activity was measured using the keratinocyte IFN&#x003b3; RNA score, DLE lesional skin, DLE nonlesional skin, and normal skin from healthy volunteers were shown to have correspondingly varying levels of IFN&#x003b3; activity, with the scores in DLE nonlesional skin being intermediate to those in lesional and normal skin. Treatment with AMG 811 did not significantly impact the keratinocyte IFN&#x003b3; RNA score in the skin.</p><p>Given the pharmacologic responses to AMG 811 in both the blood and skin as measured by the IGBS and keratinocyte IFN&#x003b3; RNA scores, the single dose of AMG 811 administered to patients with DLE possibly did not provide sufficient coverage to elicit a clinical response that could be measured by the CLASI&#x02010;A. The 180&#x02010;mg subcutaneous dose of AMG 811 covered the target adequately as assessed on the basis of changes in the serum CXCL10 levels over &#x02265;56 days&#x02014;a duration of treatment consistent with the measurement of efficacy in other DLE studies <xref rid="art40052-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="art40052-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="art40052-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>&#x02014;but the dose level of AMG 811 required to penetrate the skin and overcome local production of IFN&#x003b3; may be higher. Alternatively, despite coverage of the IFN&#x003b3; pathway, possibly other pathways, including the type I IFN pathways, may need to be inhibited concurrently to impact clinical disease. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of this population and the role of several interdependent and independent pathways may preclude the use of blockade of a single IFN pathway as an effective treatment for the majority of patients with SLE and DLE. Overall, these results do not provide a clear answer to the role of IFN&#x003b3; in the pathogenesis of DLE. While differences in gene expression profiles in the blood and skin indicate dysregulation of the IFN&#x003b3; pathway, conclusions about causality cannot be drawn given the possible incomplete blockade of the pathway in the tissue and the lack of discernible clinical impact.</p><p>Conduct of proof&#x02010;of&#x02010;concept SLE trials is challenging in terms of enrollment and trial design. Given the large number of patients required, duration of treatment, and the complex composite disease outcome measures needed, small clinical trials (particularly organ&#x02010;specific trials) that maximize data collection and provide evidence of pharmacodynamic and clinical impact are valuable in the early development of novel agents for SLE. The crossover design utilized in this study allowed us to obtain both placebo&#x02010; and treatment&#x02010;related data in the overall analysis and helped us to minimize patient&#x02010;to&#x02010;patient variability. This design addressed one of the concerns postulated by patients who are considering participation in a clinical trial, that of potentially receiving placebo treatment. Enrollment of patients with DLE, most of whom also had SLE, enabled the collection of data from the skin in addition to blood and serum, which collectively enabled a rich set of data from which to conduct robust pharmacodynamic analyses. Despite the unclear results, we would encourage the consideration of such a study design, when appropriate, in the future development of agents for SLE.</p><p>In conclusion, treatment with AMG 811 led to changes in biomarkers associated with IFN&#x003b3; in the blood and skin of patients with DLE. The treatment was well tolerated, but there was no significant clinical improvement observed with the single dose (180 mg) of AMG 811 administered in this study.</p></sec><sec id="art40052-sec-0022"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, and all authors approved the final version to be published.
