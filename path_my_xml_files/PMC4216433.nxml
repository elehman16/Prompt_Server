Treatment with the nanofiltered anti-inhibitor coagulant complex, Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA NF), is a key therapeutic option for controlling acute haemorrhages in patients with high-titre inhibitors or low-titre inhibitors refractory to replacement therapy. Given the high risk for morbidity and mortality in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX, we conducted this Phase 3 prospective study to evaluate whether prophylaxis with FEIBA NF is a safe and effective treatment option. Over a 1-year period, 17 subjects were treated prophylactically (85&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;U&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every other day) while 19 subjects were treated on demand. The median (IQR) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylaxis was 7.9 (8.1), compared to 28.7 (32.3) during on-demand treatment, which amounts to a 72.5% reduction and a statistically significant difference in ABRs between arms (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.0003). Three (17.6%) subjects (ITT) on prophylaxis experienced no bleeding episodes, whereas none treated on demand were bleeding episode-free. Total utilization of FEIBA NF for the treatment of bleeding episodes was significantly higher during on-demand therapy than prophylaxis (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.0067). There were no differences in the rates of related adverse events between arms. This study demonstrates that FEIBA prophylaxis significantly reduces all types of bleeding compared with on-demand treatment, and the safety of prophylaxis is comparable to that of on-demand treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>FEIBA</kwd><kwd>haemophilia A/B</kwd><kwd>inhibitors</kwd><kwd>on-demand</kwd><kwd>Prophylaxis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of inhibitory alloantibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) is the most serious and challenging complication in haemophilia patients and a major cause of morbidity and mortality as bleeds are difficult to treat <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The presence of inhibitors generally precludes the efficacious use of FVIII and FIX replacement therapy, especially in patients with high-responding and high-titre inhibitors, due to an anamnestic response.

A recent prospective clinical study (PRO-FEIBA) with a crossover design showed that FEIBA prophylaxis over a 6-month period was associated with statistically significant reductions in all bleeding episodes (62%), haemarthroses (61%), and target joints (72%) in haemophilia A patients with high-titre inhibitors <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. This study was designed to compare the efficacy, safety and HRQoL of a prophylactic regimen of the nanofiltered FEIBA NF, to an on-demand regimen over a 12-month observation period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00851721).

Secondary outcome measures included the following: number of bleeding episodes in joints, target joints (i.e. ankles, knees, elbows and/or hips with &#x02265;4 bleeds over 6&#x000a0;months), and other anatomical locations; occurrence of new target joints; pain, joint range of motion (ROM) and haemostatic efficacy; total FEIBA NF utilization and the number of infusions required to treat a bleeding episode; pharmacoeconomics and HRQoL; and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>Prophylaxis dosing was 85&#x000a0;&#x000b1;15&#x000a0;U&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> by i.v. bolus infusion every other day.

ABRs were transformed using the square root of the number of bleeding episodes observed (<italic>X</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;bleeds per year), <italic>X</italic>&#x02032;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0221a;(<italic>X</italic>&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;0.5) to stabilize the variance and align the sample distribution with the assumption of normality inherent in using the <italic>t</italic>-test. The difference in mean transformed ABRs was used to perform statistical tests and to generate <italic>P</italic>&#x02013;values (two-sample, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test with a significance level of 5%). To further assess differences in ABRs between regimens, a negative binomial mixed model was used to evaluate the number of bleeding episodes as the dependent variable with the logarithm of time as the offset variable and regimen as the independent variable. A repeated effect over time was included because each subject contributed multiple observations during their treatment period.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcome measures were, for the most part, descriptively compared between arms for all subjects with at least one treated bleeding episode.

One on-demand subject and two prophylaxis subjects had high-titre inhibitors at screening that changed to low-titre inhibitors by termination. Two subjects in the on-demand arm (2.3&#x02013;6.1&#x000a0;BU and 4.9&#x02013;79.6&#x000a0;BU) and one in the prophylaxis arm (3.7&#x02013;9.5&#x000a0;BU) had a rise in inhibitor levels from low to high titre. In three subjects, two haemophilia A and one haemophilia B subject, a low-titre inhibitor at screening was no longer detectable at study termination.</p><p>An unexpected finding in this study was the HBsAb positive results in seven subjects at termination. In three of these subjects, there was a history of HBV vaccination or prior HBV infection. Of the remaining four subjects, two reverted back to an HBsAb negative titre 2&#x000a0;months after the study completion. All four subjects were tested for HBcAb, HBsAg and HBV DNA by PCR and were found to be negative, indicating an absence of HBV infection. On the basis of extensive analysis of the immunoglobulin content of FEIBA NF, the titres of HBsAb in the retention plasma pools of lots tested and the detection level of the HBsAb assay, we believe that passive transfer of HBsAb from FEIBA NF provides a highly plausible explanation for the positive serology in some subjects. No subject manifested signs of an active HBV infection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prophylactic regimen of FEIBA NF in haemophilia A and B subjects with inhibitors yielded a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the number of all bleeding episodes when compared in a prospective manner to the on-demand regimen. In particular, the data showed reductions in the rate of bleeding episodes of all aetiologies and types during prophylaxis vs. on-demand therapy, with the exception of traumatic non-joint bleeding episodes. A secondary analysis (negative binomial mixed effects model) further confirmed an increased incidence of bleeding was associated with the on-demand regimen. Moreover, median (IQR) ABRs in the prophylaxis arm were higher during the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment than the last 6&#x000a0;months of treatment (8.0 [13.5] vs. 5.9 [19.1]), suggesting that longer duration of prophylaxis may further reduce bleeding in some patients.</p><p>Overall, our primary outcome data complements the results of the recent prospective PRO-FEIBA study. However, the shorter duration of observation in PRO-FEIBA may not have accounted for possible seasonal effects (6&#x000a0;months vs. 12&#x000a0;months), showing a smaller reduction in the number of all bleeding episodes (62% vs. 72.5%) during prophylaxis. While the demographic characteristics of respective study populations were similar, efficacy results presented here should be interpreted in the light of differences in study designs (i.e. parallel vs. crossover). Interestingly, the interval between prophylactic dosing in both studies (every 48&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h) exceeded the pharmacodynamic half-life of FEIBA as determined by thrombin generation assays (approximately 6&#x000a0;h) <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, and both prophylactic regimens were shown to be effective.</p><p>As expected for subjects in this study, the majority (90%) of bleeding episodes occurred in joints. Of the haemarthroses that occurred in subjects treated prophylactically, most were in existing target joints, while the majority of those in subjects treated on-demand were in new target joints. Thus, a statistically significant difference in the ABR in new target joints was observed between arms. Importantly, the development of new target joints was less common in the prophylaxis arm than on-demand arm. Therefore, we hypothesize that prophylaxis could prevent repeated joint bleeding and the development of new target joints, which is particularly promising for inhibitor patients with absent or minimal joint damage who start long-term primary prophylaxis at an early age <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p><p>The haemostatic efficacy of the treatment of bleeding episodes was similar among regimens, which is consistent with the results of FVIII usage in haemophilia A subjects without inhibitors <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p><p>Total FEIBA usage during the every-other-day prophylaxis regimen was comparable to usage during the thrice-weekly regimen of the PRO-FEIBA study in haemophilia A subjects with FVIII inhibitors (3.0- vs. 2.4-fold greater than on-demand usage) <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, and even to prophylactic FVIII usage in haemophilia A subjects without inhibitors (2.4- to 3.1-fold greater than on-demand usage) <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>.

Furthermore, ROM for the three key joints (ankles, knees and elbows) was maintained or improved over the course of the study in both arms. This study was not designed to address long-term effects of prophylaxis on the progression of joint disease.</p><p>FEIBA has two viral inactivation steps in its manufacturing process, minimizing any potential risks of hepatitis viral transmission. Detailed monitoring of HBV serology and PCR testing implemented throughout this study detected four HBsAb positive cases, which were attributed to passive transfer of antibodies from plasma used in the manufacture of FEIBA. This interpretation is fully consistent with the current extensive HBV vaccination history of plasma donors. The passive transfer of these antibodies is transitory (which can explain the reversion to HBsAb negative titre in two of four subjects) and is based on the half-life of IgG and continued administration of high doses of FEIBA NF or other plasma products. These four cases represent transient hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion and not viral transmission (active HBV infection).</p><p>There were also no thromboembolic events reported and no notable trends in thrombotic markers observed during the study further supporting the safety profile of FEIBA NF in terms of potential viral infections and thromboses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A prophylactic regimen with FEIBA NF was shown to be effective and safe in the reduction in bleeding, including bleeding in joints and target joints and development of new target joints in patients with persistent high-titre inhibitors and low-titre inhibitors refractory to FVIII or FIX treatment.
