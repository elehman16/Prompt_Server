The cumulative probability for relapse of appendicitis demanding appendectomy was: 0.09, 0.12, 0.12 and 0.13 at 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year follow-up, with a probability of 0.86&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.013 without appendectomy after 8&#x000a0;years.

However, it is still a controversy to what extent antibiotic treatment should be offered systematically as a first-line therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has even been doubted whether antibiotics offers significant resolution of inflamed appendices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This uncertainty is probably in part dependent on that long-term results are essentially lacking in the literature, although satisfying acute and long-term outcomes are reported in both adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with uncomplicated appendicitis.

The choice of antibiotics is also important, which may vary between countries and across time in different geographic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the present study, we present long-term results on outcome that should encourage physicians to choose antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis as a safe and evidence-based alternative to acute surgical operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="Par6">We have earlier published CONSORT flow sheets and inclusions of patients who started on antibiotics (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;561) due to acute appendicitis in either randomized (RCT; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;106) or population-based trials (PBT; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;442) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We also include unpublished subsequently treated non-randomized patients (Non-R; <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;271) with favourable initial response to antibiotics. All our patients were offered antibiotic treatment as an alternative to surgery for treatment of assumed acute appendicitis according to clinical evaluations as described and discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In our published reports, all patients older than 18&#x000a0;years with assumed appendicitis were eligible for inclusion (RCT, PBT). Acute appendicitis was diagnosed according to established practice: the attending physician decided based on disease history, clinical status, computed tomography and gynaecological examination when deemed necessary. Patients were randomized according to birth date (RCT). Evaluation was performed according to intention to treat and per protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. All patients with suspected appendicitis were invited to have the antibiotics-alone treatment option according to the PBT protocol; with analyses of intention to treat and per protocol as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. All our patients allocated to antibiotics could have surgery without any predetermined specification (required by ethics) if the surgeon in charge deemed it necessary; or if the patient preferred initial operations. Similarly, patients allocated to surgery could choose antibiotics as their first choice. In the RCT study, 369 patients were randomized: 202 were allocated to antibiotics and 167 to surgery; 119 patients started on antibiotics; and 250 had immediate surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the PBT study, a total of 558 consecutive patients were hospitalized and treated due to acute appendicitis: Seventy-nine per cent (442) received antibiotics as their first-line therapy and 20% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;111) had or preferred primary surgery; 77% on primary antibiotics recovered, while 23% had subsequent appendectomy due to failed initial resolution on antibiotics. The third group (Non-R, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;271) of included patients were informed to have antibiotic treatment by physicians in charge on the same premises when deemed reasonable according to encouraging results in our RCT and PBT studies. These patients have thus been subsequently selected from the same patient population as used for inclusion of patients to the RCT and PBT studies, but without any specific selection criteria beyond a patient offer to try antibiotics as a first-line treatment option. They were clinically judged and evaluated in the same way as patients in RCT and PBT groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Major patient inclusions were between 2005 and 2013. A majority of presently evaluated randomized patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;97) were treated at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, included 2006&#x02013;2007, while population-based inclusions were more equally performed at Sahlgrenska hospital (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;182) and the &#x000d6;stra University Hospital (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;160) during 2009&#x02013;2010 according to protocols described in details elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Non-randomized patients were treated only at Sahlgrenska hospital (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;271) with major inclusions 2010&#x02013;2013. The Non-R group represented around 20% of all patients treated for acute appendicitis at Sahlgrenska hospital according to a hospital incidence of acute appendicitis around 0.055% per year. Accordingly, we present the results as related to the protocols of our earlier studies and patient inclusions with different study design and inclusion premises; altogether 710 out of 832 patients who were offered and started on antibiotics. The difference of 122 patients was acute treatment failures (15%) by antibiotics. The criteria of treatment failure for antibiotic treatment alone were the same for all groups (RCT, PBT, Non-R); i.e., the need of surgery according to the physicians in charge based on overall clinical evaluation during observation of the patients. Patients who did not recover acutely on antibiotics during their hospital stay (1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days) or relapsed within 14&#x000a0;days from onset of appendicitis despite antibiotic treatment were regarded acute treatment failures. Thus, patients who responded favourably to initial antibiotic treatment and left the hospitals with complimentary oral antibiotic treatment for additional 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;days were eligible for the present follow-up analysis by a combination of personal letter request to all patients and computer-based search to what extent patients had been operated for appendicitis in any of our hospitals, confirmed by patient file examinations until December 2015. Independently, two research nurses filled in database information on all required aspects.</p><p id="Par8">Randomized patients were treated with cefotaxime 1&#x000a0;g twice and metronidazole 1.5&#x000a0;g once for at least 24&#x000a0;h and in some cases within 36&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Most recurrent appendicitis occurred within 1&#x000a0;year. The cumulative probability for relapse demanding appendectomy was: 0.09, 0.12, 0.12 and 0.13 at 1, 2, 3 and 5&#x000a0;years, respectively. This corresponds to an observed long-term cumulative probability of 0.86&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.013 to avoid operation across 8&#x000a0;years following an initial favourable response to antibiotic treatment. The number of operated patients during follow-up was: 16 (RCT), 29 (PBT) and 48 (Non-R). Thus, available information in our database predicts that the expected overall benefit of antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis should be around 60&#x02013;70% within 10-year follow-up including initial failures between 10 and 23% in unselected adults without serious complications due to antibiotic treatment.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">We have earlier reported that antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis is safe and was associated with significantly less complications compared to acute surgical interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], although conventional open appendectomy was not compared specifically to laparoscopic extirpation in our earlier trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previously published studies on antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis have mostly included only patients with confirmed positive imaging, which is a kind of restricted patient selection. By contrast, our previous studies included more or less unselected adult patients (&#x0003e;18&#x000a0;years old) with &#x0201c;assumed appendicitis&#x0201d; (both complicated and uncomplicated) according to Swedish standard criteria based on anamnesis, clinical and abdominal examinations, clinical chemistry as well as imaging in patients where the clinician in charge deemed it necessary for a high probability of positive diagnosis (in 63% of all our patients). Correct diagnoses of acute appendicitis in our hospital in unselected patients are close to 90% specificity, which is a level that applications with CT scans or ultrasound in all patients do not improve under most circumstances, particularly not in acute or emergency patients. Thus, our approach to include unselected patients based on overall clinical judgments should not be regarded a weakness of our protocols. We remain strong in the view that our results reflect standard clinical conditions at least in Scandinavian countries. This conclusion is particularly supported by the fact that RCT, PBT and Non-R studies indicate similar results at follow-up, which is as good as clinical studies can provide.</p><p id="Par15">The role of imaging (CT, MR, ultrasound) for positive diagnosis may well be a matter of continuous debate among clinicians, although overall diagnostics usually leave a window of uncertain opportunities between 85 and 100% specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We want to emphasize this fact, to avoid concerned discussions about optimized diagnosis of acute appendicitis, which is still an unsettled matter, although trained physicians usually manage to predict a correct positive diagnosis between 90 and 95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is also important to remind that most large hospitals may provide treatment results with negative findings of appendicitis at laparotomy for assumed acute appendicitis (false positive diagnosis) around 5&#x02013;10% as reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, we have never tried to select patients, based on clinical or imaging evaluations, with signs of perforated (complicated) or non-perforated (uncomplicated) appendix before offering patients antibiotic treatments. Thus, all our patients were close to unselected, with confirmed or suspected perforations around 20&#x02013;30% at subsequent appendectomies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Our previous results on antibiotic treatment of acute appendicitis have indicated that initial and short-term results are good or even very good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], depending on personal preferences. This means that around 85% of all patients could leave our hospitals without operation, which saved a considerable amount of money without particular harm and risks compared to surgical appendectomies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This perspective and fact have been difficult to accept and cope with for groups of physicians, particularly surgeons, who tend to conclude that appendectomy is a &#x0201c;superior&#x0201d; method since relapse will never occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, such arguments are hampered by the fact that serious complications following surgical appendectomy remain significant matters and may sometimes create long-life problems such as hernia, conditions with intestinal obstruction demanding reoperations and sometimes even intestinal strangulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These facts should be considered in the light that we did not observe any serious complications due to antibiotic treatment besides diarrhoea and minor allergic skin reactions during treatment with antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Eventual risk differences for effects on fertility in females on antibiotic treatment versus surgical appendectomy are presently unknown but may be a question in future investigations. Besides, it is our experience that a large number of patients are highly willing to try antibiotic treatment, both once and several times, before definite operations when provided current and available evidence-based information in published reports, as also observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Anyway, an important finding in our previous studies is that immediate start of antibiotic treatment of patients with suspected acute appendicitis is without negative matters, besides the fact that operation may soon be necessary in about 10&#x02013;20% of the patients depending on patient selection criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">With all above perspectives and eventual hesitance despite previous promising reports, it appears now that antibiotic treatment of patients with acute appendicitis is a long-term safe and effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This means that around 85% of all patients who left the hospital with initially overwhelming relief of symptoms and clinical recovery did not experienced appendectomy within a median follow-up time close to 6&#x000a0;years. According to the slope for uncensored events (appendectomy), it seems unlikely that recurrences will reappear at significant rates beyond 8-year observation. Therefore, one may estimate that antibiotic treatment of &#x0201c;assumed acute appendicitis&#x0201d; may be definite in 60&#x02013;70% of unselected adult patients with acute appendicitis including initial treatment failures (10&#x02013;23%). It can then be predicted that around 55% of all unselected patients with &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; appendicitis should be cured for at least 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years following onset of appendicitis, considering that a maximum of 7&#x02013;10% of patients with &#x0201c;assumed appendicitis&#x0201d; may have other benign explanations behind their acute abdominal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A question may, however, remain to what extent a significant number of our patients, that were successfully treated by antibiotics, may have shown such favourable results without any treatment intervention at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our previous and present results may now legitimate such investigations from ethical perspectives, with antibiotic and surgical interventions as alternatives to observational expectation, where patients could be selected for treatment alternatives according to various algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Ulla K&#x000f6;rner and Lena Gunnebo are acknowledged for excellent follow-up recordings.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Author's contributions</title><p id="Par18">KL was involved in study design, statistical calculations and writing manuscript.
