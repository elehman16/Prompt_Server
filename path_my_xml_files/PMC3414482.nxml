However, in a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) reverses disease by restoring insulin secretion. Specifically, it stimulates innate immunity by inducing the host to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which, in turn, kills disease-causing autoimmune cells and restores pancreatic beta-cell function through regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Translating these findings to humans, we administered BCG, a generic vaccine, in a proof-of-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults with long-term type 1 diabetes (mean: 15.3 years) at one clinical center in North America. Six subjects were randomly assigned to BCG or placebo and compared to self, healthy paired controls (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6) or reference subjects with (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;57) or without (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) type 1 diabetes, depending upon the outcome measure. We monitored weekly blood samples for 20 weeks for insulin-autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and other autoantibodies, and C-peptide, a marker of insulin secretion. BCG-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient who, after enrollment, unexpectedly developed acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, a known TNF inducer, exclusively showed increases in dead insulin-autoreactive T cells and induction of Tregs. C-peptide levels (pmol/L) significantly rose transiently in two BCG-treated subjects (means: 3.49 pmol/L [95% CI 2.95&#x02013;3.8], 2.57 [95% CI 1.65&#x02013;3.49]) and the EBV-infected subject (3.16 [95% CI 2.54&#x02013;3.69]) vs.1.65 [95% CI 1.55&#x02013;3.2] in reference diabetic subjects. BCG-treated subjects each had more than 50% of their C-peptide values above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the reference subjects. The EBV-infected subject had 18% of C-peptide values above this level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We conclude that BCG treatment or EBV infection transiently modified the autoimmunity that underlies type 1 diabetes by stimulating the host innate immune response.

Current immune treatments for type 1 diabetes, such as immunosuppressants and anti-cytokines, are non-specific, killing or harming both the pathological T cells (i.e., insulin-autoreactive cytotoxic T cells) and healthy cells.</p><p>Two decades of autoimmune disease research in animal models, including the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes, have uncovered overlapping genetic and functional mechanisms of disease and led to the identification of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as a potential novel immunotherapy <xref rid="pone.0041756-Kodama1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041756-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the rationale for administering TNF is that insulin-autoreactive T cells bear several intracellular signaling defects that make them selectively vulnerable to death upon exposure to TNF <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ban1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041756-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. TNF destroys insulin-autoreactive T cells, but not healthy T cells, in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of human diabetic blood samples and in the NOD mouse model. TNF exposure may also augment production of beneficial regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of T cells believed to suppress insulin-autoreactive T cells. Interventions that have destroyed insulin-autoreactive T cells and boosted beneficial types of T cells have led to regeneration of insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas of rodents with autoimmune diabetes, resulting in restoration of normoglycemia, even in advanced disease <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Kodama2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>TNF treatment at high doses in humans is limited by its systemic toxicity. An alternative approach is to test a safe, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccine containing <italic>Mycobacterium bovis bacillus- Calmette-Guerin</italic> (BCG), which has been known for over 20 years to induce TNF <xref rid="pone.0041756-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This avirulent strain of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> is different from that which causes tuberculosis in humans (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>).</p><p>The release of TNF after exposure to pathogens, such as BCG, is an example of a first-line host defense commonly called the innate immune response <xref rid="pone.0041756-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similar results to those with TNF administration have been achieved with BCG or its non-FDA approved variant, complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA), in rodent models of autoimmune diabetes <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Kodama2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Harada1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041756-McInerney1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, a single, low dose of BCG in humans with late-stage pre-diabetes was initially found to successfully induce a clinical remission in some patients <xref rid="pone.0041756-Shehadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but when efficacy was re-evaluated in expanded trials, it could not be observed a year after vaccination. At the time, the mechanisms behind BCG&#x02019;s failure were not understood and specific biomarkers or knowledge of TNF action and autoimmunity were unavailable. In recent years, however, the mechanism of action underlying the therapeutic potential of BCG and TNF in autoimmune disease has been further elucidated <xref rid="pone.0041756-Kodama1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, supporting the hypothesis based on animal data that BCG vaccination may be beneficial in type 1 diabetes, especially if the mechanism of action of BCG trigger TNF can be closely followed with sophisticated and early biomarkers of safety.</p><p>We conducted a proof-of-principle, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in which we administered two low-dose BCG vaccinations to patients with long-term type 1 diabetes. Here, we report on the safety of two low-dose BCG vaccinations and their effects on four serially studied biomarkers in long-term type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Frequent blood sampling for up to 5 months was conducted to measure biomarkers of immune and pancreatic function, including: (1) levels and viability of cytotoxic autoreactive T cells against insulin, a known autoantigen in diabetes; (2) induction of protective Tregs; (3) antibodies against the autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD); and (4) levels of fasting C-peptide, a marker of endogenous insulin production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information: see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical Trial Participants</title><p>All clinical trial participants were required to be adults, ages 18 to 50 years, with long-term diabetes treated continuously with insulin from the time of diagnosis; have no demonstrable insulin secretion (fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide less than 0.2 pmol/L) as assessed by a standard C-peptide assay by an outside vendor; be pancreatic GAD autoantibody positive; have a normal complete blood count (CBC); and have a negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test. Diabetic patients were excluded if they were pregnant or not using acceptable birth control; had a chronic infectious disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); had a history of tuberculosis (TB) or current TB infection; were currently receiving treatment with glucocorticoids, chronic immunosuppressive medications or high dose aspirin (&#x0003e;160 mg/day); or were currently living with an immunosuppressed individual.

The clinical trial subjects were compared to one or more of these groups, depending on the outcome measure as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041756-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion of diabetic reference subjects were the same as those for the clinical trial subjects as related to age of onset, duration of diabetes and HbA1C values. The reference subjects studied for insulin-autoreactive T cells were also matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 status. The serial study of these reference subjects was performed to expand the database of autoreactive T cell variation and serially studied C-peptide values in single subjects, i.e., these separate and sequential blood draws defined the biological variation in assays in single cohorts and distinguished this biological variation from variation possibly attributable to BCG treatment in the randomized clinical trial subjects also studied in a serial fashion.</p><fig id="pone-0041756-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0041756.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT flow chart (A) and flow diagraph (B) with depicts of treatment concept, outcomes and subject comparison groups for the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0041756.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by the Human Studies Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA and by the FDA.

The BCG injection was prepared by the research pharmacy from lyophilized BCG (TheraCys&#x000ae;, Sanofi-Pasteur, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and all syringes (BCG and saline) were prefilled by the pharmacy. Randomized patients received two 0.1 ml intradermal injections into the deltoid area containing either low-dose BCG (1.6&#x02013;3.2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units/injection) or saline placebo, administered four weeks apart (Week 0 and Week 4). Weekly blood sampling was performed until Week 8, followed by bi-weekly blood sampling until Week 12 and then a final visit at Week 20. This frequent blood monitoring was performed to validate outcomes and observe any early effects of therapy. All subjects were seen in the morning and were required to be fasting and normoglycemic prior to having their blood drawn.</p><p>All injections were administered in the MGH diabetes clinic. Staff who administered BCG or placebo injections were not the same as those who examined the participants to grade any reactions at the injection site. All blood was processed within two hours of being drawn. All blood samples were blinded and simultaneously sent to the laboratory for monitoring of T cell response and for storage of serum for pancreas response tests (ultrasensitive C-peptide assay and autoantibodies), which were performed by outside vendors at the completion of the trial as described in &#x0201c;Assay methods&#x0201d;.</p><p>A group of paired healthy control participants, receiving neither BCG nor placebo, had blood samples obtained at the same time as diabetic subjects.

This method is unique in yielding cells both free of magnetic particles and free of an attached positive selection antibody to either the CD4 protein or the CD8 protein. The blood was drawn into BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing acid citrate and dextrose or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The CD8 or CD4 cells extracted for these studies were selected from fresh blood and were required, for standardization purposes, to be greater than 98% pure, 95% viable, and 85% yield for the validated T cell assays <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ban1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Burger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Use of controls</title><p>For all T cell assays in this study, a diabetic blood sample was always drawn at the same time as blood from a paired healthy control to allow assay standardization.</p></sec><sec id="s2i3"><title>Detection of autoreactive CD8 T cells to a fragment of insulin</title><p>Insulin-autoreactive T cells were assayed by flow cytometry after fresh blood cell separations <xref rid="pone.0041756-Burger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to obtain high-yield and highly pure and viable CD8 T cells for tetramer staining. Tetramers are T cell detection reagents composed of the binding region of specific HLA class I proteins with loaded peptides in the exterior binding grooves. The tetramers, which are made fluorescent, bind to specific T cells with specific reactivity to the presented peptide fragment, thereby allowing for cell identification. To detect autoreactive T cells to insulin, we used tetramers to HLA-A2 *0210 insulin beta 10&#x02013;18 with a fragment of HLVEALYLV (Beckman Coulter #T02001) <xref rid="pone.0041756-Pinkse1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To further confirm the specificity of insulin-autoreactive T cell detection, cell samples were examined simultaneously with T cell reagents to detect oncogene-specific human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells of acute infection. For simultaneously studied healthy controls, the following tetramer reagents were used: HLA*0201 Her-2/neu with a sequence to KIFGSLAFL (Beckman Coulter #T02001), a breast cancer peptide; HLA*0201 null without a non-specific peptide fragment (Beckman Coulter #T01044); or an EBV tetramer reagent HLA-A*0201 EBV with sequence of GLCTLVAML (Beckman Coulter #T01010).</p><p>Tetramer reagent staining was conducted on the highly pure CD8 T cells after 12 hours of culture at 26&#x000b0;C followed by 6 hours at 37&#x000b0;C and/or 1 hour rest at 26&#x000b0;C followed by 12 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were then stained with phycoerythrin-labeled class I tetramers (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and SYTOX green dye (MBL International, Woburn, MA) and/or CD8 antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). All CD8 T cells were stained at 4&#x000b0;C in the dark for 30 minutes and then washed twice in Hanks balanced salt solution with 2% heat inactivated bovine serum. On average, 100,000 highly pure CD8 T cells were analyzed to ensure optimized data points on the Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using the Cell Quest acquisition program and allow the detection of rare autoreactive T cells. All cells were analyzed while fresh to prevent fixation artifacts and enable quantification of dead versus viable cells. Prior to tetramer staining, cells were neither frozen nor expanded. Calculations of insulin-positive T cells were reported as the percentage of insulin-autoreactive T cells to the total numbers of isolated pure CD8 T lymphocytes.</p><p>Note that all diabetic treated patients in the randomized portion of the study were HLA-A2+ except for diabetic #iv. Although diabetic #iv was HLA-A2 negative, the formal binding site for the HLA-A2 insulin-autoreactive T cell reagent was HLA-A6802. HLA-A6802 is a subtype of the HLA-A2 family and has an identical binding cleft to HLA-A2 and other common subtypes within the HLA-A2 family. Therefore, if diabetic subject #iv were to have detectable insulin-autoreactive T cells, those cells would stain positive for the insulin-autoreactive T cell reagent. Three healthy controls in this study (Control #ii, Control #iii and Control #v) were also HLA-A2+.</p><p>Reference diabetics were monitored over a three-year period for the presence or absence of insulin-autoreactive T cells and compared to their paired healthy reference controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2i4"><title>Detection of Treg CD4+ cells</title><p>Treg cells were assayed by flow cytometry after fresh blood cell separations as described above and by Burger et al <xref rid="pone.0041756-Burger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Two different methods of cell detection were employed. Treg cells were detected as either CD4, CD25<sup>bright</sup> with Foxp3 staining, or with CD4, CD25<sup>bright</sup> and CD127<sup>low</sup>antibody staining. Intracellular staining of Foxp3 was performed with Human Treg Flow&#x02122; Kit (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Isolated CD4 positive cells were incubated briefly with CD4-PE-Cy5 (clone RPA-T4) and CD25-PE (clone BC96) antibodies for 20 minutes at room temperature. After washing, cells were fixed with Foxp3 Fix/Perm solution (Biolegend) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed again and permeabilized with Foxp3 Perm Buffer (Biolegend) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then stained with Foxp3 Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 488 antibody (clone 259D, Biolegend) for 30 minutes. Isotype controls were done for each sample prior to flow cytometric analysis. For detection of Treg cells, staining was performed with a CD4 antibody (clone RPA-T4, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), a CD25 antibody (clone 4E3, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA) and an anti-human CD127 antibody (clone hIL-7R-M21, BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s2i5"><title>Flow cytometry for T cell assays</title><p>For the flow cytometry studies, the flow gates were set &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; for inclusion of CD8 or CD4 T cells of all sizes, but exclusion of the following: cell debris, red blood cells, fragmented cells, and apoptotic bodies. The &#x0201c;open gate&#x0201d; was chosen for the purified CD8 or CD4 T cells because T cells undergoing cell death, especially by apoptosis, can display changes in light scattering properties. The goal was to ensure accuracy by analyzing high numbers of cells per sample and to capture dying cells of all shapes. Cell viability was quantified by either of two stains that fluorescently labeled dead cells, i.e., Sytox (MBL international Co., Woburn, MA, USA) or propidium iodine (PI).

This insensitive but standard assay was applied to fasting and glucagon-stimulated blood samples. After screening negative for enrollment purposes, subjects&#x02019; serum was stored and freezer-banked. For subsequent samples (baseline through Week 20), the saved serum was sent to Sweden for analysis of serial C-peptide levels by an ultrasensitive C-peptide assay with a lower level of detection of 1.5 pmol/L and an assay range up to 285 pmol/L (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). For C-peptide values of 1.5&#x02013;37 pmol/L, the within-assay coefficient of variation was 3.8%; for values of 38&#x02013;60 pmol/L, it was 2.6%; and for values of 143&#x02013;285 pmol/L, it was 2.5%. The Mercodia Ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA kit, which is an FDA-listed reagent and has a filed document registration, has been evaluated for accuracy and is classified in the United States as a class one device for ultrasensitive detection of C-peptide levels. This assay is calibrated against the International Reference Reagent for C-peptide, IRR C-peptide 84/510.

Prior to enrollment, a single serum sample for GAD autoantibody was sent either to the Joslin Clinic in Boston, MA, USA (Subject #vi, Subject #i, Subject #ii, Subject #iv) or to Quest Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA, USA) (Subject #iii, Subject #iv).

None of the analyses compared the BCG-treated to placebo-treated clinical trial subjects.</p><p>For each randomized patient, a linear regression model with auto-correlated errors was used for statistical comparisons between baseline and post-treatment periods in autoantibody levels over the course of the study. This was the appropriate test for this comparison because any change in autoantibodies should be sustained over the monitoring period of this trial, i.e., the t <sub>1/2</sub> of B cells that produce antibodies exceeds 60 days. P-values compared the values of each person to their post-baseline values by two-sided test based on a regression model with auto-correlated errors. For C-peptide assays, a cut-off value of 1.5 pmol/L was used since this value is the lower limit of detection of the ultra-sensitive assay used in this study. C-peptide assays were performed by the outside vendors in duplicate; figures are therefore presented as the means +/&#x02212; the SE. For the comparison of EBV-infected or BCG-injected patients to the long-term diabetic reference samples, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test was used to compare the distribution of each patient with the reference samples. We applied this method in a conservative fashion by overestimating the variability of the clinical trial sample, as a more exact comparison is difficult to obtain due to the low sampling frequency and small numbers of measurements per patient in the reference group.

We found that repeated BCG vaccination at low doses was safe and well tolerated. We also found that BCG vaccination and an unexpected EBV infection in a placebo-treated diabetic subject, both known triggers of innate immunity, caused rapid increases in circulating insulin-autoreactive T cells that were mostly dead. The rapid release of dead insulin-autoreactive T cells supports the hypothesis, first demonstrated in the NOD-mouse model of autoimmune diabetes, that BCG ameliorates the advanced autoimmune process underlying type 1 diabetes by stimulating TNF, which selectively kills only disease-causing cells and, further, permits pancreas regeneration <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ryu1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Kodama2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> as evidenced by the transient increase in C-peptide secretion we observed using an ultrasensitive C-peptide assay.</p><p>The response we observed in the placebo subject who experienced an acute EBV infection provides evidence that infectious agents other than <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> can activate innate immunity in long-term diabetic subjects and modify the host&#x02019;s aberrant autoimmune response <xref rid="pone.0041756-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

The transient increases in C-peptide, found after both an acute EBV infection and with BCG vaccinated subjects, suggests a positive impact of these immune perturbations on beta cell function.</p><p>This study may offer mechanistic insights into ongoing clinical trials of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs, such as anti-CD3 antibodies, in new-onset type 1 diabetes. The administration of humanized anti-CD3 antibodies is associated with side effects, including re-activation of EBV in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. as reported to the FDA. Lowering the dose of anti-CD3 antibodies reduced EBV reactivation in clinical studies, but also eliminated efficacy. In another trial of anti-CD3 in new-onset diabetes, the release of greater numbers of insulin-autoreactive-specific T cells correlated with the simultaneous appearance in the circulation of EBV-specific T cells. Taken together, findings from anti-CD3 trials and the trial reported in this paper demonstrate that EBV infection or BCG vaccination marshals innate immunity characterized by known elevations in TNF and that this leads to potentially therapeutic benefits, especially death of insulin-autoreactive T cells.</p><p>Drug development is facilitated by understanding drug mechanism and by development of biomarkers for monitoring early responses to therapy. One previous uncontrolled study of a single dose BCG vaccination reported possibly successful stabilization of blood sugars in 65% of pre-diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0041756-Shehadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

The current trial is unique in now understanding the mechanism of BCG and the development of closely linked bio-markers to track mechanism. We additionally utilized multi-dosing of BCG combined with frequent monitoring for disease-specific biomarkers for up to 20 weeks to observe any TNF-driven immune effects. Intensive monitoring uncovered alterations in disease-specific T cells and changes in C-peptide secretion that suggest brief functional improvement in the pancreas. Our findings are consistent with trials showing BCG vaccination decreased disease activity and prevented progression of brain lesions in advanced multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease similarly sharing autoreactive T cells vulnerable to TNF-triggered cell death <xref rid="pone.0041756-Ristori1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041756-Paolillo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.
