The other 4 modules are intended for smokers, with one of the modules describing benefits of quitting for smokers disinterested in quitting. Three modules provide practical strategies encountered during quitting that facilitate the likelihood of successful cessation. Because clinic outpatients would be completing activities unsupervised, the full-length program was modified to give participants the option of selecting the most relevant modules to work through. To receive compensation of a US $30 gift card, they were required to work through one 20- to 30-minute standalone module and complete pre- and post-tests.

With a majority accessing ASPIRE, this can be considered an advancement in consistent delivery of tobacco prevention education to outpatients. Organizations interested in improving health-care quality are encouraged to use e-mail-based links and/or printed cards to refer patients to education about tobacco use. Unfortunately, 43% who enrolled did not access the program. They may have joined because of social desirability, parental influence, and monetary compensation but reconsidered their participation afterward. After the study, when clinic providers were asked for their thoughts about noncompleters of the study, they suggested some may not trust researchers. A possibility suggested by providers about facilitating future program dissemination could be to involve case workers employed at the clinic with whom patients have professional, trusting relationships.</p><p>Low reports of tobacco use were captured. It is possible participants were a very low-risk group for tobacco use but this is unknowable. Many were of Mexican or Pakistani origin, countries with norms about tobacco use more accepting than in the United States.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2333392817703208" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Providers were asked after the study for their explanations about why so few participants reported tobacco use. The providers felt it was logical participants were uneager to reveal tobacco use when accompanied by parents because of desiring to avoid disapproval. Physicians suggested improvements for increasing patient privacy for a future study.</p><p>Universally high agreement was indicated by study participants when asked if they learned new facts about tobacco, were influenced not to use tobacco, and would share the program with friends and family. Results indicated participants had relatively high preexisting levels of knowledge. Future research will involve pretesting and refining knowledge tests. Referral to antitobacco modules such as ASPIRE by providers has potential for great promise, however, fine-tuning is needed.</p><p>No adverse impact of the pilot study was revealed. The physicians were appreciative of enhanced prevention activities made possible by research staff (ie, enrolling, tracking, placing follow-up reminders, and mailing compensation). Other health clinics may not be able to adopt the program without similar assistance. One solution could be to use automated systems such as computerized telephone and e-mail messaging approved by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This may increase feasibility when scaling-up at additional sites.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2333392817703208"><title>Conclusions and Implications</title><p>Counseling about nicotine and tobacco use prevention and cessation among adolescents is one of the most meaningful investments in population health that clinicians can implement.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2333392817703208" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Additional work is needed to refine implementation and reduce barriers in order to efficiently link adolescents to an evidence-based program encouraging a tobacco-free lifestyle.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2333392817703208"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> Funders did not participate in the study design.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank administrators, providers, and participating patients at Ibn Sina Community Medical Center.
