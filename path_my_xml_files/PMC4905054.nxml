Formula-fed infants (14 &#x000b1; 3 days) were randomized to test or control groups until 112 days of age. Anthropometrics were assessed at 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112 days, and daily records were kept for 2 days prior to study visits. Serum albumin and plasma amino acids at 84 days were assessed in a subset. A total of 282 infants were randomized (124 test, 158 control). Significantly more infants dropped out of the control (56%) as compared with the test (41%) group. Mean daily weight gain was significantly higher in the test group compared with the control group (27.95 &#x000b1; 5.91 vs 25.93 &#x000b1; 6.12 g/d; <italic>P</italic> = .027) with the test group reporting significantly fewer stools (2.2 vs 3.6 stools/d; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). The control group reported significantly more days with &#x0003e;3 loose stools/d and a higher incidence of vomiting as compared with the test group. There were no differences in gas, mood, sleep, or serum albumin. Plasma arginine and valine were significantly lower in the test group, whereas leucine and lysine were higher; all values were within normal limits. Significantly more adverse events attributed to the study formula were reported in the control group. The 100% whey-based hypoallergenic EHF containing <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> and medium chain triglycerides supported growth of healthy infants. Future studies on the application of this formula in clinically indicated populations are warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>extensively hydrolyzed</kwd><kwd>infant formula</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>cow&#x02019;s milk allergy</kwd><kwd>whey protein</kwd><kwd><italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2333794X16636613"><title>Background</title><p>It is widely accepted that breastfeeding is the gold standard to promote optimal growth and development of newborns. Cow&#x02019;s milk&#x02013;based infant formulas are often used to supplement breast milk or used exclusively in infants whose mothers choose not to breastfeed. Approximately 2% to 3% of infants are allergic or intolerant to cow&#x02019;s milk formula and require an alternative formula.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr3-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) for the dietary management of infants who are allergic or intolerant to intact cow&#x02019;s milk formula.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>A new, 100% whey-based, extensively hydrolyzed, nutritionally complete infant formula designed for the dietary management of infants with cow&#x02019;s milk protein allergy has been developed. This EHF also contains the probiotic <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> (<italic>B lactis</italic> CNCM I-3446). Supplementation of infant formula with probiotics (live microorganisms capable of colonizing the intestinal tract to beneficially influence host health) may provide benefits beyond general nutrition. <italic>B lactis</italic> is a well-characterized bifidobacteria strain originally isolated from human feces. It has been extensively studied in <italic>in vitro</italic> and clinical studies in pediatric populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr9-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This probiotic has a designated Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for use in routine infant formulas, and it has been utilized in infant formulas for more than 15 years worldwide.</p><p>The medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) content of this formula as compared with commercially available EHFs in the United States is relatively high (49% of fat source). MCTs provide a readily available fat source designated for use in conditions of fat malabsorption. These triglycerides have fatty acids with chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12 carbons in length and are able to be absorbed into the portal circulation independent of bile acids and pancreatic enzymes and more rapidly than long-chain triglycerides (LCTs).<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Because their intraluminal hydrolysis is rapid and relatively complete, MCTs are absorbed mainly as free fatty acids and only rarely as monodiacylglycerols. In addition, MCTs are a good source of acetyl groups, which are useful in lipid synthesis.</p><p>The present study evaluated the effects of this new formula on overall growth and tolerance in healthy, term infants by comparing weight gain in healthy infants receiving this new EHF infant formula with a group of infants receiving a similar commercial formula from 2 weeks to 4 months of age. Additional measures included length and head circumference (HC), feeding tolerance, serum albumin and plasma amino acids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333794X16636613"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of 2 formula groups in parallel conducted at 25 sites throughout the United States. Participants were healthy, full-term (&#x0003e;37 weeks gestation), exclusively formula-fed infants with birth weights ranging from 2500 to 4500 g, whose caregivers had given informed consent to participate in the study. Caregivers had chosen to exclusively formula feed their infants prior to study enrollment. Exclusion criteria were the following: congenital illness or malformations that affected infant feeding and/or normal growth, suspected or known allergy to cow&#x02019;s milk protein, significant prenatal and/or postnatal disease, any readmission to hospital (except for hyperbilirubinemia) prior to enrollment, receiving oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy in the 10 days prior to enrollment or probiotics in the week before enrollment, or receiving prescription medication (with exception of topical antibiotics and/or treatment for thrush) or frequent use of over-the-counter medications, except vitamin and mineral supplements.</p><p>At 14 &#x000b1; 3 days of life, after receiving informed consent from caregivers, participants were randomized to either a 100% whey-based, extensively hydrolyzed infant formula with 49% of its fat source from MCT (test; Nestl&#x000e9; Nutrition, Florham Park, NJ) or a commercially available casein-based extensively hydrolyzed infant formula with 55% of its fat source from MCT (control; Pregestimil, Mead Johnson Nutritionals, Evansville, IN).

Study visits were scheduled at 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112 days of life, where weight, length, and HC were measured. For 2 days prior to each study visit, caregivers kept a detailed record of formula intake, stool characteristics, spit-up, vomit, longest stretch of sleep, and mood of the infant. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout the study.

Secondary outcomes, including safety end points, were analyzed in the ITT population.</p><p>The ITT population was defined as all randomized participants who took any amount of the study formula. The PP population was defined as those who took study formula continuously over the whole treatment period. A break of no longer than 3 days was accepted. In addition, those with the following conditions were excluded from the PP population: hospitalization for more than 3 days and nonexclusive feeding of assigned formula during the first 4 months of the study. A nonexclusive formula diet was defined as follows: more than 1 bottle of another formula per week, or being off study formula feeding for &#x02265;3 consecutive days, or taking 4 or more teaspoons (ie, 20 g) of complementary foods per day, and/or taking more than 3 oz of juice per day.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section4-2333794X16636613"><title>Results</title><p>Caregivers of 282 infants consented to their infants participating in the study.

One compared growth in infants fed an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula versus an amino acid&#x02013;based formula,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> whereas the other compared a liquid and powder EHF.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In these studies, the growth observed in the EHF groups was 28.2 g/d,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> 28.9 g/d, and 28.4 g/d,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which is comparable to the growth that the sexes combined in the test group (27.95 &#x000b1; 5.91 g/d) exhibited in the study presented here.</p><p>When looking at the PP analysis, for boys and girls combined, there was a statistical difference between groups for daily weight gain (28.09 g/d in test vs 25.42 g/d in control; <italic>P</italic> = .020). As in the ITT analysis, this difference was within the AAP-CON recommendations<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (difference of 2.67 g/d). Similar to the ITT analysis, in the PP group, boys in the test group had significantly greater weight gains than those in the control group, with the difference in the PP group being 4.22 g/d (30.81 g/d in test boys; 26.59 g/d in control boys). The study was designed to show noninferiority of the test product as compared with the control formula; it was not expected to show superiority of one product over another in terms of growth differences &#x0003e;3 g/d for sexes combined or separately. The result that boys in the test group had significantly greater daily weight gains and that this difference was greater than the AAP-CON recommended 3 g/d difference, was unexpected. For the purpose of the original intent of the study, noninferiority was demonstrated in terms of growth for the test formula.</p><p>It is uncertain why the boys in the control group had statistically significantly lower weight gains. Formula intakes of the PP population between the groups were statistically significantly greater at 84 and 112 days of age and for visits combined in the control group; therefore, the difference in weight gain could not be attributed to less volume intake. Although not evaluated, perhaps differences in actual stool volume could have affected weights. Participants in the control group did have significantly more stools. The osmolality of the control formula is 320 mOsm/kg water, whereas the test formula is 217 mOsm/kg water. While neither formula is hypertonic, it is possible that this difference in the formula could have affected stool consistency, with looser stools being seen in the control group (34% in the control compared with 6% in the test group; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2333794X16636613">Table 4</xref>). This could have affected the weights observed in this study. It is important to note that for sexes combined, differences in weight gain were within 3 g/d. One difference seen was between parents/caregivers of infants assigned to control formula or test formula, where significantly more parents/caregivers of infants in the control formula group smoked than parents/caregivers of infants in the test formula group in the ITT sample. Also, maternal education was higher in the test group. Although this may have affected feeding practices, it is uncertain why any effects of either of these factors would have been seen in boys but not in girls.</p><p>There were some stool pattern similarities observed in this study as compared with other studies of EHFs.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In a study comparing an extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formula with an amino acid-based formula, the stool frequency in the extensively hydrolyzed casein formula group was reported as 3.5 stools/d at day 14 and 2.9 stools/d at 28 days.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This is comparable to the control group in our study (3.6 stools/d), and the protein hydrolysate base used in both these formulas was from the same manufacturer. A stool frequency of 1.5 to 3.2 stools/d when using a liquid casein-based EHF and 1.2 to 2.5 stools/d when using a powder casein-based EHF has also been reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This is lower than what was observed in the powder control group of this study. In comparison, the whey-based test group in studied here reported 2.2 stools/d, which is less than the frequency observed for the control group of this study as well as in other studies evaluating EHF.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Stool consistency was reported on a different scale than used in this study; however, it was noted that compared with an amino acid&#x02013;based formula, stools in the EHF group were more firm at 14 and 28 days of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X16636613" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Both test and control groups had higher-than-expected drop-out rates, with a significantly higher drop-out rate in the control group (56%) as compared with the test group (41%). Participants in this study were healthy infants, with no clinical indication for an EHF; therefore, the unusual smell/taste consistent with these formulas could have prompted caregivers to withdraw their infants from the study. A limitation of this study is that the population consisted of healthy infants who may not have the necessity to use an EHF. Further studies on the longer-term use of this formula in specific populations such as infants with cow&#x02019;s milk allergy are warranted. It would be interesting to compare drop-out rates in such a population with that seen in this study because infants with cow&#x02019;s milk allergy may require use of an EHF.</p><p>In conclusion, a multicenter 4-month trial was conducted to establish noninferiority in weight gain between a new 100% whey-based EHF and a control formula. Study results confirmed daily weight gain between groups within 3 g/d for sexes combined. Therefore, the study objective was met, with adequate growth demonstrated in infants fed the new 100% whey-based EHF.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2333794X16636613"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DF was responsible for recruitment of majority of subjects, interpretation of results, and critical review and input into the manuscript.
