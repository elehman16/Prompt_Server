[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PVR can be considered a maladapted wound healing response in the retina, which results in the formation of fibrocellular membranes on both surfaces of the retina and the posterior hyaloid face. Contraction of these membranes can result in distortion of the normal retinal topography with visually detrimental sequelae, and/or tractional retinal detachment, with the reopening of pre-existing breaks or the formation of new ones.</p><p>PVR represents a difficult vitreoretinal surgical challenge and despite the improvements in vitreoretinal surgery, a significant number of cases fail to achieve reattachment. Multiple surgeries are frequently required to eventually achieve final retinal attachment with poor visual results and unsatisfactory binocular visual outcomes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, PVR management is costly in patient time and health-care resources
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Numerous adjunctive medications have been previously evaluated in clinical trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], yet no effective and safe adjunct has gained widespread acceptance to improve surgical and visual outcomes. The proposed study is a large-scale prospective randomised controlled clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Ozurdex as an adjunctive medication. A positive result of the study would have an immediate clinical application worldwide.</p><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>PVR peri-retinal membranes comprise four categories of cells; retinal pigment epithelium, glial, inflammatory and fibroblastic cells. These cells proliferate and may also be contractile and are thus targets for anti-proliferative agents. There is also a notable inflammatory component to the PVR process with marked blood-retinal barrier breakdown and intraocular fibrin formation. Thus both cellular proliferation and the intraocular inflammatory response are realistic targets for adjunctive treatments in PVR.</p><p>Steroid treatment can potentially influence both the inflammatory and proliferative components of PVR. Experimental work has substantiated the theory that corticosteroids can reduce M&#x000fc;ller cell proliferation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and reduce the severity of PVR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Previous small-scale, uncontrolled clinical studies of PVR have suggested intravitreal crystalline cortisone was well tolerated in PVR cases undergoing vitrectomy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and that systemic prednisolone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], infused dexamethasone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and intravitreal triamcinolone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] may reduce the severity of PVR although none of these studies were of sufficient power to provide a definitive answer. A small prospective non-comparative clinical study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] concluded that intravitreal triamcinolone may have some benefit as an adjunct in non-trauma-related established PVR; however, this was contradicted by a small randomised controlled trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] where no additional benefit in surgical outcome was found. Both groups concluded that further larger studies were required to answer the question definitively.</p><p>The relatively short therapeutic duration of action of triamcinolone may offer an explanation as to why it has not emerged as a definitive adjunct, and the adoption of a longer-acting sustained-release preparation may offer additional advantages.</p></sec><sec><title>Investigational medicinal product</title><p>Ozurdex&#x000ae; is an intravitreal implant containing 700 &#x003bc;g of dexamethasone in a slow-release preparation. It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with macula oedema following retinal vein occlusion (either branch or central)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is increasingly being administered to treat the aforementioned retinal conditions and has a good local and systemic safety profile
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is particularly useful in patients who have isolated ocular disease especially unilateral, providing an anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative efficacy equal to or greater than that achieved with systemic administration while avoiding the unwanted systemic side effects of steroid use.</p><p>A study comparing the pharmacokinetics of this dexamethasone preparation in vitrectomised and non-vitrectomised experimental eyes concluded there was a similar vitreoretinal pharmacokinetic profile
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The clinical safety profile and therapeutic benefit of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in patients who have previously undergone vitrectomy surgery has been reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The IMP reaches a therapeutic concentration shortly after administration and peaks at 2 months, thus adequately covering the active PVR process, proffering additional advantages over shorter-acting agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that an adjunctive slow-release dexamethasone implant, given at the time of surgery, can improve the anatomical outcome of vitreoretinal surgery for established PVR and that there will be stable retinal reattachment with removal of silicone oil without additional vitreoretinal surgical intervention at 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The secondary objectives are to determine whether an adjunctive slow-release dexamethasone implant, given at the time of surgery, has an effect on the following at 6 and 12 months following the primary study vitrectomy:</p><p>&#x02022;visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) method)</p><p>&#x02022;macula oedema and thickness (spectralis domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) analysis)</p><p>&#x02022;development of overt PVR recurrence at any time point</p><p>&#x02022;complete retinal reattachment</p><p>&#x02022;posterior (post equatorial) retinal reattachment</p><p>&#x02022;tractional retinal detachment</p><p>&#x02022;hypotony or raised intraocular pressure (IOP)</p><p>&#x02022;macula pucker or epiretinal membrane (ERM)</p><p>&#x02022;cataract</p><p>&#x02022;quality of life as assessed by NEI VFQ25, SF36 and depression screening questionnaires
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This phase III single-masked randomised control study aims to determine whether there is a beneficial effect in using a slow-release dexamethasone preparation as an adjunctive treatment at the time of surgery in patients with established PVR following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.</p><p>The 140 patients are to be divided into two equal groups (treatment and control arm). They are recruited for the study if they satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants are masked to their treatment allocation until completion of the study and the operating surgeon is masked until the time of IMP delivery.</p><p>Both groups will receive standard surgical treatment and routine preoperative and postoperative treatment and care comprising standard 3 port <italic>pars plana</italic> vitrectomy (or gel trimming if the eye was previously vitrectomised) and internal identification of retinal breaks; peeling of anterior and posterior epiretinal membranes and removal of subretinal membrane if required; relief of traction by retinectomy or placement of a scleral buckle at the operating surgeon&#x02019;s discretion; retinopexy to retinal breaks and retinectomy edge by cryotherapy or laser; intraocular tamponade using 1300 or 5000 centistoke silicone oil. Intra-oil medication, the IMP, will be administered through a sclerostomy prior to wound closure in the treatment group.</p><p>A check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection of the IMP will be performed, along with digital indentation to confirm a satisfactory IOP once all scleral ports have been sutured. Biomicroscopy will be performed the following day to confirm the position of the implant.</p><p>If a patient is rendered aphakic as part of the operative procedure and they have been randomised to receive the IMP, the study treatment will not be given
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], but the patient will still be followed up as part of the study.</p><p>Removal of silicone oil (combined with cataract extraction plus intraocular lens implantation when applicable) will be planned for 3 to 5 months after primary surgery. On removal of oil, a second dexamethasone implant will be administered with performance of the same aforementioned safety monitoring. Again, if a patient is rendered aphakic or an anterior chamber intraocular lens is inserted as part of the operative procedure, and the patient has been randomised to receive the IMP, the study treatment will not be given. The patient will still be followed up as part of the study.</p><p>Patients who do not satisfy the criteria for controlled IOP preoperatively (see management of IOP), will not receive their second IMP injection.</p><sec><title>Study visits and assessment schedule</title><p>Postoperative study visits will not differ from the routine schedule for vitreoretinal procedures at the study site for the first 6 months that is day 1, day 10, day 30, 3 months and 6 months. Further assessments will be scheduled for 9 and 12 months post initial surgery. The time window allowed around these scheduled visits will be as follows: day 10 (+/- 3 days), day 30 (+/- 7 days) and months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (+/- 14 days). At each scheduled postoperative study visit, a full ophthalmic assessment will be completed, including slit lamp biomicroscopy (with indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy when required) and recording of parameters including ETDRS visual acuity, Goldman applanation tonometry, anterior segment assessment and retinal attachment status. SD-OCT will be used to record the central foveal thickness and total macula volume. An additional study visit to assess IOP has been included in the protocol schedule at day 60 postoperatively following both the study vitrectomy and the removal of oil procedure.</p><p>Silicone oil removal will not be considered a reoperation and there will be routine subsequent follow-ups until the patient can return to the study visit schedule. Other vitreoretinal interventions (with the exception of external retinal laser treatment, and macula ERM peel) over the trial period will be considered reoperations and recorded as such. Postoperative visits related to reoperations, or any other attendance outside the study visit schedule, will be recorded as 'unscheduled visits&#x02019;. Case report forms (CRFs) identical in composition to the study scheduled visit CRF will be completed and included in the data analysis on completion of the study.</p><p>Following the final study visit at 12 months, participants will be discharged back to the care of their general practitioner. Participants requiring ongoing ophthalmic care will be followed up by their admitting consultant or will be under the care of a more appropriate specialist consultant, for example, a glaucoma specialist.</p></sec><sec><title>Management of intraocular pressure</title><p>The commonest significant side effect of this dexamethasone preparation is raised intraocular pressure (&#x02265; 25 mmHg) and was reported to occur in approximately 25% of participants in two phase III safety trials, peaking at day 60 and returning to baseline at 6 months. The investigators will include the additional risk of a rise in intraocular pressure with the trial treatment within the participant information leaflet (PIL).</p><p>As stated, an additional study visit at day 60 to assess IOP has been included in the protocol schedule and is specified in the PIL. The investigators will, as much as possible, adhere to an explicit management plan for raised IOP. This plan has been approved by an external glaucoma specialist and is given in Table&#x000a0;

Due to the poor prognosis associated with current standard treatment, we expect a high recruitment uptake following successful eligibility screening. We remain optimistic that our recruitment target will be met within the projected timescale.</p><p>We accept that although our inclusion criteria specifies Grade C PVR requiring surgery with silicone oil, the cohort of participants is likely to be quite a heterogeneous group. The severity of Grade C PVR can vary widely throughout its sub-classification both in terms of extent (number of clock hours) and distribution (focal, diffuse, anterior, posterior or subretinal). However, we expect the adequacy of randomisation to compensate for this and shall acknowledge any unequal weighting within the groups as limitations of the study. We do, however, accept that we may limit our sensitivity to small differences between the two groups.</p><p>As this single centre study serves a wide geographical catchment area with a broad patient demographic representative of the UK, we do not expect the results to provide a misleading estimate of treatment effect. Again, we expect the adequacy of randomisation to compensate for any variation of effect between ethnicities.</p><p>The authors acknowledge the limitations of a single masked study, but have made every effort to reduce investigator bias. As the IMP is no longer visible inside the eye after approximately 8 weeks, it is unlikely that the investigators will be aware of the treatment allocation of the participant at the time of the primary and secondary outcome assessments. The trial team considered using an independent assessor of the primary outcome measure at 6 and 12 months, but felt that there was insufficient evidence to suggest this was necessary and that it added additional unjustifiable cost to the study.</p><p>Furthermore, by 1) masking the operating surgeon to the treatment allocation until the end of the surgical procedure and 2) explicitly defining the clinical findings and adverse events and adhering to rigid management protocols, (for example, for an IOP rise), we have limited investigator bias as much as possible.</p><p>In summary, this is the first randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the use of an adjunctive slow-release dexamethasone implant in patients undergoing vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachments with proliferative vitreoretinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The authors confirm that the trial was in active recruitment at the time of manuscript submission.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CRF: Case report form; IMP: Investigational medicinal product; IOP: Intraocular pressure; ITT: Intention to treat; MHRA: Medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency; PIL: Participant information leaflet; PVR: proliferative vitreoretinopathy; REC: Research and ethics committee; SD-OCT: Spectralis domain optical coherence tomography; ETDRS: Early treatment diabetic retinopathy study; ERM: Epiretinal membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PJB participated in development of the trial protocol, gained regulatory authority approvals, coordinated the trial set-up at the study site, prepared the standard operating procedures, study documentation and drafted the manuscript.
