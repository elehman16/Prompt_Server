No trials or epidemiology studies to date have investigated a link with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A single case report has suggested a benefit in IBS of vitamin D supplementation. We hypothesised that IBS participants with vitamin D insufficiency would benefit from repletion in terms of their IBS symptoms. We undertook a pilot trial to provide data to support a power calculation and to justify a full trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomised, double blinded, three-arm parallel design trial of vitamin D, placebo or a combination of vitamin D and probiotics. Participants were further stratified according to whether they were vitamin D replete or insufficient. Vitamin D status was determined by blood test at baseline and exit; IBS symptoms were assessed by validated questionnaire; dietary intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A significant proportion of the IBS population were vitamin D deficient, such that the replete stratum could not be adequately recruited. There was a significant association in the baseline data between circulating vitamin D level and quality of life (&#x0201c;How much has IBS affected your life?&#x0201d;). Supplementation significantly improved vitamin D level versus placebo. IBS symptoms were not significantly improved in this pilot, although a power calculation was enabled from the intervention data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The IBS population exhibits significant levels of vitamin D insufficiency and would benefit from screening and possible supplementation. The impact of IBS on quality of life may be reduced by vitamin D level. Future trials should have a sample size of over 97.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number:</title><p>ICTRN 6116003917.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</kwd><kwd>VITAMINS</kwd><kwd>PROBIOTICS</kwd><kwd>QUALITY OF LIFE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Summary box</title></caption><sec><title>What is already known about this subject?</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects 10&#x02013;15% of western populations, yet its pathogenesis and management are poorly characterised.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>Vitamin D supplementation has been associated with positive outcomes in other lower-GI conditions, including cancer prevention and colitis.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>Few studies to date have reported any relationship between vitamin D and IBS, although we recently reported a case study in this area.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What are the new findings?</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>The IBS population exhibits low concentrations of serum 25OHD; these levels respond to supplementation.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>There is a significant positive association between quality of life and circulating 25OHD concentrations.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>We provide data on which to inform power calculations for a larger clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation in IBS patients.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x025b8;&#x000a0;</label><p>The data provide evidence for widespread vitamin D insufficiency in people with IBS.

Most hypotheses involve altered intraluminal milieu, immune activation, enteric neuromuscular dysfunction and brain&#x02013;gut axis dysregulation. It is thought that the intestinal microbiota might play an important role as bacterial infection, antibiotic use and chronic low-grade inflammation are associated with IBS onset.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Several studies have implicated changes in the colon microbiota may be associated with IBS symptoms, including perturbation in bile acid metabolism and electrolyte absorption.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This theory is further supported by generally beneficial effects of bacteriotherapeutic interventions (<italic>vide infra</italic>).</p><p>Therapy for IBS is primarily targeted at treating the symptoms experienced, and include loperamide for diarrhoea, methylcellulose for constipation and smooth-muscle relaxants for abdominal pain.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Nonetheless, symptom treatment meets with limited success and may not be effective for long-term management of IBS.</p><p>Mounting data suggest that probiotics may be beneficial in the management of IBS. A recent systematic review of 35 trials investigating probiotic use in IBS showed that 25 of these studies reported a beneficial effect on the primary outcomes including global symptom severity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The effect on secondary outcomes varied between studies with improvements seen in flatulence and abdominal bloating following treatment with VSL#3.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Other studies demonstrated a decrease in abdominal pain after 4&#x02005;weeks of treatment with <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> 299V when compared to control.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our previous work has demonstrated an improvement in global symptom severity in people with IBS following 8&#x02005;weeks of supplementation with LAB4 probiotic.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>We recently reported a case study of an IBS patient taking high dose (3000&#x02005;IU daily) vitamin D. The participant reported remission of IBS symptoms following supplementation, with a recurrence of the symptoms on supplementation cessation. Additionally, analysis of social media (blogs/forums) reports from 37 IBS patients found that 70% described improvements in their symptoms with supplementation and the majority of these individuals reported being vitamin D deficient before supplementation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A role for vitamin D supplementation in gastrointestinal health is also supported by studies showing associations between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A recent systematic review suggested there may be benefits of vitamin D supplementation in IBD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>On the basis of our previous case report,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> we hypothesised that patients with IBS who are vitamin D insufficient, would report improvement in symptoms following vitamin D supplementation. We further sought to test whether vitamin D supplementation in combination with a probiotic preparation would act synergistically.</p><p>There are no published randomised controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in IBS and therefore no data on which to base a power calculation. A formal aim of this trial is to provide data to allow such calculations to be undertaken, enabling properly scaled clinical trials to be designed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was granted by The University of Sheffield Research Ethics Committee (Ref: SMBRER278).

Reported quality of life will be influenced by the depression status of participants, a common comorbidity in IBS.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Numerous studies have reported that vitamin D levels are correlated with depression. In one such study vitamin D deficiency in young healthy individuals predicted clinical depression across a 4-week period, noting that as vitamin D levels increased due to seasonal difference in sunlight exposure volunteers showed lower levels of depression.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A similar pattern was seen in patients suffering post-stroke depression: lower serum vitamin D correlated with depression.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The exact mechanism through which vitamin D improves depression is not fully understood. However, vitamin D status has been implicated in neurological development,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed throughout the nervous system where its activation is linked to neurotransmitter levels and serotonin synthesis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Additionally binding of 25OHD-VDR complex results in expression of 1-&#x003b1;-hydroxylase which converts 25OHD to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This 25OHD metabolite has been shown to upregulate neurotrophins which in turn promote survival and differentiation of nerve cells.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> VDR is also expressed in the gut and regulates epithelial barrier function and bowel inflammation<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> suggesting that a vitamin D deficient diet may directly impact bowel function and hence IBS symptomology. Our attempt to distinguish the effects of circulating and ingested vitamin D did not support either model, likely due to underpowering.</p><p>Supplementation with vitamin D increased serum 25OHD concentrations from baseline with a significantly greater improvement seen compared to participants receiving placebo. Nonetheless the group receiving placebo showed an improvement in 25OHD levels. This may have prevented us from detecting a significant difference in symptom scores between the placebo and supplemented groups at exit. This general increase in serum 25OHD across intervention arms was likely due to seasonal differences in sun exposure. It has been found in previous studies that the percentage of individuals in the UK deficient for vitamin D ranges from 30&#x02013;40% (January&#x02013;March) to 2&#x02013;13% (July&#x02013;September).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Study participants were recruited in the early months of 2014 (January&#x02013;April) with most follow-up visits taking place from May to August, most likely explaining the rise in 25OHD in all groups.</p><p>An exploratory analysis of participants by IBS subtype showed that there was a marked improvement in response to vitamin D supplementation across nearly all IBS symptoms in participants with IBS-C (see online supplementary figure S3). Interestingly the proportion of these participants that were considered severely deficient was low in comparison to the other IBS subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJGAST2015000052F2">figure 2</xref>B). A clear limitation is the very small numbers in groups when the data is split but the observation suggests a future study into vitamin D supplementation in this subgroup may be justified.</p><p>Throughout this study we failed to observe a significant interaction with intervention with either vitamin D alone or in combination with probiotic. This is likely explained by a number of limitations in the study. First, we observed an effect of the placebo on symptom scores: IBS symptoms have a highly variable course (compare week-2 and 0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJGAST2015000052F3">figures 3</xref>B, D for example). It is recommended that active intervention in IBS last a minimum of 4&#x02005;weeks and potentially up to 6&#x02005;months for long-term analysis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Furthermore, as a pilot study the current trial is inherently underpowered. In order to detect a statistically significant response in total symptom severity scores we would need larger sample sizes. With the data generated in this study it was calculated that a sample size of 74 per arm would be needed. This was calculated based on change in total symptom severity at exit with a placebo mean of &#x02212;16, a mean of &#x02212;54 for vitamin D intervention, a combined SD of 82 and assuming a desired power of 80% with an &#x003b1; error of 0.05.</p><p>It is possible that seasonal variations in vitamin D levels may impact IBS in the current study. Our data show a general improvement in symptom score and improved 25OHD over the duration of this study is tempting to speculate that increased sunlight exposure increases vitamin D levels which in turn improved IBS symptoms. Such effects have been previously shown for IBS and IBD symptoms.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, there was a significantly greater effect of vitamin D intervention than placebo on circulating vitamin D. Taken together, these data suggestion that seasonal variation should also be taken into account in the design of trials to assess the potential application of vitamin D in IBS.</p><p>In summary we have shown that IBS sufferers deficient in vitamin D experience poorer quality of lives than their replete counterparts. Our data demonstrate the need for additional studies of more than 8&#x02005;weeks in duration with recruitment of a larger cohort of IBS patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the staff at Sheffield Clinical Research Facility for support phlebotomy and use of their research environment; Ms Fatma Gossiel undertook clinical biochemical assays for vitamin D; Ms Dolappo Owoeye and Ms Farhana ab Hadi entered diet data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ST completed exit analyses, entered all data, undertook all statistical analyses, wrote the first draft of the paper.
