Informed consent and demographic information was collected. Patients were divided in two groups by randomization through tossing a coin. Group-A patients received Metformin tablet alone at 500 mg after dinner and Group-B patients were treated with same dosage of Metformin along with oral vitamin D at 200,000 IU monthly for three months. Blood sample was obtained at baseline, 3 months and 6 months of initiation of therapy. All samples were sent to the laboratory for complete blood count, blood sugar fasting, serum calcium, serum phosphorous, serum alkaline phosphatase, HbA1c and serum 25 Hyroxy Vitamin D (S-25(OH) D) levels and iPTH.

The results of this study were very conflicting when compared with other studies. One reason for conflicting results in this study could be explained by the fact that in HbA1c was significantly higher in combination group as compared to metformin alone group, that is why at final follow-up the mean HbA1c was also low in metformin group alone.</p><p>In Type II diabetes mellitus, significant improvements in HbA1c are obtained with enhanced Vitamin D supplementation as part of drug regimen over time. Investigation provides the first known evidence of a relationship between enhanced Vitamin D supplementation as part of a pre-existing medical regimen taken over long term and determinants of Type II diabetes mellitus in a group of overweight and obese patients with Type II diabetes mellitus.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Experimental data have indicated that Vitamin D insufficiency has an important influence on glucose metabolism. The majority of epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between low Vitamin D and insulin resistance and/or Type II diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless evidence from randomized controlled trials remains inconclusive.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Nwosu et al showed that after three months of Vitamin D supplementation, there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D in Type II diabetes mellitus patients (p = 0.015). This study concluded that there was a clinically significant decrease in HbA1c from 8.5&#x000b1;2.9% at baseline to 7.7&#x000b1;2.5% in Type II diabetic patients. This study included both Type I and Type II diabetics and all the patients were given vitamin D and interestingly it also concluded that there was no clinically-significant decrease in HbA1c in Type I diabetics (8.5 &#x000b1; 1.2 to 8.53 &#x000b1; 1.1%).<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Another study aimed to investigate the effect of 16-week daily vitamin D3 supplementation on HbA1C. Interestingly this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that despite the fact that 25(OH) D increased from a mean of approximately 29nmol/L at baseline to 49 nmol/L after intervention but did not improve HbA1c.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The major contrast of this study with current one is that they included healthy subjects only and they replaced oral vitamin D daily in two dosage contraries to the present study, where vitamin D was given monthly.</p><p>The results of the current study are comparable with the Krul-Poel et al. who showed that mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyVitamin D increased from 60.6 &#x000b1; 23.3 to 101.4 &#x000b1; 27.6 nmol/L and 59.1 &#x000b1; 23.2 to 59.8 &#x000b1; 23.2 nmol/L in Vitamin D plus metformin group and metformin alone group, respectively. Mean baseline HbA1c was 6.8 &#x000b1; 0.5% in both groups. After 6 months, no effect was seen on HbA1c (mean difference: b = 0.4 [95% CI20.6 to 1.5]; P = 0.42) and other indicators of glycemic control (HOMA of insulin resistance, fasting insulin, and glucose) in the entire study population. Subgroup analysis in patients with a serum 25(OH) D&#x0003c;50 nmol/L or anHbA1c level&#x0003e; 7% (53 mmol/mol) did not differ the results.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Prakash et al., results state otherwise that judicious supplementation of vitamin D amongst vitamin D deficient type 2 diabetic patients with near normal HbA1c can reduce the blood sugar level. HbA1c reduce to target levels if it is minimally elevated. These conflicting results can be explained by the fact that in this study conducted by Prakash et al. they did not alter the medicines in any group and most of the study subjects were taking more than one antidiabetic medicines. Moreover, the replacement oral vitamin D supplementation done was at dose of 60.000IU weekly for 3 months in one group as compared to present study where it was given monthly but at 200,000 IU.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Firstly, all the patients were one single drug therapy as contrast to international studies where patients were on multiple drugs including insulin. Moreover, the dosage of vitamin D was monthly which can explain the inadequate results of the study as the absorption status of the patients could vary depending upon the complications of diabetes especially autonomic neuropathy which was not evaluated in this study. But its negative results at least give an insight into the fact that prescribing vitamin D should be discouraged in diabetic patients for controlling blood sugar level until compelling study results are available world-wide.</p><p>There is no doubt that further studies have to be conducted with different methodology and inclusion and exclusion criteria which could give more insight into the effectiveness of vitamin D in glycemic control of diabetic patients before final verdict can be made.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Vitamin D
