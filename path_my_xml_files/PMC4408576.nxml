Bleeding is caused by a combination of physical causes, such as failure of the uterus to contract or operations, and is made worse by impairment of the blood clotting system. A number of studies have shown that low levels of the blood clotting factor fibrinogen are associated with progression of bleeding, the need for invasive interventions and transfusions of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). This trial will investigate whether early infusion of fibrinogen concentrate during a major PPH, with the aim of correcting a low fibrinogen to a level that is normal for delivery, based on the Fibtem test, reduces the total number of allogeneic blood products (red blood cells, FFP, cryoprecipitate and platelets) transfused after study medication until discharge, compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial. Women will enter an observational phase and if their Fibtem levels fall they will be randomised in the interventional phase. A total of 60 women will be randomised and women are eligible for the trial if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: age 18&#x000a0;years or over, gestation &#x02265;24&#x02009;+&#x02009;0&#x000a0;weeks, haemorrhage of about 1500&#x000a0;ml and on-going bleeding without another complication or haemorrhage of about 1000&#x000a0;ml and caesarean section/uterine atony/placental abruption/placenta praevia/cardiovascular instability or microvascular oozing.

Major PPH can be divided into moderate at 1000&#x02013;2000&#x000a0;ml or severe at over 2000&#x000a0;ml. Severe PPH is also defined as a fall in haemoglobin of &#x02265;40&#x000a0;g/l or the need for transfusion of 4 or more units of red blood cells (RBC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Massive PPH has been described as bleeds of more than 2500&#x000a0;ml and is associated with significant morbidity, even in resource-rich countries, including admission to high dependency and intensive care and emergency hysterectomy (6-8% of cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>PPH is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Worldwide PPH accounts for at least 30% of all maternal deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], whilst in the UK massive PPH accounts for 75% of severe childbirth-related morbidity affecting 6:1000 deliveries each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The incidence of massive PPH has increased over the last 10&#x000a0;years in the UK and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and outcomes have not improved over that time period. Deaths directly caused by obstetric bleeding in the UK have had an incidence between 0.33 and 0.93 per 100,000 deliveries over the last 15&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>PPH results from a combination of physical causes such as trauma, uterine atony and placental complications and is exacerbated by haemostatic impairment. Haemostatic impairment is caused by a combination of consumptive and dilutional coagulopathies. This leads to low levels of fibrinogen early during PPH and before clinically significant depletion of other coagulation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The low fibrinogen level results in the formation of poor quality clots and contributes to on-going bleeding. Bleeding is exacerbated by fibrinolysis (the breakdown of fibrin clots), which is often increased during PPH.</p><p>There are no high-quality data to guide the replacement of coagulation factors during PPH. Coagulation factors are often replaced with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) but there is limited evidence to support its efficacy. When as well as how much FFP to infuse in any clinical situation is debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend identical haemostatic support during PPH as for all other clinical situations of massive haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is limited evidence to support these transfusion guidelines in any clinical situation and none in PPH; studies in this area have been highlighted as a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Physiological changes in coagulation at the time of delivery mean that standard transfusion triggers, such as those used in trauma (and recommended in current guidelines), are unlikely to be applicable at the time of a major PPH. At term the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are shorter and fibrinogen is higher than in the non-pregnant population. In addition, the PT and aPTT often remain normal despite very large bleeds. The current recommendation is to infuse FFP during PPH when the PT or aPTT is greater than 1.5 times normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but this is not supported by any evidence and these coagulation abnormalities will be associated with established haemostatic failure and microvascular bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Audit data demonstrate that clinicians often do not follow these recommendations in clinical practice when dealing with severe PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The fibrinogen level at the time of delivery is between 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;g/l compared to 1.5-4&#x000a0;g/l in the non-pregnant healthy population. Current recommendations are to maintain the fibrinogen level above 1 or 1.5&#x000a0;g/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. During an on-going PPH it is not known whether fibrinogen should be replaced to a level appropriate to the non-pregnant population or a level appropriate for the time of delivery. There are data, however, suggesting that a fibrinogen level associated with the time of delivery might be more appropriate.</p><p>There are no systematic reviews of the use of fibrinogen concentrate in PPH; however, the fibrinogen level has been shown to be a useful predictor of progression from early to severe PPH in multiple studies. A fibrinogen level below 2.9&#x000a0;g/l, taken early during labour (before any bleeding has occurred), had an odds ratio of 19 for progression to PPH. In this study a fibrinogen of &#x0003c;2.9&#x000a0;g/l had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 39% for progression to PPH whilst a fibrinogen above 2.9&#x000a0;g/l had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In other studies, a low fibrinogen level, taken early during a PPH, was predictive of the need for invasive procedures or infusion of RBC and FFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Charbit et al. found that a fibrinogen level below 2&#x000a0;g/l, taken during an on-going PPH, had a PPV of 100% for progression to severe PPH, defined in part as the need for at least 4 units of RBC, whilst a fibrinogen level above 4&#x000a0;g/l had a NPV of 85-90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Gayat et al. demonstrated that a fibrinogen level below 2&#x000a0;g/l, taken after a 1000&#x000a0;ml estimated blood loss, was an independent predictor for the need for an invasive procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Retrospective data from 240 women experiencing a major PPH in a 6-month period, taken from the Cardiff Maternity Database, also found that fibrinogen was a useful predictor for progression to the need for RBC transfusion. The receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI) for any RBC transfusion was 0.78 (0.74-0.83), the need for 4 units of RBC 0.8 (0.73-0.86) and for progression to 2500&#x000a0;ml blood loss 0.85 (0.78-0.93). In women with a fibrinogen level less than 3&#x000a0;g/l, 18/21 (86%) required RBC transfusion (median 3 units range 0&#x02013;12) and 11 also required FFP. The mean (SD) allogeneic units (RBC&#x02009;+&#x02009;FFP&#x02009;+&#x02009;cryoprecipitate&#x02009;+&#x02009;platelets) infused was 5.8 (6.8). In contrast, in women with a fibrinogen level greater than 4&#x000a0;g/l (a normal level for delivery) 7/81 (8.6%) required RBC transfusion, a mean (SD) of 0.2 (0.6) units/woman, and none required FFP. These data have been confirmed in a prospective, consecutive cohort of 346 women in Cardiff experiencing a major PPH that showed that the ROC AUC (95% CI) for fibrinogen (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;332) as a predictive biomarker for the need for 4 or more units of RBC transfusion was 0.77 (0.66-0.87).</p><p>Bleeding during PPH is often very fast and, in order to reduce the risk of progression from moderate to massive PPH, early intervention is required. If a low fibrinogen level is to be used as a trigger for intervention the result needs to be available to the clinician as soon as possible. Testing fibrinogen in the laboratory takes between 60 to 90&#x000a0;min and this is too long to be clinically useful in most cases of PPH. Furthermore, during a PPH the fibrinogen level may fall rapidly and so repeated measurements may be required to identify when a critically low level has been reached. A better strategy would be to use point-of-care testing to trigger a fibrinogen replacement and to guide the dose to be given.</p><p>It is not possible to replace fibrinogen to levels normally associated with delivery with FFP because the concentration of fibrinogen in FFP is less than 4&#x000a0;g/l. In addition, there is substantial delay between deciding to give FPP and/or cryoprecipitate and its infusion. This is because requesting FFP/cryoprecipitate from the laboratory, thawing it, issuing it and transporting it from the laboratory to the delivery suite usually takes around 60&#x000a0;min even with an efficient system. Fibrinogen concentrate (RiaSTAP&#x000ae; manufactured by CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) can be used to rapidly replace fibrinogen to the pregnancy-related normal range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and will be used in this study. Anecdotal data suggest that fibrinogen concentrate may be useful as rescue therapy in managing severe hypofibrinogenaemia associated with massive PPH. In a number of case series, severe haemorrhage was clinically arrested or substantially improved when fibrinogen concentrate was used during severe and on-going bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>A potential point-of-care surrogate test for the fibrinogen level is the Fibtem measured on the ROTEM&#x000ae; machine. The Fibtem assay gives results after 5&#x000a0;min (A5) and at the time of maximum clot firmness (MCF). Prospective data collected during major PPH in Cardiff have shown that the A5 and MCF are strongly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> 0.93) but the A5 is available a median (IQR) 19 (13&#x02013;24) min earlier than the MCF. The A5 is available on average 6&#x000a0;min after the start of the Fibtem assay. The A5 is between 1 and 2&#x000a0;mm lower than the MCF. The Fibtem A5 has been shown to correlate well with the laboratory-measured fibrinogen level during early PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and a result is available within 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min after taking blood. The Fibtem assay has been used successfully to guide fibrinogen replacement with fibrinogen concentrate following complex cardiac surgery and was shown to have a large effect on bleeding and transfusion requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In a Cardiff prospective observational study over a 12-month period of 346 analysable women experiencing a major PPH, 318 had a Fibtem performed and 332 had a Clauss fibrinogen (in press) (NB: the paper includes one more case than presented in this paper and hence the results are not identical). In this cohort the utility of Fibtem A5 and MCF to predict the need for red cell transfusion was investigated. For the need for any red cell transfusion, the ROC AUC (95% CI) for Fibtem A5 was 0.62 (0.55-0.69) and MCF was 0.62 (0.55-0.69), a result almost identical to that with the laboratory fibrinogen, 0.68 (0.61-0.75). Fibrinogen, Fibtem A5 and MCF had improved utility for predicting larger bleeds: for the need for 4 units of red blood cells the ROCs were 0.75 (0.64-0.87), 0.77 (0.67-0.87) and 0.78 (0.67-0.88) respectively. The results for the need for eight or more units of allogeneic products (red cells&#x02009;+&#x02009;FFP&#x02009;+&#x02009;platelets&#x02009;+&#x02009;cryoprecipitate) were 0.81 (0.70-0.92), 0.79 (0.67-0.91) and 0.79 (0.67-0.91) for fibrinogen, A5 and MCF respectively. This supports the potential use of Fibtem A5 or MCF instead of a laboratory fibrinogen level to guide treatment in this situation. Given that A5 and MCF give equivalent information and the A5 is available on average 19&#x000a0;min earlier than MCF, it allows earlier intervention during major PPH and hence is the preferred parameter to use for this study.</p><p>In the Cardiff prospective study there were 32 women with a Fibtem A5 below 16&#x000a0;mm (or a Clauss fibrinogen below 3&#x000a0;g/l) and on-going bleeding (&#x0003e;250&#x000a0;ml). Of these 27 (84%) required a red cell transfusion; mean (SD) number of units of red cells transfused was 4.1 (3.9). The mean (SD) number of units of allogeneic blood products was 8.2 (8.7). Of the 32 women, 7 also received between 3 and 7&#x000a0;g of fibrinogen concentrate as rescue haemostatic therapy.</p><p>Of the 288 women who had a Fibtem A5 of 16&#x000a0;mm or above or did not have on-going bleeding, and so would not have been randomised in the prospective study, 64 (22%) received a red cell transfusion, mean (SD) 0.55 (1.20 units/woman). The mean (SD) number of allogeneic units was 0.79 (2.19). The PPV (95% CI) for the need for a red cell transfusion of a Fibtem A5 below 16&#x000a0;mm in women with on-going bleeding was 84 (67&#x02013;94)%. The NPV was 78 (73&#x02013;82) %.</p><p>In the same study, of the 84 women with a Fibtem A5 of 23&#x000a0;mm or above, 16 (19%) received a red blood transfusion [median (range) 2 (2&#x02013;5) units]. The mean (SD) number of units of red cells transfused was 0.44 (0.99) with a median (IQR) of 0 (0&#x02013;0) units. The mean (SD) number of allogeneic units transfused was 0.58 (1.51) with a median (IQR) of 0 (0&#x02013;0) units.</p><p>Although there is not a direct relationship between Fibtem and fibrinogen levels, in women experiencing major PPH, a Fibtem A5 of 16&#x000a0;mm is associated with a fibrinogen level below about 3&#x000a0;g/l and a Fibtem A5 of above about 23&#x000a0;mm with a fibrinogen above 4&#x000a0;g/l (prospective unpublished data from Cardiff and Huissoud 2009).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate whether infusion of fibrinogen concentrate, based on the Fibtem A5 test, during a moderately severe PPH reduces the total number of allogeneic blood products transfused after study medication until discharged compared to placebo.

The data were therefore transformed using the natural log (x&#x02009;+&#x02009;1) transformation. This resulted in a more normal distribution with a mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 1.811 (1.004) on the log-transformed scale. Back-transforming this data gives a geometric mean of 5.12 units of allogeneic blood transfusions. Using the data from low-risk women with Fibtem A5&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;22&#x000a0;mm (representing what we would expect in the intervention group) then using the same transformation, the mean (SD) is 0.256 (0.539). Back-transforming gives a geometric mean of 0.30 units of allogeneic blood transfusions. This demonstrates a difference of 1.811-0.256&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.556 on the log-transformed scale.</p><p>A total of 60 patients can realistically be recruited. Therefore basing our sample size calculation on 27 per group (54 in total plus a 10% dropout), if the mean on the transformed scale in the intervention group is 1.036, this is the size of difference that we would be able to detect with power 80% at the two-sided 5% alpha level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A transformed mean of 1.036 corresponds to a back-transformed &#x02018;geometric mean&#x02019; of 1.81 allogeneic units. This is a 3.3 unit reduction, when measured as a simple difference on the original scale. The size of difference between control and intervention groups we might assume from this, when expressed on the log-transformed scale, is 1.811-1.036&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.775.</p><p>In the light of the difference found between the high- and low-risk groups (1.552), the assumption we are making for the new study still appears to be cautiously conservative. Thus we conclude that 27 individuals in each treatment arm (54 in total) would give 80% power to attain a difference of 3.3 total allogeneic units (0.775 on a log-transformed scale) at a conventional 5% alpha level. Assuming a 10% loss to follow-up, this will enable 60 women (30 per treatment group) to complete the trial and achieve the above numbers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation will be carried out using random permuted blocks. Computer-generated random numbers will be produced to select a block of allocations from the set of all possible permutations of allocations (on a 1:1 ratio) given a particular block size before the trial begins. Saint Mary&#x02019;s Pharmaceutical Unit will undertake an exercise to validate the blinding process. A reproducible method that ensures all the fibrinogen does dissolve will be developed and detailed guidance produced that will form the basis of training the centre staff.</p><p>The fibrinogen concentrate will be supplied as vials of 1&#x000a0;g per bottle by CSL Behring to Saint Mary&#x02019;s Pharmaceutical Unit (SMPU) in Cardiff. The placebo will be 50&#x000a0;ml of normal saline for each 1&#x000a0;g of fibrinogen. SMPU will supply each site with packs of blinded fibrinogen concentrate and placebo. At the time of randomisation the next consecutive numbered study pack will be opened. Black syringes will be used to draw the fibrinogen/placebo bottles with added diluents; the air will be expelled from the syringe into a bag of Gelofusine.

Fibrinogen appears to be a useful biomarker to predict the progression from moderate to massive PPH and the need for blood transfusion; however, it is not known whether replacement of fibrinogen to levels normal for the peripartum period (4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;g/l), during an on-going PPH, would reduce bleeding and the need for transfusion. Although fibrinogen concentrate is not licensed for use in obstetric haemorrhage in the UK, it has been used off-label to correct hypofibrinogenaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is the recommended treatment in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>This trial is designed to detect haemostatic impairment rapidly and early during major PPH, identified by a near patient Fibtem A5 test below 16&#x000a0;mm, and replace fibrinogen to a level within the lower end of the normal range associated with delivery. Laboratory tests of fibrinogen take about 60&#x000a0;min to become available, and this is usually too slow to inform clinical intervention. The Fibtem A5 result is available within about 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min of venesection and so can be used for decisions on therapeutic intervention. The decision to use the criteria of on-going bleeding and a low for delivery Fibtem A5, rather than a more pragmatic approach of randomising all women with a specific estimate blood loss, was made to minimise the chance of women being exposed to unnecessary IMP because many women in that situation would have a fibrinogen level above 4&#x000a0;g/l and therefore be unlikely to respond to a higher level The amount of fibrinogen concentrate or placebo given to all participants allocated to the intervention group will be based on the woman&#x02019;s ideal weight for height and the Fibtem level. The dose will be rounded to the nearest whole number of grams of fibrinogen and the maximum dose of fibrinogen concentrate or placebo will be 8&#x000a0;g. The dose of fibrinogen is designed to increase the Fibtem A5 and Clauss fibrinogen to the lower end of the normal range for delivery. This level has been shown to be associated with a reduced requirement for blood products. This approach was preferred to the pragmatic approach of giving a standard dose of fibrinogen because this would be likely to be associated with both under- and over-dosing. The lower end of the normal range has been targeted to minimise the risk of thrombosis.</p><p>The study is designed to be blinded until the decision to give the first 4 units of FFP has been taken and hence the Fibtem A5 taken 15&#x000a0;min after IMP is not known to the clinicians managing the case. The primary endpoint is a comparison of allogeneic products between the two arms and knowledge of whether fibrinogen or placebo had been given is likely to affect the decision to give FFP, cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen. After the first FFP has been given and if the bleeding is on-going, clinicians need to know the fibrinogen level to optimally manage the case. At this point Fibtem A5 and Clauss fibrinogen tests can be performed that are available to clinicians. This will have the effect of partially unblinding the study because clinicians will know whether the Fibtem has increased or not. This partial unblinding was deliberately included in the study for women with on-going bleeding for safety reasons.</p><p>The primary objective is to investigate whether infusion of fibrinogen, based on a Fibtem A5 test, during a moderately severe PPH reduces the total number of allogeneic blood products (FFP, red blood cells, platelet concentrates and cryoprecipitate) transfused after study medication until discharge compared to placebo. This was chosen because the alternative primary endpoint of estimated blood is very difficult to measure accurately and reproducibly, especially in a multicentre study.</p><p>At the time of a PPH women may not have full capacity to give informed consent because of factors such as pain, altered levels of consciousness due to drugs and blood loss and anxiety. In addition, some clinical situations are so acute that there will be insufficient time to read and understand a full patient information sheet.
