</p><p>An underlying cause of renal disease rarely is found at the time of CKD diagnosis and therefore treatment usually employs renoprotective measures (eg, diet, enteric phosphate binders, angiotensin&#x02010;converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi]) designed to preserve renal function. Treatments that can slow the development of renal fibrosis potentially would be renoprotective and important. Transforming growth factors &#x003b2; (TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2;) are upregulated in experimentally induced and naturally occurring fibrosis, including renal fibrosis.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> For this reason TGF&#x02010;&#x003b2;, associated signaling cascades, and downstream mediators are the focus of much research related to renal fibrosis.

The dosage was increased as needed to maintain a systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;160&#x000a0;mmHg. Severe hypokalemia (clinical signs of myopathy) was treated with IV potassium supplementation in the form of potassium chloride followed by PO supplementation. Mild or moderate hypokalemia (serum potassium concentration below reference interval but without signs of myopathy) was treated with PO supplementation on an outpatient basis. Potassium gluconate was prescribed at 2&#x000a0;mEq PO q12h. This dose was increased as needed to maintain serum potassium concentration within the reference interval. If a cat was previously receiving SC fluids at inclusion in the study, this treatment was continued. Bacterial urinary tract infections were treated with an appropriate antibiotic based on urine culture and sensitivity testing and followed up with a repeated bacterial culture within 1&#x000a0;week of discontinuing antibiotic treatment.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12365-sec-0021"><title>Cause of Death</title><p>Kidney&#x02010;related death was defined as death or euthanasia because of the progressive decline of kidney function or the consequences thereof.

Of the cats included in statistical analysis, 9 cats were allocated to the rhubarb only group (Group I), 9 cats to the benazepril only group (Group II), and 8 cats to the rhubarb and benazepril group (Group III). One cat originally allocated to Group II had a presumed severe cutaneous drug reaction to benazepril soon after inclusion into the study. This cat was placed in Group I after a 30&#x02010;day washout period. Only the data collected for this cat after being allocated to Group I were included in the statistical analysis.</p><p>There were no significant differences among treatment groups at entry into the study with respect to body weight, blood pressure, hematocrit, serum creatinine concentration, or UPC (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim12365-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). The mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD duration of time that cats were enrolled in the study was 22.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;12.3&#x000a0;months. The mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD duration of enrollment for Groups I, II, and III was 22.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15.9, 25.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10.1, and 17.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.56&#x000a0;months, respectively. There was no significant difference in duration of time cats were enrolled in the study among treatment groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.42). There were no significant differences within or between groups over time with respect to the change in serum creatinine concentration, body weight, hematocrit, blood pressure, or UPC (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim12365-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>, Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim12365-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). While enrolled in the study, 5 cats were euthanized for kidney&#x02010;related reasons; the numbers of cats from Groups I, II, and III were 1, 2, and 2 cats, respectively. An additional 3 cats were euthanized because of reasons unrelated to the natural progression of CKD; the number of cats from Groups I, II, and III were 1, none, and 2 cats, respectively. The causes of death in these 3 cats included persistent periuria, bilateral renal transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), and unknown. The cat with periuria had multiple negative aerobic bacterial cultures and crepitus on palpation of multiple joints. This cat failed to improve by providing an additional litter box without a climb&#x02010;up step and medical treatment for osteoarthritis. The second cat was euthanized because of an acute deterioration in renal function. Bilateral renal TCC was found at necropsy and therefore this euthanasia was not attributed to natural progression of CKD. A third cat died of unknown causes and no postmortem examination was performed. Based on contemporaneous laboratory results and clinical signs, this death was categorized as nonkidney related. The numbers of all cause deaths in Groups I, II, and III were 3, 2, and 4 cats, respectively. Because of the low rate of kidney&#x02010;related death, survival analysis was not performed.</p><table-wrap id="jvim12365-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Indirect indicators of renal function at study inclusion in cats with <styled-content style="fixed-case">IRIS</styled-content> Stage 2 or early Stage 3 <styled-content style="fixed-case">CKD</styled-content> treated with <styled-content style="fixed-case">C</styled-content>hinese rhubarb (Group I; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), benazepril (Group II; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), or both (Group III; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical Variable</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment Group</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The results failed to detect a significant difference among treatment with rhubarb supplement, benazepril, or both with regard to the progression of CKD as quantified by changes in serum creatinine concentration, body weight, hematocrit, systolic blood pressure, and UPC. The IRIS staging system classifies cats with serum creatinine concentration of 2.5&#x02013;5.0&#x000a0;mg/dL as Stage 3.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Cats with IRIS Stage 2 or early Stage 3 CKD (serum creatinine concentration of 1.6&#x02013;3.5&#x000a0;mg/dL) were chosen for this study. Although this inclusion criterion was arbitrary, cats with later IRIS Stage 3 CKD and beyond, with a potentially greater degree of renal fibrosis already present, were considered less likely to benefit from antifibrotic treatment.</p><p>Not finding a significant difference among treatments is only notable with an appropriately powered study. Prestudy power estimates showed that including 6 cats in each group would provide a power of 0.80 for the detection of a 0.4&#x000a0;mg/dL difference in serum creatinine concentrations, a 0.14 difference in UPC, or a 10&#x000a0;mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure. This estimate assumed an intracat correlation over time of 0.75. This study consisted of at least 8 cats per treatment group. As such, there is expected to be at least an 80% chance that if a significant difference existed it would have been detected.</p><p>The diagnosis of feline CKD is essentially one of exclusion. Azotemia because of ureteral obstruction, renal neoplasia, pyelonephritis, and prerenal or postrenal causes must be ruled out. A diagnosis of CKD usually includes small irregular kidneys on abdominal palpation and small, irregular kidneys with a loss of corticomedullary definition of abdominal ultrasound examination and usually does not include renal biopsy. As such, it is possible for an underlying renal disease to go undetected. One cat in this study was found to have bilateral renal TCC on postmortem examination. This neoplasm may have been the cause of renal dysfunction in this cat from the beginning. It is also possible that this cat developed renal TCC subsequent or in addition to CKD. The fact that this cat lived for almost 11&#x000a0;months with relatively stable kidney function, that kidney imaging at inclusion was consistent with CKD and not renal neoplasia, and postmortem examination showed both glomerulosclerosis and interstitial nephritis in addition to renal TCC, makes CKD and subsequent renal TCC most likely. For this reason, this cat was included in the final statistical analysis. To the authors' knowledge, renal TCC or other renal neoplasia has never been associated with rhubarb administration in other species including humans or rodents. Although considered unlikely, rhubarb supplement as a cause of renal cancer in this cat cannot be completely ruled out.</p><p>As expected, cats with IRIS Stage 2 and early Stage 3 CKD live a relatively long time.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> For this reason, dependent variables other than survival were used to assess response to treatment. Euthanasia is the most common cause of death in cats with CKD and is because of perceived poor quality of life.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> All deaths in this study were because of euthanasia. Of the 3 cats that were euthanized for nonkidney&#x02010;related causes, 1 was euthanized because of persistent periuria. It could be argued that this was at least in part related to CKD secondary to polyuria. Other comorbidities whether related to CKD or not that might predispose a cat to periuria include idiopathic cystitis, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, urinary tract neoplasia, osteoarthritis, and cognitive dysfunction. This cat had multiple negative bacterial urine cultures and unremarkable urinary bladder ultrasound examination making bacterial cystitis, neoplasia, or urolithiasis unlikely. Osteoarthritis was believed to be present in this cat based on crepitus during joint manipulation. The cat failed to improve with provision of an additional litter box that did not have a climb&#x02010;up step and medical treatment for osteoarthritis. It was possible that osteoarthritis or reluctance to step up into the litter box initiated the periuria which then became behavioral. Because factors beyond CKD likely played a substantial role in the periuria and subsequent euthanasia in this cat, it was classified as a nonkidney&#x02010;related death.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the duration of time cats were enrolled in the study. The mean duration of enrollment for all cats in this study was approximately 22&#x000a0;months. For case recruitment, referring veterinarians and pet owners received a monetary incentive. The monetary incentive given to the pet owner after 1&#x000a0;year of study participation likely improved compliance and increased the duration of participation. Because of the monetary incentives provided, compliance as it relates to the treatment groups was not further investigated.</p><p>A second limitation of this study is that neither pet owners nor investigators were blinded to the treatments and some treatment bias may have occurred. The objective indirect measures of kidney function or consequences thereof, such as serum creatinine concentration, hematocrit, change in body weight, systolic blood pressure, and UPC likely were not affected. Alternatively, the pet owner's perceived quality of life and the decision to euthanize may have been affected.</p><p>A third limitation of this study is that GFR was not measured. Serum creatinine concentration indirectly correlates with GFR when certain factors such as lean body mass are held stable.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Overall, the cats in this study lost body weight over time. There was no significant difference in body weight among groups at inclusion into the study or in the change in body weight over time. The latter suggests that across groups the effect of the change in body weight as it pertains to serum creatinine concentrations would be similar.</p><p>A final limitation of this study is that the benazepril dose was not adjusted based on patient response. Four cats receiving benazepril, 2 each from Groups II and III had UPC persistently &#x02265;0.4. If allowed by study protocol, the benazepril dose may have been increased in these cats. It is possible that allowing for dose escalation of benazepril in this study would have led to improved clinical efficacy in these cats. ACEi may slow the progression of feline CKD, but the evidence is limited.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> There is more evidence for this effect in other species.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Not finding a significant difference among treatment groups suggests that in this population of cats both benazepril and rhubarb affected the progression of CKD similarly or possibly not at all. Without a negative control, it is not possible to make any statement with regard to how the treatments compared to no treatment at all.</p><p>The UPC provides prognostic information in feline CKD.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> As such, it would have been reasonable to either stratify or include a certain degree of proteinuria as an exclusion criterion. The inclusion of proteinuric cats was deemed important as studies using rodent models of kidney disease have shown a decrease in proteinuria with the administration of rhubarb extract.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> In addition, there is evidence that the effects of ACEi and rhubarb on proteinuria and renal fibrosis are synergistic.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Although consistent renal proteinuria (UPC &#x0003e;0.4) was uncommon in this study, the authors felt it was unethical to withhold appropriate treatment of proteinuria. For these reasons, benazepril was chosen as the positive control and a third group of cats treated with both drugs was included in the study. Treatment of systemic hypertension with amlodipine decreases proteinuria,<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> which may have affected the UPC in the 2 cats from Group I that received amlodipine.</p><p>Although the UPC at baseline was not significantly different among treatment groups, this does not necessarily mean that they were not clinically different. In a prospective, longitudinal study of geriatric nonazotemic cats, cats that became azotemic started with a UPC of 0.17 as compared to cats that did not become azotemic with UPC of 0.14.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> Considering the relatively small difference between groups in the aforementioned study, the difference between Group I (mean UPC 0.23) and Groups II and III (mean UPC 0.72 and 0.61, respectively) in this study may be clinically relevant. It is not possible to discern how the differences in proteinuria among treatment groups affected these study results.</p><p>Hematocrit was chosen as an indirect indicator of renal endocrine function. Endocrine dysfunction in the case of a relative lack of erythropoietin can provide important therapeutic and prognostic information.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> The failure to detect and appropriately treat renal anemia leads to lethargy and other signs of systemic illness readily recognized by the pet owner. Anemia associated with CKD is multifactorial; contributing factors include anemia of chronic disease, shortened red blood cell life span, relative erythropoietin deficiency, and gastrointestinal blood loss.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> In this study, early signs of anemia especially when accompanied by gastric upset were treated with famotidine. Although this treatment was directed toward gastric erosion or ulceration that may develop secondary to hypergastrinemia, no further investigation such as gastrointestinal endoscopy was used to corroborate or refute this assumption. In addition, bone marrow sampling to further investigate nonregenerative anemia was not performed in any cat. Finally, hydration status is patient dependent and may have affected the hematocrit. An alternative to assessing renal endocrine function would have been directly quantifying erythropoietin, which would have been interpreted in light of the cat's hematocrit. At the time of the study, a commercial feline erythropoietin assay was not available.</p><p>Systemic hypertension frequently is associated with feline CKD.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> As such, systolic blood pressure was monitored throughout the study. There is no evidence that systemic hypertension is more prevalent as CKD progresses. There is evidence in people with CKD that systemic hypertension contributes to deterioration of renal function.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Although the role of systemic hypertension in the progression of CKD in cats is not well established, there is some histopathologic evidence that it may negatively affect prognosis.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Control of systemic hypertension in cats with CKD may improve survival in part by decreasing proteinuria.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> We felt it was unethical to withhold amlodipine treatment to cats with hypertensive CKD. To decrease confounding bias and variability and increase power in this study, we tried to select a homogenous population of cats with CKD. Cats had variable clinical monitoring before the study, and it is possible that cats with systemic hypertension at the first visit may have had long&#x02010;term systemic hypertension. For these reasons, cats with systemic hypertension were excluded from the study. During the study, only 2 cats developed systemic hypertension, and they did so approximately 1 and 3&#x000a0;years after entry, respectively. Both cats were considered at moderate risk for target organ damage based on the degree of systemic hypertension and neither had evidence of complications.<xref rid="jvim12365-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Because of the frequent monitoring of cats in this study, the amount of time the cats could have been hypertensive was short. For these reasons, the 2 cats that developed systemic hypertension were not removed from the study.</p><p>One cat in Group II was reallocated to Group I. The fact that this group change contradicted the goals of random allocation and intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat was recognized, although the effect to the overall randomness of the study was considered very small. A total of 17 cats in this study received rhubarb for a mean duration of approximately 20&#x000a0;months. As stated previously, it is considered unlikely that rhubarb supplementation was the cause of renal TCC in 1 cat in this study, although it cannot be completely ruled out. Only 2 additional cats showed mild findings that were possible adverse effects of rhubarb administration, suggesting that the rhubarb supplement used in this study is likely safe to administer over a relatively long period of time to cats with Stage 2 or early Stage 3 CKD.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12365-sec-0025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the analysis of easily measured clinical indirect indicators of renal excretory and endocrine function, this study failed to find a significant difference in the progression of feline CKD among cats treated with benazepril, rhubarb supplementation, or both at commonly recommended dosages. Further investigation of the effects of rhubarb supplementation as it relates to specific subsets of cats with CKD is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim12365-sec-0026"><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors acknowledge Sherry Sharp, RVT for her technical assistance.
