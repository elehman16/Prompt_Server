However, the physiological response of BR in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. The objective was to test exercise performance in COPD, supplementing with higher doses of BR for a longer duration compared to previous trials in this patient group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Fifteen COPD patients consumed concentrated BR (2&#x000d7;70 mL twice daily, each containing 300 mg nitrate) or placebo (PL) (2&#x000d7;70 mL twice daily, nitrate-negligible) in a randomized order for 6 consecutive days. On day 7, participants consumed either BR or PL 150 min before testing. BP was measured before completing 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and two trials of submaximal cycling. The protocol was repeated after a minimum washout of 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plasma nitrite concentration was higher in the BR condition compared to PL (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). There was no difference between the BR and PL conditions regarding the covered distance during the 6MWT (mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean: 515&#x000b1;35 m (BR) vs 520&#x000b1;38 m (PL), <italic>P</italic>=0.46), O<sub>2</sub> consumption of submaximal exercise (trial 1 <italic>P</italic>=0.31 vs trial 2 <italic>P</italic>=0.20), physical activity level (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05), or systolic BP (<italic>P</italic>=0.80). However, diastolic BP (DBP) was reduced after BR ingestion compared to baseline (mean difference: 4.6, 95% CI: 0.1&#x02013;9.1, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Seven days of BR ingestion increased plasma nitrite concentrations and lowered DBP in COPD patients.

The participants completed four visits: screening, habituation, and experimental days at the end of each intervention.

During this period, PAL was estimated by accelerometry.

Immediately following the physical tests blood lactate was analyzed (1500 SPORT Lactate Analyzer; YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH, USA).</p><p>At day 7 of the interventions, the participants arrived in the morning after overnight fasting. Details regarding specific tests and analysis are outlined below, but the experimental day consisted of BP measurements (baseline values were measured on the morning of the PL period), blood sampling, and baseline blood lactate measurements (fingerprick test). The participants consumed a standardized meal and 2&#x000d7;70 mL of BR/PL. After 2&#x000bd; hours, another blood sample was collected and BP was measured.

Before testing, the analyzer was calibrated using known O<sub>2</sub> concentrations and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The same cycle ergometer (Monark 894E) was used for all tests and the submaximal load was equivalent to 50% of the estimated Watt<sub>max</sub>. Ending each trial, HR, lactate concentration, respiratory measures, and Borg-RPE were registered.

The workload on the Aastrand&#x02013;Rhyming test was adjusted so that the participants could cycle for 6 min at an HR between 105 and 115 bpm followed by 4 min with an HR between 125 and 140 bpm. HR and workload were registered every minute until steady-state HR (varied &#x0003c;3&#x02013;5 bpm).

Before analysis, data between retiring to bed and wakeup time were removed, as this was expected to be non-awake time. When participants went to bed past midnight, the activity was included in the calculations for the previous day.

Our study was not statistically powered to perform subanalysis, merely including patients having a marked increase in plasma NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Hence, future investigations should try identifying specific COPD phenotypes obtaining high plasma NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> levels after BR ingestion and who, with higher probability, could benefit physiologically. In addition, the trial was not designed for performing stratified analyses depending on degree of COPD. Nevertheless, we repeated the statistical analysis for the primary outcome parameter 6MWT separately, based on data from the group of patients with an FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003c;50% (n=5) and in the group of patients with an FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x0003e;50%. The walking distance was not different between the two stratified groups of COPD patients.

Thus, we cannot exclude that age/disease-related causes might reduce the responsiveness to BR supplementation.</p><p>COPD patients are susceptible to weather factors, which are conveyed as impaired respiration, potentially impacting cycling and 6MWT considerably. Two participants failed to complete cycling because of respiration problems, during the PL condition.

These observations are questionable as to whether the 6MWT reflects maximal performance. The reduced ability to perform maximally may partly be caused by other health-related challenges, as three of 15 participants reported having knee pains unrelated to COPD. In support, a negative correlation between pain severity and 6MWT distance has been reported.<xref rid="b4-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>When testing COPD patients on a shuttle walk test (SWT) following an acute consumption of BR, an 11% increase in walking distance was observed (<italic>P</italic>=0.005).<xref rid="b14-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, these results remain questionable, as a true PL was lacking and the energy content of the drinks was unequal.<xref rid="b14-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Conversely, following a 3-day BR supplementation and using a lower BR dose, Leong et al<xref rid="b34-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> failed to observe a significant increase in walking distance or time-to-fatigue, thereby questioning the superiority of the SWT compared to the 6MWT in this patient group.</p><p>PAL measured in the present study corresponded with the previous measurements in COPD patients.<xref rid="b35-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Previous studies show that the effect of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> supplementation, if continuously supplemented, is maintained for 6&#x02013;15 days in healthy individuals.<xref rid="b16-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b18-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b28-copd-12-1765" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, we hypothesized that COPD patients would increase PAL in the BR period, and unfortunately this was not observed. This is not surprising, as O<sub>2</sub> consumption during cycling was not reduced, and we cannot exclude that PAL is primarily based on scheduled habitual activity plans instead of small variations in physical capacity. The accelerometer might not be sensitive in detecting small changes in this patient/age group, partly explaining the lack of effect on PAL.</p><p>BR supplementation reduced DBP compared to baseline, which was not observed in the PL condition.

Although the habituation was completed to eliminate a learning effect, the participants did not become familiar with cycling, thus potentially affecting respiration during testing.

Submaximal cycling O<sub>2</sub> consumption was not significantly influenced by BR supplementation. Further studies are warranted to clarify the therapeutic role of BR supplementation in COPD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all of the study participants for their time, dedication, and enthusiasm.
