exercise on balance in elderly with knee osteoarthritis. [Subjects and Methods] Fifty
elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis were recruited, a horse-riding simulator group
performed exercise three times a week for eight weeks. And each exercise was performed for
30 minutes. [Results] The horse-riding simulator group showed significant differences
after the intervention in Short Form Berg Balance Scale, Functional reaching test.

quality of life. Due to age-related changes, balance ability deteriorates. Osteoarthritis is
a degenerative disease that causes severe pain in elderly patients with low pain thresholds.
Research has shown that it results in a high disability score, low quality of life, and
limited range of motion, in addition to weak muscle strength, poor balance ability, and high
risk of falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As osteoarthritis causes
severe pain and functional disorders, in general, the clinical treatment is focused on pain
management and amelioration of related disorders. The treatments include muscle strength
training, electrical stimulation, manual therapy, aquatic therapy, balance therapy, and
pharmacotherapy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As balance ability and falls are closely related in the elderly, exercise therapies need to
focus on the maintenance of such ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Horseback riding exercise is one such therapy. In research conducted by Ara&#x000fa;jo et al. <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> where elderly individuals performed
horseback riding exercise for eight weeks, the researchers reported that the exercise
significantly improved the participants&#x02019; balance and muscle strength. Unlike other
interventions, horseback riding exercise can arouse the interest of patients and motivate
them while improving their balance, bone density, muscle strength, and mental state<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to some studies, horseback
riding exercise increased the static muscular contraction of the rider against the movement
of the horse and improved the muscle strength in the quadriceps femoris and knee flexors of
young riders<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most people do not indulge in horse riding because of where they live (i.e., urban rather
than rural areas) or the costs and risks involved in horse riding. Hence, simulator
horseback riding exercise equipment using virtual reality has been developed for use at home
and in small spaces. Previous studies reported that horseback riding exercise significantly
increased oxygen intake, minute ventilation, MET, calorie consumption, and muscle<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although various therapeutic approaches have made with horseback
riding exercise in the previous studies there is a lack of research on the effects of
horseback riding exercise equipment on the balance and gait abilities of elderly patients
with osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the protocols established by the

information study all subjects received a participation agreement.</p><p>In this study, the subjects, while providing conventional physical therapy, 8 weeks three
times a week the movement of the horse riding equipment, was carried out for 30 minutes.
Before performing horse riding simulation exercise, subjects were educated about exercise
program through a research assistant&#x02019;s demonstration. In this study, used the SlimRider
(Shinhwa,MX-0004SE, Korea), which is a horse riding simulator. While performing a horse
riding equipment exercise, subjects were effort to maintain the correct posture. Exercise
intensity was increased gradually according to the state of the subjects while performing
the exercise, the research assistant were always observed to prevent falling.</p><p>In order to evaluate the balance of the elderly, it was using the FRT (Functional reach
test) and SBBSF (Short form berg balance scale). All of the measurement results were
expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.</p><p>The SPSS for Windows (version 18.0) was used for data analysis of the study. In order to
compare the differences between before and after, it was analyzed using the paired t-test.

high disability scores, thereby resulting in a low quality of life, increased risk of falls,
and poor balance ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, the static, dynamic, and functional balance abilities of osteoarthritis patients who
undertook horseback riding exercises on exercise equipment were measured using a FRT and
SFBBS. The SFBBS score increased significantly after the intervention. The findings are in
accordance with those of study that stroke patients performed horseback riding exercise for
35&#x02005;min five times a week for eight weeks and Ara&#x000fa;jo<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> in which elderly patients performed horseback riding exercise for
eight weeks. They are also in accordance with the results of Han Jun-young<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> in a study of stroke patients who
performed horseback riding exercise for 12 weeks that an eight-week-long horseback riding
exercise significantly improved the BBS scores of osteoarthritis patients. In general
elderly, the average BBS score is 20.60 &#x000b1; 4.08<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the scores of the elderly participants were
lower than average before the exercise. After eight weeks of the exercise, the average score
was 22.3 &#x000b1; 4.4, higher than the average. The results suggest that horseback riding exercise
equipment can improve dynamic and functional balance abilities.</p><p>Furthermore, according to the FRT results, the static balance ability of the participants
improved. These results are in line with the research findings of Yasuhiro et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kim Sung-gil<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> where the FRT scores improved significantly after
12-week-long and 8-week-long horseback riding exercise, respectively. An increase in the FRT
score is considered an improvement in static balance ability. Based on the findings of the
present study, horseback riding exercise equipment seems to improve the static balance
ability of the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Daegu University Research Grants in 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Imamura</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Imamura</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaziyama</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Impact of nervous system hyperalgesia on pain, disability,
