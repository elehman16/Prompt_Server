Patients underwent protocol-specific evaluations at the pre-procedure, discharge, and 1-month visits. Cerebral MRIs were performed at pre- and post-procedure visits (see Cerebral MRI Imaging and Neurological Assessments section). Additionally, cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) at pre-procedure and 1-month visits. The PRECISION GOLD study was designed similarly to the ERACE study, employing the same embolic lowering procedural manoeuvres.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Peri-procedural anticoagulation</title><p>Oral anticoagulation with VKA was initiated at least 3 weeks prior to ablation to achieve an INR of &#x02265;2.0 on the day of ablation and continued for the duration of the study. To rule out LA thrombus, transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed 48 h before ablation. Heparin was administered prior to and/or immediately after transseptal puncture and sustained throughout the procedure to maintain ACT levels &#x02265;350 s, with monitoring at least every 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ablation protocol and procedural techniques</title><p>After a single transseptal puncture, a 10Fr or larger sheath was inserted into the LA. Submerged loading of PVAC GOLD into the introducer, as well as continuous flushing of the sheath with heparinized saline, was performed to minimize air ingress. Pulmonary vein ablation catheter GOLD was advanced slowly through the sheath into the LA. Pulmonary veins (PVs) were electrically isolated by targeted ablation of each PV-LA antrum. Pulmonary vein isolation was defined as PV-LA entrance block verified with pacing manoeuvres, as appropriate. Sinus rhythm (SR) was restored by cardioversion at the end of the procedure as needed.</p><p>Pulmonary vein ablation catheter technology has been described previously.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="EUV385C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Briefly, the GENius generator delivers duty-cycled bipolar and unipolar phased RF energy to all or selected electrode pairs.

This creates a bipolar short circuit, resulting in excessive tissue and blood heating. Furthermore, air ingress during introduction into the transseptal sheath was a source of gaseous emboli.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Wieczorek <italic>et al.</italic> showed a significantly lower ACE incidence in patients without vs. with an E1&#x02013;E10 interaction (11 vs. 44%).<sup><xref rid="EUV385C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Subsequently, the multicentre ERACE study showed that submerged capture to avoid air entrapment, plus de-activation of E1 or E10, could reduce ACE incidence to 1.7%, which is one of the lowest rates ever published.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Importantly, uninterrupted OAC with warfarin coupled with an elevated procedural heparinization (target ACT &#x0003e;350 s) likely contributed to the marked ACE reduction in this study.

This finding is also consistent with the ERACE study, which found PELs in 60% of a similar patient cohort.</p><p>In the present study, one patient had two acute PELs in the left cerebellum, 5 &#x000d7; 5 and 9 &#x000d7; 6 mm. For studies with silent embolism endpoints, this finding illustrates the importance of pre-ablation imaging, as its absence would have doubled the observed post-ablation ACE incidence in the present study. As 1-month MRI was not performed for this patient, it is not known whether these acute PELs would have disappeared similarly to the majority of post-ablation ACE findings &#x02264;10 mm in size which are not visible during follow-up imaging.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="EUV385C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The longer-term course of spontaneous acute PELs vs. chronic PELs, and their clinical significance, requires further longer-term evaluation.</p><p>Although the aetiology of chronic PELs is currently unknown, several factors may contribute including a history of AF, diabetes, sub-therapeutic anticoagulation, hypertension, and microvascular disease. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that AF is associated with a great that two-fold increase in the odds for PEL.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Of note, in the present study, older age and a higher CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score were the main predictors of PELs and not the number of AF episodes in the last 3 months before ablation.

This transient nature suggests that gaseous or sub-mm particle emboli may be the primary contributors to post-ablation ACE causing a temporary interruption of blood flow, but not resulting in a permanent detectable scar. The potential impact of transient ACE on cerebral function might therefore be less significant, when compared with permanent chronic PELs. As such, performing ablations earlier in the course of AF may confer clinical benefits through a decrease in AF burden, stroke risk, PEL incidence, and cognitive decline. Larger clinical studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Comparison of procedural efficiency and safety between PVAC GOLD and PVAC</title><p>Compared with PVAC in the ERACE study, no differences were observed in procedure time, LA dwell times, or mix of energy modes. Importantly, PVAC GOLD was associated with a similarly low rate of complications and comparable rate of PVI (94 vs. 100% in ERACE). In contrast, less RF applications per patient and per PV (except for the left inferior PV) were needed to achieve isolation in PRECISION GOLD. Contributing factors likely include the increased heat transfer of gold electrode material, as reflected by a significant increase in EC and EE and a 50% reduction in low-power ablations, and the 20&#x000b0; forward tilt, which provides more uniform contact with the PV antrum. Overall, this may reflect improved lesion formation with PVAC GOLD as Haines <italic>et al.</italic> recently demonstrated that gold electrodes allow more efficient cooling and deeper lesions with phased RF ablations than platinum.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> De Greef <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that increased rates of low-power ablations (&#x0003c;3 W) with PVAC were associated with acute PV reconnection and clinical AF recurrence.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In a temperature-controlled RF ablation, low-power ablations can be caused by inadequate circulatory cooling at the electrode&#x02013;tissue interface, limiting the lesion depth. Kardos <italic>et al.</italic> showed that cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was faster and required fewer RF applications using 8 mm gold vs. platinum electrodes.<sup><xref rid="EUV385C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Whether better RF biophysics results in improved clinical outcome with PVAC GOLD remains to be proved.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The present study includes a moderate number of patients without a control group. The observed ACE incidence in this study cannot be extrapolated to different peri-procedural anticoagulation strategies or newer agents, as well as, persistent or longstanding persistent AF patients. There are limitations to comparing the procedural and biophysical data from the PRECISION GOLD and ERACE studies, including the impact of different investigators and different software versions for the GENius generator. Lastly, subtle changes in cognitive function may not be detected by the MMSE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PRECISION GOLD study builds upon the preclinical work by Haines <italic>et al.</italic>, and the ERACE study providing evidence that AF ablations performed with the new-generation PVAC GOLD result in some of the lowest reported ACE rates (2.1%) for any technology. This study shows that despite a low thromboembolic risk score and inclusion of only paroxysmal AF patients, 73% of patients had pre-existing cerebral lesions. Finally, the current study demonstrates that the new PVAC GOLD with associated design changes demonstrate improved biophysics with similar acute safety, efficacy, and incidence of ACE as the predicate PVAC.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>The PRECISION GOLD trial was sponsored by Medtronic, Inc.
