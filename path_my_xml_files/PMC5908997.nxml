medication, bed rest, physical therapy, massage, exercise therapy, manual therapy, and
traction therapy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these, the
preferred methods are manual and traction therapies. Among manual therapies, chiropractic
often makes use of the flexion-distraction technique and the drop technique.</p><p>At present, flexion-distraction therapy is used for over 50% of chiropractic treatments in
clinical practice<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. This therapy increases
the disc space by widening the gap between the spinous processes. The increase creates
negative pressure within the intervertebral disc space, which helps the part pushed out from
the posterior intervertebral discs to move back inward<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the treatment, patients may experience a natural correction
of their subluxated vertebrae<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
therapy also induces lumbar traction in specific parts of the lumbar spine, and it realigns
intervertebral discs through an extension of the anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments brought about by the application of intensive exercises in the apophyseal
joint<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The drop technique is mainly used to correct the pelvis, the sacrum, and the thoracic and
cervical vertebrae. It is based on a system that can safely treat strong joints, such as the
pelvis, using a specially designed table. The technique accurately identifies the locations
of the patient&#x02019;s major subluxations and applies an analysis method unique to the Thompson
technique. It is the most commonly employed technique among existing chiropractic
techniques<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study by Kim et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> also reported that the drop technique showed
statistically significant positive effects on the pain and function of sciatica
patients.</p><p>Although the flexion-distraction and drop techniques are widely used for various spinal
diseases, the evidence of their effects has not been firmly established. This study
therefore aims to verify the clinical effects of those techniques by means of a comparative
analysis of their effects with the effects of the spinal decompression therapy that is
frequently applied in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 30 female patients in their twenties to fifties who, due to the
continuance of lumbar pain for at least three months, were inpatients or outpatients at S
Orthopedic Hospital in Daegu, South Korea. They were diagnosed by an orthopedic specialist
as having lumbar intervertebral disc herniation originating from the L5&#x02013;S1 area. Diagnosis
was based on their physical complaints and also on neurological, radiological, and clinical
findings with x-ray, CT, and MRI results. On average, the experimental group treated with
flexion-distraction and drop techniques (EG, n=15) was 35.0 &#x000b1; 8.4&#x02005;years of age, 162.6 &#x000b1;
6.6&#x02005;cm in height, and 57.1 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x02005;kg in weight. The control group (CG, n=15) averaged 36.6 &#x000b1;
11.2&#x02005;years of age, 161.2 &#x000b1; 6.3&#x02005;cm in height, and 59.5 &#x000b1; 10.4&#x02005;kg in weight. The test of
homogeneity showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Ethical
approval for the study was granted by the U1 University institutional review board, and all
subjects read and signed consent forms in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. As selection criteria, the subjects had to (1) score at least 17
points on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), (2) mark a Ferguson&#x02019;s angle of 30&#x000b0; or above,
and (3) have passed at least one week since the onset of their symptoms. Those with a
medical history of lumbar surgery, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatism, or
contraindications for manual therapy were excluded.</p><p>A physical therapist with over 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience treated the EG with the
flexion-distraction technique using a Zenith-Cox flexion table (Zenith-100, USA) and the
drop technique using a drop table (Zenith 440, USA). A spinal decompression device (MID 4&#x02005;M
Series, WIZ Medical, Korea) was used to treat the CG. Both groups received conservative
physical therapies including hot pack (20 mins), interferential current (100 bps, 15 mins),
and ultrasound therapies (5 mins). All subjects underwent their respective treatments three
times a week over an eight-week period.</p><p>In the flexion-distraction technique, the therapist touched each patient&#x02019;s lumbar spinous
process with the thenar of one hand. He then held the tail handle of the Cox table with his
other hand and lowered the caudal pelvic section of the table. In doing so, he applied
flexion-distraction motions five times for four to five seconds each time in order to apply
distraction for 20 seconds in total. When moving the caudal segment downward, the therapist
lowered it to around 5&#x02005;cm and applied the respective motions for a total of 20 seconds. One
set consisted of five repetitions, and three sets were applied to each patient. After
applying the flexion-distraction technique, the therapist repeated the foramen magnum pump
technique 10 times, applying flexion-distraction motions by lowering the tail unit of the
table while supporting the back of the patient&#x02019;s head with one hand<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the drop technique, each patient&#x02019;s pelvic and leg lengths were measured, and then it was
determined whether they had cervical syndrome. Once a patient was confirmed to have lumbar
and pelvic subluxations, the drop technique was applied with the patient in prone position.
The positive Derifield technique was applied as follows. With the patient lying in supine
position, the therapist touched the posterior superior iliac spine in the ilium with the
thenar of his dominant hand for the correction and touched the opposite ischial tuberosity
with his other hand to assist the correction. In this position, the therapist set the
direction for pelvic drops as the anterior-inferior direction, and he performed corrections
three to four times in posterior-anterior and inferior-anterior directions.</p><p>The negative Derifield technique was applied as follows. With the patient in supine
position, the therapist touched the ischial tuberosity with the thenar of his dominant hand
and held the wrist with his other hand to assist the correction. In this position, the
therapist first performed corrections three to four times in an inferior-superior direction.
He then touched the patient&#x02019;s anterior femoral region with the back side of his lower
forearm and touched the medial posterior superior iliac spine with the caput ulnae of his
upper forearm. He performed the corrections through a slight abduction of the patient&#x02019;s
legs, elevating them with both his hands interlocked<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. After correcting the pelvic subluxation, the therapist corrected
the sacral subluxation by setting a low level of tension in the table. The level of
correction for vertebral columns was limited to the lumbar vertebral column and pelvic
girdle.</p><p>In the spinal decompression therapy, with the patient in supine position, the therapist
fastened an air belt in the pelvic and thoracic regions using an air-grip extension and
fixed the head with a head strap, thereby preventing these body regions from slipping. He
then applied a sacrum extension device to maintain the lumbar lordosis. The duration of
traction therapy was 20 minutes, and the ratio of hold time to rest time was set at 2:1.</p><p>The ODI was used to evaluate each patient&#x02019;s disorder. It was measured using the responses
to ten questions about functional performance abilities on a scale ranging from 0 to 5. A
higher score indicated a higher level of disorder. The scores for each item were added up,
and the resulting sum was divided by 45 (the total score of the index) and recorded as a
percentage (%).</p><p>Ferguson&#x02019;s angle was measured using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS)
with a radiographic apparatus (DS-20UR, KOR). Ferguson&#x02019;s angle is the angle between the base
of support and the horizontal plane in the sacrum on a simple radiograph of the lateral
lumbar and sacral regions. A smaller angle leads to increased stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This angle was measured by one radiographer without knowing
the patient&#x02019;s symptoms or other information.</p><p>For statistical processing, paired t-tests were performed to identify changes in disorders
and in Ferguson&#x02019;s angle in female patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation within
each group. The statistical significance was set at p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of this study showed statistically significant reductions in disorders and in

neurological and radiological findings corresponded to lumbar intervertebral disc herniation
originating from the L5&#x02013;S1 area and whose Ferguson&#x02019;s angles were 30&#x000b0; or above. They were
divided into a group in which manual therapies (flexion-distraction technique and drop
technique) were applied and a group in which spinal decompression therapy was applied. Both
groups were treated three times a week over an eight-week period, and their changes in
disorders and in Ferguson&#x02019;s angle before and after treatment were observed.</p><p>Sutlive et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the
application of manual therapies to the lumbar spine and pelvis decreased the ODI with
statistical significance. In their study of 219 patients treated using a spinal
decompression device, Gionis and Groteke<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 86% experienced pain reduction. In the present
eight-week study involving patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, both groups
showed a statistically significant decrease in the ODI. This may be because the
flexion-distraction and drop techniques and spinal decompression therapy lowered pressure
within the intervertebral discs by accurately decompressing the sites of lesions and gently
stretching specific parts of the intervertebral discs. The therapies also reduced pain and
increased mobility by creating a greater visual diameter within the spinal canal<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lee<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> applied chiropractic in 10
patients complaining of lumbar pain and lower-extremity radiating pain and reported that
Ferguson&#x02019;s angles in six patients returned to normal levels. In the present study, the
effects of the given therapies on Ferguson&#x02019;s angle within each group were verified, and the
results revealed a statistically significant decrease in both groups. This may be because
the manual therapies (flexion-distraction and drop techniques) and the spinal decompression
therapy (using a device for inducing sacral movements) opened motor units in the posterior
spine with a combination of manual force applied to the posterior spine and vertical
distraction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It may also be due to
inducement of a correction of facet joint dysfunction, mobilization of closed vertebral
joints, and reductions in pressure on the nerve roots caused by working on regions with low
mobility or limited movement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
effects may eventually have facilitated joint movements that had previously been limited and
may have improved motor skills within the articular capsule.</p><p>This study has some limitations. It involved only a limited number of subjects selected
from the patients visiting our hospital over the eight-week research period. It also focused
on a limited number of sites in terms of the origin of lumbar lesions. Moreover, the
subjects&#x02019; daily lives could not be fully controlled, and long-term treatments were not
performed. A variety of follow-up studies are therefore required to compensate for these
limitations.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hammer</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Chiropractic management and rehabilitation of a
