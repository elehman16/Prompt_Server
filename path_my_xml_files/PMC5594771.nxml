Painful uterine contractions cause maternal hyperventilation and increased catecholamine release resulting in maternal and fetal hypoxemia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Providing labor analgesia takes away the disadvantage and result in better maternal and fetal outcome. An ideal labor analgesic technique should provide adequate and satisfactory analgesia without any motor blockade or adverse maternal and fetal effects. Among the variety of labor analgesia techniques, epidural analgesia remains gold standard for providing pain relief during labor.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Even though combined spinal epidural analgesia (CSEA) is considered as a safe technique with greater maternal satisfaction, there were no differences in maternal satisfaction, mode of delivery, and ability to ambulate between CSEA and epidural techniques.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>With the emerging concept of low dose and minimal local anesthetic (LA) dose and volumes, all present day labor epidurals are low-dose epidurals. In the last decade, the concentration of LA used to maintain labor epidural analgesia has been decreasing (0.0625%&#x02013;0.125%) in an attempt to reduce the total dose of LA used as well as to avoid motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Epidural bupivacaine provides excellent sensory block and has been used for labor analgesia for many years. However, concern about its cardiac toxicity and the intensity of motor block has led to the investigation of other agents. Ropivacaine has been associated with reduced incidence of operative vaginal delivery and less motor block when compared to bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Recently, it has been shown that ropivacaine appears equipotent to bupivacaine, less cardiotoxic and neurotoxic and seem to be more suitable agent for pain relief in laboring women.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In the randomized study comparing levobupivacaine, ropivacaine and bupivacaine with fentanyl for labor analgesia concluded that all three regimens were effective during the first stage of labor although pain scores were higher in those receiving levobupivacaine. Motor block was greater with bupivacaine than with levobupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The quality of analgesia is excellent when highly lipid-soluble opioids are added. The addition of opioids to LA reduces its requirement by synergistic effect of opioid receptors in the spinal cord. This reduces the chances of motor blockade and the hemodynamic perturbations.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODOLOGY</sc></title><p>After obtaining clearance from the Institutional Ethical Committee, a prospective randomized double-blinded study was conducted on sixty parturients with singleton term pregnancy with physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I and II in spontaneous labor with normal fetal heart rate tracing, who requested for labor analgesia.</p><p>Parturients with medical disorders, obstetric complications, fetal malpresentations, and those with contraindication for regional analgesia were excluded from the study. After obtaining informed written consent, parturient was randomly allocated by a computer-generated table of random numbers by a person blinded to the procedure to avoid selection bias into two groups of thirty each as Group bupivacaine (B) (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and Group ropivacaine (R) (<italic>n</italic> = 30).</p><p>Double-blinded randomization to epidural analgesia procedure was accomplished by means of a computer-generated randomization list. The procedure was carried out by one anesthesiologist while the observations were made by the second one who was not present at the time of the procedure. The progress of labor and other obstetric parameters and fetal heart rate (FHR) were assessed by an obstetrician who was also blinded to the group allocations.</p><p>Before the institution of analgesia, parturients were administered 500 ml of Ringer's lactate solution, monitors connected (electrocardiogram [ECG], SpO<sub>2</sub>, noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP]), and baseline readings were noted. Parturients were placed in the left lateral position, and with all the aseptic measures, epidural space was identified by a midline approach at L3&#x02013;L4 level with 18-gauge Tuohy needle using loss of resistance to saline technique. After negative aspiration for blood and CSF, the epidural catheter was threaded on through the Tuohy needle, and the needle was carefully withdrawn over catheter adjusting the catheter length of 3&#x02013;4 cm inside the space.</p><p>Once the epidural catheter's position in the epidural space was confirmed, 10 ml of study drug of either 0.0625% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml or 0.1% ropivacaine with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/ml was given in 5 ml fractionated doses with 5 min interval.</p><p>All the parturients in the both groups were familiarized with a visual analog scale (VAS) (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imagined). Parturients not experiencing analgesia (VAS &#x0003e;4) within 15 min of initial bolus were supplemented with additional 5 ml of solution. At the end of 30 min, if parturient does not experience pain relief, they were excluded from the study.</p><p>The SpO<sub>2</sub>, heart rate, NIBP, FHR were monitored before the insertion of catheter and at intervals of 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, min and every 30 min until delivery.</p><p>Analgesia was maintained by timed top ups at the end of 90 min whether the parturient had pain or not, without breakthrough pain experiences. The dosage of top ups was equal to the initial dose of the drug. Adverse effects such as hypotension, arterial desaturation, ECG abnormalities, pruritis, and nausea were noted and managed if necessary.</p><p>A fall of systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;20% from the baseline or &#x0003c;90 mmHg reading was taken as hypotension. Hypotension was managed by O<sub>2</sub> supplementation, left uterine displacement, intravascular volume expansion, and intravenous bolus ephedrine 3 mg as required.</p><p>After the administration of bolus dose of drug and also after giving timed top ups following parameters were noted: FHR, cervical dilatation, pain score (VAS), highest level of sensory block (assessed by loss of temperature discrimination to alcohol swab), motor block (intensity as per Bromage scale), total dose of LA consumed per hour and number of additional supplemental doses administered. All the parameters were assessed at 20 min after the initial bolus dose and every 30 min thereafter. The mode of delivery (spontaneous vaginal, instrumental vaginal, and cesarean section) was also noted. After the delivery, maternal satisfaction levels with epidural analgesia (on a numerical scale 0 = totally unsatisfied, 10 = totally satisfied) were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using software version SPSS-20 (IBM SPSS statistics for windows, version 20.0.

Similar observations have been reported in other studies where no differences were found in the maximum height of the block with 0.5% and 0.75% concentrations of each drug.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, use of these two drugs in low doses with opioids as in our study, have not been much reported.</p><p>In our study, we found that 0.0625% of bupivacaine with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml fentanyl and 0.1% of ropivacaine with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml of fentanyl given in 5 ml fractionated doses given for lumbar epidural labor analgesia produced effective labor analgesia with a mean duration of analgesia in Group B of 220 &#x000b1; 55.3 min and in Group R of 209 &#x000b1; 75.35 min (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.522).</p><p>There was no difference in motor blockade between the two Groups B and R. Most of our patients had a Bromage score of 0 or 1. We decided to test whether this statistically insignificant value had any clinical significance because we considered the most frequent Bromage score reached in all patients in both groups of our study, which holds good with a study comparing 0.5% bupivacaine and 0.75% ropivacaine which also showed no significant differences in motor block[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Scott <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] McCrae <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Owen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] studies showed that motor block was similar in bupivacaine and ropivacaine groups.
