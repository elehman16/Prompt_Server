training using a real-world video recording of the gait of individuals with chronic
stroke. [Subjects] Forty chronic stroke survivors were randomly divided into two groups of
20 subjects each. [Methods] The experimental group performed virtual dual-task treadmill
training using a video recording for 30 minutes per session, three times a week for 4
weeks, whereas the control group performed only treadmill training for 30 minutes per
session, three times a week for 4 weeks. A video recording was performed in a large
supermarket, and the subjects could walk at their favorable speed on a treadmill. The
temporospatial gait variables were measured to examine the training effect. [Results] The
experimental and control groups showed statistically significant improvements in the gait
variables after training. The enhancement of gait ability was statistically better in the
experimental group than in the control group. [Conclusion] Our findings suggest that
virtual dual-task treadmill training using a video recording can improve the gait
parameters of chronic stroke survivors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Video recording</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Individuals with stroke experience difficulty returning to their productive roles in
society due to gait disturbances<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurological deficits resulting from the
stroke lead to persistent functional impairment and physical problems caused by brain
damage<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The chief complaint is related
to a change in gait ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased
gait ability can improve an individual&#x02019;s independence, participation in society, and quality
of life as well as reduce the supporting costs of caregivers<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, gait training interventions are needed. Treadmill
training is a useful exercise for mobility recovery, cardiovascular fitness, and whole-body
metabolism<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various tasks are performed in daily life<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some tasks are required to perform a cognitive task while walking
for community ambulation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
high cognitive function is needed to complete these motor tasks<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. When stroke
patients perform dual tasks, their gait patterns, such as reductions in gait speed, are
changed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These gait changes result in difficult time-critical tasks, such
as crossing the street safely in the community<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the ability to perform dual
tasks can be a helpful factor in returning to the community<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive-motor interference (CMI) is generated by the intense concentration when cognitive
and motor tasks are simultaneously performed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. CMI changes by age group and is further
increased in stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
cognitive task such as language or calculation may be more challenging for an individual
with a lower education level<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
increased CMI in stroke patients is caused by cognitive motor function damage. The dual
task-related increase in CMI is significantly correlated with activities of daily living in
stroke patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. To reduce CMI,
automatization should be improved through repetitive gait training, whereas the coordination
ability of dual tasks should be improved through task-oriented training<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous research on virtual reality training was performed improve gait ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Using virtual reality technology, it is easy to control the difficulty level and determine
the interest and motives through visual, auditory, and tactile feedback, which provides
individuals with experience and active learning<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Movement re-education from various stimuli can help improve gait
ability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The development of computers
has resulted in three dimensional virtual reality tools. Virtual reality makes it possible
to create realistic environment the enable safer and more efficient indoor training<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The outdoor environment is a difficult
setting in which to develop community mobility in stroke patients<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, the need for special hardware or software is a weakness of existing
virtual reality training system. In addition, although the actual environment can be
represented, it does not resemble real-life. To complement such limitations, virtual
training using a video recording is needed.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop virtual reality images that more closely resemble real
life by recording a place that can be commonly observed in daily life. The effect of virtual
dual-task treadmill training was examined through video recording of the gait of stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were recruited from rehabilitation hospital. The inclusion criteria were
hemiplegic subjects who had experienced a middle cerebral lesion and stroke at least 6
months earlier to exclude natural restoration, subjects who scored greater than 24 points on
the Mini-Mental State Examination-Korea, and could understand and follow the intervention
and walk 10&#x02005;m independently.</p><p>Patients with vestibular system disease, cerebellar disease, visual disability, visual
defect, sensory aphasia, auditory disability, auditory defect, neurologic diseases, or
orthopedic diseases that could have affected the study were excluded.</p><p>After explaining the study objective and procedures, only those subjects who voluntarily
provided written consent were allowed to participate.</p><p>This study was a pilot randomized single-blind controlled trial. To minimize bias, the
selected participants were randomly allocated into the experimental and control groups
according to the treatment condition using Random Allocation Software (ver. 2.0)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects in the experimental and control
groups received traditional physical therapy for 1 hour, five times a week for 4 weeks. The
experimental group performed virtual dual-task treadmill training using a video recording
for 30 minutes per session, three times a week for 4 weeks, whereas the control group
performed only treadmill training for 30 minutes per session, three times a week for 4 weeks
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental flow diagram according to CONSORT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3693-g001"/></fig>). The study was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>Virtual dual-task treadmill training was performed in a separate space. In contrast to the
existing computer program, the first-person scene, in which a cart is pushed in a major
supermarket, was recorded using a camcorder (VIXIA HF-R20, Canon Korea, KOREA, 2010). The
moving speed of cart was maintained at 100&#x02005;cm/s while the video was recording. The
experimental group walked on the treadmill (STEX 620T, Taeha Mechatronics, KOREA, 2009)
while looking at the recorded scene. The 100 inch screen was placed closely enough to the
subject to cover the visual field. The gait speed at which the participants could walk
comfortably was selected. To match the flow of the surrounding objects on the screen with
each individual&#x02019;s gait speed, the speed ratio suitable for each gait speed was set up in
advance (Gom Player v2.1.46.5131). In every session, the therapist checked the selected gait
speed. Since the environment was set up to be similar to reality through recorded sounds,
the subjects were trained to walk and push the handle as though they were pushing a real
cart. Before starting, all of the subjects were asked to remember five items and press a
buzzer after finding those items in the recorded scene. A new set of items was located each
time and included product such as detergents, certain fruits like bananas, apples,
pineapples, specific soft drinks and snacks, bread, and a dehumidifying agent. When an
object presented on the screen was passed, even if the subject pressed the buzzer, it was
excluded from the count. The subjects showed a reaction to four or more items each time.</p><p>The control group simply walked on a treadmill at a preferable speed for 30 minutes<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A therapist always accompanied the
subjects during walk to prevent falls.</p><p>To examine an individual&#x02019;s basic capacity for the inclusion criteria, a gait ability test
was administered before training.</p><p>An electronic gait carpet containing a total of 2,304 sensors (1&#x02005;cm diameter) placed
vertically every 1.27&#x02005;cm was used. The collected data related to the temporospatial
variables were processed using GaitRite GOLD version 3.2b software (CIR System Inc, USA,
2007). To reduce participant-related acceleration and deceleration errors, the GaitRite was
placed 1&#x02005;m ahead of the departure point and 1&#x02005;m behind the finishing point. The mean values
of three measurements were used.</p><p>After training, the gait ability was tested again to examine the total training effect. The
mean and standard deviation were calculated using SPSS ver. 18.0. The data normality was
assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test prior to training. Descriptive statistics were used to
analyze the participants&#x02019; general characteristics, while an independent t-test was performed
to examine the differences between the two groups. A paired t-test was performed to compare
the pre- and post virtual dual-task treadmill training data using a video recording of each
group. The level of statistical significance (&#x003b1;) was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 50 subjects initially recruited, we included the 40 who met the inclusion criteria.

particular, the reaction time was increased when participants performed a dual task due to a
central bottleneck paradigm. The main cause of the psychological refractory period is the
central bottleneck paradigm, but this can be eliminated by practice. Therefore,
automatization through repeated practice is essential for reducing dual-task
interference<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the
participants were asked to finding items before training and perform cognitive tasks that
require continuous attention while walking. Such tasks can be accelerated by
automatization.</p><p>Automatization of the control group was improved due to the repetition of treadmill
walking, whereas the proper allocation ability of coordination and attention was improved in
the experimental group by virtual dual-task training, which led to the decreased CMI. CMI is
a phenomenon that results in the deterioration in many aspects of gait ability, such as
slower gait speeds, reduced cadence, and shorter stride length<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the experimental group, the perturbation that occurred
when the buzzer was pressed was consistently controlled, and walking at the same rate in the
situation was thought to have resulted in improved gait ability. Thus, the automatization of
the experimental group led to decreased CMI, which is linked to increased gait ability.</p><p>Visual feedback in the virtual reality environment motivates the participants to actively
participate in the training<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Improvements in concentration as well as postural stability contribute to a normal gait
pattern<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Through this, the gait
ability of stroke patients was improved.</p><p>Based on a representation of virtual reality using a video recording, it is possible to
secure the strengths of virtual reality and select images that represent an actual
environment. Even without special software, it is possible to clinically harness this
technology. The task difficulty can be controlled in phases by providing real visual-audio
feedback during task performance.</p><p>On the other hand, this study was limited in that it was conducted only on stroke patients
who could walk independently. Therefore, these results are only applicable to patients who
can walk independently despite severe disability after stroke. In addition, the task was
performed only in a major supermarket. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide
participants with a chance to be exposed to additional environments using video
recordings.</p><p>The results of this study are clinically and potentially important. In stroke patients,
multiple factors should be considered. Dual tasks should be considered when attempting to
achieve qualitative gait improvements as opposed to quantitative improvements in the
rehabilitation process. Virtual reality using video recordings can be used to help patients
return to the community by attracting their interest. Nevertheless, additional research into
the effects of this strategy on quality of life is needed.</p><p>Similarly, virtual dual-task treadmill training using a video recording has strengths
related to both dual-tasks and virtual reality. The intervention of virtual reality provided
stroke survivors with motivation and emotional stability, and their neuroplasticity
increased through repetitive training of their damaged lower extremities, resulting in
improved gait ability. Therefore, the control group probably showed more efficient
improvements in gait ability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Sahmyook University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Leys</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Esquenazi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The interaction between neuropsychological and motor
