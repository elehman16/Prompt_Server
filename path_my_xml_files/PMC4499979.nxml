lumbar load and increased comfort. [Subjects] Fifteen healthy people participated.
[Methods] The study examined three randomized backrest conditions: no pad; a 3-cm-thick
lumbar pad; and a 6-cm-thick lumbar pad. The location of the lumbar pad was standardized
at the mid-lumbar level (L3). Participants were instructed to propel the wheelchair using
only the handrims. [Results] Activation of the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, and
biceps brachii muscles was significantly reduced when the participants used the 3-cm pad
compared to no pad, while it was significantly increased in the anterior deltoid, upper
trapezius, posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii when the participants used the 6-cm pad
compared to the 3-cm pad. Muscle activation did not differ significantly between the no
pad and the 6-cm lumbar pad conditions. [Conclusion] A lumbar pad decreased the activation
of the upper extremity muscles. We believe that padding of the appropriate thickness will
lead to effective muscle activation while propelling a wheelchair and decrease the risk of
musculoskeletal disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Lumbar pad</kwd><kwd>Wheelchair</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Upper-limb pain and dysfunction are frequent complaints associated with manual wheelchair
propulsion, which is physically demanding and involves repetitive movements<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. About 73% of wheelchair users suffer from
chronic upper-limb pain, which is primarily attributed to two factors: wheelchair propulsion
and transfers<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, selecting the
appropriate wheelchair and seating system is one of the most important decisions for those
who spend long periods of time in their wheelchairs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Active wheelchair users report shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand
pain, chiefly shoulder pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The chair
backrest is designed to decrease the stresses on the vertebral column by: allowing
relaxation of the erector spinae muscles, maintaining lumbar lordosis, and improving
comfort<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. While biomechanical variables
are important criteria for wheelchair users, they have not been studied sufficiently.
Prevention is the best way to reduce chronic pain, and researchers have suggested various
methods of preventing the development of problems during wheelchair propulsion. Ergonomic
wheelchair seats provide good support for the user under dynamic conditions. Back belts
might have positive effects on sustaining an erect trunk and lumbar lordosis by supporting
the force from the knees, but they may secondarily lead to knee discomfort. Another method
allows the user to lean backwards<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The backrest thickness may also affect
comfort and performance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently,
criteria for the optimal design of backrests need to be established. It is also important to
investigate how the backrest thickness affects comfort, especially in a dynamic setting
during wheelchair propulsion. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of backrest
thickness on the lumbar load and comfort by assessing the surface electromyography (sEMG)
activity of the shoulder muscles during wheelchair propulsion with lumbar support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen healthy people (seven females) participated. All of the subjects were informed of
the study purpose and methods before participating, and provided their informed consent
according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. None reported any upper
extremity pain or neuromuscular disorder. Our study consisted of three randomized backrest
conditions: no pad; a 3-cm-thick lumbar pad; and a 6-cm-thick lumbar pad. The lumbar pads of
the backrests used in this study had a density of 27&#x02005;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The location of the
lumbar pad was standardized by aligning it at the mid-lumbar level (L3). Participants were
instructed to propel the wheelchair using only the handrims. They propelled the wheelchair
30 times with their hands, the upper body in an upright position at an average rate of once
per second. For stable propulsion, the wheelchair was raised from ground level. A 5-minute
rest was given between measurements. The sEMG activity of the upper extremity muscles was
collected, amplified, digitized, and analyzed using an ME6000-biosignal monitor (Mega
Electronics, Kuopio, Finland). The electrode locations were as follows: anterior deltoid,
anterior aspect of the arm, approximately 4&#x02005;cm below the clavicle; upper trapezius, slightly
lateral to and halfway between the cervical spine at C-7 and the acromion; posterior
deltoid, 2&#x02005;cm below the lateral border of the spine of the scapula and angled obliquely to
the arm; and biceps brachii, attached at the middle muscle belly over the short and long
heads. The EMG data were converted into root mean square (RMS) values in a window comprising
300&#x02005;ms of data. We obtained the reference voluntary contraction (RVC) using the submaximal
normalization method. SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the differences
in shoulder muscle activities. The Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test was performed to test for a
normal distribution before using parametric statistics. The significance of differences
among wheelchair propulsion with no lumbar pad, the 3-cm lumbar pad, and the 6-cm lumbar pad
was tested using one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA<italic>).</italic>
Values of p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.05 were accepted as significant. For the significant main
effect, the Bonferroni correction was used to identify the specific mean differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The normalized EMG data obtained while performing the wheelchair propulsion task with no
pad, a 3-cm-thick lumbar pad, and a 6-cm-thick lumbar pad revealed significant differences
in the activation of the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, posterior deltoid, and biceps
brachii muscles. Muscle activation of the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, and biceps
brachii muscles significantly decreased when the 3-cm pad was used compared to none, and
significantly increased in the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, posterior deltoid, and
biceps brachii when the participants used the 6-cm pad compared to the 3-cm pad. There were
no significant differences in muscle activation between the no pad and the 6-cm lumbar pad

upper limb injuries<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous study has shown that a lumbar support increased (or
preserved) the comfort while sitting. Especially, it indicated that a 2&#x02013;3&#x000b0; change in lumbar
posture influences the compressive load at L4&#x02013;L5 when performing spinal loading work<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our present results show that there was a
significant decrease in the activation of the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, and biceps
brachii muscles when the participants used the 3-cm pad compared to no pad, while the
activation of the anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii
significantly increased when the participants used the 6-cm pad compared to the 3-cm pad.
There were no significant between the no pad and the 6-cm lumbar pad conditions. Generally,
the push phase mainly uses the anterior deltoid, pectoralis major, and biceps brachii,
whereas the recovery phase primarily uses the upper trapezius and middle and posterior
deltoid<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. One possible explanation for our result is the effect of muscle
activation on the propulsion efficiency when performing wheelchair propulsion with the 3-cm
pad compared with no pad or a 6-cm pad. It has also been reported that an appropriate lumbar
pad provides a biomechanical advantage to the shoulder during seated work. A decrease in
muscle load might elicit the optimal curvature of the lumbar spine when propelling a
wheelchair. This suggests that although users might not benefit from a lumbar pad to improve
their temporal muscle load, long-term users develop musculoskeletal shoulder pain. Goosey et
al. indicated that a lower propelling frequency could explain the effectiveness of pushing
economy. A high frequency is associated with more shifts during the deceleration and
acceleration phases, and increased inertial limb moments. As a result, a lower frequency
leads to less muscle activity, possibly reducing rotator cuff fatigue, while maintaining the
stability of the humeral head<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study,
the backrest was rated as more comfortable, and it had better dampening capability, which
allowed leverage in the contact area between the lumbar spine and backrest during wheelchair
propulsion. The results of our present study confirm that an appropriate lumbar pad allows
more effective coordination of the shoulder muscles and increases comfort during wheelchair
propulsion.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mercer</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Boninger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Koontz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Shoulder joint kinetics and pathology in manual wheelchair
