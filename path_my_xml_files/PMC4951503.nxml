The US Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s Subpart H approval, under which midodrine was initially approved, requires post-marketing studies to confirm midodrine&#x02019;s clinical benefit in this indication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of midodrine with regard to symptom response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, multicenter study (NCT01518946). Following screening, patients aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with severe symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and on a stable dose of midodrine for at least 3&#x000a0;months were randomized to treatment with either their previous midodrine dose or placebo on day 1 and the respective alternate treatment on day 2. The primary endpoint measured time to syncopal symptoms or near-syncope using a 45-min tilt-table test at 1&#x000a0;h post-dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-three patients were screened for inclusion: 19 received at least one dose of midodrine and had at least one post-dose measurement of the primary endpoint. The least-squares mean time to syncopal symptoms or near-syncope after tilt-table initiation (mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard error) was 1626.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;186.8&#x000a0;s for midodrine and 1105.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;186.8&#x000a0;s for placebo (difference, 521.0&#x000a0;s; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 124.2&#x02013;971.7&#x000a0;s; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0131).

The condition can have a substantial impact on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several therapies have been used for its treatment, including fludrocortisone, methylphenidate, ephedrine, indomethacin, and dihydroergotamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, none of these agents are indicated for the condition, and they are also associated with various adverse events. Droxidopa, a prodrug metabolized to norepinephrine, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness, or near-syncopal feelings in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, but its effectiveness has not been established beyond 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Midodrine hydrochloride, a prodrug for the active metabolite desglymidodrine, received conditional approval in the USA in 1996 for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Desglymidodrine is an alpha-1 agonist that increases blood pressure and vascular tone via stimulation of arterial and venous alpha-adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It does not stimulate cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and, owing to its poor diffusion across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, generally has no effect on the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pressor effects of midodrine occur within approximately 1&#x000a0;h of the oral administration of a single dose, and the effects usually persist for about 4&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Studies conducted in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which included over 4000 patients, have shown midodrine HCl to be of value in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. The FDA&#x02019;s accelerated Subpart H approval of midodrine in 1996 considered a decrease in the frequency of the reductions in blood pressure that occur after standing in patients with orthostatic hypotension to be a &#x0201c;surrogate marker of effectiveness&#x0201d; that would likely &#x0201c;correspond to a clinical benefit&#x0201d;. Midodrine has been shown to increase blood pressure and vascular tone and to reduce the frequency and severity of syncopal symptoms in patients with orthostatic hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but full approval of the drug requires post-marketing studies to confirm that midodrine provides a clinical benefit for patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this phase 4 study was to assess the effect of midodrine on symptom response in the form of time to onset of syncopal symptoms or near-syncope measured using a protocol-defined tilt-table test at 1&#x000a0;h post-dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study overview and participants</title><p>This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, multicenter study conducted at six sites in the USA from 14 May 2012 to 22 June 2013. The study was carried out in an inpatient setting.

To be eligible for inclusion, individuals had to have been on a stable dose of midodrine for at least 3&#x000a0;months, been ambulatory when receiving adequate therapy for their symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, and had at least one of the following symptoms while standing or when not on treatment: dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like they might lose consciousness.</p><p>Additional eligibility criteria were: women of child-bearing potential must have had a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test and must have abstained from sexual activity that could have resulted in a pregnancy or had agreed to use acceptable contraceptives throughout the period of the entire study and for 30&#x000a0;days after the last dose of midodrine; willingness and ability to undergo the procedures required by the protocol, including inpatient stay as required; adequate hydration status (as assessed by physical examination and clinical laboratory parameters, e.g., urine specific gravity); and ability to provide written, signed, and dated informed consent to participate in the study.

Eight patients in the enrollment set experienced a total of 11 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Part A, all of which were mild or moderate in severity and none of which was considered by the investigator to be related to midodrine.

There were no notable concerns related to clinical laboratory evaluations, ECG results, or health status.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study used a randomized-crossover design to assess the clinical benefit of midodrine in terms of symptom response compared with placebo in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms were induced in a controlled inpatient setting using a 45-min tilt-table test that was performed at 1&#x000a0;h post-dose with midodrine or placebo. Treatment with midodrine provided a statistically significant increase in time to tilt-table-induced syncopal symptoms or near-syncope in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension when compared with placebo.</p><p>Changes in blood pressure correlate with the frequency and severity of syncopal symptoms in patients with orthostatic hypotension, and this has been used as a surrogate measure of the effectiveness and clinical benefit of orthostatic hypotension treatments. Midodrine has previously been shown to increase blood pressure and vascular tone, which correlates with a reduction in frequency and severity of syncopal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further studies were required to evaluate midodrine&#x02019;s clinical benefit with regard to symptom response. In the present study, patients responding well to midodrine treatment (stable dose for at least 3&#x000a0;months) were enrolled. Midodrine-related blood pressure changes and improvement in OHSA scores in part A of the study served to identify those patients for whom midodrine provided a clear clinical benefit. Subsequent analyses during part B demonstrated the midodrine-related symptomatic improvement of these patients in a controlled clinical setting.</p><p>A history of severe orthostatic hypotension was one of the primary criteria for enrolment in the study, and according to the selection process for part B of the study, the patients were required to exhibit a&#x000a0;&#x0003e;4 point decrease in their OHSA score and an acute drop in orthostatic blood pressure on withdrawal of midodrine, confirming the severity of their hypotension. Although a mean tilt time of 1105 s with placebo may seem long for patients with this disease, the majority of patients were being managed with multimodal treatment. Within this trial, patients were able to maintain all other treatments, such as fludrocortisone, which may have influenced the seemingly long time to response in the placebo group. Interestingly, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the patients who had a longer tilt time with placebo seemed to exhibit greater improvement with midodrine than those patients with shorter placebo tilt times of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;min. As this patient population had been under treatment for at least 3&#x000a0;months and the study was focussed on evaluating the symptomatic response in patients with a confirmed midodrine-related clinical benefit, an expectation of similar results for typical patients with immediate-onset (&#x0003c;1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;min) symptomatic orthostatic hypotension is unlikely.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Time to onset of syncopal symptoms/near-syncope after initiation of a tilt-table test in patients receiving midodrine or placebo in the final analysis set The time to onset of syncopal symptoms/near-syncopal symptoms was defined as the duration (in seconds) from the initiation of the protocol-defined tilt-table test until syncopal symptoms/near-syncope (of sufficient severity that caused the patient to ask that the tilt table be returned to the horizontal position).

Systolic pressure of about 200&#x000a0;mmHg was observed in 13.4&#x000a0;% of patients taking 10&#x000a0;mg midodrine, seemingly associated with a mean pre-treatment supine systolic blood pressure of 170&#x000a0;mmHg. Midodrine is not recommended for use in these patients, and to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the study, the cut-off value for supine blood pressure (&#x02265;180/110&#x000a0;mmHg) was applied as an exclusion criterion. As only patients who had been on a stable dose for at least 3&#x000a0;months were included, the toleration of midodrine in the population was likely to be quite high. No incidences of supine hypertension were reported, none of the adverse events reported were considered to be related to midodrine, and no new safety signals were identified.</p><p>The primary diseases underlying orthostatic hypotension include Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy, although non-neurogenic causes are more common and may be related to dehydration, drug therapy, and cardiovascular abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Many patients with orthostatic hypotension have comorbidities related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as cognitive impairment and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These comorbidities display intra- and inter-day variations in intensity and could impact the assessment of the efficacy of midodrine versus placebo. In this study, the enrolment criteria were related primarily to the history and assessed severity of orthostatic hypertension and not the underlying diagnosis. As a result, the patient population included patients who were diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension at a younger age, who, thus, may have otherwise been excluded from previous phase 3 clinical trials; this included patients with depression, diabetes, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypothyroidism and cancer, as well as patients with primary dysautonomias. Patients with orthostatic hypotension are usually elderly, with prevalence increasing with age (10&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% in the elderly), and study enrollments usually reflect this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, studies have also shown a prevalence of 5.1&#x02013;6.2&#x000a0;% in middle-aged patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with increased mortality risk in patients with orthostatic hypotension younger than 42&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. By evaluating a real-world population in which the patients&#x02019; ages ranged between 18 and 78, the benefit provided by clinical application of midodrine with regard to patients&#x02019; symptoms and individual responses could be demonstrated in a controlled environment for a heterogeneous population, with a wide age distribution and a range of associated diagnoses.</p><p>Although the use of tilt-testing as implemented in this study is quite different from real-life situations, midodrine was highly efficacious in this controlled clinical setting. A previous midodrine study reported that improved hemodynamic responses to a tilt-table test were associated with reductions in the symptoms of hypotension and with improvements in health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Midodrine is clearly beneficial in the studied environment, but more detailed analyses would give greater insight into the effect on the patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>Developing effective therapies for orthostatic hypotension is vitally important as it greatly affects a patient&#x02019;s day-to-day functioning: it can be associated with increased incidence of heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and some studies suggest that it can also cause cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Orthostatic hypotension is difficult to treat, particularly as orthostatic stress is not uniform throughout the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, treatments that elevate standing blood pressure may cause problems, such as severe supine hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Many commonly recommended therapies used in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension have a limited evidence base and lack high-quality data from randomized, controlled clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results of this study are supportive of earlier investigations into the efficacy of midodrine treatment for orthostatic hypotension, which assessed a variety of dosing frequencies and concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; these randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies reported that the proportions of patients experiencing an improvement in standing systolic blood pressure and a reduction in the major symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness or lightheadedness, and unsteadiness) were significantly larger after receiving midodrine than after receiving placebo.</p><p>The range of orthostatic symptom severity is extremely wide, and the same treatments are not suitable for all patients. Patients with mild symptoms can be well treated with intravascular volume repletion or support stockings, while patients with more severe symptoms require much more aggressive medical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition to the previously reported physiological effect of sustaining blood pressure in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], this study has shown that midodrine offers a clinical benefit with regard to its efficacy in prolonging symptom-free orthostasis. As a clinically effective and well-tolerated treatment for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, midodrine is an important treatment option for those patients who are not adequately treated using simpler measures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>On behalf of the SPD426-406 investigators.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the following investigators who, together with their site personnel, enrolled patients into the study: Aaron N.
