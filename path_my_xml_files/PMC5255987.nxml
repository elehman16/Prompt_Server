Fifty-eight low-risk renal allograft recipients who receiving Tac 6 months posttransplant, were randomly assigned to continue Tac (<italic>n</italic> = 29) or convert to SRL (<italic>n</italic> = 29). We evaluated the 3-year outcomes including patient and graft survival, graft function, and safety profile. Three-year patient and graft survival in SRL and Tac groups were 93.1% versus 100% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.32), and 89.7% versus 100% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.11), respectively. However, the SRL group had a significantly better renal function, from the 2<sup>nd</sup> year posttransplant until the last follow-up. Four (13.8%) patients in the SRL group and 3 (10.3%) in the Tac group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.5) developed biopsy-proven acute rejection. Mean urinary protein excretion increased significantly after SRL conversion. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower at the end of the study in patients who eliminated Tac (80.4 vs. 75.6 mmHg in Tac and SRL group, respectively) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Mean hemoglobin concentrations decreased after SRL conversion and remained significantly lower from 12 months to 36 months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The mean serum cholesterol (540 &#x000b1; 44 mg/dl) and triglyceride (177 &#x000b1; 27 mg/dl) increased significantly in the SRL group, compared to Tac group (487 &#x000b1; 62 mg/dl) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and (141 &#x000b1; 26 mg/dl) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Our experience demonstrates that conversion to SRL from calcineurin inhibitors-based therapy may result in better renal function and blood pressure control in renal transplant recipients without an increased risk of acute rejection. However, these benefits have not resulted in a growing advantage in graft or patient survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kidney transplant</kwd><kwd>outcome</kwd><kwd>sirolimus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the use of cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac) has markedly improved 1-year kidney transplant survival and decreased the acute rejection rate in most centers, both of these calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are nephrotoxic, and it is well recognized that their long-term use does not solve the problem of chronic rejection. The use of CNIs, CsA, and Tac has been associated with both acute and chronic nephrotoxicity and contribute to the development of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Biopsy-proven CAN was found in 62% of the Tac- and 72% of the CsA-treated patients within 2 years posttransplantation. Notably, 68% of the biopsy specimens with CAN were obtained from patients who developed CNI nephrotoxicity during the 1<sup>st</sup> year posttransplantation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the short-term, CNI produces renal arteriolar vasoconstriction and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that is dose-related and reversible.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Long-term exposure to CNI causes chronic nonreversible changes that are characterized by interstitial fibrosis and obliterative arteriolar changes due to fibrous intimal thickening.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Nankivell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed a histological evidence of CNI toxicity in all renal allografts within 10 years by adopting annual protocol biopsies. Such a long-term attrition effect of CNI is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft damage despite the serum level being maintained within the therapeutic range. In order to avoid or even to ameliorate this effect, a variety of strategies has been explored. These include complete withdrawal of CNI at some point in the posttransplant period, substitution of CNI with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or simply minimizing the CsA maintenance dose.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although some success has been achieved with these strategies, withdrawal of CNI as late as 1 year posttransplant is often associated with acute rejection and the risk of late graft damage.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Sirolimus (SRL) has been shown to be effective as a <italic>de novo</italic> therapy after renal transplantation[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and as long-term maintenance therapy with steroids.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It may also have a role as an effective substitute for CNI therapy late after transplantation to avoid further CNI nephrotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, the potential risk and benefit of this conversion strategy are not yet fully known, especially in the long-term.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of conversion to SRL-based immunosuppression in stable kidney transplant recipients 6 months posttransplant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients selected for the study were low-risk kidney transplants between January 2005 and October 2009 receiving Tac-based maintenance treatment and followed-up at our center.

Indeed, long-term kidney transplant survival rates have not kept pace with the striking improvements achieved in short-term outcomes.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] A major cause of long-term allograft injury, fibrosis and functional decline, is CNI toxicity.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This study examines the safety and efficacy of converting patients with a stable renal function from Tac-based regimen to an SRL-based regimen after kidney transplantation.</p><p>SRL-based immunosuppressive therapy is thought to be less nephrotoxic and continues to be evaluated as a CNI sparing therapy. In the <italic>de novo</italic> setting, SRL therapy combined with mycophenolic acid has not provided superior outcomes or adequate protection from acute rejection.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, conversion from CNI to SRL therapy after transplantation improved short-term renal function but did not decrease allograft fibrosis.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Moreover, in conversion trials, SRL-treated patients typically experienced higher rejection rates and adverse events, further confounding the results.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we found the incidence of BPAR was 13.8% in SRL group and 10.3% in Tac group patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.5). Most of the patients in both groups experienced one rejection episode. However, in SRL group, one developed chronic antibody-mediated rejection with no response to therapeutic modalities and patient returned back to dialysis. A previous meta-analysis of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi) use in kidney transplant recipients had been shown no difference in acute rejection and superior graft function when SRL are used as CNI replacement.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In a study,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on conversion of CsA to everolimus at 4.5 months posttransplant found that the incidence of BPAR from randomization to month 36 was significantly higher in the everolimus group 13% versus 4.8% in the CsA arm, <italic>P</italic> = 0.015. On the other hand, Lebranchu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] although they noticed a similar pattern of BPAR after SRL conversion, however, two graft losses due to acute rejection were observed in the SRL group during the 1<sup>st</sup> year of the follow-up period. However, although, they found no difference in the incidence of <italic>de novo</italic> or persistent anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies between the groups; 12.3% of patients in the SRL group and 21.1% in the CsA group, they concluded that SRL may expose to the risk of graft loss due to resistant acute rejection.</p><p>Our results show that the rates of graft loss (including death with a functioning graft) were significantly higher in the SRL group, despite improved graft function in those surviving with functioning grafts. Two patients died between 1 and 3 years in the SRL group; death was due to brain tumor and cerebral stroke. Results from large registry database analyses[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] suggest that Tac/SRL- or SRL/MMF-based immunosuppression may be inferior to Tac/MMF-based immunosuppression in long-term graft survival. In symphony study,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] it was found that allograft survival differed significantly among the four groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and was highest in the low-dose Tac group (94.2%), followed by the low-dose CsA group (93.1%), the standard-dose CsA group (89.3%), and the low-dose SRL group (89.3%). In a recent large UNOS-based observational study of 139,370 kidney transplant patients, <italic>de novo</italic> use of mTORi was associated with increased allograft loss and mortality throughout 8 years of longitudinal follow-up.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The higher incidence of allograft loss may be due to the increased rate of acute rejection seen with mTORi and the known association of acute rejection with allograft loss. Interestingly, in this study, that mortality did not correlate with acute rejection suggesting a mechanism independent of effect on allograft function. This phenomenon was also observed in a prior observational investigation of Hungarian allograft recipients, in which mTORi were associated with increased mortality, but not worse allograft outcomes.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Further studies are needed to firmly establish this association and the responsible mechanism for high mortality among these patients. However, in spare the nephron study,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] they found better graft and patient survival after 2 years of follow-up of their patients and explained this for lower incidence of acute rejection (9.5% and 11.3% in MMF/SRL group and MMF/CNI group, respectively), and fewer deaths in the SRL group. Compared to our results, it may be explained by the shorter period of follow-up, the higher number of patients allocated and the multicenter nature of the study design.</p><p>Estimation of renal allograft function by calculated GFR revealed a better renal function in group SRL patients as compared to Tac patients at most time points. This finding came in accordance with what had been previously reported by Lebranchu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Weir <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that CNI-free regimens based on SRL have better renal function than CNI-based regimens. In the Spare the Nephron study,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] they found at 1 year, the mean percentage change in directly measured GFR was greater in the SRL arm (24.4 vs. 5.2%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.054), but this benefit was no longer evident at 2 years. The evidence suggests that in patients without markedly compromised kidney function or proteinuria, conversion from a CNI to mTORi may preserve GFR, but offers no definitive benefit on the hard outcomes of mortality or allograft loss.</p><p>In our study, as observed at the end of the follow-up observational period, urinary protein was higher in the SRL group. Severe proteinuria was not frequent (7.6%) but may have resulted in the reconversion to CNI in these cases. Thus, the small increase in protein excretion was considered clinically acceptable, especially in the presence of the improved GFR values in the SRL group. However, in view of indications that early low-grade proteinuria may predict subsequent graft loss,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] urinary protein excretion should be carefully monitoring during the long-term follow-up of these patients.</p><p>The decrease in blood pressure in the SRL group versus Tac controls has potentially more advantages on patient and graft survival. The avoidance of CNI with the use of SRL may allow more effective long-term blood pressure control.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The profile of adverse events reported here in the SRL group was as expected, including the effect on lipid profile, diabetes mellitus, and hematological values. Cholesterol levels requiring statin therapy were significantly higher in SRL group, as shown in the present trial. SRL has been observed to elevate blood lipids in almost all clinical trials,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the dyslipidemic effect appears to be dose-related. Hyperglycemia has been reported in more than a third of patients on SRL and Tac. CNI therapy is well-known to increase the rate of new-onset diabetes after kidney transplantation, and in few small, single-center studies have suggested that SRL may have a diabetogenic effect. In one retrospective analysis, the authors showed that SRL is associated with a similar risk of diabetes compared to Tac.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] There was a significant increased incidence of anemia and the percentage of patients receiving erythropoietin in the SRL groups. Augustine <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported a prevalence of anemia of 31% in patients on Tac-based compared with 57% on SRL-based therapy in renal transplant patients at 1 year post-transplantation.</p><p>Some limitations must be acknowledged in our study. First of all, it was a single-center study with a small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 58) and also the relatively short observation period which may lighten the sound of conclusions. The fundamental rationale for SRL conversion is the potential for improved long-term outcome, measured over decades, with respect to proteinuria, renal function, and graft survival. Second, some methodological factors should be taken into account in the interpretation of this study including statistical power which is needed to estimate the total sample size needed based on the expected outcome in each group. Moreover, we did not include protocol biopsy to assess chronic allograft damage index in our study which may have some benefits in diagnosing histopathological changes in grafts over time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our experience demonstrates that conversion to SRL from CNI-based therapy may result in better renal function and blood pressure control in renal transplant recipients without an increased risk of acute rejection but was associated with higher discontinuation rate attributable to adverse events.
