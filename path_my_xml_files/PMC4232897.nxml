The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportions of treatment responders [patients with &#x02265;&#x000a0;1-point improvement in SMF on the 5-point Clinician-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS)] and patients satisfied with their face and chin appearance on the Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS).

The study was divided into a screening period (week &#x02013;8 to baseline; visit 1), followed by a 12-week treatment period (visits 2&#x02013;5) and a 12-week efficacy and safety follow-up period (visits 6 and 7). Patients were recruited at 28 centres in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice, and all local legal and regulatory requirements were followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Men and women aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years were eligible to participate if they presented with moderate or severe SMF [grade 2 or 3 on the 5-point Clinician-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS)] and expressed dissatisfaction with the appearance of their submental area [Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS) score 0&#x02013;3] at visit 2. Patients agreed to undergo clinical evaluations and laboratory tests and to maintain stable body weight, diet and exercise practices during the study. Women of reproductive age were required not to be pregnant or lactating and to practise birth control during the study. The principal exclusion criteria were: previous intervention to treat SMF; anatomical features or previous trauma liable to interfere with SMF evaluation or result in an aesthetically unacceptable outcome after treatment; evidence of any cause of submental enlargement other than SMF; and any medical condition likely to affect safety or efficacy assessments or the patient's ability to undergo study procedures or provide informed consent. Patients with a body mass index (BMI)&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, those undergoing or considering a weight-reduction programme, and patients with a history of sensitivity to any components of the study material or topical or local anaesthetics were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were randomized (1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;:&#x000a0;1) at visit 2, after completion of baseline evaluations, through allocation of a unique randomization number using a computerized web/voice-response system. ATX-101 and placebo treatment kits had an identical appearance and carried a blinded label with a random kit number; these were assigned to patients using the computerized system.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>All randomized patients were to have at least one treatment session, with a maximum of four sessions, separated by 28&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;day intervals (visits 2&#x02013;5). Patients received up to 10&#x000a0;mL of the study drug per treatment session, and the number of sessions was dependent on the amount of remaining SMF and each patient's satisfaction with the appearance of their face and chin. Injections were administered subcutaneously directly into the pre-platysmal SMF at a volume of 0&#x000b7;2&#x000a0;mL per injection and spaced approximately 1&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;cm apart using a grid to provide even coverage. Topical anaesthesia was provided, if needed. Premature treatment discontinuation could occur owing to adverse events (AEs), early therapeutic success or at the patient's request. The treatment area was evaluated 7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;days after each treatment and concomitant medication use was reported. Patients attended two follow-up visits (visits 6 and 7) 4&#x000a0;weeks (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;days) and 12&#x000a0;weeks (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;days) after the final treatment session.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy outcome measures</title><p>Efficacy endpoints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) were evaluated at visit 7 (12&#x000a0;weeks after final treatment). There were two co-primary efficacy endpoints: the proportion of treatment responders, i.e. with a reduction in SMF of &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 point on the 5-point CR-SMFRS relative to baseline, and the proportion of patients satisfied with their appearance in association with their face and chin (i.e. with a score of &#x02265;&#x000a0;4 on the 7-point SSRS rating scale). To confirm the primary endpoint results, sensitivity analyses were conducted on the secondary parameters of change from baseline in CR-SMFRS and SSRS scores, and changes in calliper measurements of SMF thickness, by treatment session. The effect of treatment on skin laxity (Skin Laxity Rating Scale, SLRS) was evaluated, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Patient-Reported Submental Fat Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS) and Patient-Reported Submental Fat Impact Scale (PR-SMFIS). Additional patient-reported instruments were also used but outcomes are not discussed here.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Efficacy parameters and scales used in the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Efficacy outcome</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evaluator</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Method of evaluation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rating scale (range)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physician</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMF severity (submental convexity and amount of SMF)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinician-Reported SMF Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (absent) to 4 (extreme)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Satisfaction with appearance in association with the face and chin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject Self-Rating Scale (SSRS)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 6 (extremely satisfied)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Physician</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Skin laxity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Skin Laxity Rating Scale (SLRS)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (no laxity) to 4 (very lax)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perceived SMF severity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient-Reported SMF Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (absent) to 5 (very large amount)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Psychological impact of SMF appearance on feelings and perceived visual self-image</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient-Reported SMF Impact Scale (PR-SMFIS)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Objective</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMF thickness</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calliper measurement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measured continuously (mm)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SMF, submental fat.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Safety outcome measures</title><p>AEs were evaluated at each visit and approximately 7&#x000a0;days after each treatment session, and were characterized descriptively by the day on which they started and stopped, and by severity and intensity.

The null hypothesis for the treatment comparisons was that there was no difference between each dose of ATX-101 and placebo for the two co-primary efficacy endpoints. Comparisons of the two ATX-101 dose groups with placebo were made via odds ratios from binary logistic regression. An adjustment for multiplicity was performed. Because there were two co-primary endpoints, the null hypotheses for both variables had to be rejected at the same significance level (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05). This was accounted for by using the larger of the two <italic>P</italic>-values in the Bonferroni&#x02013;Holm procedure.</p><p>For the secondary endpoints, changes from baseline in CR-SMFRS and calliper scores were analysed using a mixed-models repeated-measures analysis. Changes from baseline in SSRS scores were analysed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). PR-SMFRS improvements of &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 point were analysed by binary logistic regression. Changes from baseline in SLRS scores were recorded in frequency tables and Pearson's chi-square test was applied to compare each ATX-101 group with placebo. Descriptive statistics were calculated for PR-SMFIS scores, with the change from baseline analysed by a <italic>post hoc</italic> Fisher's least-square difference test for continuous variables, only if ANOVA showed an overall treatment effect. Statistical summaries for AEs were based on treatment-emergent AEs in the safety population (all patients who received at least one treatment with study drug). The numbers of AEs and patients presenting with each AE were categorized according to association with treatment, study withdrawal, death, severity, intensity, system organ class and preferred term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Between December 2010 and January 2012, 363 patients successfully completed screening and baseline evaluations and were randomized to receive ATX-101 1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>120), ATX-101 2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>121) or placebo (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>122) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). One patient randomized to the lower ATX-101 dose did not receive treatment; therefore, 362 patients were treated (safety population). Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Overall, the majority of patients were female (76&#x000b7;5%) and white (94&#x000b7;8%), although other Fitzpatrick skin types were represented.

Significant efficacy was achieved for both ATX-101 dose groups. Secondary efficacy outcomes, including calliper measurements, demonstrated significant reductions in SMF with ATX-101 compared with placebo. No overall worsening of skin laxity was seen. ATX-101 treatment was associated with improvements in the psychological impact of SMF. Overall, the ATX-101 2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> dose showed a trend towards better efficacy outcomes compared with the 1&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> dose but it should be noted that this study was not designed to compare the two ATX-101 doses.</p><p>The efficacy measures used in this study (clinician and patient ratings) were found to be appropriate for the assessment of SMF following formal validation studies (data on file). Although a relatively simple tool that is potentially subject to investigator-dependent variability, calliper measurements demonstrated a reduction in SMF with ATX-101 compared with placebo. These results are consistent with observations from a phase II study (currently unpublished), in which the objective measurement tool was magnetic resonance imaging.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although magnetic resonance imaging would have been more precise, it is laborious and would not have added greatly to the evidence provided by the clinical efficacy scales.</p><p>Both ATX-101 doses were well tolerated. Most AEs occurred in association with the treatment area, were temporally associated with treatment, and were mild or moderate in intensity. Most AEs resolved in the interval between treatments and generally did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Although more treatment area-associated AEs occurred with ATX-101 than with placebo, and it might be expected that patients could infer that they were receiving active treatment based on AEs, the distribution of events among the ATX-101 and placebo groups suggested that the integrity of the blinding was maintained. Furthermore, patients receiving active treatment had no basis for comparison with placebo treatment, and positive treatment responses using patient outcome measures, including satisfaction with appearance of the face and chin, were recorded in all groups.</p><p>Of the most common injection-site AEs, localized pain, swelling, bruising and erythema may result partially from a response to the injections, as suggested by the relatively high frequency of these events with placebo. However, the greater number of such events, and also of numbness and induration, in the ATX-101 groups may also relate to the adipocytolytic action of DCA. Adipocytolysis leads to a mild inflammatory response and clearance of the lysed cellular material from the injection site.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, these AEs may result from a combination of both the mechanism of delivery and action of the agent. It is possible that higher doses of DCA might be associated with more severe AEs affecting nonadipose cell types.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, this would be unlikely with the concentrations of DCA used in this study.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In this study, a substantial placebo effect was observed, exceeding 30% for some outcome measures. The placebo effect is a well-known phenomenon, particularly with aesthetic treatments,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and should be taken into account when looking at case series data from other interventions for the reduction of SMF.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Perhaps unsurprisingly, the placebo response was greatest for the patient-reported outcomes (e.g. SSRS, PR-SMFRS). Nevertheless, ATX-101 treatment was associated with significantly better outcomes than placebo across the range of efficacy measures evaluated and, although the CR-SMFRS response for placebo remained fairly constant over the four treatment sessions, a consistent improvement was recorded in the active treatment groups (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>).</p><p>ATX-101 is a proprietary formulation of synthetically derived DCA and is the first injectable drug for SMF reduction to undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation. Although injectable lipolytic therapies have existed since the 1950s,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> no previous formulation has been subject to appropriate controlled clinical testing and thorough pharmaceutical development. Small-scale studies of deoxycholate with or without phosphatidylcholine for the reduction of small areas of fat have been reported previously.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Concerns were expressed about the unregulated nature of these formulations and many health authorities banned their use. In contrast, this study and three additional phase III clinical studies of ATX-101 (results to be published) will provide the first true evidence base for adipocytolytic therapy with a specific formulation of DCA alone. Given that surgical procedures, such as face-lift and liposuction,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> are invasive and not appropriate for all patients,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and that energy devices have been subject to minimal clinical study, a state-of-the-art and thoroughly tested nonsurgical alternative is warranted.</p><p>In this phase III, randomized clinical study, ATX-101 showed a favourable efficacy profile for the nonsurgical reduction of unwanted SMF and was well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments and disclosures</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the investigators who contributed to and recruited patients for this study: Joan Vandeputte (Belgium); Jean-Paul Ortonne, Bruno Halioua, Isaac Bodokh, Daniel Interligator, Hugues Cartier (France); Thomas Dirschka, Tatjana Pavicic, Ridwan Weber, George Popp, Gerhard Sattler, Diamant Thaci, Torsten Walker, Klaus Fritz, Marc Heckmann, Tanja Fischer, Andrea Graefe, Maurizio Podda (Germany); Jaume Masia Ayala, Jes&#x000fa;s Benito Ruiz, Gerardo Moreno Arias (Spain); Ross Martin, Stephanie Ogden, John Tanqueray, Shahida Ullah (United Kingdom).
