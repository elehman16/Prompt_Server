In 1987, 7.4&#x000a0;% of the adult population (aged 18&#x000a0;years and older) had a body mass index (BMI) of 30&#x000a0;kg/m2 or higher (the cut-off for obesity). In 2012, this percentage exceeded 17, and 53.7&#x000a0;% of the adult population met the definition of obesity or overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The adoption of diets high in fat and refined sugars, accompanied by a marked increase in sedentary behaviours are the primary risk factors for the explosive rise in overweigh or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, have appeared new products such as Smartphone applications and wearable device that may improve these modifiable risk factors for obesity.</p><p>Obesity is clearly associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As BMI increases, a gradual but continual increase in relative risk of mortality has been reported, with the greatest increase observed when BMI exceeds 30&#x000a0;kg/m2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There is strong evidence that weight loss in overweigh and obese individuals reduce risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Treatments for overweight and obesity obtain disparate results. In one review of 14 studies of weight-loss interventions in young adults (18&#x02013;25 years old), the authors conclude that combined interventions seem to have a beneficial effect on weight loss (&#x02212;2.96&#x000a0;kg, 95%CI &#x02212;4.4 to &#x02212;1.5&#x000a0;kg). The most significant weight reduction was obtained by combining diet, exercise and motivational strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Considering the ubiquity of Smartphone use, mobile applications (apps) that combine multiple strategies offer an attractive &#x0201c;modern&#x0201d; alternative to traditional weight-loss programs.</p><p>According to the 15th edition of &#x0201c;The Information Society in Spain&#x0201d;, published in 2015 by the foundation of Spain&#x02019;s national phone company, mobile phones are owned by almost 95.5&#x000a0;% of the world population, and by almost 120&#x000a0;% of the European population. More than 80&#x000a0;% of mobile phone users have Smartphone and more tablets than laptop computers are sold as intelligent terminals. The nascent field of mobile health (mHealth) is rapidly expanding; experts estimate that as many as 100,000 health-related apps were available in the first trimester of 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] . Many of these apps aim to help persons change behaviours to achieve weight loss by increasing physical activity or recording dietary intake. According to data from Price Waterhouse Cooper and GSMA, by 2017 the use of mHealth could save the health care budgets of European countries up to 100,000 million euros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interventions in the primary care setting have the added benefit of ongoing professional support and monitoring, which could contribute to better patient outcomes.</p><p>The hypothesis that some overweight and obese subjects do not lose weight while following a low-caloric diet because their energy intake is substantially higher than reported is based on the finding that whereas many people underreporting is greater in overweight and obese people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Overweight and obese subjects may also overestimate the energy that may therefore require less energy intake to maintain body weight than their exercise history suggests. A study found that the discrepancy between self-reported and actual calorie intake and physical activity, estimated as being as large as 47+/&#x02212;16&#x000a0;% and 51+/&#x02212;75&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another study found that consistent self-monitoring of exercise was associated with fewer difficulties with exercise and greater exercise and weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This suggests that providing patients with tools that will help to record dietary intake or physical activity more accurately could increase the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent overweight/obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study found that users of a mobile app which self-monitoring physical activity and dietary intake consumed less energy than those self-monitoring using a paper journal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An a recent systematic review found behavioural changes increased to diet monitoring (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, many of Smartphone apps are not very sophisticated and deliver a limited or dubious benefit. Therefore, the need to regulate this growing market is becoming a concern, with researchers emphasizing the need for studies that will contribute scientific evidence about the true impact of this type of apps . A limited number of intervention studies have been designed to assess the effectiveness of Smartphone applications for weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and for increase physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All of these studies had small sample sizes, none of them incorporated a wearable device, and none of them were done in a setting resembling the primary care system in Spain.</p><p>In recent months, wearable devices have taken the electronic devices market by storm. They offer processing capacity and Internet connectivity, and of particular interest to this project are the wearable knows as SmartBands that can monitor physical activity. In the first quarter of 2014, 2.7 million SmartBands were sold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The SmartBands have adopted gamification as a means to increase initiation and retention of desired behaviours. Gamification is the use of game design elements in nongame contexts, include the use of game-like rewards and incentives and sustain habits of individuals over time. A comprehensive review of gamification use in health and fitness found a lack of integrating important elements of behavioural theory form the app industry, which can potentially impact the efficacy of gamification apps to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although the use of this tactic in health and fitness mobile apps has increased, little to no in-depth inquire into its effectiveness and appropriate functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a weight loss intervention based on standard diet recommendations plus a free Smartphone application (app) and wearable device, compared to the standard evidence-based diet intervention alone (control), in primary care patients aged 18&#x000a0;years or older who are overweight or obese.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>Randomized, controlled trial with one experimental group and a control group (Participant Flowchart, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant Flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1845_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Blinding</title><p>The type of intervention makes it impossible to blind participants and health professionals to participants&#x02019; study group assignment.

The main objective of the usual diet intervention for weight loss is to change dietary paterns, rather than focus on changing specific food choices. The intervention is designed to be carried out during a 12-month period, with 15 total visits. The first visit lasts one hour and followed by 15-min monthly visits. Each visit address one item that is characteristic of a balanced diet, using educational materials specifically designed for the intervention. Use of these supporting materials helps to reeducate patients about dietary intakes as health professionals individualize the messages based on each person&#x02019;s specific dietary habits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Experimental group</title><p>The experimental group will receive the standard diet intervention for weight loss plus free Smartphone app plus a wearable device. <bold><italic>Description of the mobile app</italic></bold>: The app to be tested in the present trial has three distinct functions: (a) Self-monitoring of food intake, recorded to help determine the quantity of calories consumed each day, and physical activity, used to establish a calorie plan adapted to the profile and daily activities of each participant.

Data confidentiality will be protected under the Spanish law governing the protection of personal data (Ley org&#x000e1;nica de Protecci&#x000f3;n de Datos de Car&#x000e1;cter Personal (15/1999 13 December).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>One of the study limitations is its open design. It is impossible to mask the intervention; both patients and health professionals in the experimental and control groups will be aware that they are participating in a weight loss intervention, which could affect the success or failure of the intervention and has the potential to introduce bias. Randomization of patients to study groups will help to achieve a balance in sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics, as well as risk factor profile. Potential confounding factors will be controlled by applying the appropriate multivariate analysis. The researcher responsible for the statistical analysis will be blinded to study group assignments.</p><p>Although the study results cannot be applied to all health-related mobile apps, limiting the external validity of the study, they will likely be generalizable to apps with characteristics similar to this free app. Another possible limitation is the length of the study period. One of the great challenges to patients who have lost weight is to maintain the weight loss longer than a year. Based on the study results, however, follow-up strategies will be designed to support participants beyond the end of the study period within the framework of the universal primary care system in Catalonia.</p><p>Among the strengths of the study is that this clinical trial has the potential to provide a validated weight loss tool that could be very useful to patients accessing primary health care who want to lose weight. Very few studies to date have validated the effectiveness of weight loss apps, and none of them were done in our setting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>Corresponding author GFM led the development of this manuscript and contributed to the research design, and drafted the manuscript.
