Perception of hirsutism is by definition subjective, and women present with a wide variation in severity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Hirsutism affects 5%&#x02013;10% of unselected women, depending on the definition and ethnicity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Female hirsutism is an embarrassing condition that threatens both a woman's perception of her femininity and her self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Underlying causes of hirsutism may be congenital adrenal hyperplasia, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian and adrenal tumours, pharmacological agents, familial or it may be idiopathic.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>It is very important to determine the underlying causes. Although the most common causes are ethnic or hereditary, one must look to out any sign of androgen excess, such as, an increase in body hair, irregular menstrual cycles, acne, alopecia and seborrhoea.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Such male-pattern growth of terminal body hair usually occurs in androgen-sensitive locations, such as upper lip, chin, chest, areola, abdomen, back and femoral region.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, hypertrichosis is independent of androgen influence and is manifested, particularly by the superfluous and uniform growth of non-terminal (vellus) hairs over the body particularly in non-sexual areas.</p><p>Many temporary hair removal methods exist including shaving, tweezing, waxing, chemical depilatories and electrolysis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The need for a rapid, non-invasive method has led to the development of various light sources.</p><p>Laser hair reduction (LHR) has emerged as a popular cosmetic dermatology procedure. Several types of lasers are available for hair removal along with non-laser intense pulse light (IPL) epilators. However, optimising these devices according to the skin and hair type of the patient to be effective yet safe, is a difficult task.</p><p>Lasers emitting light in the wavelength range of 600&#x02013;1100 nm can effectively target the melanin in the entire portion of hair follicles.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Different laser systems and intense-pulsed light currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, USA, for the reduction of hair are ruby (694 nm), alexandrite (755 nm), diode (800 nm) and long pulse Nd: YAG (1064 nm) laser and IPL (515&#x02013;1200 nm) sources.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>LHR is a slow process which takes at least six to eight sittings and spacing between the sessions is done depending on the hair cycle of that area. The apparent cosmetic improvement may be related to reduction in number of hairs or a decrease in diameter or pigmentation. Tracking of these parameters over such long periods is tedious. Hence, a lot of confusion still exists regarding the optimum settings and the type of laser most beneficial for a given hair and skin type.</p><p>In spite of different laser systems available for LHR, no single system has been found to be safest and most effective in all skin types.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a high-energy, long-pulsed 1064-nm Nd: YAG Laser and IPL-755 in the treatment of hirsutism in Indian population.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>AIM</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of long-pulsed Nd: YAG laser and IPL-755 in management of idiopathic facial hirsutism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-3"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study was an open-labelled randomly allocated experimental type. A total of thirty-three cases were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were hirsutism patients presenting in the outpatient department (OPD) with age more than 18 years and those who gave consent to participate in the study.</p><p>Patients having hypertrichosis, greying of hirsute hairs, associated photo-aggravated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, keloidal tendency or taking photosensitive drugs, undergoing treatments such as chemical epilation or electrolysis or active cutaneous infections in the treatment area such as herpes labialis and bacterial folliculitis were excluded from the study.</p><p>Detailed history taking and clinical examination, hormonal and sonological evaluation was done as per relevance to the particular case. Eligible patients were randomly divided into two groups:</p><p>

</p><p>A skin patch test was performed at a comparatively less sun-exposed site 2&#x02013;3 days before the procedure to select the parameters for treatment and safety profile of a particular patient.</p><p>Patients were asked not to take up threading, bleaching, plucking, waxing or electrolysis once the treatment was start ed.; Shaving was to be avoided 2 weeks before the session; and sunscreen to be used during the study period. Photographs were taken before starting the laser sessions each time and after every session.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Procedure</title><p>The area to be treated was marked with skin marking pen and shaving was done using a cleansing gel carefully to avoid cuts. Any tattoo and mole were marked with white pencil and laser were avoided over the area. Furthermore, metallic jewellery was removed during the procedure. Patient's eyes were covered with metallic shields and protective eye goggles were worn by doctors performing the laser. Baseline parameters were determined based on patch test result as well as hair type scoring. Cooling was done with inbuilt cooling device. After each sessions patients were evaluated and the results were graded according to a 4-point scale as excellent &#x0003e;75% reduction; good, 50%&#x02013;75% reduction; fair, 25%&#x02013;50% reduction and poor, &#x0003c;25% reduction in hair density. Comparison of efficacy and safety between long-pulse Nd: YAG Laser (1064 nm) and IPL-755 nm was determined using Chi-square.</p><p>Follow-up was done at every 4&#x02013;6 weeks and dose was adjusted according to response and tolerability of the patient.
