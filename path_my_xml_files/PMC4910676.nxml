The effects in overweight individuals are unclear, and the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mycoprotein on energy intake, appetite regulation, and the metabolic phenotype in overweight and obese volunteers. In two randomised-controlled trials, fifty-five volunteers (age: 31 (95 % CI 27, 35) years), BMI: 28&#x000b7;0 (95 % CI 27&#x000b7;3, 28&#x000b7;7) kg/m<sup>2</sup>) consumed a test meal containing low (44 g), medium (88 g) or high (132 g) mycoprotein or isoenergetic chicken meals. Visual analogue scales and blood samples were collected to measure appetite, glucose, insulin, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). <italic>Ad libitum</italic> energy intake was assessed after 3 h in part A (<italic>n</italic> 36). Gastric emptying by the paracetamol method, resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were recorded in part B (<italic>n</italic> 14). Metabonomics was used to compare plasma and urine samples in response to the test meals. Mycoprotein reduced energy intake by 10 % (280 kJ (67 kcal)) compared with chicken at the high content (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;009). All mycoprotein meals reduced insulin concentrations compared with chicken (incremental AUC<sub>low</sub> (IAUC<sub>low</sub>): &#x02212;8 %, IAUC<sub>medium</sub>: &#x02212;12 %, IAUC<sub>high</sub>: &#x02212;21 %, <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;004). There was no significant difference in glucose, PYY, GLP-1, gastric emptying rate and energy expenditure. Following chicken intake, paracetamol-glucuronide was positively associated with fullness. After mycoprotein, creatinine and the deamination product of isoleucine, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-keto-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-valerate, were inversely related to fullness, whereas the ketone body, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hydroxybutyrate, was positively associated. In conclusion, mycoprotein reduces energy intake and insulin release in overweight volunteers. The mechanism does not involve changes in PYY and GLP-1. The metabonomics analysis may bring new understanding to the appetite regulatory properties of food.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mycoprotein</kwd><kwd>Energy intake</kwd><kwd>Appetite hormones</kwd><kwd>Overweight</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Gastric emptying</kwd><kwd>Metabonomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">GAA</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">guanidinoacetic acid</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">GI</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">gastrointestinal</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">GLP-1</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">glucagon-like peptide-1</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">IAUC</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">incremental AUC</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">PYY</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">peptide tyrosine-tyrosine</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">REE</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">resting energy expenditure</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">T2DM</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">type 2 diabetes mellitus</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>In the present context of the increasing worldwide prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there is a need to understand the impact of food products on appetite regulation and glycaemic control in overweight and obese people. Of the three macronutrients, protein is recognised as the most potent appetite suppressor both in rodents and in humans<sup>(</sup>

The main ingredient of Quorn&#x02122; is mycoprotein, which is the RNA-reduced biomass produced from the continuous fermentation of the filamentous fungus <italic>Fusarium venenatum</italic>. Mycoprotein, as used typically, contains 25 g of solids, including 11 g of protein and 6 g of fibre/100 g (data from Marlow Foods Ltd). The fibre content is attributed to the cell wall and is composed of 2/3 branched 1&#x02013;3 and 1&#x02013;6 <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan and 1/3 chitin, creating a fibrous chitin&#x02013;glucan matrix with low water solubility (88 % insoluble). This fibrous glucan&#x02013;chitin complex is specific to fungal mycelium and not frequently present in human food.</p><p>Owing to its relatively high protein and fibre content, mycoprotein presents an attractive food product to improve appetite regulation and postprandial glycaemic and insulin responses in overweight and obese individuals at risk of developing T2DM. Previous studies in lean individuals have found that mycoprotein reduces postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. However, this study used half of the portion of mycoprotein found in commercially available mycoprotein products. Given previous observations, there is a need to ascertain whether mycoprotein exerts a dose-dependent effect on energy intake and glycaemic control in overweight and obese individuals and to determine the mechanism through which mycoprotein may exert its action. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies investigating the effect of mycoprotein on GI hormones.</p><p>The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of low, medium, and high doses of mycoprotein on energy intake and glucose homeostasis compared with isoenergetic and protein-matched chicken meals in overweight and obese individuals. We hypothesised that mycoprotein would reduce acute energy intake in overweight and obese volunteers compared with a macronutrient-matched chicken meal in a dose-dependent manner by delaying gastric emptying and increasing the release of PYY and GLP-1.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><p>We undertook two randomised single-blinded controlled trials to investigate the impact of mycoprotein (nutritional information in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) on appetite regulation.

Part B investigated the effect of the highest content of mycoprotein used in part A compared with chicken on appetite, glucose and insulin concentrations, gastric emptying, and energy expenditure and substrate oxidation.<table-wrap id="tab1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Nutritional composition of mycoprotein</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="S0007114516001872_tab1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><col align="left" width="1*" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="2">Per 100 g of mycoprotein</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy (kJ)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">356</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy (kcal)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">85</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Available carbohydrate (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dietary fibre (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fat (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> MUFA (oleic acid) (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x000b7;3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> PUFA (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Linoleic acid (C18 : 2) (g)</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b7;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b7;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Relevant covariates, such as sex, age and BMI, were included in the initial model and removed if their effect was not significant. For time-profile variables, the baseline value was included as a covariate in order to correct for baseline differences, and correlation matrices of residuals were chosen by assessing the model by &#x02212;2 log likelihood. For each model, the distribution of the residuals was checked for normality. The homoscedasticity of the residuals was checked by plotting the observed values against the predicted values.

All spectroscopic analyses were performed on a 700 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer, operating at 300 K and equipped with a 5 mm <sup>1</sup>H(<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N) inverse cryoprobe. For each urine sample, a standard one-dimensional NMR spectrum was acquired with water peak suppression using a standard pulse sequence. For each spectrum, eight dummy transients and 128 transients were collected into 64 K data points with a spectral width of 12&#x000b7;001 parts per million. For the plasma samples, water-suppressed Carr&#x02013;Purcell&#x02013;Meiboom&#x02013;Gill spin-echo spectra were recorded. In this experiment, eight dummy transients were followed by 128 transients and collected in 64 K data points. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions. Urine samples were referenced to the trimethylsilylpropionic acid (TSP) singlet at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 0&#x000b7;0, and plasma samples were referenced to the anomeric proton of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucose at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 5&#x000b7;223. Spectra were digitised using an in-house MATLAB (version R2009b; The Mathworks, Inc.) script. To minimise baseline distortions arising from imperfect water saturation, the region containing the water resonance was excised from the spectra. Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed in MATLAB using scripts provided by Korrigan Sciences Ltd. Here, the spectroscopic profiles served as the descriptor matrix, and class membership (chicken and mycoprotein diet) was used as the response variable. Further OPLS models were constructed using volunteer metrics (fat-free mass) and outcome measures (fullness and hunger) as continuous response variables to illuminate associated metabolic variation. Correlation coefficients plots were constructed from the model outputs by back-scaling transformation to display the contributions of each metabolite to sample classification. Colour represents the significance of correlation for each metabolite to class membership. The predictive ability (Q<sup>2</sup>Y) of each model was calculated using a 7-fold cross-validation approach, and model validity was established by permutation testing (1000 permutations).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="general"><title>Volunteers</title><p>Part A of the study was completed between August 2010 and September 2011.

<sup>)</sup>, this is the first study showing that the consumption of 132 g of mycoprotein by healthy overweight and obese adults reduces energy intake by 10 % at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal compared with a macronutrient-matched meal containing chicken. Low and medium quantities of mycoprotein did not reduce energy intake, suggesting that a minimum amount of mycoprotein is needed to affect appetite. If mycoprotein was consumed regularly and its effect maintained over the long term, this 10 % reduction in energy intake may represent a significant weight loss. The present study also showed that mycoprotein reduced energy intake by a further 9 % over 24 h compared with chicken; however, a significant effect was only observed at the lower content of protein. Although we do not have a clear explanation for this observation, it is possible that the study was underpowered to look at differences in 24-h energy intake or that underestimation or poor completion of the food diaries, which are both common in overweight human volunteers, increased the error in measurement of energy intake. In line with previous findings by Burley <italic>et al.</italic>

<sup>)</sup>, no significant effects of mycoprotein consumption on appetite ratings were noted. Although the use of VAS is common in appetite studies, the sample size needed to detect significant small differences in appetite ratings after statistical correction for multiple comparisons was possibly not reached in this study.</p><p>We found that the protein content of the meal (low, medium, or high) did not have any significant effect <italic>per se</italic> on energy intake at the <italic>ad libitum</italic> meal. Although previous studies have suggested a negative dose&#x02013;response in appetite to increasing contents of protein, differences in protein content in those studies (13&#x02013;26 g in the study by Astbury <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The investigations of the mechanisms underlying the mode of action of mycoprotein were inconclusive. Part A of our study showed that mycoprotein did not induce a significant increase in GLP-1 and PYY plasma concentrations compared with the chicken meal, suggesting that the reduction in energy intake is not mediated by changes in the release of these hormones. Furthermore, although there was an increase in GLP-1 concentrations following the consumption of the test meal in our study, no postprandial increase in PYY concentrations could be detected, suggesting that the energy load of the meal was not sufficient to induce a detectable increase in PYY. Other GI hormones may have played a role in the energy intake reduction following mycoprotein intake. Further studies should, for example, investigate the role of cholecystokinin, which has been shown to be associated with gastric distension and to play a role in appetite regulation.</p><p>Using the paracetamol method, no significant differences in gastric emptying following the consumption of the mycoprotein and chicken test meals were found. The paracetamol method can be used as a proxy to estimate gastric emptying rate in solid meals, as it is a relatively inexpensive replacement to the scintigraphic, polyethylene glycol dilution and <sup>13</sup>C acetate breath test methods<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Consistent with previous studies, paracetamol was supplied to the participants in a liquid form. However, participants consumed the paracetamol drink along with their meal in our study, whereas paracetamol was given at the end of a solid meal in previous studies. Although participants were asked to keep a similar constant drinking pace during both visits, it is possible that because mycoprotein is bulkier the rate of drinking was faster than during the chicken test meal. This may be clarified by mixing paracetamol directly within the test meal in future studies. Alternatively, mycoprotein may modulate gastric distension or intestinal transit time without affecting gastric emptying, as its energy density is lower than that of chicken.</p><p>In the second part of our study, mycoprotein did not induce significant changes in energy expenditure. Matching of the test meals for protein content may explain this observation, as protein has been shown to increase energy expenditure independently of the energy content in previous studies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Changes in RER and substrate oxidation were not significant. As this area of research is relatively new, there are no studies directly investigating the effect of fibre supplementation on substrate oxidation. The amount of fibre contained in mycoprotein may not be sufficient to induce acute changes in substrate oxidation. Whether prolonged supplementation of mycoprotein could induce significant alterations in substrate oxidation over the long term is unknown, but it is unlikely that this would be the main mechanism of action of mycoprotein.</p><p>The main difference between the test meals resulted from the fibre content. The fibre contained in mycoprotein, composed of chitin and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan linked in a strong matrix, is 88 % insoluble. This suggests that the insoluble fibre may be the main active compound in mycoprotein. Chitin is generally absent from the diet of humans, and its impact in the GI tract is poorly understood. It may be resistant to digestion, as its structure is similar to that of cellulose and xylose. The largely insoluble <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan in mycoprotein is different from soluble plant-derived <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan originating from barley and oats, which have been shown to reduce energy intake, act on intestinal transit and glucose homoeostasis and modulate GI hormone release in several animal and human studies<sup>(</sup>

Although there have been few studies that have investigated the digestion of mycoprotein in the GI tract<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>, its effects on appetite regulation remain to be explored. It would be interesting to extract digested mycoprotein from the GI tract of animals and analyse its composition at regular time intervals following oral ingestion.</p><p>Our study found that mycoprotein did not induce any significant changes in glycaemic response compared with chicken, which is consistent with findings by Marks <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Although Turnbull <italic>et al</italic>. found a significant reduction in glucose concentration at 60 min following the consumption of mycoprotein compared with a soya meal, the design of their study differed considerably, because they used a liquid oral glucose tolerance test-like meal containing soya, milk and mycoprotein powder. Consistent with previous findings, our study showed that mycoprotein reduced postprandial serum insulin concentrations by 8&#x02013;21 % compared with chicken in overweight and obese individuals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, analysis of the Matsuda, Insulinogenic and Disposition Indices suggested that mycoprotein improves insulin sensitivity and reduces <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cell output without altering glucose concentrations. More robust measurements of insulin sensitivity assessment, such as the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, should be used to confirm whether mycoprotein results in the sparing of the <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-cells following a long-term intervention. Our hypothesis is that the structure of mycoprotein itself plays a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism following oral ingestion by limiting carbohydrate absorption in the intestine. Native mycoprotein paste is composed of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glucan-chitin filaments of various lengths randomly oriented in all directions and bound by a gel matrix<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In a previous study investigating the impact of the length of mycoprotein filaments, Marks found that 90g of mycoprotein containing long filaments delayed gastric emptying compared with the same quantity of mycoprotein containing short filaments<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>43</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Although no difference in gastric emptying was found in our study, it does imply that the structure and length of the filaments play a role in the digestion of mycoprotein.</p><p>To further understand the mechanism through which mycoprotein modulates appetite regulation, the urinary and plasma metabolic profiles were studied across the participants. Multivariate statistical analysis of the urinary profiles identified that 1-methylhistidine was excreted in greater amounts following consumption of chicken. This metabolite derives from the breakdown of anserine and has been previously reported as a biomarker of meat consumption. Indeed, Sjolin <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>45</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> have shown urinary 1-methylhistidine to be associated with chicken ingestion.</p><p>Following mycoprotein consumption, a greater excretion of GAA was observed compared with chicken intake. GAA is a methyl-group acceptor and the precursor for creatine; as such, it is an essential substrate for muscle energy metabolism. It can be synthesised endogenously from arginine and glycine in the liver and kidneys. Although there is lack of data on the role of GAA in humans, dietary GAA has the potential to spare dietary arginine. Recently, there is preliminary evidence that arginine may play a role in appetite regulation<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Another metabolite was excreted in greater amount following mycoprotein ingestion, although we were unable to identify it in the context of this study. In response to the mycoprotein diet, it is a possible to speculate that the ketone body <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hydroxybutyrate was found to be positively associated with fullness. This was not observed in response to the chicken diet. <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-Hydroxybutyrate has been previously linked to appetite suppression through central effects at the hypothalamus. <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-Hydroxybutyrate is normally associated with long-term fasting; in the case of this study, the volunteers were in a fed state. At present, the unique association between <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hydroxybutyrate and fullness with the mycoprotein diet remains unclear. It does raise an interesting possible explanation for the appetite suppression, which would be worthy of further study.</p><sec id="sec3-1" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate for the first time in overweight and obese volunteers that mycoprotein acutely reduces energy intake and improves glycaemic profile.
