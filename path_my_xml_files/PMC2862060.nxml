 motivation in individuals with severe mental illness and psychiatric
 professionals.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p></fn><fn><p>None.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The results given here have been presented in part at the 2008 Krakow

 illnesses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> but in
 many economically developed countries rates of unemployment among people with
 severe mental illness often exceed
 90%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
 However, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs), predominantly in North
 America, have found that supported employment using the individual placement
 and support (IPS) model can increase rates of competitive employment to
 30&#x02013;60%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
 It is less clear whether the IPS model is effective in populations with high
 rates of unemployment and relatively generous state welfare benefits for
 unemployed people with severe mental illness. Only one European study has been
 published to date investigating the IPS model in countries with diverse labour
 markets and different welfare
 systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> and in this
 study the IPS model was not effective in all countries included. We therefore
 aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the IPS model in
 the UK. Our primary hypothesis was that at 1-year follow-up a significantly
 greater percentage of individuals who received IPS would be in competitive
 employment compared with those receiving usual services. Secondary hypotheses
 were that participants allocated to IPS would be: working significantly more
 hours each week; have significantly longer job tenure; earn a significantly
 higher net income; have significantly higher job satisfaction; make
 significantly greater (net) contributions to the national economy; have a
 significantly higher quality of life in the domains of work, finance, leisure
 and social life; have more of their needs met; and have significantly improved
 self-esteem.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Study design and sample characteristics</title><p>The SWAN (Supported Work and Needs) study is a pragmatic RCT of the IPS
 model. Participants were recruited from community mental health teams in two
 boroughs of South London (ISRCTN96677673). Borough A has an average index of
 deprivation score of 21.31 (a rank average score of 125 out of 354 for the
 UK), a 6.3% unemployment rate (compared with 5.3% nationally) and incapacity
 benefit (a benefit received by people unable to work because of ill health) is
 received by 5.6% of working-age residents (compared with 7.2% nationally).
 Borough B has an average index of deprivation score of 34.95 (a rank average
 score of 19 out of 354, i.e. a high level of deprivation), a 9.5% unemployment
 rate and incapacity benefit received by 7%.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were that participants should be receiving out-patient
 or community psychiatric care from local mental health services, have severe
 mental illness (duration of illness over 2 years, global asssessment of
 functioning (GAF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
 score of 60 or less, and a diagnosis of a psychotic or chronic affective
 disorder), aged 18&#x02013;65, able to read and speak English to a high enough
 standard to give informed written consent, to have been unemployed for at
 least 3 months and want to obtain competitive employment. Participants were
 excluded if they had been referred for IPS in the previous 6 months. Mental
 health professionals were asked to identify potential participants and ask
 them if they agreed to being approached by a researcher. After participants
 were given a complete description of the study by the researcher, written
 informed consent was obtained. Ethical approval was obtained from the Joint
 Institute of Psychiatry/South London and Maudsley Research Ethics Committee
 (reference no 319/03).</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention group or the
 control group. Treatment allocation was stratified by gender and age (10-year
 bands). Randomisation with minimisation was used, performed by the Institute
 of Psychiatry Mental Health and Neuroscience Clinical Trials Unit, a unit
 independent of the study to maintain concealment. The intervention condition
 was an IPS programme integrated within community mental health teams provided
 by a well-established not-for-profit non-governmental supported employment
 agency. The intervention involved linking four experienced employment
 specialists (two for each borough) with community mental health teams. In
 addition to seeing clients, the employment specialists attended team meetings
 and multidisciplinary care planning meetings, and met with care coordinators
 whenever appropriate. They focused on rapid placement with continued follow-up
 support and sought to find employment opportunities that were consistent with
 participants&#x02019; preferences, skills and abilities. However, the
 integration of the IPS programme was not structural or managerial, reflecting
 supported employment as it is provided in the vast majority of settings in the
 UK, which is the current provision referred to by the UK government in its
 implementation of
 IPS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>The control condition (treatment as usual, TAU) consisted of existing
 psychosocial rehabilitation and day care programmes available in the local
 area. There were 33 such services in the catchment areas of the RCT; these
 were visited or telephoned and a senior manager was asked about their
 operational characteristics. Each service employed, on average, 7 vocational
 staff, had a median of 58 places available to clients (range 6&#x02013;3000) and
 79% of services received referrals from clinical teams. A range of courses
 were offered, most commonly pre-employment preparation (e.g. interview skills,
 curriculum vitae coaching and application form practise),
 computers/information technology and confidence building/motivation.</p><p>The participating community mental health teams were given presentations on
 the study with opportunities for questions and answers and written information
 on the study, and employment consultants working with the community mental
 health teams would regularly explain the study when they attended team
 meetings and when addressing individual questions and concerns. Teams were
 also regularly sent newsletters with updates on study progress and examples of
 success in obtaining employment. Written information on the study was revised
 when the study team were aware of specific issues that needed to be addressed
 (e.g. concerns about equipoise or the referral process).</p><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were assessed at baseline by the recruiting researcher and at
 12 months after randomisation by a separate researcher who was masked to
 allocation status. Each participant was given &#x000a3;20.00 for their time at
 the baseline and 1-year follow-up interview. Participants were not reimbursed
 for any contacts they had with the employment consultants.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>At baseline, participants were assessed using the Structured Clinical
 Assessment in Neuropsychiatry
 (SCAN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> to
 determine their diagnosis. Participants with a SCAN diagnosis of
 schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder or other
 psychotic disorders were categorised as having a psychotic disorder.
 Participants with a SCAN diagnosis of bipolar disorder, mania or depression
 were categorised as having a mood disorder.</p><p>At the baseline and 1-year follow-up interviews, data were collected on
 demographic information, service use and employment status over the previous
 12 months. Measures of psychosocial functioning were:</p><p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Manchester Short Assessment (MANSA) version

 </p><p>At 1-year follow-up the primary outcome measure was competitive employment
 in the previous 12 months. Open competitive employment was defined as a job
 paying at least the minimum wage, located in a mainstream socially integrated
 setting not set aside for persons with disabilities, held independently (i.e.
 was not agency owned) and the participant was in continuous employment for at
 least 30 days (with part-time employment rated pro-rata). Information on this
 and the other employment outcomes was collected by employment consultants
 whenever they saw their clients or, for clients who were not seeing employment
 consultants regularly (i.e. those in the control arm and those not engaged
 with the IPS programme), by employment consultants at 4-monthly intervals
 through the study (either face-to-face or by telephone at the person&#x02019;s
 convenience). Where this was not possible (e.g. if the client was on holiday
 or unobtainable), data were obtained from clinical staff if possible. Data
 were then compared with data collected by the researcher and any discrepancies
 were investigated by asking clients for clarification, or, if they were not
 available, checking with other sources of information. Job satisfaction was
 assessed using the Indiana Job Satisfaction
 Scale.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We calculated that a sample size of 75 in each group (150 in total) would
 be sufficient to detect a difference in employment from 10% in the TAU group
 compared with 30% in the experimental group, assuming a significance level
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 (double sided) at 80% power. Allowing for a 30% attrition
 rate, our target recruitment was 108 (216 in total) in each group. The base
 rate of 10% and the likely refusal and attrition rates were based on a study
 in Baltimore<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> and
 as discussed above are typical of many populations of people in the UK with
 schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Masking</title><p>Due to the nature of the study, it was not possible for participants or
 those administering the intervention to be masked to the participants&#x02019;
 allocation status. However, the researcher conducting the follow-up assessment
 was not told the participants&#x02019; allocation status and asked the
 participant at the beginning of follow-up interviews not to disclose the
 allocation if possible. A test of the success of masking was carried out by
 comparing the researcher&#x02019;s guessed allocation with the actual
 allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Process data</title><p>The IPS fidelity
 scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> was
 completed by a lead occupational therapist independent from the study who
 interviewed service users in the intervention arm, the IPS workers and care
 coordinators in community mental health teams, and assessed the structure of
 the services. This scale rates good IPS implementation if a score of
 66&#x02013;75 is obtained, fair IPS implementation for scores 56&#x02013;65, and a
 failure to implement IPS if a score of 55 or below is obtained (maximum rating
 is 75). During the course of the study, employment workers were required to
 record prospectively any events that occurred in relation to the client. These
 events included direct client contact and any non-client contacts (of more
 than 10 min) that were to do with the client, e.g. contact with the
 client&#x02019;s community psychiatric nurse. Employment workers were required
 to record the amount of time spent per contact, where and when the contact
 took place and the nature of the contact.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical and health economic analysis</title><p>All data were analysed using SPSS for Windows (version 15.0). The primary
 and secondary hypotheses were tested on the whole group. For comparing groups,
 <italic>t</italic>-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-tests were used to compare means and
 proportions respectively, unless the data were highly skewed, in which case
 non-parametric tests were used. Logistic and linear regression models were
 also fitted including potential confounding variables: (grouped) age, gender,
 ethnic group, educational level, symptomatology and diagnosis. All data were
 analysed in groups as randomised, whether or not receiving an intervention
 (i.e. intention-to-treat). Data were compared for those followed up with those
 not followed up, overall and by each treatment arm.</p><p>The amount of time spent by employment workers with clients was recorded
 and this was multiplied by their hourly cost. This was based on annual costs
 per employment worker of &#x000a3;40 000, a working week of 35 h and 42 weeks
 per year, and a ratio of direct to indirect client time of 0.67 (this ratio
 was not directly available from the employment services and therefore was
 based on the ratio of occupational therapist direct to indirect client
 time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> and used to
 calculate the cost of the IPS intervention). The resulting cost was &#x000a3;45
 per hour. The costs of other services were calculated by combining service
 data with appropriate unit cost
 information.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
 Total costs at follow-up were compared between the two groups using a
 regression model with the group indicator as the single independent variable.
 Confidence intervals around the cost difference were estimated using
 bootstrapping with 10 000 resamples due to the likely skewed cost
 distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Participants were recruited between November 2004 and September 2006. Of
 the 375 people referred to the study, 220 entered into the study
 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). One participant
 withdrew between the baseline assessments and randomisation leaving 219
 participants. There were no substantial differences between the two randomised
 arms on any baseline variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table
 1</xref>). Twenty-two participants were lost to follow-up at 1 year.
 There were no significant baseline differences at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 in
 sociodemographic or clinical variables between those who were and those who
 were not lost to follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table
 2</xref>), although there was some weak evidence that the BPRS and GAF
 were different (at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1), with those followed up being slightly
 less symptomatic and higher functioning.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline sociodemographic and clinical variables of participants by

 programme in the two boroughs received a good IPS rating of 67 (Borough A) and
 69 (Borough B); the IPS programme scored less well on the organisation
 dimension (specifically, integration of rehabilitation with mental health
 treatment) and, for Borough A, the services dimension (specifically, for the
 rapid search for a competitive job) compared with other dimensions. Of the 109
 patients in the intervention arm, 73 (67%) engaged with staff (i.e. had at
 least one direct contact with an employment consultant); of these individuals,
 the mean number of contacts with or on behalf of clients was 14 (s.d. =
 10).</p><p>The researchers who conducted the 1-year follow-up interviews were masked
 to allocation status, but guessed 119 correctly out of the 197 (60%) clients
 assessed compared with a hypothesised 50% (with random guesses); this is
 significant at <italic>P</italic> = 0.005 (single sample, double-sided test of a
 proportion).</p></sec><sec><title>One-year follow-up</title><p>One protocol deviation was noted in that one participant randomised to TAU
 received the intervention. Out of 219 individuals recruited, 20 (9%) reported
 having worked between baseline and the 1-year follow-up, in jobs that met the
 competitive employment criteria. Of those followed up, 7 out of 99 (7%) were
 from the control group and 13 out of 98 (13%) were from the intervention group
 (risk ratio 1.35, 95% CI 0.95&#x02013;1.93, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1) = 2.07,
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.15). Controlling for variables associated with loss to
 follow-up (BPRS and GAF) made no difference to the conclusions (<italic>P</italic> =
 0.127). Sensitivity analyses were conducted assuming the 22 participants who
 were lost to follow-up had either all worked or all not worked, but this made
 little difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.288 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.153 respectively). If
 the primary outcome had been alternatively defined (as in some other
 studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> &#x02013;
 working at least 1 day) there would still have been no significant difference
 in obtaining competitive employment: 22/197 (11%) of participants worked in a
 job for at least 1 day, 8/99 (8%) from the control group and 14/98 (14%) from
 the intervention group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.911, <italic>P</italic> = 0.167).
 When sensitivity analyses were conducted assuming the 22 participants who were
 lost to follow-up had either all worked or all not worked, this made little
 difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.296 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.170 respectively).</p><p>The median number of hours worked per week was not significantly different
 in the control group (32.5 h, interquartile range (IQR) 4&#x02013;45, range
 3&#x02013;63 for 7 jobs obtained) and the intervention group (8 h, IQR
 4&#x02013;16, range 3&#x02013;50 for 15 jobs obtained) (Mann&#x02013;Whitney
 <italic>Z</italic> = &#x02013;1.45, <italic>P</italic> = 0.15). Similarly, the length of job
 tenure (median 13 weeks, IQR 8&#x02013;15, range 4&#x02013;26 for control group;
 18 weeks, IQR 7&#x02013;30, range 4&#x02013;52 for intervention group;
 Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>Z</italic> = &#x02013;1.20, <italic>P</italic> = 0.23) and the median
 salary (&#x000a3;7.73, IQR 6.15&#x02013;14.18, range 6&#x02013;16 for control group;
 &#x000a3;6.00, IQR 5.35&#x02013;7.20, range 4.85&#x02013;30 for intervention group;
 Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>Z</italic> = 1.48, <italic>P</italic> = 0.14) were not
 significantly different in the two groups. Out of the 20 participants who had
 worked in competitive employment in the 1-year follow-up, 2 had worked in two
 different competitive employment roles. The hypothesis that the intervention
 would increase net contributions to the national economy is closely linked to
 the hypotheses regarding net earnings and hours worked. Higher earnings would
 potentially lead to increased tax revenues. However, because there was no
 significant difference in earnings there is also no significant net gain to
 the economy.</p><p>Within the intervention arm, there was a significant difference in
 employment outcome by borough: within Borough A, 1 participant (3%) obtained
 competitive employment, whereas within Borough B, 12 participants (17%)
 obtained competitive employment (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).
 At 1-year follow-up there were no adverse events for any clients.</p><p>Forty-five per cent (10 of 22) of the jobs gained at 1-year follow-up were
 elementary occupations (e.g. bar work, kitchen porter); 23% (5 of 22) of jobs
 were sales and customer service occupations; 14% (3 of 22) were administrative
 and secretarial occupations, 9% (2 of 22) were professional occupations. Other
 jobs obtained were skilled trade&#x02019;s occupation (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and
 process, plant and machine operative (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> shows there were no

 evidence of significant benefit of the IPS model in helping people with severe
 mental illness obtain competitive employment. The study context &#x02013; a
 socioeconomically deprived area with a somewhat rigid welfare benefits system,
 and an intervention provided by an external agency &#x02013; may have made
 successful implementation of the IPS model more challenging. Although in this
 sample the IPS model achieved higher rates of competitive employment compared
 with standard services, this was not significant, and it is striking that in
 both arms the rates of competitive employment were very low (considerably
 lower than the rates reported for control groups in other studies). This
 suggests that even with a larger sample size that may have allowed us to
 detect a significant difference between the intervention arm and TAU, a very
 large number of people would need to receive the intervention in order to
 achieve relatively low rates of competitive employment.</p><p>Although we did not find evidence that IPS was effective in this study, we
 did not find the intervention arm to be significantly more expensive than the
 control arm; in fact, the control group spent more days in hospital and
 therefore was significantly more expensive (although this is as a result of a
 small number of outliers and has therefore skewed the results). This may be a
 chance finding or may reflect the supportive nature of the intervention, which
 may prevent in-patient admissions.</p><p>Successful effective implementation of IPS may be context-dependent, and it
 may be difficult to achieve even moderate rates of competitive employment in
 some settings. Our results contrast markedly with previous results reported in
 RCTs of the IPS model and there are a number of possible explanations for our
 findings. First, the IPS model may be less helpful in non-USA settings &#x02013;
 a recent review of RCTs of supported employment found that two of the three
 studies with the lowest employment rates were non-US
 studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
 although some non-US studies have found IPS to be effective (e.g. Latimer
 <italic>et al</italic>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
 These findings may be because of the different nature of the labour market;
 the lack of employer incentives in employing individuals with severe mental
 illness outside the USA; payment for healthcare in the USA, which may increase
 the pressure to find work in US settings; and the differences in welfare
 benefit systems found in different countries &#x02013; Burns <italic>et
 al</italic>&#x02019;s EQOLISE
 study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> found that
 the degree of economic disincentives for working across several countries
 predicted the success of IPS programmes. They also reported considerable
 recruitment difficulties, despite carrying out the study in a relatively more
 affluent area of London (Richmond) that is likely to have more entry-level
 jobs; this suggests that some of these disincentives existed at the London
 site in their study. However, whereas local unemployment rates do predict
 vocational outcomes for people with severe mental
 illness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> there is
 evidence from the USA that even in areas with high unemployment, people who
 receive IPS have superior outcomes to those in the control
 condition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> so
 local unemployment rates are unlikely to be the main reason for our
 results.</p><p>Second, the same
 review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> found
 lower employment rates in a trial that did not require clients to have a goal
 of competitive
 employment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
 Whereas our eligibility criteria included individuals only if they wanted to
 obtain competitive employment we did not test participants&#x02019; motivation
 or restrict access to the trial to people with high levels of motivation.
 However, the lack of engagement with employment consultants that occurred in a
 quarter of the participants suggests that participants may have been less
 motivated compared with those in other trials. Recent studies have suggested
 that the most robust predictors of work outcomes include recent employment
 history, motivation and
 self-efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 Ethnographic research suggests that people who say they would like to work can
 be categorised as &#x02018;active job-seekers and passive job-seekers&#x02019;,
 and the latter make little progress in obtaining a
 job.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> We may
 therefore have demonstrated greater effectiveness of the intervention if we
 had selected only participants who were &#x02018;active job-seekers&#x02019;; 25%
 of participants obtained employment in the UK Sesami study, where participants
 were self-selected and had already engaged with supported employment
 programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
 Indeed, some of the American trials have held two participant consent
 meetings, to screen out those who are less highly motivated to participate,
 whereas we held one consent meeting only. These findings suggest that IPS
 programmes should routinely include tests of motivation before entry into the
 programme.</p><p>Third, the IPS programme was not structurally or managerially integrated
 with community mental health services and these may be important components
 that determine the effectiveness of IPS. Previous research has found that the
 degree to which integration of IPS with mental health services occurs predicts
 success.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> It may
 therefore be relevant that the borough with the higher fidelity rating (i.e.
 where IPS was more successfully implemented, although still without structural
 or managerial integration) had better employment rates than the other borough.
 We have not been able to find many studies that report data on the number of
 contacts between IPS staff and clients to compare with our other process data,
 but the two studies (of 11 RCTs included in a recent
 review)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> with such
 data report higher numbers of contacts, which also suggests IPS implementation
 may not have been optimal. Other aspects of IPS implementation, which are not
 captured by the IPS fidelity scale, such as the nature of the relationship
 between the IPS worker and the client (which was an independent predictor of
 outcome in the EQOLISE
 study)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> may also
 explain the poorer outcomes found in this study. A recently developed modified
 IPS fidelity scale (IPS+) also includes rating essential processes such as
 consumer choice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 and the IPS fidelity rating carried out in this study may have been lower if
 the IPS+ had been used.</p><p>Fourth, the relatively high proportion of participants from ethnic groups
 other than White (62%) could also limit the success of IPS in the UK, as
 people from other ethnic groups are more likely to be unemployed in the
 UK.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> We also used
 an inclusion criteria of a maximum level of functioning of 60 (as measured by
 the GAF scale) in order to examine the effectiveness of IPS in people with
 severe mental illness. However, this means that our study population may have
 been more impaired than those recruited in other studies. In addition,
 qualitative research reported
 elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> found
 that the clinicians involved in this RCT had idiosyncratic interpretations of
 the eligibility criteria used for the trial (e.g. some staff would not refer
 individuals with positive symptoms to the study team even though this was not
 an exclusion criterion). This may have led to motivated potential participants
 not being referred and entering the trial, as staff wished to avoid the
 &#x02018;stress&#x02019; of job-seeking in case this led to relapse. Finally,
 attitudes towards employing people with severe mental illness may differ in
 different contexts; there is evidence that experienced and anticipated
 discrimination do vary across
 countries,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> but
 there are no current data on international differences in discrimination for
 employment.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of this study include the largest sample size for an RCT of IPS
 in the UK, the comparatively diverse group of participants and high levels of
 retention at follow-up. The limitations include the pragmatic nature of this
 trial in a &#x02018;real world&#x02019; setting in a socially deprived inner-city
 catchment area where most people with severe mental illness do not obtain
 employment, and as is typical in the UK, the IPS programme was provided by an
 external supported employment agency. Such well-established but financially
 insecure non-governmental agencies may have less IPS-focused staff than new
 staff employed to set up IPS programmes (as in previous RCTs) where the
 enthusiasm and commitment of staff is likely to be particularly high. Despite
 the high IPS fidelity rating, the separation of the supported employment
 agency from mental health services may also have led to differences in the
 intervention received by participants in this study compared with that
 delivered in more fully integrated models of care.</p><p>Other studies have not usually reported on rates of engagement with IPS so
 it is difficult to compare data but the failure to engage all participants may
 reflect an individual&#x02019;s lack of motivation, severity of illness or staff
 attitudes. Mental health professionals involved had low expectations of their
 clients&#x02019; ability to obtain competitive employment, as reported
 elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 The UK site of the only European RCT of IPS also found recruitment difficult
 and slow,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
 suggesting these factors are not unique to our study. There is evidence from
 other UK studies that mental health professionals do not focus on vocational
 needs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> and may
 actually advise people not to
 work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></p><p>There was evidence for researchers guessing allocation arm but as the
 primary outcome was derived from administrative methods in addition to
 participant and healthcare professional recall this is unlikely to affect the
 main findings. The methods to calculate patient costs relied on recall of
 service utilisation. There may be some concerns about recall accuracy but this
 is an accepted method (especially in the absence of databases designed to
 measure service use for insurance systems) and previous studies have shown the
 method to be
 acceptable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>This study therefore suggests that implementing IPS in the context studied
 here can be challenging. Even in the studies carried out in North America, IPS
 is successful in obtaining employment for only around 50% of people with
 serious mental illness in the total population of people with disablility.
 Thus it is not clear that IPS alone can overcome an individual&#x02019;s
 reluctance to join the workforce, deficits in social skills and neurocognitive
 impairments that militate against enduring
 employment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> and
 research into additional interventions such as motivational interviewing,
 cognitive interventions and benefits
 counselling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> may
 help identify further ways of helping people with severe mental illness into
 work. We conclude from our study that IPS will not be the only intervention
 necessary to improve social inclusion for people with severe mental illness.
 Alternative or additional interventions such as motivational interviewing
 and/or cognitive remediation may be needed to help obtain work; for those who
 do not obtain work, other measures will be necessary to promote social
 inclusion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the <funding-source>Wellcome
