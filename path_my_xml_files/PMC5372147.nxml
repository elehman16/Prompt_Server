Early intervention units applying the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) for toddlers and young children with ASD have been created in France and Belgium to improve this situation. It is essential to evaluate this intervention for the political decision-making process regarding ASD interventions in European French-speaking countries. We will evaluate the effectiveness of 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM intervention on the cognitive level of children with ASD, over a 2-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will be a multicentre, randomised controlled trial, using a two-stage Zelen design. Children aged 15&#x02013;36&#x02005;months, diagnosed with ASD and with a developmental quotient (DQ) of 30 or above on the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) will be included. We will use a stratified minimisation randomisation at a ratio 1:2 in favour of the control group. The sample size required is 180 children (120 in the control and 60 in the intervention group). The experimental group will receive 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM by trained therapists 10&#x02005;hours per week in the centre and 2&#x02005;hours in the toddlers' natural environment (alternatively by the therapist and the parent). The control group will receive care available in the community. The primary outcome will be the change in cognitive level measured with the DQ of the MSEL scored at 2&#x02005;years. Secondary outcomes will include change in autism symptoms, behavioural adaptation, communicative and productive language level, sensory profile and parents' quality of life. The primary analysis will use the intention-to-treat principle.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Overall ASD prevalence is about 0.7&#x02013;1%.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The prognosis involves individuals, families and society.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Early intervention for ASD in European countries is heterogeneous and poorly evaluated to date.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In French-speaking European countries, most children and their families have access to a public consultation centre specialised in autism. Families and children have regular consultations with a public psychologist or child and adolescent psychiatrist, but meeting schedules vary greatly (weekly, monthly or once a quarter). Moreover, children can also have speech and language therapy and/or occupational therapy and/or individual or group psychotherapy. Occupational therapy and individual or group psychotherapy are frequently based on psychoanalytic or psychodynamic traditions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Additional interventions may include behavioural therapies or the principles of Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEAACH).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Group psychotherapy is a relationship-based intervention in small groups (three to four children for two adults), generally conducted in sessions of 1&#x02005;hr 30&#x02005;min, twice a week. Of all interventions, speech and language therapies are those most frequently reported.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These therapies can vary in frequency (30&#x02005;min per session and up to four times per week). All these different treatments can be delivered in public or private centres. Most are refunded by social national funds and mandatory health insurance.</p><p>With regards to schooling, children have access to regular preschool with an optional special needs assistant or they may attend special preschools for children with more severe disabilities. In France, the majority of children with ASD below the age of four have &#x0003c;4&#x02005;hours interventions per week and go to preschool with a special needs assistant. Educational professionals are connected with healthcare professionals.</p><p>An early comprehensive, intensive, behavioural intervention may improve the children's developmental trajectory.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Among the various early interventions, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) has the advantage of having been developed for young non-verbal children with ASD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The ESDM is a comprehensive developmental and behavioural intervention aiming to promote optimal social interactions between the child and their environment to enable the child to learn from their environment. It integrates applied behaviour analysis with developmental and relationship-based approaches. The ESDM involves a therapist who individually interacts with the child; parents or other childcare professionals (eg, nursery/preschool) can be taught ESDM techniques to use them in daily life and thereby improving generalisation of the children's skills. ESDM delivered at home 20&#x02005;hours per week has demonstrated significant gains in the cognitive level of toddlers.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The ESDM methodology is precisely detailed in a manual, including a fidelity rating scale, and rigorous training.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Since 2011, early intervention units applying the ESDM for toddlers and young children with ASD have been created in France and Belgium to improve early intervention in French-speaking countries. In these intervention units, 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM intervention is provided through public funding. The effectiveness of 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM has yet to be demonstrated.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is, therefore, essential to evaluate this in a population of young children with ASD in order to provide data for the political decision-making process regarding ASD interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main objective is to evaluate effectiveness of 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM on the cognitive level in children aged 15&#x02013;36&#x02005;months with ASD. Cognitive level will be assessed through the developmental quotient (DQ) of the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL). The secondary objective is to measure the effectiveness on autism symptoms, behavioural adaptation, communicative and productive language levels and sensory profiles.

Additional covariates can be included if they are significant at 0.05 level according to the likelihood ratio test or if they alter the coefficient of the intervention effect &#x0003e;10%, when removed from the analysis. All models will be performed with the SAS MIXED procedure.</p><p>Model assumptions will be verified according to residual analysis. If most of the assumptions are not met, other alternatives such as transformation for DQ score or generalised linear mixed model will be examined.</p><p>For the secondary outcomes, change in other scores from baseline to 24&#x02005;months after randomisation will be analysed in the same way as the primary outcome.</p><p>All tests will be two sided and carried out at the 5% level of significance. Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) by the centre for clinical research of the teaching hospital of Lyon (Hospices Civils de Lyon, France).</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Organisation</title><p>The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will be responsible for overseeing the progress of the trial and will meet at regular intervals.

More specifically, in the two-stage Zelen design, all parents of eligible children consent to participate in a longitudinal observational study, and second, children are randomly allocated to the intervention group. Only the parents of these children are informed about the intervention, and give their written consent for it. This design presents some significant advantages. First, it should avoid a strong feeling of disappointment among parents, and reduce the risk of study withdrawal if their child is not randomised to the intervention group, as 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM is highly desired by families<italic>.</italic><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Thus, it may promote participation and limit withdrawal of consent.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Furthermore, the use of the Zelen design will minimise the bias typically encountered in traditionally designed randomised clinical trials where participant expectations may influence study outcomes, that is, parents' expectation for their child and their participation in the behavioural intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>An effectiveness study</title><p>As the aim of this study is to evaluate the 12&#x02005;hours per week ESDM strategy, compared with the care available in the community within a broad, heterogeneous and representative population, we will conduct an effectiveness study.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The control group of this study will receive heterogeneous interventions available in the community with different intensity and practices.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In the intervention group, we will notify to what extent the participants are compliant with the ESDM intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The outcome measures</title><p>Because the needs of children with ASD are complex, a diversity of outcome measurement tools is used to collect evidence about the child's progress.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Their cognitive abilities play a central role in the manifestation of core and associated symptoms in ASD.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The MSEL is commonly used as a measure of cognitive and language skills in ASD.
