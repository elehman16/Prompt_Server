It was of interest to complement the existing real-life evidence with data from a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trials Identifier</title><p>NCT01758380.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This multiregional, double-blind study randomized 557 patients with T2DM (mean glycated hemoglobin [HbA<sub>1c</sub>], 6.9%), previously treated with metformin and any sulfonylurea to receive either vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or gliclazide plus metformin. The study included four office visits (three pre-Ramadan) and multiple telephone contacts, as well as Ramadan-focused advice. Hypoglycemic events were assessed during Ramadan; HbA<sub>1c</sub> and weight were analyzed before and after Ramadan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of patients reporting confirmed (&#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L and/or severe) hypoglycemic events during Ramadan was 3.0% with vildagliptin and 7.0% with gliclazide (<italic>P</italic>=0.039; one-sided test), and this was 6.0% and 8.7%, respectively, for any hypoglycemic events (<italic>P</italic>=0.173). The adjusted mean change pre- to post-Ramadan in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 0.05%&#x000b1;0.04% with vildagliptin and &#x02212;0.03%&#x000b1;0.04% with gliclazide, from baselines of 6.84% and 6.79%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.165). In both groups, the adjusted mean decrease in weight was &#x02212;1.1&#x000b1;0.2 kg (<italic>P</italic>=0.987). Overall safety was similar between the treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In line with the results from previous observational studies, vildagliptin was shown in this interventional study to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment in patients with T2DM fasting during Ramadan, with a consistently low incidence of hypoglycemia across studies, accompanied by good glycemic and weight control. In contrast, gliclazide showed a lower incidence of hypoglycemia in the present interventional than the previous observational studies. This is suggested to be linked to the specific circumstances of this study, including frequent patient&#x02013;physician contacts, Ramadan-focused advice, a recent switch in treatment, and very well-controlled patients, which is different from what is often seen in real life.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dipeptidyl peptidase 4</kwd><kwd>fasting</kwd><kwd>incretin</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>hypoglycemia</kwd><kwd>Ramadan</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin increases the sensitivity of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; cells to glucose, resulting in glucose-dependent secretion of insulin and glucagon, which underlies its improvement of glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as well as its low risk of causing hypoglycemia.<xref rid="b1-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Preservation of glucagon counter-regulation to hypoglycemia has been specifically shown for vildagliptin in patients with T2Dm<sup>2</sup>,<xref rid="b3-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and type 1 diabetes<xref rid="b4-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is likely a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-mediated effect.<xref rid="b5-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The corresponding clinical benefit is particularly promising for patients exposed to a higher risk for hypoglycemia, including elderly patients with T2DM<xref rid="b6-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and patients with T2DM undergoing prolonged fasting, such as during the holy month of Ramadan.</p><p>Ramadan involves major changes in dietary habits, in particular, a complete abstinence from food and fluid intake from dawn to sunset.

Furthermore, in the large (N&#x0003e;1300) observational Ramadan study, VIRTUE (VildagliptIn expeRience compared wiTh sulphonylUreas obsErved during Ramadan), conducted across 10 countries in the Middle East and Asia, significantly fewer patients reported hypoglycemic events (HEs) with vildagliptin compared with SUs (5.4% versus 19.8%).<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The incidence of hypoglycemia was also lower with vildagliptin when compared with each individual SU, including gliclazide (19.2%).

Given that the two trial settings have different strengths and weaknesses, it was of interest to complement the existing evidence for vildagliptin with data from an interventional study. The present trial, STudy Evaluating vildAgliptin compareD to gliclazide in patients with type 2 diabetes FASTing during Ramadan (STEADFAST), was therefore undertaken across countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia and, to our knowledge, represents the first randomized, double-blind study with a DPP-4 inhibitor in patients with T2DM fasting during Ramadan. Beyond its randomized controlled, double-blind nature, the study had additional important design features, in that the protocol included multiple patient&#x02013;physician contacts before and during the Ramadan fasting period, stipulated to provide Ramadan-focused advice, which plays an important role in the safe management of T2DM during Ramadan fasting,<xref rid="b15-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and required patients to be switched from their previous dual SU and metformin therapy to the study treatments (vildagliptin or gliclazide plus metformin).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and patient population</title><p>STEADFAST was a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group interventional clinical trial conducted at 69 sites in 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.</p><p>The key inclusion criteria for this study included age 18 years or older, body mass index 22&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.5% or lower, T2DM treated with metformin (&#x02265;1,500 mg daily) plus any SU (for &#x02265;12 weeks and, for SU, also &#x02264;3 years) and the intention to fast during Ramadan 2013. Patients were excluded if they had an acute metabolic condition (such as ketoacidosis), a current diagnosis of congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), other significant cardiovascular history within 6 months, acute or chronic liver disease or abnormal liver tests (alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase more than three times the upper limit of normal, or bilirubin [total] more than two times the upper limit of normal), or clinically significant renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, &#x0003c;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>After an up-to-4-week screening period, eligible patients were randomized using interactive response technology in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vildagliptin or gliclazide in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion, in addition to continuing their open-label metformin therapy (at 1,500&#x02013;2,500 mg daily). After the treatment switch from their previous SU therapy, vildagliptin was administered at 50 mg twice daily (bid), and gliclazide was to be given at an equivalent dose to previous SU in multiples of 80 mg, with the final dose decision being at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion.</p><p>In addition to the screening (V1) and randomization (V2) visits, the study required a pre-Ramadan visit (V3; within 4 weeks before the start of Ramadan, often occurring close to the start of Ramadan) and an end-of-study visit (V4; within 4 weeks after the end of Ramadan). In addition to the four office visits (3 before Ramadan and 1 after Ramadan), the study protocol required multiple telephone contacts (at least one between V2 and V3 and weekly starting from 1 week before Ramadan to the end of Ramadan). The protocol further stipulated that individualized Ramadan-focused advice was to be given to each patient at the pre-Ramadan visit (V3). This was to follow international and/or local guidelines in a personalized manner, rather than in a formal, standardized educational program; in this regard, the protocol specifically recommended inclusion of the importance of individualizing treatment/treatment adjustments, regularly monitoring blood glucose levels, and tailoring nutritional advice.</p><p>The overall treatment duration consisted of an 8-week or longer pre-Ramadan stabilization period, the 4-week Ramadan period, and a post-Ramadan period of 4 or fewer weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study assessments</title><p>The primary study objective was to assess the proportion of patients with at least one HE during the Ramadan fasting period in patients treated with vildagliptin or gliclazide plus metformin dual therapy.

The mean daily gliclazide doses were 122 mg at randomization (V2), 130 mg pre-Ramadan (as recommended by the investigator at V3), and 129 mg post-Ramadan.

Vildagliptin was also associated with good treatment adherence, as well as a small decrease in body weight (&#x02212;1.1 kg), and the study did not identify any safety signals or unforeseen risks in vildagliptin-treated patients with T2DM fasting during Ramadan. Importantly, the results from this randomized, double-blind study for vildagliptin are consistent with the findings from the previous observational studies and, thus, can predict the effectiveness observed under normal therapeutic conditions. For example, the large VIRTUE observational study reported that 5.4% of patients treated with vildagliptin experienced any HEs (with or without confirmation) and 2.7% reported confirmed (&#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L) hypoglycemia during the Ramadan fasting period,<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which is very similar to the results of the present study.</p><p>Under the conditions of the present study, including multiple patient&#x02013;physician contacts and protocol-stipulated Ramadan-focused advice, as further discussed here, gliclazide in combination with metformin also showed a low incidence of hypoglycemia. Although numerically still higher than with vildagliptin, in particular when assessing confirmed events, the difference between the two treatments did not reach statistical significance. Notably, in contrast to the findings with vildagliptin, gliclazide showed a markedly lower incidence of HEs in the present randomized, double-blind trial setting (8.7% for any HEs and 7.0% for confirmed HEs) than previously observed in several nonrandomized, observational studies comparing the two treatments.<xref rid="b13-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For example, in the above-mentioned VIRTUE study, 19.8% of patients treated with any SU and 19.2% of patients treated with gliclazide reported HEs.<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Of the events with SUs, 12.9% were confirmed.</p><p>Although it needs to be recognized that gliclazide is among the SUs with low rates of hypoglycemia and was used at an intermediate, rather than maximum, dose in the present study, the low hypoglycemia rate nevertheless merits comment, in particular, in view of the very low HbA<sub>1c</sub> of the recruited patients (mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7%, lower than in any of the previous studies). T2DM, as such, is associated with impaired glucagon counter-regulation,<xref rid="b17-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and SUs have previously been shown to significantly impair this glucagon response in patients with T2DM.<xref rid="b18-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At the same time, insulin secretion is stimulated in a glucose-independent way. Thus, hypoglycemia remains a considerable risk, especially at low levels of glycemia.</p><p>It is therefore of interest to further consider the effect of the interventional nature of the present study versus the naturalistic setting of the previous observational trials. First, special caution may have been applied in selecting patients enrolled in the present study, potentially favoring individuals who were very well-controlled and who have demonstrated that they can avoid HEs with an SU at their low level of glycemia. This may have played a more important role for physicians, given the randomized, double-blind nature of the study, which included treatment switches in both treatment group at randomization, compared with an observational study setting, in which the regular treatment of the patients is continued. Of note, the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of the patients entering the present study (6.9%; 76% of patients with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264;7.5%) was considerably lower than that often seen in clinical practice in patients treated with an SU plus metformin, both when used in a population fasting during Ramadan<xref rid="b13-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or in the general T2DM population.<xref rid="b20-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Second, the switch in SU treatment to gliclazide a few weeks pre-Ramadan and the frequent contacts with the patients provided the physicians with the opportunity to prescribe and tailor the SU dose according to the patients&#x02019; needs. It is important, in this regard, to keep in mind that in addition to the randomized, double-blind nature of the study, the STEADFAST trial had several important additional design features that may have contributed to the observed outcome.</p><p>The protocol required multiple patient&#x02013;physician contacts, including three pre-Ramadan visits, with the third visit mostly being very close to Ramadan, as well as weekly telephone contacts starting 1 week before the start of Ramadan until the end of Ramadan. In addition, the patients in the study were distributed over a large number of sites/physicians. Finally, the protocol stipulated that individualized Ramadan-focused advice was to be given to each patient, in line with international and/or local guidelines. Thus, the interventional clinical trial setting, together with the specific protocol features, have created circumstances quite different from what is often seen in clinical practice or what has been reported in the previous observational Ramadan studies.<xref rid="b13-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In particular, the study protocol requirements likely resulted in considerably more time spent between the physician/site personnel and the patient in the pre-Ramadan and Ramadan periods than would routinely occur under real-life conditions. This ensured an unusually well-controlled and educated population in which patients were properly advised regarding the risks and behaviors during Ramadan, as well as optimal management of gliclazide use. Of note, Ramadan-focused education has previously been shown to markedly reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM treated mainly with gliclazide, either as monotherapy or combination therapy.<xref rid="b15-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Bravis et al reported a nearly 50% reduction in the hypoglycemic event rate from pre-Ramadan to Ramadan, despite fasting, in a group participating in a Ramadan-focused diabetes education program, whereas the control group experienced a fourfold increase.<xref rid="b15-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Of interest, lower incidences of hypoglycemia with gliclazide than seen in the observational Ramadan studies have also been observed in two randomized, open-label studies comparing sitagliptin and SUs, including gliclazide.<xref rid="b21-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Thus, the particular attention and education provided within the interventional trial setting of the STEADFAST study, a situation rather different from what can often be achieved in clinical practice, may have significantly contributed to the observed low risk of hypoglycemia with gliclazide in the study. On the basis of its mechanism of action,<xref rid="b1-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> a similar difference between the trial situation and real life, as observed for gliclazide, would not be expected for vildagliptin and has not been seen.</p><p>Glycemic control, assessed as changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, remained stable pre- to post-Ramadan with both treatments (0.05% with vildagliptin plus metformin versus &#x02212;0.03% with gliclazide plus metformin), indicating that similar efficacy can be achieved during the Ramadan fasting period with vildagliptin and gliclazide. There was also no change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with vildagliptin, from randomization to the end of the study (&#x02212;0.01%). Thus, patients in the vildagliptin group, who were all to be switched from an SU to vildagliptin at study entry, did not lose the glycemic control achieved with their previous SU treatment.</p><p>In both treatment groups, a small decrease in body weight from pre-Ramadan to post-Ramadan of 1.1 kg was observed. A similar decrease in body weight in patients with low (&#x0003c;7%) baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> has previously been reported for vildagliptin in a non-Ramadan setting.<xref rid="b23-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although gliclazide use is often associated with an increase in body weight,<xref rid="b24-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> it is of interest that in the previously discussed study by Bravis et al, patients mainly treated with gliclazide who were participating in a Ramadan-focused diabetes education program showed a small weight loss during Ramadan (&#x02212;0.7 kg), similar to what has been seen in the present study; in contrast, the control group not participating in the program reported a weight increase of the same magnitude.<xref rid="b15-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Taken together, this randomized controlled, double-blind study with a DPP-4 inhibitor in Ramadan showed that patients with T2DM can safely and effectively fast during Ramadan. For vildagliptin, the low risk for hypoglycemia predicted from its mechanism of action was consistently seen between the present interventional and previous observational studies, with comparable efficacy to gliclazide. In contrast to previous observational studies, the reported difference in hypoglycemia between vildagliptin and gliclazide was smaller and did not reach statistical significance. The results suggest that the lower hypoglycemia rate for gliclazide seen in the present study may be linked to the special conditions of the STEADFAST study, in which the particular attention to each patient, Ramadan-focused advice, the recent switch in treatment, as well as the patients&#x02019; very good glycemic control have created a setting that is often not reflected in real life, as seen, for example, from the results of the VIRTUE study.<xref rid="b14-vhrm-10-319" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.
