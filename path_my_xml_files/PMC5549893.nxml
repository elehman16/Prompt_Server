Patients initially randomly assigned to everolimus continued on the same dose; those who were receiving placebo crossed over to everolimus 10 mg/day. Dose modifications were based on tolerability. The primary end point was angiomyolipoma response rate, defined as a &#x02265;50% reduction from baseline in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomas in the absence of new target angiomyolipomas, kidney volume increase of &#x0003e;20% from nadir, and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding grade &#x02265;2. The key secondary end point was safety.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 112 patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of everolimus, 58% (95% CI, 48.3% to 67.3%) achieved angiomyolipoma response. Almost all patients (97%) experienced reduction in renal lesion volumes at some point during the study period. Median duration of everolimus exposure was 46.9 months. Sixteen (14.3%) patients experienced angiomyolipoma progression at some point in the study. No angiomyolipoma-related bleeding or nephrectomies were reported. One patient on everolimus underwent embolization for worsening right flank pain. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma lesion response was achieved in 48% of patients and skin lesion response in 68% of patients. The most common adverse events suspected to be treatment-related were stomatitis (42%), hypercholesterolemia (30.4%), acne (25.9%), aphthous stomatitis and nasopharyngitis (each 21.4%). Ten (8.9%) patients withdrew because of an adverse event. Renal function remained stable, and the frequency of emergent adverse events generally decreased over time.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Everolimus treatment remained safe and effective over approximately 4 years.

In the brain, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) develop in up to 20% of patients and their growth can potentially lead to ventricular obstruction, acute hydrocephalus, and death [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Skin lesions of various types including hypopigemented macules, ungual fibromas, and facial angiofibromas are the most readily visible TSC manifestation with more than 90% of patients possessing one or more lesions [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Angiomyolipomas are the most common renal lesions associated with TSC, occurring in up to 80% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Angiomyolipomas usually manifest as multifocal, bilateral, asymptomatic disease, but as the lesions exceed 3 to 4 cm, they may become symptomatic [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and carry an increased risk for aneurysms that can lead to hemorrhage [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Renal angiomyolipomas associated with TSC or sporadic LAM (sLAM) exhibit upregulated activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) resulting from mutations in either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> genes [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The TSC consensus guidelines recommend mTOR inhibitors as first-line therapy for asymptomatic growing angiomyolipomas measuring &#x0003e;3 cm in diameter, whereas selective embolization and kidney-sparing resection are acceptable second-line therapies [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The EXIST-2 (EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous sclerosis complex) study demonstrated superiority of everolimus over placebo in angiomyolipoma response rate, time to angiomyolipoma progression, and skin lesion response rate in patients with angiomyolipoma associated with either TSC or sLAM [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Initial response required confirmation by second MRI. All MRI scans were analyzed in a central institute by independent radiologists. Additional end points included response duration, time to angiomyolipoma response and progression, proportion of patients with &#x02265;30% reduction in angiomyolipoma volume, proportion of patients with angiomyolipoma-related surgery, skin lesion response rate (&#x02265;50% improvement on skin lesions, based on Physicians Global Assessment), SEGA response rate (&#x02265;50% reduction in sum volume of target SEGA lesions in the absence of new target SEGA lesion with no worsening of nontarget SEGA lesions and no new or worsening hydrocephalus). Pulmonary function tests were monitored in patients with LAM.

AEs were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Serious AEs were defined as those that were fatal or life-threatening, resulted in persistent or signifnicant disability/incapacity, constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Clinically notable AEs, defined as those AEs eliciting specific clinical interest in connection with everolimus, were also reported. Renal function was assessed using glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline data and efficacy variables. The best percentage change from baseline at any time in the sum volume of target angiomyolipomas was represented by a waterfall plot. A piecewise linear mixed model with repeated measurements was used to link the post-baseline sum volume of angiomyolipoma lesions to the duration on treatment. The model included the sum volume of angiomyolipoma lesions at baseline as a covariate and considered two periods of time: the period in the first 3 months, and the period beyond the first 3 months. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for median duration of angiomyolipoma response. Summary statistics determined median time to angiomyolipoma response and progression, with statistics given as point estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI). Exact 95% CIs for angiomyolipoma, skin lesion, and SEGA responses were obtained from the Clopper-Pearson method. For median time to angiomyolipoma, skin lesion, and SEGA responses, 95% confidence interval were calculated with the LIFETEST procedure using the method of Brookmeyer &#x00026; Crowley, 1982 [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

One patient receiving everolimus for 1.5 years underwent embolization after pain worsened in the right flank (progressive disease). Another patient underwent elective left partial nephrectomy following everolimus discontinuation (after 3 years of exposure) in an apparent attempt to use everolimus to reduce tumor burden prior to surgery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>This analysis from the conclusion of treatment in EXIST-2 supports the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM. Renal angiomyolipoma response continued to improve from 41.8% in the core phase (median exposure, 8.8 months) to 58% in the extension phase (median exposure, 46.9 months) [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Clinically relevant renal angiomyolipoma reductions persisted over time as shown by the longitudinal data analysis which demonstrated an important reduction in the first 3 months of treatment and a continuous but less marked reduction later on. Low rates of renal angiomyolipoma progression were observed.</p><p>Over the 4-year duration of everolimus treatment, angiomyolipoma-related complications or procedural interventions were uncommon, and no treated patient experienced an angiomyolipoma-associated hemorrhage, whereas one-third of the patients experienced major renal interventions before entering the trial.</p><p>Everolimus was also associated with sustained reductions in SEGA volume and improvement in skin lesions. In the subset of patients with TSC-associated LAM, a lower than expected rate of decline in pulmonary function was reported. A 12-month, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with LAM reported an annual decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 10% in patients taking placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 43) [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], whereas the current study reported a decline of 5.9% after nearly 2 years of everolimus treatment. Together, the evidence supports a multisystem clinical impact of everolimus on various manifestations of TSC.</p><p>The longer-term safety profile of everolimus was consistent with that previously reported in TSC-associated clinical settings with everolimus [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. AEs occurred in most patients but were managed by dose adjustment in the majority. After the placebo arm was discontinued, it was difficult to distinguish between true everolimus side effects and AEs due to TSC (eg, infections were just as common in the placebo as in the everolimus group in the double-blind phase [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Some AEs, however, were predictable or known effects of mTOR inhibitors, often attributed to downregulation of cellular turnover (eg, amenorrhea, mouth ulcers). Nearly three-quarters of the patients completed this long-term study as per protocol. Stomatitis, an event known to be associated with everolimus, was the most frequent AE. While infections were common and mostly mild to moderate in severity during the study, it should be noted that severe life-threatening infections have been reported in patients treated with everolimus for TSC [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The frequency of emergent AEs of all types decreased over time. Renal function remained stable in most patients, and no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding events were reported. Immediate surgical intervention with embolization was performed in one patient (during the study period), and nephrectomy was performed in another (after treatment discontinuation). The observation of a single embolization while on everolimus over a median exposure of approximately 4 years indicates that treatment was successful and suggests a need for longer-term mTOR inhibition to continue to prevent or slow tumor regrowth, preserve renal function, and reduce the need for future embolization. This reduction in hemorrhage frequency could be due to restoration of a more appropriate mTORC1 axis in the TSC mutant vascular pericytes, thus preventing vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Better angiographic data are required to assess the vascular effects on therapy [<xref rid="pone.0180939.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Patients included in this study were at high risk for long-term renal deterioration because most of them had large, bilateral angiomyolipomas at baseline. Sustained clinical responses to everolimus in angiomyolipoma and other lesional manifestations of TSC&#x02014;such as skin lesions, SEGA, and LAM&#x02014;support everolimus as a viable treatment option for TSC and its potential to be a disease-modifying therapy in these patients.</p><p>Given the magnitude of effect with everolimus in the primary analysis, maintenance of an untreated arm was unethical, thus justifying the omission of the placebo arm in the extension phase. A planned noninterventional follow-up of EXIST-2 will provide longer-term data to determine angiomyolipoma characterizations for up to 1 year after the discontinuation of everolimus. Results of EXIST-2 demonstrate that everolimus is a safe and effective longer-term therapy for patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM not requiring immediate surgical intervention. Early treatment with everolimus may prevent progressive damage to renal tissue, reduce renal-related complications and the need for renal intervention, and improve patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180939.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of ethics committees and/or intuitional review boards that approved the EXIST-2 study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180939.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180939.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>EXIST-2 study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180939.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180939.s003"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomized trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180939.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180939.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Study design.</title><p>CT = computed tomography; EIAED = enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; sLAM = sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis; TSC = tuberous sclerosis complex. <sup>a</sup>Enrollment occurred between April 28, 2009, and December 30, 2010. <sup>b</sup>Dose adjusted based on toxicity. <sup>c</sup>Angiomyolipoma progression by central review or occurrence of adverse event of angiomyolipoma-related bleeding grade 2 or worse.</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180939.s004.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the EXIST-2 patients, study investigators, and study site personnel for their participation in this study.
