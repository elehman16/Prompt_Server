Most TAFE students are young adults, a period when health risk behaviours become established. Furthermore, high rates of smoking, risky alcohol consumption, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake and insufficient physical activity have been reported in TAFE students. There have been no intervention studies targeting multiple health risk behaviours simultaneously in this population.

TAFE classes will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control condition (50 classes per condition). To be eligible, students must be: enrolled in a course that runs for more than 6&#x000a0;months; aged 16&#x000a0;years or older; and not meet Australian health guideline recommendations for at least one of the following: smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and/or vegetable intake, or physical activity. Students attending intervention classes, will undertake via a computer tablet a risk assessment for health risk behaviours, and for behaviours not meeting Australian guidelines be provided with electronic feedback about these behaviours and referral to evidence-based online programs and telephone services. Students in control classes will not receive any intervention. Primary outcome measures that will be assessed via online surveys at baseline and 6&#x000a0;months post-recruitment are: 1) daily tobacco smoking; 2) standard drinks of alcohol consumed per week; 3) serves of fruit consumed daily; 4) serves of vegetables consumed daily; and 5) metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Proactive enrolment to existing online and telephone services has the potential to address modifiable determinants of disease.

Young adulthood is a period when smoking becomes established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], risky alcohol consumption increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and fruit and vegetable intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and physical activity declines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Australian health guidelines recommend that adults: do not use tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; consume no more than two standard alcoholic drinks per day (to reduce life-time disease risk) and no more than four standard alcoholic drinks on any one occasion (to reduce the risk of injury and acute problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; eat at least two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; and do at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate physical activity or at least 75&#x000a0;min of vigorous physical activity each week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges are the primary national provider of vocational education and training in Australia and deliver nationally recognised training to students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. TAFE provides training for diverse career pathways including for example hairdressing, beauty therapy, fashion, automative, plumbing, electronics and commercial cookery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are approximately 1.8 million TAFE student enrolments per year nationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and a high proportion of students are aged 15&#x02013;34 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. TAFE students have high rates of daily smoking (22&#x000a0;%), risky alcohol consumption (49&#x000a0;%), insufficient fruit (50&#x000a0;%) and vegetable (96&#x000a0;%) intake, inadequate physical activity (88&#x000a0;%) and almost all students (98&#x000a0;%) report two or more of these behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews have demonstrated that online programs and telephone services are each effective at reducing smoking rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and risky alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and increasing healthy eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and telephone interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] are also effective at improving multiple health risk behaviours. A community randomised trial in the US with 3,391 adults found that online and telephone support significantly improved physical activity and also reduced the total number of health risk behaviours (included smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetables intakes) at 6-months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In another trial with 3,344 US adults online intervention was found to significantly increase daily fruit and vegetable consumption and weekly physical activity, 6-months after the intervention, however there was no effect on smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Existing online and telephone services that are widely available to the community typically involve recruitment through mass media relying on individuals to initiate contact, an approach that limits their reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Proactive recruitment methods that involve the recruiter initiating contact with the individual have been shown to increase the use of telephone services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For example, a population-based randomised controlled trial found that 52&#x000a0;% of smokers who were proactively offered quitline telephone callbacks accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] which is substantially higher than the 3.6&#x000a0;% of Australian smokers who initiate contact with the quitline on their own each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Further, 23&#x000a0;% of individuals proactively offered calls from the Get Healthy Information and Coaching telephone service, accepted the offer of assistance to improve their nutrition and physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], compared with the &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;% of individuals who inititate contact with this service each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Proactive enrolment has significant potential for improving the reach of existing services, and hence contributing to population level reductions in the prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours.</p><p>Despite TAFE students having high rates of smoking, risky alcohol consumption, insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, and inadequate physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], no prior studies have assessed the effectiveness of either telephone-based or online programs with this population. Furthermore, no study has proactively and simultaneously offered both online and telephone support for all the health risk behaviours. The aim of this cluster randomised trial is to examine the effectiveness of providing TAFE students with electronic feedback and referral to a suite of online and telephone services to address their smoking, risky alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A two arm, parallel, cluster randomised trial will be conducted with 100 TAFE classes (50 per condition) at TAFE campuses in the Hunter Region of New South Wales Australia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The CONSORT statement will be followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. TAFE classes will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. In intervention classes, students will receive electronic feedback about their health risk behaviours and will be proactively referred to evidence-based online and telephone services for behaviours that do not meet Australian health guidelines. Students in control classes will not receive an intervention. Online surveys will occur at baseline and 6&#x000a0;months post-recruitment and will be administered in classrooms using a computer tablet.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of recruitment, intervention and follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1898_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>TAFE campuses located in the Hunter Region (population 620,530) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] will participate and TAFE records will be used to identify classes that run for &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months. Eligible students will: be currently enrolled in a course that runs for &#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months; aged 16&#x000a0;years or older; and not meet Australian health guidelines for at least one of the risk behaviours as assessed by the baseline survey: smoking, risky alcohol consumption, insufficient fruit intake, inadequate vegetable intake, or insufficient physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation</title><p>The randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent statistician using a random number function in Microsoft Excel. An equal number of classes will be randomised to each condition (1:1) using a randomised block design, with a block size of six, to ensure the conditions are balanced. Participant blinding will not be possible because they will be aware of the trial&#x02019;s conditions and the differences will be apparent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment and baseline survey</title><p>An information letter describing the trial and intervention and control conditions will be distributed to students. A week later, students will be provided with a verbal explanation of the study in class and invited to complete the baseline survey using a computer tablet. Informed consent will be recorded via the first page of the online baseline survey which will explain that if the student would like to take part in the trial they should choose &#x02018;Next&#x02019; and if they do so they agree to participate in the trial. Across the 100 classes, approximately 1,100 eligible TAFE students will be approached, and assuming the 92&#x000a0;% response fraction achieved in pilot work, we expect 1,012 students to be recruited into the trial and complete the baseline survey. The baseline survey will include standard and validated questions to examine the student&#x02019;s current smoking, alcohol consumption, daily fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity. Students&#x02019; knowledge of the Australian guidelines for each risk behaviour and intentions to change behaviours that do not meet Australian guidelines will be assessed. Socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported height, self-reported weight, and type of TAFE course students are studying will also be collected at baseline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention condition</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Electronic feedback, online and telephone support</title><p>Online support and telephone support strategies were chosen based on the APEASE criteria for selecting interventions: Affordability, Practicability, Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Safety and Equity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The online and telephone services: are available at no cost to participants; have potential for broad reach; and are supported by systematic reviews showing that online and telephone services using evidence-based behaviour change techniques such as motivational interviewing, monitoring and tailored feedback are effective across a range of behaviours and population groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The intervention will involve the following components (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Electronic health risk feedback</title><p>Based on their responses to the baseline survey, students in the intervention classes will receive immediate electronic feedback via the computer tablet relating to the reported behaviours that do not meet Australian guidelines. The feedback will include information about the relevant evidence-based guideline and advice to assist behaviour change. For instance, students who consume &#x0003c;2 serves of fruits or &#x0003c;5 serves of vegetables each day will receive immediate feedback that they are not meeting the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating nutrition recommendations, and that healthy eating can improve their overall health. They will then be informed via the computer tablet that online and telephone services and advice from a dietitian or doctor can help increase their fruit and vegetable intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Referral to online and telephone services</title><p>Following the electronic feedback, the software program will offer referral to existing online and telephone services for each behaviour where the participant does not meet the Australian guidelines. These services will be provided at no cost to participants. Students who agree to use online programs will be asked to provide their e-mail or mobile phone details and the hyperlink for the relevant program(s) will be sent to them. Students who agree to use telephone services will be asked to provide their contact details including a home and/or mobile phone number. Electronic referral will be sent to the NSW Quitline and the Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service and within two days of referral these telephone services will contact the student directly to provide advice and support. Given the Alcohol Drug Information Service (ADIS) is an anonymous service, participants will be sent the ADIS telephone number via e-mail or text so they can contact the service directly. Students will be able to accept either or both the online and telephone services for any behaviour that does not meet recommended Australian guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Online programs</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Smoking &#x02013; QuitCoach program</title><p>The QuitCoach (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.quitcoach.org.au/">http://www.quitcoach.org.au</ext-link>) provides individually tailored advice and support using principles of cognitive behavioural therapy to help smokers quit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The QuitCoach creates a two to four page personalised quit plan by asking participants a series of questions about their current smoking, plans to quit, motivation, confidence and past quit attempts. Intervention elements include: strategies to help resist urges to smoke, deal with nicotine withdrawal, and situations where the individual used to smoke. The program permits unlimited access and provides evidence-based advice and information sheets and sends reminder emails to the participant to return to the QuitCoach program to review their current situation. For instance, if the participant has quit smoking, QuitCoach will make adjustments to their personalised plan to provide relapse prevention strategy advice that reflects the progress made.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Alcohol &#x02013; THRIVE</title><p>Tertiary Health Research Intervention Via E-mail (THRIVE) is an online alcohol screening and brief intervention program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thrivehealth.org.au/curtin/survey.php">https://thrivehealth.org.au/curtin/survey.php</ext-link>) developed to reduce risky drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The program involves a 5&#x02013;10 min session of assessment and personalised feedback. The program examines the participant&#x02019;s drinking patterns, dependence symptoms, and alcohol-related problems. Based on participant responses THRIVE provides feedback about: 1) classification of the participant&#x02019;s drinking as moderate, hazardous, harmful or possibly alcohol dependent; 2) associated health risk and strategies for reducing alcohol consumption; 3) the participant&#x02019;s drinking compared to other people of the same age and gender; 4) an estimated blood alcohol concentration for their heaviest drinking occasion in the past four weeks; and 5) their estimated expenditure on alcohol in the last year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Fruit and vegetable intake &#x02013; The Healthy Eating Quiz</title><p>The Healthy Eating Quiz is an online program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthyeatingquiz.com.au/">http://healthyeatingquiz.com.au</ext-link>) developed to identify alignment of current eating habits with the Australian Dietary Guidelines.

Strategies for overcoming difficulties in achieving the participant&#x02019;s nutrition and/or physical activity goals are also discussed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Reminder e-mails or texts</title><p>Six weeks after the baseline survey, personalised e-mails or texts will be sent to remind intervention group participants about the online and/or telephone services they agreed to use in the baseline survey. The messages will encourage students to use the online program(s) and will include the relevant hyperlinks to the program(s). Students who were referred to a telephone service will be asked if they received calls from the relevant service(s) and if calls have been completed if they would like to be re-referred to the service for additional support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Control condition</title><p>Students in the control classes will be asked to complete the baseline and follow-up surveys but will not receive an intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Follow-up survey</title><p>The follow-up survey will be administered via computer tablet to the same students while in class, 6&#x000a0;months after recruitment. Based on TAFE records of student retention in courses, it is expected that the trial&#x02019;s retention rate will be about 80&#x000a0;%, which will result in approximately 810 students (405 per condition) completing the 6-month assessment. The students&#x02019; sex, year of birth, TAFE class, and first and last letters of mother&#x02019;s first name will be used to link baseline and follow-up survey data. The probability of a mismatch using this procedure has been calculated to be &#x0003c;1 in 148 000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

A picture showing a standard drinks chart, plus the number of standard drinks in some bulk alcohol containers will accompany each question. This measure improves accuracy by providing a recall prompt and estimating actual rather than usual alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Physical Activity</title><p>Physical activity will be measured using the modified version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] of the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which measures in the past month the average number of times per week a participant engages in mild, moderate or vigorous physical activity for 10&#x000a0;min or longer. As per the scoring rules for the GLTEQ, weights of 9, 5 and 3 will be applied for each of the vigorous, moderate and mild responses respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Participant responses for each category will be converted into metabolic equivalent scores (i.e., MET-minutes/week) by multiplying the weekly minutes of: mild activity by 2.5 METs; moderate activity by 4 METs; and vigorous activity by 7.5 METs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Knowledge of recommended Australian guidelines</title><p>Participants&#x02019; knowledge of the recommended Australian guidelines for each risk behaviour will be explored.

Logistic regression will be used to test if there is a statistically significant difference in the change in prevalence of daily smoking between the two treatment groups. The outcome in the model will be smoking status and the predictors will include time, group and an interaction term between time and group. The <italic>p</italic>-value associated with the interaction term will be used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in change between the groups. Linear regression will be used to test if there was a statistically significant different change in the mean level of the other outcomes between the groups. The outcome in each model will be the participant&#x02019;s value of the outcome measure post treatment and the predictors will include their baseline value and treatment group (i.e., Analysis of Covariance). The p-value associated with treatment group will be used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in the change from baseline to follow-up between the groups. Both the logistic and linear regression models will also be fit within a Generalised Estimating Equation framework to adjust for the correlation of responses within classes. All analyses will be conducted according to the Intention To Treat principle and the approach suggested by White and colleagues will be used to handle missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The initial analysis will include all available data and will be valid under the assumption that the missing data are missing completely at random. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted under different assumptions about the missing data mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Sample size</title><p>As there are five primary endpoints (smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit intake, vegetable intake and physical activity) an alpha level of 0.01 will be used to adjust for the multiple comparisons.

We aim to recruit 1012 TAFE students at baseline (i.e., 506 per condition). Allowing for 20&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up at 6&#x000a0;months, data will be available for 405 participants per condition. With an expected intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.005 this will give the study a design effect of approximately 1.04 and an effective sample size of 389 per group, which will provide 80&#x000a0;% power to find an absolute difference of 9.5&#x000a0;% (in daily smoking rates) between the groups at the follow-up visit. Allowing for a higher ICC for the continuous outcomes (0.01), the study will have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect an absolute difference of 0.25 SD in these measures at the 1&#x000a0;% significance level, which equates to a difference of approximately 1.25 standard drinks of alcohol, 0.25 pieces of fruit, 0.25 vegetables and 50 MET minutes of physical activity per week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Ethics approval &#x00026; trial registration</title><p>The University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee has granted ethical approval for this cluster randomised trial (H-2014-0012).
