After informed consent was obtained, 20 patients (12 men, 8 women; mean age, 67 &#x000b1; 11 years) with known chronic myocardial infarction were included for an intraindividual comparison of a single-dose gadobutrol and a single-dose gadobenate dimeglumine. Two MR imaging examinations were performed within a period of 28 days in a crossover design. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging was performed 10 minutes after gadolinium administration using a 2-dimensional phase-sensitive inversion recovery gradient echo sequence at 3 T. Infarct size, signal intensities (SIs), signal-to-noise ratio, and CNR were determined on phase-sensitive MR images. Values for CNR were calculated as CNR<sub>infarct/myocardium</sub> = (SI<sub>infarct</sub> &#x02212; SI<sub>myocardium</sub>)/SD<sub>noise</sub> and CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> = (SI<sub>infarct</sub> &#x02212; SI<sub>blood</sub>)/SD<sub>noise</sub>. In addition, the areas of myocardial infarction were determined on single slices. The entire infarct volumes were calculated by adding the areas with hyperenhancement multiplied by the slice thickness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement was present in all patients. Median values of the infarct area, infarct volume, and transmurality for gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine showed good to excellent concordance (<italic>r</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.85, <italic>r</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.95, and <italic>r</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.71, respectively).

The mean values of CNR<sub>infarct/myocardium</sub> and CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> were 14.5 &#x000b1; 5.9 and 4.0 &#x000b1; 4.6, respectively, for gadobutrol and 13.9 &#x000b1; 6.1 and 0.9 &#x000b1; 4.5, respectively, for gadobenate dimeglumine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine allow for successful late gadolinium enhancement imaging of chronic myocardial infarction after a single-dose application (0.1 mmol/kg) at 3 T. Gadobutrol provides a higher CNR between infarct and blood. The CNRs between infarct and normal myocardium, infarct size, and transmural extent were similar for both contrast agents.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>late gadolinium enhancement</kwd><kwd>contrast agent</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Precise assessment of the presence and extent of ischemic injury is of clinical importance in the treatment of patients with acute and chronic myocardial infarction for risk stratification and therapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The transmural extent of myocardial infarction predicts regional functional recovery after revascularization.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The extent of the ischemic scar is directly correlated with the outcome after myocardial infarction.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents has been proven as the most accurate method for the assessment of myocardial infarction size owing to its high spatial resolution.

The study was approved by the local institutional review board and by the BfArM (Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte). The study is registered by the European Community Clinical Trial System (EudraCT no. 2010-022570-13) and under ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01655290). For intraindividual comparison of gadobutrol versus gadobenate dimeglumine, patients were recruited for 2 consecutive MRI examinations within 2 to 28 days. At each visit, 1 of the 2 contrast agents was applied (crossover design). The permutation randomization of the order of contrast agent application was performed using closed envelopes. The order of contrast agent administration was blinded to the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 20 patients (12 men, 8 women) with chronic Q-wave myocardial infarction (positive electrocardiographic results and evidence of typical biochemical markers in patient history) were included. The mean age of infarction was 3.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 years. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The mean age of the patients was 67 &#x000b1; 11 years. The mean weight was 77 &#x000b1; 13 kg. CINE MRI revealed a mean stroke volume of 62 &#x000b1; 20 mL and a mean ejection fraction of 59% &#x000b1; 10%. Exclusion criteria were an impaired renal function with a glomerular filtration rate lower than 30 mL/min, allergies against gadolinium-containing contrast agents, cardiac pacemaker, as well as refused consent or disability to give appropriate informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>MR Imaging</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3-T MR system (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) with novel dual-transmit technology (maximum gradient amplitude, 45 mT/m; slew rate, 200 T/m/s; rise time, 0.2 milliseconds) and a standard 12-element posterior and 12-element anterior coil. Before contrast agent administration, CINE images were acquired in standard orientations (2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views and a stack of short-axis images) for the assessment of cardiac function using a standard 2-dimensional (2D) steady-state free precession pulse sequence with the following parameters: typical field of view, 413 &#x000d7; 413 mm; acquisition matrix, 216 &#x000d7; 214; reconstruction matrix, 336 &#x000d7; 336; slice thickness, 8 mm; reconstructed in-plane resolution, 1.2/1.2 mm; repetition time/echo time, 2.9/1.4 milliseconds; flip angle, 45&#x000b0;; temporal resolution, 42 milliseconds.</p><p>For LGE imaging, a 2D phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) gradient echo sequence was used including the following typical parameters: field of view, 350 &#x000d7; 350 mm; acquisition matrix, 220 &#x000d7; 178; reconstruction matrix, 384 &#x000d7; 384; bandwidth, 229 Hz/Px; slice thickness, 8 mm; no gap; flip angle, 25&#x000b0; (flip angle for the reference segment, 5&#x000b0;); repetition time/echo time, 6.1/3.0 milliseconds; reconstructed in-plane resolution, 0.9 mm &#x000d7; 0.9 mm. The optimal TI was determined using a standard Look-Locker sequence. Late gadolinium enhancement images were acquired 10 minutes after contrast agent injection. According to the randomization, either 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol (Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany) or 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine (Bracco Imaging, Konstanz, Germany) was applied. Contrast agents were injected at a rate of 1 mL/s followed by a bolus injection of 30 mL saline at an identical flow rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Image Analysis</title><p>Analysis of LGE images was performed in a blinded manner. Images were analyzed on the day of acquisition. Thus, the results between the 2 contrast agents could not be directly compared during the analysis. Image analysis was performed using the Osirix software (Osirix Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland) by 2 independent radiologists with 7 and 15 years of experience with cardiac MRI. Short-axis CINE stacks were used for determination of the global left ventricular functional parameters ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and left ventricular myocardial mass. Endocardial and epicardial contours and the end of the diastole and the end of systole were traced semiautomatically and manually corrected where necessary.</p><p>Phase-sensitive reconstructed images in short-axis orientation were used for LGE analysis. Areas of LGE were traced semiautomatically using the Osirix plugin. The contours were manually adjusted where necessary. Infarct areas were defined as regions with signal intensities higher than 2 standard deviations (SDs) compared with the signal intensities of remote myocardium. Infarct delineation from the remote myocardium was precise in all cases. The differentiation of infarct from a bright blood pool required manual corrections in 4 cases. For determination of infarct area on a single slice, the image with the highest transmural extent was selected. Entire infarct volumes were determined by adding the LGE-positive infarct areas of each short axis image multiplied by the slice thickness. Transmurality of infarct extension was measured as maximum infarct thickness divided by the thickness of the entire myocardium and presented as a percentage value.</p><p>The infarct area determined on a selected short axis image, the entire infarct volume, and the maximum of the transmural extent were determined. Values of both contrast agents were compared. In addition, the number of affected myocardial segments with LGE was determined for each examination. The bulls-eye plots reveal the results according to the 17-segment model of the American Heart Association.</p><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD values of signal intensity (SI) were measured in infarcted myocardium, in remote left ventricular myocardium, and in the left ventricular cavity (blood pool). Noise determination on PSIR imaging is considered to be critical. Usually, image noise is determined as the SD in a region of interest (ROI) outside the patient. However, for phase-sensitive images, it has been suggested that noise determination is performed in a region close to the ROI of the target lesion.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Thus, we estimated noise by the SD of SI in the remote myocardium. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was defined as mean SI in the ROI divided by the SD of SI in the remote myocardium. The CNR was defined as the difference of mean SI of 2 ROIs divided by the SD of SI in the remote myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0 a (Graph Pad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) and R 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Demographic patient data, stroke volume, and ejection fraction are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. The distribution of infarct area on a selected short-axis slice, the entire infarct volume, and the transmural extent are presented as median and range because of deviations from the normal distribution. Agreement of measurements resulting from the application of the 2 contrast agents was assessed by Lin concordance correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. The former was computed on ranked data to avoid bias induced by extreme values. The distribution of SNR and CNR values is given by mean &#x000b1; SD. Differences between the 2 contrast agents were investigated by a 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test for paired samples. Owing to the crossover design of the study, it was also checked for possible interaction effects of contrast agent and study period, using a 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test. No evidence fur such interaction effect was found (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). All statistical tests were performed in an explorative manner on a 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 20 patients completed the 2 MRI examinations.

To our knowledge, there is not much experience in the current literature concerning a comparison of a single-dose gadobutrol and gadobenate at 3.0 T for LGE imaging of myocardial infarction. There are differences in contrast agent behavior beyond known relaxivities between 1.5 and 3.0 T, which are currently not well investigated. A short delay time after contrast material application of 10 minutes is advantageous compared with a longer delay time of 30 minutes, both for improvement of contrast between infarction and viable myocardium as well as for reducing the entire room time. The use of a single-dose contrast agent instead of a double dose is cost effective and may reduce the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</p><p>In the current study, we compared 2 high-relaxivity contrast agents, gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine, for late-gadolinium enhancement of chronic myocardial infarction at 3 T. A field strength of 3 T is becoming more commonly used for clinical MRI examinations, as the SNR increases proportionally to B<sub>0</sub> in theory with subsequent higher SNR and CNR values. The determination of the correct TI is important to obtain a high contrast between the bright infarcted and the remote myocardium on magnitude images. Failure in choosing the correct TI can lead to a severe loss of contrast and image artifacts. Therefore, Kellman et al<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> implemented a PSIR technique for LGE imaging. It has been shown that PSIR imaging provides a high and stable CNR between infarct and normal myocardium, even when short default TIs are used. Thus, the need to determine the correct TI can be avoided and a more consistent image quality can be achieved.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We chose a segmented 2D PSIR gradient echo sequence for LGE imaging in our study protocol. However, we used an individual adaptation of the TI to make images, acquired after the application of the 2 different contrast agents, as comparable as possible. Our results demonstrate that gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine administered at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg are similarly effective in determining the size of the infarcted myocardium. With the infarct area determined on a selected slice, the entire infarct volume and the transmural extent showed high concordance for LGE imaging with gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine. Gadobutrol provided a higher contrast between infarcted myocardium and the left ventricular blood compared with gadobenate dimeglumine. According to previous observations,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the SI in the left ventricular cavity is still high when images are acquired 10 minutes after the application of gadobenate dimeglumine. The protein binding properties of gadobenate dimeglumine are considered to be responsible for this observation. In a previous study, Secchi et al<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> detected only a minor contrast between left ventricular cavity and adjacent infarcted myocardium at 1.5 T. A delay of at least 10 minutes seems to be necessary to allow for a certain clearing of gadobenate dimeglumine from the blood with subsequently improved contrast between infarct and blood. When using gadobutrol at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, LGE imaging seems to be possible already at 10 minutes after contrast injection, with high CNR between infarcted and remote myocardium as well as between infarcted myocardium and blood. The blood half-life of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadobutrol in healthy subjects is reported in a similar range of 1.5 hours, which, however, increases dramatically in case of decreased renal function.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> As all patients included in our study had similarly normal renal function, a significant impact of renal clearance on the blood pool contrast is considered as unlikely.</p><p>Although rare, NSF is the most feared complication in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with coronary artery disease are more frequently affected by renal impairment than the normal population.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, using a lower dose of gadolinium-based contrast agents and switching to safer contrast agents are important goals in patients with coronary artery disease. Macrocyclic contrast agents such as gadobutrol are considered to be safer than linear gadolinium compounds with regard to the risk for NSF owing to their higher thermodynamic stability.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Currently, it is recommended to avoid linear gadolinium chelates in patients with impaired renal function.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Gadobenate dimeglumine has a linear structure; however, it is considered only as an &#x0201c;intermediate-risk&#x0201d; contrast agent that is recommended to be used instead of gadopentetate dimeglumine in patients with impaired renal function.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> When evaluating the risk of gadolinium-based MR contrast agents, the complex stability and the associated Gd<sup>3+</sup> dissociation rate are decisive. When compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine exhibits a similar rate of Gd<sup>3+</sup> release, indicating that these complexes are equally stable.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Instead of linear gadolinium agents, macrocyclic gadolinium chelates such as gadobutrol are recommended.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Gadobutrol has been successfully evaluated for imaging viability at the standard double dose of 0.2 mmol/kg,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> at a dose of 0.15 mmol/kg,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> both at 1.5 and 3.0 T. Durmus et al<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> have shown that gadobutrol at a dose of 0.15 mmol/kg provides excellent contrast between infarcted and remote myocardium and achieves a higher contrast between infarct and left ventricular cavity when compared with 0.2 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine and 0.2 mmol/kg gadoteric acid at 1.5 T. Only 1 study investigated the performance of a single-dose gadobutrol application at 3 T in imaging myocardial infarction.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Gadobenate dimeglumine has a 2-fold higher <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> relaxivity compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Previous cardiac MRI studies have used gadobenate dimeglumine at concentrations of 0.05 mmol/kg,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> 0.1 mmol/kg,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and 0.2 mmol/kg.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These studies report results derived from MR images acquired all at 1.5 T. A comparison between gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine, when applied a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg, revealed higher CNR<sub>infarct/myocardium</sub> values for infarcted and remote myocardium for gadobenate dimeglumine but superior CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> values for the infarcted myocardium and left ventricular blood for gadopentetate dimeglumine.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A single dose of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine provided higher CNR<sub>infarct/myocardium</sub> when compared with 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine. However, no disadvantage concerning the CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> was observed.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> T1 mapping at 3.0 T revealed similar extracellular volume fractions after 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine compared with 0.15 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A direct comparison of 0.1 versus 0.2 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine, despite a fractionated application, showed that 0.1 mmol/kg provides a high contrast between infarcted and remote myocardium already at 10 minutes after injection, with significantly increased CNR<sub>infarct/myocardium</sub> values at 20 minutes after contrast agent application, performed at a field strength of 1.5 T.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Ten minutes after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimgelumine, Secchi et al<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> observed no differences in CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> values between infarcted myocardium and left ventricular blood. Only at 20 minutes was a statistically significant increase in CNR<sub>infarct/blood</sub> observed at 1.5 T. This suggests that the prolonged clearance of gadobenate dimeglumine from the blood enables detection of smaller subendocardial myocardial infarctions only at late time points after gadolinium injection.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The SI in the blood is almost similar compared with the infarcted myocardium, with poor contrast between both compartments at a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which is in accordance with our results obtained with 0.1 mmol/kg at 3.0 T.</p><p>The following limitations apply to this study: The patient cohort of 20 individuals is rather small; however, results concerning SNR and CNR values seem to be clear. Studies including larger patient series may be performed to confirm these results. As discussed above, the extent and intensity of LGE were assessed only at 10 minutes after injection. Data acquisitions at a later time point after contrast material application can be expected to provide different CNR values, which may have especially an influence on CNR of infarct and left ventricular blood, when gadobenate dimeglumine is used. The LGE assessment was performed using a PSIR technique. Especially novel 3D acquisition techniques, various readout and reconstruction techniques may provide different CNR values, which have to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, both gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine allow for successful LGE imaging at a reduced dose of 0.1 mmol/kg at 3 T. Ten minutes after injection, gadobutrol is superior compared with gadobenate dimeglumine concerning the contrast between infarct and the left ventricular cavity, which may be advantageous for the detection of small subendocardial infarctions. Contrast between infarct and myocardium, infarct areas, volumes, and transmurality are similar for both contrast agents.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of interest and sources of funding: The study was supported by a research grant by Bayer Healthcare.</p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
