However, the bacterial etiology has not yet been able to substantiate various aspects of periodontal disease. Recent microbiological researches on periodontal disease have focused on the possible involvement of human viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of destructive periodontal diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies have implicated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstien barr virus 1 (EBV-1) in the pathogenesis of human periodontal disease. These viruses are capable of infecting and impairing polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), macrophages, and lymphocytes. Herpes virus-infected cells can reduce the host defense and give rise to overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and invade the cells more efficiently.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Contreras and Slots[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] also demonstrated the presence of EBV-1, HCMV, and other herpes viruses in juvenile and chronic periodontitis lesions. Association of herpes viruses with bacteria was also assessed to improve our understanding of etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Furthermore, recent studies have quantified the herpes viruses in periodontal pockets to show their positive association with severity of periodontal disease. The prevalence and number of herpes viruses in periodontal pockets may vary according to type of periodontal disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Studies have confirmed the frequent presence of HCMV, EBV, and HSV in crevicular samples of chronic periodontitis lesions and suggested a strong relationship between the presence of these viruses and measurement of probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and the severity of the disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Evidence from studies also indicate the subgingival presence of EBV-1 and HCMV is strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and co-infection with HCMV and EBV appears to be particularly deleterious to periodontal health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The present study aims at detecting and comparing the presence of HCMV, EBV, HSV-1, and HSV-2 in subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, and periodontally healthy individuals and its relation with the clinical parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The patients participating in the study were selected from the Outpatient Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India. The study was carried out after obtaining the ethical clearance from the institutional review board. This cross-sectional study included 10 patients (6 women and 4 men within age group 18&#x02013;55 years). All the patients were systemically healthy and had not received any antibiotics or periodontal therapy in the past 6 months prior to the sampling and recording. Smokers, pregnant women, and lactating mothers were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each study subject after all the procedures had been fully explained.</p><p>Patients were grouped as follows:</p><p>Group 1: Periodontally healthy individuals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] (Included volunteered dental students and paradental staff with age &#x02265; 21 years &#x02013; 45 years, presence of sulcus depth &#x02264; 3 mm, radiologically without crestal bone loss [CEJ as landmark]).</p><p>Group 2: Chronic periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] (Patients with age &#x02265; 35 years, 30% of sites involved, periodontal pocket depth &#x02265; 6 mm, and attachment loss &#x02265; 3 mm, with severe bone loss [&#x02265;50% of root length]).</p><p>Group 3: Aggressive periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] (Patients with age &#x02265; 18 years, 30% of sites involved, periodontal pocket depth &#x02265; 6 mm, and attachment loss &#x02265; 3 mm, with severe bone loss [&#x02265;50% of root length]).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical procedures</title><p>A total of 75 sites were selected, 25 sites belonged to each of the three groups. The selected sites were subjected to clinical evaluation of plaque index (Silness and Loe, 1964),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] gingival index (Loe and Silness, 1963),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] probing pocket depth, and clinical attachment level. All clinical parameters were measured with a UNC-15 probe calibrated in millimeters and were performed on four sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, and lingual). Prior to sampling, supragingival plaque was gently removed with sterile cotton pellets and the sample sites were isolated with cotton rolls and dried. In the periodontitis patients (Groups 2 and 3), subgingival samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pocket sites of the dentition, and for the periodontally healthy individuals (Group 1) samples were collected from sites with probing depth measuring &#x02264;3 mm. Subgingival samples were collected by a sterile curette. After gently inserting the curette to the bottom of the sample site, subgingival plaque was removed with a single stroke of the curette. The collected plaque samples were transferred into separate sterile plastic vials containing TE (Tris EDTA) buffer, which contains Trishydrochloride (pH &#x02013; 8.0) 10 mM and Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1 mM. All plaque samples were collected by a single examiner and the collected samples were coded and sent for microbiological analysis. Thus, the analyzer was blinded regarding the source of the sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Deoxyribonucleic acid extraction</title><p>On reaching the laboratory, the sample is immediately processed for Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. The sample is washed twice in TE buffer at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes each, followed by one wash in Lysis buffer-1 [Tritonx 100 (1%), EDTA &#x02013; 1 mM, Trihydrochloride 10 mM]. 100 ml of Lysis buffer &#x02013; 2 is added, which contains (Tri hydrochloride 50 mM, Potassium chloride (50 mM), Magnesium chloride (2.5 mM), Tween&#x02013;20 (0.45%), Nonidet P-40 (0.45%) with Proteinalase-K (100 mic gms / ml). This is kept in an incubator at 65&#x000b0;C for 2 h followed by 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C. Later, this is kept at -20&#x000b0;C until processing.

The method depends on the use of two flanking oligonucleotide DNA primers and repeated cycles of primer extension using DNA polymerase. Multiplex PCR is a type of PCR technique in which multiple primer pairs for different target molecules are included in the same amplification mixture. This mixture is used to simultaneously amplify target sequences for several pathogenic microorganisms in a single reaction vial. To optimize the multiplex PCR, a series of titrations of primer concentrations and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels were performed. Primer concentrations of 10, 25, 50, and 100 pmol from each primer pair were titrated simultaneously with dNTP (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mM concentrations of each dNTPs).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The amplifications were performed with DNA thermalcycler (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). After placing the PCR vials inside the thermalcycler, 40 amplification cycles of 30 s at 94&#x000b0;C, 40 s at 60&#x000b0;C, and 50 s at 72&#x000b0;C were carried out. In a PCR vial (Axygen Inc., Union city, California, USA) with a 50 mL final volume containing 10 p mol of each of the 8 primers (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, USA), 5 mL of 10X reaction buffer, 0.2 mM concentrations of each dNTP, and 2.5 U of cloned pfu DNA polymerase enzyme (Genei Bangalore, India). Five mL of appropriate DNA sample (positive controls, HSV-1 strain F, HSV-2 strain G, HCMV strain AD169, and EBV strain P-3, negative controls, plaque sample) was added to the reaction mixture. After the last cycle, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 78&#x000b0;C to complete the extension of primers. Ten mL of each amplified product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis on 3.5% agarose containing 1 mg of ethidium bromide / mL in 1x TBE buffer and was visualized in a UV transilluminator (Bio- Imaging Systems, NY, USA).

HSV-1 usually causes orolabial disease and HSV-2 is associated more frequently with genital and newborn infections. At the site of epithelial infection, viral antigens induce a cell-mediated immune response. Following replication in epithelial cells, some viral nucleocapsids ascend the local sensory neurons by retrograde axonal transport and establish a lifelong latency in the corresponding spinal and cerebral ganglions. Reactivation of herpes simplex virus can occur subclinically, but about one-third of the individuals become prone to clinical recurrences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Cultured epithelial cells and fibroblasts from clinically healthy human gingiva are susceptible to HSV infection,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] suggesting that those cells could be a reservoir for the latent virus. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, HSV-1 antigens could be detected in 4 out of 14 gingival biopsies from periodontally diseased patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The presence of HSV antigens could also be shown in 26 out of 66 specimens of clinically healthy gingiva using a similar method.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>In this study, which was studied on Indian population, a highly statistically significant prevalence of HSV-1 in subgingival samples from chronic periodontitis patients (76%) and aggressive periodontitis patients (80%) compared to healthy controls (12%) was seen. These results were correlated with the study by Saygun <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] where HSV-1 was found to be statistically significant in aggressive periodontitis patients compared with healthy individuals. However, there was no statistically significant detection of HSV-1 between chronic periodontitis patients (76%) and aggressive periodontitis patients (80%). In our study, HSV-2 was not found to be statistically significant. Similar results were observed in the study by Contreras and Slots,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] wherein presence of HSV-1 was seen in all the samples but HSV-2 was not detected in any of the samples. HSV-2 is usually transmitted through genital infection and is rarely found in the oral cavity.</p><p>EBV affects over 90% of humans and is usually transmitted by oral secretions or blood. The virus replicates in epithelial cells or B-cells of the oropharynx. Resting memory B cells are the main site of persistence of EBV in the body. The number of latently infected cells in a person remains stable for over years.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Latent EBV infection can be reactivated, leading to viral shedding into oral mucosa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In our study, EBV was found to be significant in chronic periodontitis patients (32%) compared with healthy controls (8%). Saygun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] found EBV to be present in 44.3% of sites from patients with chronic periodontitis and only 14.3% of the sites obtained from healthy controls. Konstantinidis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] showed EBV to be present in 11 out of 12 chronic periodontitis patients and only one in healthy controls. Similarly, in aggressive periodontitis patients, EBV was found to be significant (32%) compared with healthy controls (8%). Studies conducted by Yapar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and Saygun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] showed EBV to be significant in the sites of aggressive periodontitis patients compared with healthy control sites. However, no difference was found between chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis patients in this study. This is contradictory to the study results obtained by Kubar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] where EBV was seen to be present in 89% sites in aggressive periodontitis patients compared with 46% in chronic periodontitis patients, which was statistically significant. So with these findings from our study, we can infer that there is a close association of HSV-1 and EBV with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.</p><p>HCMV, the largest member of herpes family of viruses, is responsible for a significant percentage of asymptomatic viral infections worldwide. HCMV exhibits marked tropism for cells of the immune system. HCMV interferes with innate and adaptive cellular and humoral immune effector mechanisms by activation and silencing of natural killer cells, by down-modulating antigen presentation in the MHC class I and II pathways and by impairing apoptosis. HCMV infection induces abnormalities in adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal activities of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. It also diverts potent antiviral cytokine response or even interferes with cytokine production.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In this study, HCMV detection was not found to be statistically significant in all the three groups. This is contradictory to the previous studies conducted by Kamma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Yapar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Contreras <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and Kubar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] which has found HCMV in periodontitis lesions. This variation of results among various studies could be due to geographical, economic background, and ethnicity.</p><p>In chronic and aggressive periodontitis, HSV-1 detected sites are more compared with undetected sites indicating that HSV-1 is associated with the progression and severity of the periodontal disease. In this study, EBV-1, HCMV, and HSV-2 have not shown any correlation with the clinical parameters of periodontal disease. However, studies conducted by Contreras and Slots <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Ling <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] and Kamma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] have found contradictory results.</p><p>This observation that herpes virus tends to be associated with initiation and progression of periodontitis offers testable hypothesis for explaining the periodontopathic effects of these viruses. It is hoped that such information will help bridge the gap between our clinical understanding of destructive periodontal disease and our lack of knowledge at the molecular levels of mechanisms involved in periodontal tissue breakdown. Further studies should include longitudinal, clinical, and microbiological studies and further research on the role of herpes viruses in different forms of periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The following conclusions could be made from the findings of this study.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>HSV-1 and EBV are significantly associated with destructive periodontal disease including chronic and aggressive periodontitis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HSV-1 detected sites were more in relation to sites of deep pocket depth and increased clinical attachment loss, and this signifies that these viruses might be associated with severity and progression of destructive periodontal disease.</p></list-item></list>
