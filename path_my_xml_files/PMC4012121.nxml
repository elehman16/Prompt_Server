All teeth were free of any caries, breakage, or enamel problems at buccal or lingual surfaces. Following rinsing with water, the teeth were kept in 0.5% chloramine T solution. Depending on the rinsing angle, the teeth were divided into 6 groups as follows: Group I (with a rinsing angle of 90&#x000b0;); Group II (with a rinsing angle of 75&#x000b0;); Group III (with a rinsing angle of 60&#x000b0;); Group IV (with a rinsing angle of 45&#x000b0;); Group V (with a rinsing angle of 30&#x000b0;); and Group VI (with a rinsing angle of 15&#x000b0;). Following this division, the teeth in each of the groups were sub-divided into two groups as follows: Buccal (5 teeth), and palatal (5 teeth) randomly. Next, the teeth roots were mounted in plaster blocks (Vel-Mix Stone, Kerr, Italy) with a diameter of 2.5 cm, and a height of 2 cm. They were mounted in such a way that the height of contour of the surfaces were almost in vertical positions. Two fissures, one vertically and one horizontally, were cut by a high speed hand piece to indicate the location which was etched and rinsed. By means of a low speed hand piece, the examination sites on the teeth were cleaned for 10 s. In this step, the teeth were microscopically tested for a second time to find any enamel problems. In order to clarify the rinsing angle exactly, a syringe on a moving protractor in a distance of 2 cm of the tooth surface was fixed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. A barometer, on the water pouring system, helped to uniform the water pressure, pouring on all samples. After 20 s of etching (by Scotch Bond, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA), the teeth surfaces were rinsed for 20 s at each of the angles mentioned above. The teeth were dried in such a way that the chalky-white enamel surface was visible. To put the sealants (Concise, 3M, ESPE, USA) on the etched surfaces, transparent plastic pipes with an internal diameter of 3.6 mm and a height of 4 mm were used. Finally, following sealant placing in the plastic cylinders and curing them, the plastic matrix was dissected by the scalpel blade and finally separated. A cylinder with a diameter of 3.5 and a height of 4 mm was remained on the buccal or palatal surface of the teeth. The roots were dissected from 2 cm below the C.E.J. by a diamond discus (DandZ Diamond, Germany) and separated. All samples were kept in distilled water for 24 h, before being prepared for micro tensile bond test.</p><p>The teeth were sectioned in X and Y directions to obtain bonded sticks with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1.0 mm2, measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo Corp, Japan).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A water syringe mounted onto a protractor to determine the exact rinsing angle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-5-67-g001"/></fig><p>The samples were then fixed on the plate of the micro tensile test machine (Bisco Inc., USA) conforming to the midline of the plates. In this machine, a pulling strength of 200 N with a speed of 0.5 mm/min was exerted to the samples. The load (N) and the bonding surface area of the specimens in mm<sup>2</sup> were noted and the micro tensile bond strength calculated in MPa.</p><p>The type of failure in the samples was determined at a magnification of 90 &#x000d7; by stereo microscope (SZX Olympus, Japan).

A move in this direction is needed as the interest of the dental profession in preventive dentistry is increasing. Considerable research has been undertaken to optimize the bond strength between resin-based dental materials and dental enamel. The ability of the resin to penetrate between the enamel crystallites and rods is a determinant of the bond strength between the resin and the etched enamel.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] To enhance the enamel surface free-energy and resin penetration, it is important to remove all etched remnants in the enamel porosity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Here we showed that a general trend exists between reduction in bond strength and the rinsing angle from 90&#x000b0; to 15&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. It seems that the increased tensile bond strengths, associated with the more thorough washing, were due to the increased rinsing angle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, at 90&#x000b0;, the complete evacuation of the etching products can be achieved, while the persistence of deposit remnants on enamel surface might possibly be a consequence of reduction in the rinsing angle. These data, therefore, support the hypothesis that failure to remove the etched enamel surface deposits markedly reduces bonding between the sealant and the enamel. Indeed, scanning electron microscopy of etched enamel surfaces has shown the presence of such deposits after inadequate washing.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Incomplete cleansing obscures the fine structure of the etched prism by a generalized precipitate layer so that the surface does not lend itself to mechanical bonding.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of sealants and resins has been evaluated by numerous mechanical testing methods, such as shear bond strength, tensile bond strength and micro-leakage.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In this study, we used the micro tensile technique, a recent but widely employed test to evaluate the bond strength of adhesive materials to dental tissues.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Compared to other debonding tests, this method tends to increase adhesive failures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Because of the small size of the specimens in the micro tensile test, stress distributions are improved and failures occur in materials with true ultimate strength closer to the applied load.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Thus, identification of the site where failure has occurred is important. In our study, the mean micro tensile bond strength varied between 23 and 24.98 Mpa [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In spite of such high bond strength, no cohesive failure was observed in the enamel. This behavior may be attributed to the micro tensile test characteristics, which have been shown to produce a more homogeneous stress distribution and to the prismatic orientation of the intact enamel surface, which is mostly perpendicular to the enamel periphery and parallel to the applied stress.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These will result in higher bond strength and fewer cohesive failures.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a study conducted by Giannini <italic>et al</italic>., on the ultimate tensile strength of tooth structures, they found that intact enamel when stressed transversely to its prismatic orientation, is significantly weaker compared to when stressed parallel.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>A possible explanation for the cohesive failures (in adhesive material) in Groups I and II [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] may be the higher bond strength in these groups, which was probably stronger than the ultimate tensile bond strength of the adhesive,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] leading to failures in sealant material. A reduction in the rinsing angle was coupled with more adhesive failures, which would be attributable to the lower bond strength observed in acute angles.</p><p>Light stereo microscopy of the specimens revealed that the presence of more sealant remnants at the failure site when a rinsing angle of 90&#x000b0; was used. Furthermore, the percentage resin remnants decreased with a reduction in the rinsing angle. This indicates that bond failures in acute angles occur more frequently at the enamel adhesive interface consistent with the other findings in this study, showing that rinsing at 90&#x000b0; results in improved adhesion of sealant to the enamel surface. It should be further noted that in view of the fact that many researchers consider a clinically successful bond as being between 15 and 35 Mpa,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] it seems that there were acceptable bond strengths in the acutest rinsing angles. We did not observe any premature fractures in our study in contrast to some other investigations.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to the literature, premature failure occurs in very low tensile strengths (5-7 Mpa) or in high cutting speed during specimen preparation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To avoid this problem, we have used a low cutting speed with a coolant spray and a very thin cutting blade (0.3 mm) during sample preparations.</p><p>Since many variables encountered in the clinical cases cannot be controlled for <italic>in-vitro</italic>, we are unable to make direct inferences from the information obtained in this study to the clinical cases. Therefore, future clinical trials that assess the longevity of sealants placed subsequent to washing with different rinsing angles are necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of this <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>
