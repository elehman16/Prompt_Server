The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effects of oral administration of DM on reducing methadone dose in MMT used to treat illicit opioid drug abuse.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS:</title><p>A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was designed. Seventy two opiate abusers undergoing MMT were randomly divided into two groups. Participants in the intervention group were medicated by DM while those in the control group received placebo. After a 6-week follow-up, methadone consumption dosage, quality of life (QOL) and withdrawal symptoms were assessed and compared between the two groups by repeated measure ANOVA statistical test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The mean of methadone consumption in the DM and control groups were 62.7 mg/day (52.7-72.7) and 70.4 mg/day (60.4-80.4), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups among the four evaluations made (F = 1.192, P = 0.279). There were not any significant differences in withdrawal symptoms between the two groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Total mean scores of QOL in the intervention and control groups were 84.8 (78.7-90.8) and 77.8 (71.8-83.7) (P &#x0003e; 0.05), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>Although DM might be useful for opioid dependence treatment, results of the current study did not reveal any statistically significant differences.

Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is one of the most common methods of long-term treatment of illicit opioid abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> MMT has been customary in Iran for treatment of opioid addiction. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has shown that higher methadone doses were more effective than doses under 60 mg in both retention on maintenance treatment and reduction of illicit drug use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> However, parallel to treatment with methadone, another phenomenon named tolerance is acting. In many cases, tolerance is induced during MMT and methadone dosage consumption enhances.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Although it was supposed that negative auto-regulation was responsible for tolerance creation, the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been proved to have an essential role in opioid tolerance. NMDA receptor antagonists have the ability to inhibit the development of opiate tolerance and dependence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> In addition, NMDA receptor antagonists can indeed inhibit tolerance to different mu opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>Many studies demonstrated that the combination of an NMDA-receptor antagonist and morphine decrease analgesic tolerance of morphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Some NMDA-receptor antagonists like dextromethorphan (DM) have been used for tolerance reduction in MMT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> However, few studies investigated DM usage in lack of tolerance to methadone during MMT. Therefore, there is a need to further explore the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on the development of tolerance and sensitization to opiates. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of DM for reducing methadone dose in MMT of illicit opioid abuse. Additionally, we compared the side effects of DM and assessed patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p><bold><italic>Design:</italic></bold> A double blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from January 2009 to January 2010.

</p><p><bold><italic>Participant recruitment:</italic></bold> All participants were selected from substance abuse clinic at Noor hospital associated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Sample size was calculated based on two mean comparison formula and 95% confidence and 80% power. The effect size was considered based on the range of methadone consumption between 30 to 120 mg. Overall, 72 patients with opium addiction were included and divided into two groups of 36. A researcher conducted the eligibility check using the abovementioned criteria and explained what would happen in the two arms of the trial and the randomization process. After the researcher summarized the information in the participant information sheet and responded to the questions about the study, the participants provided written consents. Then, participants were randomly allocated into two arms by a computer software. Every patient took a 4-digit code. Finally, EPI-6 software was used to randomly allocate the subjects into two groups of intervention and control. Only the main researcher knew about the code of allocated individuals. Evaluations were done by another investigator who was blinded regarding the allocation.</p><p><bold><italic>Procedure:</italic></bold> In the beginning, all participants underwent laboratory liver function, serum BUN and creatinine tests to check liver and renal function. After randomization, the first group received 60 mg DM daily for 4 days. Then, the dose was increased to 120 mg daily (60mg/12h) for 4 days. In the third 4-day period, DM dosage was increased to 240 mg daily (120mg/12h) which continued through the next 6 weeks. However, in the other group (considered as control), the subjects were receiving placebo using the same process in the intervention group. DM and placebo were both made by School of Pharmacy at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p><bold><italic>Measurements:</italic></bold> The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOLQ) and Short Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) were completed for each participant by a trained staff member. WHOQOLQ is a valid questionnaire to evaluate quality of life (QOL) designed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Nedjat et al. have also validated this questionnaire for Iranian population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> SOWS is a scoring system for evaluating the frequency and severity of withdrawal symptoms in patients recruited in opioid rehabilitation programs. It has been designed by Handelsman et al. in 1987.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> This questionnaire was adapted for Iranian patients and has been applied in several studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> The average methadone consumption was registered by the researchers in data sheets. First evaluation was done at the onset of the study to provide baseline data. Second evaluations were done every two weeks until 6 weeks after the study was started.</p><p><bold><italic>Statistical analysis:</italic></bold> Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (ver.17; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons between the groups were made by t-test for means and chi-square test for nominal variables. Repeated measure of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate changes of methadone consumption and QOL scores during 6 weeks. Variance homogeneity, as a presumption of repeated measure ANOVA, was tested by Mauchly's test. Levene's test was also used to investigate homogeneity of variance in both DM and control groups. Friedman test was used for repeated measurement of nominal variables such as changes of withdrawal symptoms during the 6-week assessment in each group. The changes of each withdrawal symptom were evaluated between the two groups using Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy two patients completed all the follow-up stages of this study.

First, with the exact quality control, the study benefitted from a high-quality methodology. In addition, the appropriate sample size, which was estimated by exact statistical formula, increased the power of the study to detect small differences between the groups.
