All subjects were randomly assigned to receive either curcumin or placebo capsules for 9 months. To assess the T2DM progression after curcumin treatments and to determine the number of subjects progressing to T2DM, changes in &#x003b2;-cell functions (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]-&#x003b2;, C-peptide, and proinsulin/insulin), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), anti-inflammatory cytokine (adiponectin), and other parameters were monitored at the baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month visits during the course of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>After 9 months of treatment, 16.4% of subjects in the placebo group were diagnosed with T2DM, whereas none were diagnosed with T2DM in the curcumin-treated group.

According to the World Health Organization, there are &#x0223c;311 million people worldwide who live with T2DM. This number continues to rise, especially in the newly developing and poorer countries in Asia and elsewhere. Because T2DM is currently incurable, a common treatment approach is to try to control the disease with lifelong use of antidiabetes drugs. Limiting the number of newly developed T2DM cases should be one of the better key strategies to restrict the global impacts of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In order to limit the number of new T2DM cases, the lifestyle of the prediabetic population has to be changed. However, this has been shown to be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). One of the alternative approaches to prevent development of T2DM is to intervene with the prediabetic population before disease progresses into fully developed T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The intervention approach is appealing. It relies on timely identification of prediabetic individuals and provision of preventive treatment before the disease fully progresses. The intervention represents a chance for the diabetes-prone population to halt the disease progression and maintain a normal and healthy life. In recent years, several effective T2DM intervention regimens have been developed, with encouraging results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, these regimens are not usually economically accessible, and they are not well-tolerated because of treatment-related toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The focus now is to identify new effective therapeutic agents, with relatively low cost and low toxicity, that can be used regularly to control a progression of T2DM in the prediabetic population.</p><p>Curcumin is the principal curcuminoid found in turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic> Linn.), a popular spice in Asian cuisine. It is widely consumed and generally believed to be beneficial for human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Curcumin extract from rhizomes of turmeric has been shown to contain anti-inflammation and antidiabetic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In addition, it could delay development of T2DM, improve &#x003b2;-cell functions, prevent &#x003b2;-cell death, and reduce insulin resistance in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of curcumin extract as an intervention agent to prevent T2DM development. We assessed T2DM progression and several indicative T2DM parameters in a large randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled cohort. We found that curcumin extract effectively reduced the number of prediabetic individuals who progressed toward T2DM as well as improved functions of &#x003b2;-cells.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center of Srinakharinwirot University (Nakornnayok, Thailand). Two hundred forty patients were selected to participate in this study by inclusion and exclusion criteria (for a complete flow chart, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). The subjects were enrolled in the 12-month&#x02013;long study. We educated all subjects to perform in the same protocols for diet and exercise during a 3-month period after the enrollment (before the randomization). Standard lifestyle recommendations were provided for all subjects in written form. All of the subjects took part in a 20&#x02013;30-min one-on-one workshop that emphasized the importance of a healthy lifestyle. Participants were encouraged to follow the Medical Nutrition Therapy and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To avoid any interference from other medications, during the recruitment process, we excluded all of patients who were taking any other medicines, as shown in the exclusion criteria. Only prediabetic subjects aged &#x02265;35 years were included in this study. Prediabetes was diagnosed following the American Diabetes Association (ADA) practice guidelines. Subjects who fit into at least one of these three criteria were included: subjects with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 100 and 124 mg/dL (indicating impaired fasting glucose), an oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) plasma glucose at 2 h postglucose load (OGTT at 2 h) between 140 and 199 mg/dL (indicating impaired glucose tolerance), and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) range from 5.7 to 6.4%. Diagnosis of prediabetes was confirmed by a second repeating test of all of the above-listed criteria on a different day.</p><p>Subjects diagnosed with diabetes according to the new ADA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) were excluded from the study (subjects who are positive for any one of these following criteria: FPG level &#x02265;126 mg/dL, OGTT at 2 h &#x02265;200 mg/dL, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5%. The following subjects were also excluded from the study: subjects receiving oral hypoglycemic agents, antiplatelet drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, fenofibrate, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin; subjects with serum creatinine &#x02265;2.0 mg/dL or on dialysis; subjects with the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x02265;3 folds of upper limit of normal value range; subjects receiving other herbal medicines; subjects with secondary causes of hyperglycemia (receiving steroids or with pancreatic cancer); subjects with acute infections or chronic inflammatory diseases (cancer, rheumatoid arthritis); and subjects with gall bladder disease or history of cholecystectomy. This study (clinical trial reg. no. NCT01052025) was approved by the Ethic Committee of Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok, Thailand (serial number SWUEC 9/2552) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were informed and gave their consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Randomization procedures</title><p>After steps of screening, consenting, and diet and lifestyle training, all subjects were randomly assigned to either the curcumin-treated group (intervention treatment condition) or placebo-treated group (control condition) using a fixed randomization scheme with assignment based on computer-generated random numbers performed by an independent researcher. The allocation scheme was sealed in opaque and consecutively numbered envelopes. Envelopes were opened sequentially by the independent person. The participants were informed that two types of interventions were being compared.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>The intervention</title><p>All participants were instructed to take three capsules with blinded labels of either curcumin or placebo twice a day (total of six capsules per day) for 9 months continuously. Each curcumin capsule has curcuminoid content of 250 mg. Curcumin and identical placebo capsules were manufactured by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand. Patients were asked to bring all capsules back at the follow-up visit at 3, 6, and 9 months for assessing their compliance. Numbers of capsules taken by the subjects were recorded (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0116/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Preparation of curcuminoids capsules</title><p>Dried rhizomes of turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic> Linn.) grown in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand, were ground into powder. The turmeric powder was extracted with ethanol and evaporated at low pressure to obtain ethanol extract in the form of semisolid containing oleoresin and curcuminoids. The oleoresin was removed to yield curcuminoid extract (total curcuminoids content between 75 and 85%). The peak ratio of curcumin:demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin in the extract was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The extract (calculated for 250 mg of curcuminoids) was filled into capsules under the Good Manufacturing Procedures standard. Fingerprints of the extract and a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of the preparation in the extract are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0116/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was assessed by numbers of the subjects in the curcumin-treated or placebo-treated groups diagnosed with T2DM according to the ADA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Secondary outcomes were also measured as follows: changes of the &#x003b2;-cell functions (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]-&#x003b2;, C-peptide, and proinsulin/insulin ratio), insulin resistance (IR) by HOMA-IR, obesity (body weight), abdominal obesity (waist circumference [WC]), and anti-inflammatory cytokine (adiponectin). Adverse effects of curcumin were determined by elevated creatinine &#x02265;1.2 mg/dL and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT &#x02265;3 times the upper limit of normal value range, and any symptoms of patient complaints were recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

We recorded demographic data at the baseline; the researchers administered a questionnaire on medical history and medication, and measured body weight, height, and vital signs. The abdominal obesity/WC were measured by tape horizontally, midway between the inferior margin of the wrist and the superior border of the iliac crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Histories of CAD and cerebrovascular disease were tracked from the subjects&#x02019; medical records. The diagnosis of CAD, based on the presence of angina symptoms and abnormalities in resting electrocardiogram, was also assessed at baseline and during each follow-up visit (at 3, 6, and 9 months). Hypertension was determined by history of high blood pressure (&#x02265;130/85 mmHg). Dyslipidemia was defined by any of the following: total cholesterol &#x02265;200 mg/dL, triglycerides &#x02265;150 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol &#x02265;100 mg/dL, and/or HDL cholesterol &#x02264;35 mg/dL or taking lipid-lowering drugs. BMD, a known fracture risk, was analyzed at the baseline and at 9 months after starting the intervention by dual X-ray absorptiometry (QDR 4500; Hologic) at the level of the lumbar spine region. OGTT at 2 h was performed in all subjects by taking 75 g oral glucose solution after overnight fasting; and then 2 h later, blood glucose level was measured. Blood was collected at 8:00 <sc>am</sc> from the antecubital vein while the subjects were in the recumbent position after an overnight fasting. Plasma samples for insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and adiponectin assays were frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the analysis of hormones were measured. FPG, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured according to the standard procedures. Plasma insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, and adiponectin concentrations were determined using the radioimmunoassay kits from Millipore (St. Charles, MO) with a &#x003b3; scintillation counter, which is calibrated for <sup>125</sup>I measurement. HOMA-&#x003b2;, C-peptide, and the proinsulin/insulin ratio were measured for &#x003b2;-cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

These indicated that curcumin treatment may result in better &#x003b2;-cell function in the prediabetic population. HOMA-IR clinically represents IR. We found that in the curcumin-treated group, HOMA-IR was significantly lower when compared with that of the placebo group. From these results, we believe that curcumin intervention in the prediabetic population can prevent T2DM conversion and lower the IR level by maintaining healthy &#x003b2;-cell functions.</p><p>Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory cytokine known to play a positive role in pathogenesis of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). It has been shown that a higher adiponectin level is associated with a lower risk of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Our study showed that curcumin intervention significantly increases adiponectin levels. Curcumin has also been shown to reduce inflammation by downregulating other inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, leptin, and resistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In an in vivo diabetic mouse model, curcumin treatment significantly reduced macrophage infiltration of white adipose tissue and reversed many of the inflammatory derangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Because inflammation is one of the main causes of &#x003b2;-cell degradation, we hypothesize that the anti-inflammation activity of curcumin is a key factor for the curcumin&#x02019;s antidiabetic property.</p><p>Of note, we observed from our study the conversion rate of the placebo-treated group during a period of 12 months (from first screening to the end of study) to be 16.7%, which is significantly higher than that in a well-known American study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We reasoned that the high conversion rate may be specific to the ethnicity of the subjects. However, because of a lack of data on conversion rate in Thai prediabetes, we cannot directly verify our data. We then compared our result to a diabetes study conducted in a large Thai cohort by Aekplakorn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the Electric Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) study. In this study, risk scores were developed from a Thai cohort of 2,677 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The EGAT study identified a set of strong risk factors that accelerate the development of T2DM among the Thai population; these are old age, high BMI, high WC, hypertension, and history of diabetes in parent or sibling. We found that these factors also influenced our study (see the health parameter of the subject at the baseline in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Our subjects are mostly of old age, with high BMI (according to Asian standards), high WC, and some with hypertension and a history of diabetes in parent or sibling.</p><p>When we analyzed data based on the instruction from the EGAT study, we found that the prediabetic subjects from our study were assigned with high-risk scores (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0116/-/DC1">Supplementary Tables 4&#x02013;6</ext-link>). When we followed the EGAT calculation, the estimated overall incidence rate (normalized to a period of 12 months) from our study would be 21.8% (within 12 months, an estimation of 21.8% of the prediabetic subjects would develop T2DM). We observed 16.4%, which is well within the estimation (not higher than expected).</p><p>Therefore, we believe that the high conversion rates found in the present study are a common characteristic of Thai prediabetes.</p><p>Several studies have shown that traditional Chinese herbs and dietary supplements may have potential antidiabetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Although promising, most of these studies could not be easily interpreted, quite often because of inadequate study designs, such as lack of randomized control trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), small sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), or lack of safety information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our study was designed and set up specifically to overcome those previous problems. Our study showed that the curcumin extract can effectively prevent the prediabetic population from developing T2DM. Although we found that the results were quite remarkable, a longer trial may be required to see if the curcumin-treated prediabetic population will eventually develop T2DM.</p><p>We found that a 9-month treatment of curcumin was rather safe. We have not found any significant adverse effect caused by curcumin treatment when compared to the placebo treatment. Despite losing some body weight and WC, all of the subjects treated with curcumin appeared to be healthy. Because of its benefits and safety, we propose that curcumin extract may be used for an intervention therapy for the prediabetic population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
