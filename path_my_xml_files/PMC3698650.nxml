In each patient pairs of striae alba with similar shape and size and approximately symmetrical site, were selected.</p><p>Totally, 92 striae in 6 participants were selected and divided into two matched groups, with 46 striae in each. Left sided and right sided striae were randomly selected to be enrolled in either group.
