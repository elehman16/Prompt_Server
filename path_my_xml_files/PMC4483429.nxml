exercises with visual feedback on the activation of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and
vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in young adults with an increased quadriceps angle
(Q-angle). [Subjects] This study used a motion analysis program (Dartfish, Switzerland) to
select 20 young adults with an increased Q-angle, who were then divided into a squat group
that received visual feedback (VSG, n=10) and a squat group that received no visual
feedback (SG, n=10). [Methods] The intensity of exercises was increased every two weeks
over a six-week exercise period in both groups. A visual marker was attached to the
patella of the subjects in the VSG, and they then performed squat exercises with a maximum
of 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion within a route marked on a mirror. The SG performed squat exercises
with a maximum 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion without attaching a visual feedback device. [Results]
Analysis of the muscle activation due to 90&#x000b0; squat exercises indicated that both groups
had statistically significant increases in activation of the VL. The VSG exhibited
statistically significant increases in activation of the VMO. [Conclusion] This study
confirmed that squat exercises with visual feedback are effective in activation of the VMO
and VL muscles. The findings are meaningful in terms of preventing the occurrence of
patellofemoral pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Q-angle</kwd><kwd>Visual feedback squat exercise</kwd><kwd>VMO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The structure of the knee joint provides a high level of resistance that enables weight
support, activity control, and the bearing of heavy loads, so the knee joint is in charge of
weight-bearing and has a wide range of motion (ROM)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. From a biomechanical perspective, the quadriceps femoris group,
iliotibial band, adductor magnus, adductor longus, pes anserine group, and biceps femoris
work as knee joint stabilizers for the patellofemoral joint<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patellar alignment and tracking are determined by the amount of
force and the direction of soft tissues around the patellofemoral joint. In particular, the
vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle works as a medial patellar stabilizer<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An increase in the Q-angle increases the pressure on the patellofemoral joint<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and can give rise to anterior knee pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. An excessive Q-angle can result from
imbalance between the VMO and the vastus lateralis (VL) muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This imbalance leads to lateral gliding and incorrect
tracking of the patella, thereby causing pain by increasing the pressure on the
patellofemoral contact area<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Weakening of
the VMO is especially regarded as an important cause of knee imbalance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Women showed a greater increase in the Q-angle than in men
due to their wider pelvises, which can cause malalignment of the genu valgum<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patellofemoral pain is also reported to be
about twice as common in women than in men<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, selective strength training for the VMO is of great
importance to secure balance and stability in the VMO and VL<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Squat exercises are generalized lower-extremity closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercises<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study suggested their application as
a safe and effective exercise method that minimizes stress in the patellofemoral joint
within its functional range<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. McClelland
et al. stated that exercises using a visual feedback device are effective for symmetrical
pattern reeducation training of knee joint exercises<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. McConnell also reported that this type of real-time information
delivery induced selective strengthening of the VMO<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Comparison and analysis of the action potentials of different muscles during muscle
strengthening exercises in the knee joint are also important elements in identifying the
effects of these exercises. Evaluation of exercises using an electromyogram (EMG) provides
information on bioelectric activities related to the start of muscle contraction and muscle
control actions, so the use of EMG is effective in these kinds of studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several previous studies reported that
EMG-based visual feedback exercises positively affect the alignment of lower extremities in
young women with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), but their application has not been
generalized.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to compare and analyze the muscle activation of the VMO
and VL due to performance of visual feedback exercises in young adults with a large Q-angle,
thereby verifying the extent of active improvement of control ability. The overall goal was
to suggest a more general exercise method that can prevent pain occurring in the knee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used a motion analysis program (Dartfish, Switzerland) to select 20 young adults
with an increased static Q-angle, who were then divided into two groups. One group underwent
squat exercises with visual feedback (visual feedback squat group; VSG, n=10), and the other
group performed squat exercises with no visual feedback (squat group; SG, n=10). The average
age, height, weight, static Q-angle, and Kujala patellaofemoral score (KPS) in the VSG were
22.60&#x000b1;1.83&#x02005;years, 167.00&#x000b1;7.45&#x02005;cm, 63.80&#x000b1;12.01&#x02005;kg, 17.03&#x000b1;0.54&#x000b0;, and 83.20&#x000b1;2.83, respectively.

subjects, who then agreed to participate. They also signed a written consent form according
to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects were young adults
with a larger static Q-angle than normal as determined using a motion analysis program
(Dartfish, Switzerland). In addition, they had to score at least 80 points, but below 90
points, for the KPS, and they had to have no medical history of undergoing orthopedic
surgery or treatment in the lower extremities including the knee joint, no visual field
defects nor abnormalities in vestibular organs, and no deformities in the knee joint, hip
joint, and foot.</p><p>Before the experiment, the tester demonstrated the designed exercises to help the subjects
understand the experiment&#x02019;s progression and procedures, and then all subjects were
instructed to practice for five minutes to become familiar with the squat positions. The
exercise program consisted of a warm-up, main exercises, and a cooldown. The warm-up and
cool-down exercises were identical in the VSG and SG groups. For the main exercises, the VSG
performed squat exercises with visual feedback, whereas the SG performed squat exercises
without visual feedback. The intensity of the exercises in this progressive exercise program
was increased every two weeks the course of a six-week period.</p><p>Visual feedback in the VSG consisted of marks attached to a mirror that provided a visual
route that guided the ideal alignment of the lower extremities. In addition, while each
subject&#x02019;s knee joint was extended in the sagittal plane, a visual marker was attached to the
upper side of the patella. The distance between the visual marker on the subject&#x02019;s knee
joint and the lines guiding the visual route on the mirror was set as 1&#x02005;m. Within the lines
guiding the visual route, the subject performed squat exercises while gradually increasing
the level of knee flexion, with the maximum being 90&#x000b0;.</p><p>In the SG, each subject performed squat exercises without wearing a visual feedback device
and also gradually increased the level of knee flexion, with the maximum being 90&#x000b0;. For the
warm-up, all subjects performed walking in the functional exercise system while maintaining
a balance in the lower extremities and stretching exercises for shortened muscles related to
increases in the Q-angle. For the main exercises, the VSG performed squat exercises with
visual feedback, and the SG performed squat exercises without visual feedback. During weeks
1 and 2, the subjects performed one set of 20 squat exercises, which consisted of 20 squats,
at 90&#x000b0;of knee flexion. During weeks 3 and 4, they performed two sets of squat exercises.
During weeks 5 and 6, they performed three sets of squat exercises. The cooldown consisted
of walking on a treadmill for five minutes.</p><p>The muscle activation of the VMO and VL was measured with each subject in a 90&#x000b0; squat
position using a surface EMG (Noraxon Myosystem DTS, USA). The EMG signals were standardized
by measuring the muscle activation of the VMO and VL during maximal voluntary isometric
contraction by conducting a manual muscle test. The data values underwent RMS processing for
five seconds, and the average EMG signal for three seconds, excluding the first and last
second, was used as 100% MVC. For statistical analyses, comparisons of the VMO and VL within
each group before and after the experiment were verified using paired t-tests. Differences
between the two groups in values before and after the experiment were compared by
independent t-tests. Fisher&#x02019;s least significant difference (LSD) was employed as a post hoc
test. Data were statistically processed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows, and the statistical
significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Analysis of the muscle activation due to 90&#x000b0; squat exercises indicated that both groups had

adults with an increased Q-angle by dividing the subjects into a squat exercise group that
was provided with visual feedback (VSG) and a squat exercise group that received no visual
feedback (SG). The effects of visual feedback exercises that are easily accessible in daily
life are meaningful in terms of preventive medicine. Therefore, this study was undertaken to
verify the effects of new, easily accessible visual feedback exercises.</p><p>Recent relevant studies have focused on how to improve the control of the VMO, strengthen
muscles functionally, and improve muscle performance with regard to the patella, rather than
solely focusing on muscle strengthening<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fehr et al. reported increases in the KPS following application of
CKC exercises in a group of patients with PFPS<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jae-Yeong Kang reported that the measurement of the Q-angle at 60&#x000b0;
of knee flexion resulted in statistically significant decreases in a CKC exercise group that
used EMG biofeedback<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Surface EMG analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the results of treatment during
treatment processes<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hyeon-Hee Lee
reported that patients with patellofemoral pain showed statistically significant declines in
muscle activation of the VMO based on surface EMG readings<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the Q-angle measurements were 17.03&#x000b1;2.01&#x000b0; in
the VSG and 16.86&#x000b1;2.41&#x000b0; in the SG, which confirmed increases in the Q-angle compared with
the average levels of normal adults. Raveendranath et al. reported that the average
measurement values for the Q-angle in normal adult women were larger than those in men<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study noted that an increase in
the Q-angle over normal levels led to genu valgum and could cause PFPS due to excessive
pressure<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
analysis of muscle activation following 90&#x000b0; squat exercises showed statistically significant
increases in the VMO activation in the VSG.</p><p>Grossi et al. reported statistically significant increases in muscle activation in both an
PFPS group and the general groups during 60&#x000b0; squatting<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Seo-Yi Park also reported that, among CKC exercises, squat and
step-up/down exercises yielded statistically significant increases in activation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gi-Cheol Kim analyzed the muscle
activation ratios of the VMO and VL when subjects performed squat exercises with different
angle variations, and found statistically greater effects in the group that performed
biofeedback squat exercises<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. They also
compared the average differences between the biofeedback and general squat exercise groups
and reported greater effects with biofeedback squat exercises than with general squat
exercises at all tested angles (30&#x000b0;, 60&#x000b0;, and 90&#x000b0;). In the present study, measurement of
muscle activation before the experiment showed that the VMO had a higher level of muscle
activation than the VL. Both the VSG and SG exhibited statistically significant increases in
muscle activation of the VL after the treatments; however, only the VSG showed a
statistically significant increase in activity of the VMO. These findings suggest that squat
exercises with visual feedback are more effective in activating the VMO than squat exercises
without visual feedback. Squat exercises with visual feedback are also effective in
activating both the VMO and VL.</p><p>The limitation of this study is its focus on young adults with an increased Q-angle, which
precluded the identification of pain reduction effects in patients who have pain. However,
this study is considered meaningful in terms of helping to prevent potential patellofemoral
pain using visual feedback squat exercises that activate the VMO, a primary cause of
patellofemoral pain. Therefore, this study provides basic data regarding the muscle
activation of the VMO and VL, but additional systematic studies should be conducted in the
future using more diverse subjects and variables.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name></person-group>: Clinical Kinesiology.
