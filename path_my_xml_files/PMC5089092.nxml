Three milliliters aliquots of 1% lidocaine were instilled over the vocal cords, carina, main bronchi, and the segment that required intervention. A well-trained physician was responsible for TCI sedation (Injectomat TIVA Agilia, Fresenius Kabi, France), monitoring the level of sedation and vital signs, and providing supportive interventions if necessary. The patients were randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures into 5 groups on the basis of a computer-generated random list (Microsoft Excel, Seattle, WA). Group 1: normal saline was given 2&#x0200a;minutes before the administration of propofol, and alfentanil 2.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg was given immediately before the administration of propofol; Group 2: normal saline was given 2&#x0200a;minutes before the administration of propofol, and alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg was given immediately before the administration of propofol; Group 3: alfentanil 2.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg was given 2&#x0200a;minutes before the administration of propofol, and normal saline was given immediately before the administration of propofol; Group 4: alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg was given 2&#x0200a;minutes before the administration of propofol, and normal saline was given immediately before the administration of propofol; Group 5: normal saline was given 2&#x0200a;minutes and immediately before the administration of propofol as a control. The bronchoscopist, physician in charge of sedation, and patients were blinded to the patient distribution. A staff nurse responsible for the preparation of alfentanil and normal saline (placebo) was the only person who had access to the random list. Alfentanil or placebo was prepared with the same volume for each patient in a syringe with no label.</p><p>After the administration of alfentanil or placebo, the calculated effect site concentration (Ce) of induction was set at 2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL, titrated by 0.2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/mL in order to maintain a stable sedation level and vital signs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[16]</sup></xref> The Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale (OAA/S) was evaluated every 30&#x0200a;seconds after the patient closed their eyes.

The results demonstrated that alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg given immediately or 2&#x0200a;minutes before propofol infusion achieved faster induction with less dose of propofol and better cough profile evaluated by physicians performing sedation than control group 5, but alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg given immediately propofol infusion caused significant hypoxemia during induction than control group. Therefore, alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg given immediately propofol infusion cannot be recommended. Alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg given 2&#x0200a;minutes before propofol infusion was the possible potential induction regimen for TCI propofol infusion in FB sedation.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to ascertain the regimen of alfentanil in propofol infusion for FB sedation to achieve an acceptable benefit and risk ratio, and an induction regimen of alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg (group 2 and 4) was found to provide a better sedative profile with regard to induction time, propofol dose of induction, and cough severity, although the benefit in coughing was not significant when assessed by the patients, probably because of the amnesia effects of sedation. Shifting the administration of alfentanil to 2&#x0200a;minutes before propofol infusion (group 4) ameliorated hypoxemia.</p><p>Compared with group 5 (propofol alone), group 4 used a lower amount of propofol by 10&#x0223c;20&#x0200a;mg and saved 2&#x0200a;minutes in induction, implicating the synergistic effect between alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg and propofol infusion. This effect was also observed in the induction time. A recent study reported that alfentanil in combination with propofol for FB sedation did not improve the quality of sedation compared with propofol alone, although this combination resulted in greater respiratory depression.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[11]</sup></xref> However, the sedative protocol was fundamentally different from the present study, in that they used a patient-controlled sedation device with a mixture of alfentanil and propofol. The sedative level was relatively shallow because the drugs were administered according to the patients&#x02019; self-perception of discomfort, and the majority of patients underwent 2 procedures. Most importantly, alfentanil was given in every bolus, which is different from our study and may be the reason for the higher incidence of hypoxemia in sedation with both alfentanil and propofol than in sedation with propofol alone.</p><p>The interaction between propofol and alfentanil is complicated at both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics levels.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[6]</sup></xref> Alfentanil and propofol can decrease the clearance of each other, and alfentanil has been shown to decrease the amount of propofol needed for induction of anesthesia in a synergistic manner.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

The reason for this difference is probably due to the bronchoscopists focusing more on completing the complicated procedures, and the physicians in charge of bronchoscopy tending to observe the patients more thoroughly. Furthermore, from the point of view of the patients, cough severity was excellent in all 5 groups. Therefore, our findings confirm that this sedation regimen offers a high degree of satisfaction.</p><p>There were no differences in terms of the incidence of propofol injection related pain among the 5 groups. This may be because the dose of alfentanil was not high enough to suppress pain. In previous studies, 15&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg&#x0223c;1&#x0200a;mg alfentanil was used for propofol-induced pain; however, this increases the risk of hypoxemia during FB sedation.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>]</sup>
</p><p>The present study has several limitations. We used TCI for propofol administration because TCI integrates individual variables and then provides precise pharmacokinetic control to achieve a steady plasma concentration and improved hemodynamic stability.<sup>[</sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>]</sup> However, TCI is not always available in a clinical setting. We focused on the optimal regimen for induction, and the outcomes were mostly related to induction. During the minutes before achieving the desired sedation, differences between different administration protocols, for example, TCI, manually controlled infusion, or bolus of propofol may not be too substantial. Despite these limitations, our findings provide scientific evidence with regard to sedative induction for FB sedation. We hope that this study prompts further research to improve the safety and efficacy of FB sedation.</p><p>In conclusion, induction with alfentanil 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg given immediately before propofol TCI sedation for bronchoscopy is risky particular for hypoxemia. Further study is required to define conclusions about the induction regimens of alfentanil 2.5 and 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Yu-Jr Lin, PhD, for statistic consultation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, Ce = effect site concentration, FB = flexible bronchoscopy, FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FVC = forced expiratory vital capacity, OAA/S = Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation scale, TCI = target-controlled infusion, VAS = visual analogue scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Authorship: YLL had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: CHH, YLL, TYL, SML, HPK.
