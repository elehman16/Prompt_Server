AE treatment is a significant cost burden for health care providers. The purpose of the trial is to investigate whether daily application of emollients for the first year of life can prevent AE developing in high-risk infants (first-degree relative with asthma, AE or allergic rhinitis).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a protocol for a pragmatic, two-arm, randomised controlled, multicentre trial. Up to 1400 term infants at high risk of developing AE will be recruited through the community, primary and secondary care in England. Participating families will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive general infant skin-care advice, or general skin-care advice plus emollients with advice to apply daily to the infant for the first year of life. Families will not be blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome will be a blinded assessment of AE at 24&#x000a0;months of age using the UK Working Party Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Eczema. Secondary outcomes are other definitions of AE, time to AE onset, severity of AE (EASI and POEM), presence of other allergic diseases including food allergy, asthma and hay fever, allergic sensitisation, quality of life, cost-effectiveness and safety of the emollients. Subgroup analyses are planned for the primary outcome according to filaggrin genotype and the number of first-degree relatives with AE and other atopic diseases. Families will be followed up by online and postal questionnaire at 3, 6, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months with a face-to-face visit at 24&#x000a0;months. Long-term follow-up until 60&#x000a0;months will be via annual questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will demonstrate whether skin-barrier enhancement through daily emollient for the first year of life can prevent AE from developing in high-risk infants. If effective, this simple and cheap intervention has the potential to result in significant cost savings for health care providers throughout the world by preventing AE and possibly other associated allergic diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN registry; ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN21528841">ISRCTN21528841</ext-link>.

Atopic eczema usually starts in infancy and around 40% of cases persist into adulthood, especially those with early onset and widespread disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The family impact of caring for a child with moderate or severe atopic eczema is greater than that in caring for children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, mainly due to sleep deprivation, employment loss, time to care for atopic eczema and financial costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Children with atopic eczema, especially those with severe disease, are at increased risk of also developing other allergic (immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated) diseases including food allergy, allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Eczema is often the first manifestation of the so-called &#x02018;atopic march&#x02019;, in which a child progresses from atopic eczema to food allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Together, these atopic diseases are the most common chronic diseases of childhood and represent a major financial burden to the UK National Health Service (NHS), with direct costs estimated at over &#x000a3;1 billion per annum in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is a strong association between atopic eczema during infancy and the risk of food allergy, with the highest prevalence of food allergy reported in early onset and severe atopic eczema. A causal link has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and this is supported by evidence from mouse and human studies showing that sensitisation to some foods can occur across a defective skin barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Atopic eczema is highly heritable and shows strong familial clustering. Prevalent mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (<italic>FLG</italic>), a key skin-barrier protein, represent the strongest and most consistent known genetic risk factor for atopic eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Emollient (moisturiser) therapy is intended to improve the barrier function of the skin. An emollient provides lipids to the stratum corneum, which in turn, improves skin hydration by trapping water. Emollients also help to prevent inflammation caused by external irritants as evidenced by their benefit in preventing irritant occupational hand eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In premature babies, emollients have been shown to reduce the incidence of skin inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and in people with atopic eczema, to reduce flares of atopic eczema (secondary prevention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Primary prevention is a highly desirable goal in a complex chronic disease like atopic eczema with no cure. If primary prevention of atopic eczema using a strategy of early skin-barrier enhancement with simple low-cost emollients is effective, it would represent a significant cost saving for health care providers through reduced treatment and appointment costs. Further cost savings would result if early skin-barrier enhancement prevents sensitisation and associated food allergy, asthma or allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even if the frequency of atopic eczema cannot be significantly reduced, a shift in the severity distribution of atopic eczema towards milder cases could improve quality of life and reduce carer burden and health care provider costs.</p><p id="Par31">We carried out pilot studies to inform the design of this trial. A functional mechanistic study provided evidence for the choice of emollients for this trial and showed they are not associated with any harm to the skin barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A multicentre, randomised controlled pilot trial of 124 families showed that families found the intervention acceptable and thus it would be feasible to conduct a larger trial of emollients for the prevention of atopic eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Clinical outcomes showed that infants in the emollient group had a significantly reduced risk of developing atopic eczema by 6&#x000a0;months of age compared to those in the control group (43% versus 22%, respectively, relative risk, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28&#x02013;0.90; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.017). A further trial from Japan that included 118 infants showed similar results, with 32% fewer infants in the emollient group developing atopic eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This large, pragmatic trial (the Barrier Enhancement for Eczema Prevention (BEEP) trial) described here is now required to confirm the results seen in these small, short-term trials and to establish the long-term effects of emollients for preventing atopic eczema and associated allergic diseases.</p><p id="Par32">This is an abridged protocol based on protocol version 5.0 dated 26 October 2016. The full protocol is available on the trial website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

It is a pragmatic design in which investigators have no scheduled contact with the families between randomisation and the 24-month visit in order to limit any influence on adherence, minimise the risk of un-blinding and keep the research nurse resources required to a reasonable level. All other contact is with the trial coordinating centre (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Screening for eligibility and the consent process is carried out either antenatally or shortly after delivery.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par42">The trial is recruiting families across England. Identification is via primary care (mailshot invitations to participate), secondary care (through antenatal care, dermatology clinics and posters), and in the community via direct advertising. Recruiting sites are mainly secondary care centres, with a smaller number of primary care centres involved. A list of recruiting centres can be found in the acknowledgements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par43">Infants at high-risk of developing atopic eczema, defined as having a first-degree relative with parent-reported physician-diagnosed atopic eczema, asthma or allergic rhinitis, are eligible for the trial. The infant must be no more than 21&#x000a0;days old at the point of randomisation, the mother must be aged at least 16&#x000a0;years and the consenting adult must be able to understand English. Infants are not eligible if they are born prior to 37&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation, have a severe skin condition at time of randomisation that would make it difficult to assess the skin for signs of atopic eczema or that would preclude the use of emollients (such as dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, ichthyosiform erythroderma or lamellar ichthyosis), or if they have a serious health issue that would make participation difficult for the family (e.g. neonatal sepsis or major congenital abnormalities). Only the first born of any multiple births will be randomised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par44">Both groups receive general skin-care advice to avoid soap and bubble bath, use mild cleansers and shampoos that have been specifically designed for babies, and avoid using baby wipes based on NICE guidance on infant skin care, July 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The use of bath oils is also discouraged unless directed to do so by a health care professional. Furthermore, the intervention group receives additional advice to apply emollient daily for the first year of life and are supplied with emollient free of charge. Parents are able to choose between Doublebase Gel&#x000ae; (Dermal Laboratories Ltd.) and Diprobase Cream&#x000ae; (Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme Ltd.) and can switch emollient during the trial should they wish to. These emollients were chosen because they have a similar formulation to many emollient creams used in the UK, which would mean that the results of this trial would be applicable to a range of emollients with similar formulation and not restricted to the two emollients used in this trial. Emollients containing sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) as an emulsifier were specifically excluded because they have been shown to have negative effects on the skin barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The skin-care advice for both groups is sent to families within 2&#x000a0;days of randomisation in the form of a booklet and a short online video. These materials will be available as part of the final trial report.</p><p id="Par45">The intervention group advice includes how to apply the emollient; at least once daily all over the infant (the scalp can be avoided) and the emollient should always be applied bathing, even if it has previously been applied that day. Parents are advised to start the emollient as soon as possible after birth and definitely within 3&#x000a0;weeks and the start date of emollient usage is recorded by the trial coordinating centre during a routine 2-week post-randomisation phone call. Emollient is continued until the child is 1&#x000a0;year old and with parental reported usage collected at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The trial coordinating centre keeps a record of the quantity of emollient provided to each participating family.</p><p id="Par46">If the infant develops skin problems during the trial, parents are advised to seek medical help in the usual way. Any eczema that develops will be treated as per normal practice regardless of treatment group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary outcome</title><p id="Par47">The primary outcome is a diagnosis of atopic eczema at 24&#x000a0;months, defined as meeting the UK Working Party Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Eczema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] which assesses signs and symptoms present over the past year. The criteria will be applied by a trained research nurse blinded to treatment allocation. Applying these criteria when the infants are 24&#x000a0;months old will detect atopic eczema that has developed between the ages of 12 and 24&#x000a0;months and will, therefore, exclude transient eczematous rashes common in the first year of life that are often not true atopic eczema.

During the trial, access to the sequence is confined to the IT programmer at NCTU. Randomisation is stratified by recruiting centre and number of immediate family members (parents or siblings) with atopic disease (1, 2, or more than 2). Recruiting centre staff randomise participants via a web-based randomisation system developed and maintained by NCTU. Recruiting centre staff are not sent the results of the randomisation. It is not possible to blind parents as to which group they are in, but the trial nurses conducting the skin examination at the 2-year visit are blinded to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study procedures and data collection</title><p id="Par91">The screening and consent visit take place either in the family home or at the recruiting site, depending on parent preference, and consent obtained by the trial nurse (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Separate optional consent is obtained for the <italic>FLG</italic> genotyping, skin-prick testing and food challenges.

Parents are sent questionnaires online (or paper if requested) at 3, 6, 12, 18, 36, 48 and 60&#x000a0;months to collect outcome data. There is a second face-to-face visit with the trial nurse at 24&#x000a0;months, again in the family home or at the recruiting centre depending on parent preference. At this 24-month visit the blinded trial nurse conducts the skin examination for the diagnostic criteria and the EASI, completes the questionnaires, and (where consent is given) takes the saliva sample and carries out the skin-prick test. A summary of the data collection can be found in Table 1: The schedule of trial assessments. The trial nurses are fully trained in the diagnosis of atopic eczema and carrying out the EASI.</p><p id="Par92">Saliva samples are collected via the child spitting into a pot or swabs taken from the inside of the child&#x02019;s cheek and sent to the Centre for Dermatology and Genetic Medicine, University of Dundee for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction by standard techniques and <italic>FLG</italic> genotyping for the most prevalent null mutations in the white European population (2282del4, R501X, S3247X and R2447X) according to published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Positive (1% histamine) and negative (0.9% saline) controls will also be used (Allergopharma, Germany). The trial nurses are fully trained in conducting skin-prick tests and emergency procedures in the highly unlikely event of any serious allergic reactions. Participants with a positive skin-prick test or history suggestive for food allergy in whom further investigation is required for a diagnosis of food allergy to be made are invited for a supervised oral food challenge conducted by experienced allergy nurses following standard procedures who are blinded to treatment allocation.

It will also show whether the intervention can delay the onset of atopic eczema, or whether it alters the severity distribution towards milder disease. The effect on any other atopic conditions associated with atopic eczema (allergic rhinitis, asthma and food allergy) will also be assessed. By assessing the <italic>FLG</italic> genotype of participants, the extent to which any effect of emollients can be modified by filaggrin haploinsufficiency will also be determined. Any differential effect according to <italic>FLG</italic> genotype could be used for a personalised approach to the future use of emollient for the prevention of atopic eczema.</p><p id="Par105">We have taken a pragmatic approach to all aspects of this trial including a limited number of exclusion criteria, interfering as little as possible in the use of the emollient, minimal follow-up and an intention-to-treat analysis. However, as with all pragmatic trials, there are some limitations. Families participating in the trial are likely to be more motivated to use the emollients than the average population. Even so, we may observe a null result due to poor adherence because of the pragmatic nature of the advice to use emollients, whereas the intervention may be effective under conditions that enhance adherence. We have included only families whose child is at higher risk of developing eczema due to family history of atopy, although other groups are planning trials in unselected-for risk populations. Also, we have only offered two emollients in this trial, but there are many others commonly prescribed or purchased by parents. If the trial demonstrates that this relatively cheap and simple intervention is effective in preventing atopic eczema, uptake of the intervention will result in reduced costs for health care providers such as the UK National Health Service. Furthermore, if any effect is extended to the prevention of other atopic conditions then the cost savings could be significantly greater.</p><p id="Par106">The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) journal series, and disseminated to health care providers and professional groups including health visitors, midwives, GPs, dermatologists and commissioners. Health care providers and professionals will then have the evidence required to make funding and health care decisions about emollients for preventing atopic eczema. We will inform all trial participants of the results of the main 2-year analysis and 5-year analysis and we will also post our results on the trial register. A variety of media outlets will be used to disseminate the results directly to pregnant women and new parents. Parents are often anxious to know whether their children will develop atopic eczema, especially those with experience of atopic eczema, and are keen to know what they can do minimise the risk. The results of this trial will help inform families whether emollients are an effective prevention strategy.</p><p id="Par107">Other trials of emollients and related interventions for the prevention of atopic eczema are being undertaken throughout the world, and we have formed a collaborative group to undertake a prospectively planned meta-analysis (PPMA) of such studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].
