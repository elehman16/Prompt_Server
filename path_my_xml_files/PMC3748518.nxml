This effectiveness trial conducted in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Uganda, compared a diagnostic and treatment package for malaria and pneumonia with presumptive treatment with anti-malarial drugs; artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). We enrolled 4,216 febrile children between 4 and 59 months of age in 2009&#x02013;2010. Compliance with the malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results was high in the intervention arm across the three countries, with only 4.9% (17 of 344) of RDT-negative children prescribed an ACT. Antibiotic overuse was more common: 0.9% (4 of 446) in Uganda, 38.5% (114 of 296) in Burkina Faso, and 44.6% (197 of 442) in Ghana. Fever clearance was high in both intervention and control arms at both Day 3 (97.8% versus 96.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.17) and Day 7 (99.2% versus 98.8%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.17). The use of diagnostic tests limits overuse of ACTs.

Sapon&#x000e9; and Kassena Nankana are situated in the Sudan-Sahelian eco-climatic zone, with a seasonal malaria transmission pattern. Iganga is situated in South Eastern Uganda with an equatorial climate and minimal seasonal variation in malaria transmission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> In Sapon&#x000e9;, malaria transmission is markedly seasonal, with most transmission occurring during the rainy season, and with an entomological inoculation rate (EIR) ranging from 50 to 200 infective bites/person/year. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the predominant malaria parasite accounting for more than 95% of infections in children &#x0003c; 5 years of age. The malaria burden is heaviest among children &#x0003c; 5 years of age, who experience an average of two clinical malaria episodes every transmission season. Iganga district has year-round malaria transmission, and over 90% of malaria cases are caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Transmission peaks are seen following the rains: i.e., April to June and September to December.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> The annual EIR is not known, but is reported to be &#x0003e; 500 infective bites/person/year in the neighboring district of Tororo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> In Kassena Nankana, malaria transmission occurs during most months of the year; however, there is a distinct seasonal pattern with the peak of transmission coinciding with the period of the major rains (May&#x02013;October) and the dry season (November&#x02013;April) seeing very low rates of malaria infection. Transmission has been estimated to be 418 infective bites/person/year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>Data were collected in Burkina Faso from August 2009 to June 2010, in Ghana from April 2009 to February 2010, and in Uganda from October 2009 to October 2010. The sites were selected by an advisory committee from those who responded to a call by TDR in 2006. Some variations in the methodology were unavoidable, because in each case the specific national health framework was followed. Because of varying sample size per country, and the ease of access to nationally available supplies, the studies started and ended at different times.</p><p>Twelve villages participated in the study in Burkina Faso, 16 in Ghana, and 14 in Uganda. In Burkina Faso, the 12 villages were selected from two community clinic catchment areas within the Sapon&#x000e9; Health District with an estimated total population of 9,000. The 16 villages selected in the Kassena-Nankana districts were drawn from 47 villages with a total population of 150,000 under continuous demographic surveillance. The 14 villages in Iganga were all drawn from Namungalwe sub-county, which has a population of &#x0223c;38,100 in 19 villages. Malaria, pneumonia, and diarrheal diseases are the leading causes of ill-health among children 1&#x02013;59 months of age in the three study areas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>We included children 6&#x02013;59 months of age (with the exception of Uganda where the lower limit was 4 months in line with national guidelines on the use of ACTs in children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) with measured fever or history of fever (last 24 hours), who presented to a CHW. Exclusion criteria included severe illness (according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illness [IMCI] guidelines), known chronic disease, reported anti-malarial or antibiotic treatment in the previous 2 weeks, or known sensitivity to the study medications.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design.</title><p>The study was designed to assess the effect of the use of a diagnostic and treatment package for iCCM, comprising RDTs and ACTs for malaria, RRTs and antibiotics for pneumonia, on recovery from fever, and the rational use of medicines.</p><p>We performed an open, cluster randomized two-arm trial in the three countries. Clusters were the villages (catchment populations) of individual CHWs. Within the study areas we excluded, for ethical reasons, clusters that were more than 5 km from a designated health facility where CHWs referred cases for special care to minimize non-completion of referral because of distance. A cluster randomized design was chosen over an individually randomized design to reduce contamination, facilitate supervision, reduce costs, and to ensure that the CHWs maintained the correct treatments based on the tests in the intervention arm and the presumptive treatment in the control arm.</p><p>In the intervention arm, CHWs assessed children with acute febrile illness for malaria using RDTs, and for pneumonia by counting their respiratory rate with RRTs. Treatment was then provided on the basis of the test results. Children with a positive RDT received artemether-lumefantrine in Burkina Faso and Uganda, and artesunate-amodiaquine in Ghana. Children with a high respiratory rate received amoxicillin in Ghana and Uganda, and cotrimoxazole in Burkina Faso. The criterion for antibiotic administration was the presence of a high respiratory rate, regardless of the presence of cough or difficult breathing, in contrast to WHO guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> Additionally, paracetamol (PCT) was provided to all children in whom both RDT and RRT were negative, and to children with an axillary temperature &#x0003e; 38.5&#x000b0;C.</p><p>In the control arm, all febrile children received ACTs based on a presumptive diagnosis of malaria as provided for in the current IMCI guidelines. In line with the protocol, CHWs in Burkina Faso and Uganda were not provided with antibiotics. In Ghana, in line with existing practice, CHWs in the control clusters were also supplied with amoxicillin that they could provide to children based on clinical judgment. Antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs were provided as 3-day treatment courses, whereas PCT was provided for 2 days, so that it did not interfere with the fever assessment on Day 3. The first dose of all treatments was administered under the supervision of the CHW, and if the child vomited within 30 minutes they were given another dose. The dosing schedule was explained to caregivers who then administered the remaining treatments at home.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Malaria RDTs used.</title><p>First Sign Malaria Pf Card Test (Unimed International, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), Paracheck Pf Rapid test for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Malaria (Device) (Orchid Biomedical System, Goa, India), and ICT Malaria Pf Cassette test (ICT Diagnostics South Africa) were used in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Uganda, respectively.

The CHWs were selected by their respective community, based on minimum criteria that included the ability to read and write clearly so that they would be able to complete the study Case Report form (CRF). In Burkina Faso new CHWs were selected, whereas in Uganda existing CHWs previously trained to provide anti-malarial drugs in the community as part of the community case management were used. In Ghana, existing community health nurses (living within the community and hired and trained by the Ghana Health Service to provide basic services) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size.</title><p>The estimated sample size for the study was 4,360 febrile children between 4 and 59 months of age, with Burkina Faso and Ghana contributing 1,200 each, and Uganda 1,960. The sample size was estimated using the simplified formula by Hayes and Bennett<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> for cluster randomized trials, with a power of 80% to detect an absolute difference in fever clearance 72 hours after initiation of treatment of 10% (85% against 75%) between the two arms with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The estimation took seasonality into account, and accounted for loss to follow-up. We assumed a coefficient of variation between clusters of 0.12.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Training.</title><p>The CHWs were taught how to take a history, recognize clinical features of uncomplicated malaria, and signs of severe illness requiring referral; preparation of thick blood films for malaria microscopy; the use of classification and treatment algorithms for malaria and pneumonia (intervention arm only); use of simple dosing guidelines based on age for ACTs and PCT; managing drug supplies; obtaining informed consent; and completing CRFs including documentation of reported signs and symptoms, physical examination results, and medications administered to the child. In cases where informed consent was declined, the child received standard presumptive management of fever with an ACT.</p><p>In addition, CHWs in the intervention arm were taught the clinical features of non-severe pneumonia; use of malaria RDTs; infection control measures; how to count respiratory rate; and the use of simple dosing guidelines based on age for antibiotics.</p><p>There was interactive training consisting of oral presentations, discussions, role play, and supervised hands-on practice for all the study CHWs. At the end of the training, facilitators assessed the competency of the CHWs to follow the algorithm, complete study forms, and for CHWs in the intervention arm the appropriate use of RDTs and RRTs, as reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>At the health facility level, health personnel were oriented on the treatment strategies in the two arms, and received refresher training on IMCI. These staff provided care to children referred from the study and provided supportive supervision to the CHWs.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Quality assurance plan.</title><p>The CHWs were supervised weekly by field supervisors to detect and correct any deviations from the protocol. During these visits, the following were monitored: completeness of data captured in the CRFs, respect of inclusion/exclusion criteria, drug administration, drug and RDT storage conditions, and assessment and follow-up of enrolled children.</p><p>At each supervisory visit three samples of RDTs were collected from the batch in use. The RDT samples were tested against a sample of blood confirmed positive by microscopy to ensure the RDTs were still functioning with adequate sensitivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></p><p>At the end of each month all CHWs attended a review meeting at the health center at which the assessment, treatment, and follow-up algorithms were reviewed, and problem areas were identified and discussed. The CHWs brought their registers and CRFs. The CHWs identified as having problems with a particular part of the algorithm were followed up and were provided with support and retraining by the study team. The accuracy of CHWs in performing the RDTs was assessed as part of each supervisory visit. When there were no patients at the time of the visit, CHWs were asked to demonstrate how they perform the procedure, including how they do the finger prick and how they read the RDT result. The CHWs were observed and reminded to perform the RDT in a well-lighted place.</p><p>Refresher training was provided to the health facility microscopists on malaria microscopy before enrollment started. Ten slides per month were selected for quality control (5 low density and 5 negative slides) using a random number system recommended by WHO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> and sent to a reference laboratory for rereading on a &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; basis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection methods.</title><p>All children who were tested for malaria on Day 0 also had a thick blood film prepared by the CHWs. The blood films were collected within 24 hours in all three sites by a fieldwork supervisor with a motorbike. Blood films were stained with 10% Giemsa stain for 10&#x02013;15 minutes and screened microscopically under a &#x000d7;100 oil immersion lens using a light microscope by a microscopist trained by the study teams and based at the referral center. A blood slide was taken at Day 0 in the control arm to enable a comparison of the prevalence of malaria in the two arms (in Uganda this was only done in a sub-sample of enrolled children across both dry and rainy seasons).</p><p>The number of parasites present per white blood cell was counted, and the figure multiplied by 8,000 (an average white blood cell count per &#x003bc;L) to give the parasite density.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> Slides were double read, and when there was a discrepancy between the two readings the slide was read again by an experienced/senior microscopist who was independent of this study and whose reading was considered final. The microscopy results were used to establish the accuracy of the RDTs when used in the communities. Children with a negative RDT, but with a positive slide reading were traced at home and treated with ACTs. All patient data were recorded on CRFs at all three sites.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Patient management and follow-up.</title><p>The CHWs reviewed children and completed the CRF on Days 0, 3, 7, and on unscheduled visit days. A review on Day 3 determined if a child had recovered from fever (temperature below 37.5&#x000b0;C as measured by a digital thermometer). Children in either arm who had not recovered were referred to a designated health center. All children not referred at Day 3 (clinically recovered) were reviewed on Day 7, and any fever relapse cases were referred to the health center. All children referred (Day 3 or 7) were examined by a trained project nurse, and managed according to IMCI guidelines. Children who did not come for scheduled visits were traced and assessed at home.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Study outcomes.</title><p>The primary outcome was resolution of fever at Day 3, whereas resolution of fever at Day 7, and the use of anti-malarial and antibiotic drugs were secondary outcomes.

In Ghana (where antibiotics were available in control clusters as well) 51.4% (300 of 584) of all children were prescribed antibiotics in the intervention clusters compared with 64.3% (380 of 591) in the control clusters (OR 1.7, 1.34&#x02013;2.17; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), suggesting less overprescription of antibiotics in the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Impact on fever clearance.</title><p>Fever clearance results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 3</xref>. There were high fever clearance rates across the countries and arms.

In each country, we adopted a pragmatic approach, following existing national policies. This resulted in some variations in what was actually done in each country. The package led to a clear improvement in the appropriate use of ACTs, and in Ghana, the only site in which antibiotics were available in the control arm, to fewer prescriptions of antibiotics. The vast majority of children recovered from fever in both the intervention and control groups, and no effect of the intervention on the clinical outcome (recovery from fever) were detected. The microscopy positivity rates reported from the three sites (54&#x02013;80%) are not for the general population, but for children who had been sick and were taken to CHWs for care. These rates are much higher than what would have been expected in a population-based sample.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></p><p>Inappropriate use of ACTs is a major concern, because it may lead to the development of resistance to these highly effective drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> The potential for misuse of ACTs could be particularly high at the community level, where ACTs are distributed by non-professional staff.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> The latest WHO malaria treatment guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> recommend parasitological confirmation before administering anti-malarial drugs to a patient presenting with fever in all areas, including highly malaria-endemic settings. The shift from symptom-based to RDT-based treatment with ACTs has major implications. It limits the over-diagnosis of malaria and thus the inappropriate use of ACTs and expenditure,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref> and reduces missed diagnosis of other causes of fever<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> at a time when a declining proportion of fevers in Africa are attributable to malaria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Administering ACTs only to patients with a positive RDT has led to dramatic reductions in the use of ACTs in Cambodia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> mainlandTanzania,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> and Zanzibar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref> Nevertheless, in some health facility settings substantial proportions of patients with negative test results were reported to receive ACTs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref> although improvements in adherence to treatment guidelines were achieved after intensive training in some cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></p><p>Poor adherence to RDT results has also been reported when febrile episodes are managed at the community level by CHWs, with up to 58% of patients with a negative RDT result being treated with an antimalarial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref> Poor compliance with referral advice by patients with fever but with a negative RDT result has also been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref> It is noteworthy that in both these studies there was no alternative diagnostic test, nor treatment of RDT-negative patients. However, very high levels of appropriate prescription of ACTs after rapid malaria testing were achieved in Chikankata, Zambia in a program in which febrile children were assessed for pneumonia, and antibiotic treatment was provided as appropriate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>; similar findings were reported more recently in another study in Zambia that used an intensive training and supervision model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></p><p>The results of our study in three sub-Saharan African countries, conducted with a similar design to the one in Chikankata, confirm that inappropriate use of ACTs is extremely rare (&#x0003c; 5% of cases) when alternative diagnostic tests and treatment of other conditions are provided to patients with negative RDT results (in our study children with fever and a negative RDT were prescribed antibiotic treatment if there were signs of pneumonia, and PCT if there were none). On the contrary, when anti-malarial treatment is administered to all febrile children, without prior parasitological confirmation, as in the control clusters of our study, an important proportion of cases are treated with ACTs unnecessarily. This study was conducted in areas of high malaria prevalence, confirmed both by microscopic examination and RDT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and 2). It is important to note that the use of RDTs to guide treatment decisions in these high transmission settings resulted in substantial overprescription of ACTs, compared with treatment based on the results of blood slide microscopy. Nonetheless, based on the proportion of negative RDT results in the intervention clusters of the study sites, the proportion of unnecessary use of ACTs was estimated to vary between 12% and 26% across the three sites. This finding has public health implications, suggesting that a disease management approach based on a diagnostic and treatment package improves the appropriate use of ACTs, and provides alternative treatment of other causes of febrile illness.</p><p>Inappropriate use (non-compliance with study guidelines) of antibiotics was high in two study sites. More than a third of children with a normal RR received antibiotic treatment in Ghana and Burkina Faso, whereas 27% and 14% of children with a high RR did not receive any antibiotics in the two countries, respectively. In Ghana, however, where CHWs could prescribe antibiotics in control clusters based on their clinical judgment, 64.3% of children were treated with antibiotics in control clusters compared with 51.4% in intervention clusters. In this study, we used only a high respiratory rate as the criterion for antibiotic use, whereas the WHO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> recommends the presence of cough or difficulty breathing together with high respiratory rate as the criteria. This is a limitation of this study, and fewer children would have been treated with antibiotics under WHO guidelines than were treated using a criterion of rapid breathing alone. Overuse of antibiotics is a well-known phenomenon at all levels of the health system in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, as reported by the WHO,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> and has been recently reported to be aggravated by the introduction of RDT in the decision algorithm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> In Uganda, over- or under-prescription of antibiotics was rare, accounting for only 0.9% and 1.7% of cases. This difference between Uganda and the other sites may be explained by the more intensive supervision program of the CHWs, and by local treatment practices. It is possible that local antibiotic prescription practices influenced behavior in the intervention clusters. Vialle-Valentin and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref> have reported higher antibiotic use among under-five children in Ghana compared with other countries including Uganda.</p><p>The study was conducted in areas with microscopic malaria prevalence ranging between 54% and 80%. Cost-effectiveness of the integrated package compared with presumptive malaria treatment may be lower in areas with high rather than low malaria transmission, if judged only by savings in anti-malarial treatments. However, the WHO now recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed with a diagnostic test before treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> in all settings; furthermore, the development of an integrated package fitting all epidemiologic settings, regardless of the relative prevalence of malaria and pneumonia, has obvious advantages in terms of translation into policy. It is also possible that the overuse of medicines may be higher in settings with lower malaria prevalence, in which many of the RDTs would be negative. It will be important to explore this issue further in these lower transmission settings.</p><p>The primary endpoint of our study was fever clearance 3 days from initiation of treatment. One might expect a higher proportion of children with fever to be afebrile after a few days if treated more rationally, with different drugs based on the results of diagnostic tests. Consistently across the study sites, over 96% of the children were afebrile at the follow-up visits in both intervention and control arms. Although a smaller proportion of children in the intervention arm remained febrile at Days 3 and 7 compared with the control arm, the numbers of such children were small and the difference observed could be caused by chance. This result is not easy to interpret. One possibility is that the frequency of minor, self-limiting viral infections as the cause of fevers was high, and diluted the effect of specific anti-malarial and antibacterial treatment. Furthermore, in a context of high parasitemia, it is possible that antibiotics might not have a measurable effect on fever clearance. Our findings are consistent with those from a study in Zambia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> that found no evidence that the risk of persistence of fever differed in intervention and control clusters after 5 and 7 days of treatment. Adding cough/difficulty breathing to our treatment algorithm would not have altered this because most under-five children who needed an antibiotic received one in the intervention arm.</p><p>The subgroup analysis that was conducted suggests that the use of antibiotics in the control arm in Ghana may have diluted the effect of the intervention, as there was some evidence of an effect of the intervention on fever clearance when data from only Burkina Faso and Uganda were used. However, visual inspection of the data from these two countries does not suggest a large difference in fever clearance rates at Day 3 in the intervention compared with the control arm.</p><p>Other aspects of feasibility, and acceptability of the approach based on the diagnostic and treatment package was assessed in all sites and will be reported in detail elsewhere. Overall, the CHWs were found to be able to perform their tasks satisfactorily, including RDTs for malaria and respiratory rate counting. A study in Uganda found that when RDT results and RR were double-checked by laboratory technicians and pediatricians there was a concordance rate of 100% for RDTs and 93% for RR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The acceptability of CHWs performing RDTs and RR counting was also high among communities, CHWs, and health staff. The majority of interviewed community members were satisfied with CHWs treating children according to the package.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></p><p>Though the study was not designed to evaluate RDT performance, the positivity rates for microscopy were consistently lower than those for RDTs across the three sites. This may be explained by the fact that all three RDTs used HRP2 as the target antigen, which can persist in the blood stream after parasite clearance,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref> suggesting that some positive RDTs were indicative of past rather than current infection. The choice of which RDT to use was made for one of the following reasons: availability, resistance to high storage temperature (40&#x000b0;C), delivery time, and national policy. Burkina Faso received their supply from TDR as their original supplier failed to deliver. The RDTs used were FirstSign in Burkina Faso, Paracheck pf in Ghana, and ICT in Uganda. It should also be noted that the RDTs were selected before the publication of &#x0201c;Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test Performance &#x02013; Results of WHO product testing of malaria RDTs Round 2&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> in which RDT performance was recorded for 67 RDTs. The ranking of the PDS for the RDTs was 28 for ICT, 49 for Paracheck, and 59 for First Sign,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> indicating that none really achieved a high combined measure positivity rate, along with inter-test and inter-lot consistency, although their PDSs were above 70/100.</p><p>The study shows that an iCCM approach based on the use of diagnostics and medicines for malaria and pneumonia by CHWs improves the rational use of anti-malarial drugs, and may reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics at the community level in settings where they are already available. Fever clearance was very high in both intervention and control arms at both Day 3 and Day 7 and when all three countries were included in the analysis there was no clear evidence of a clinical benefit of the intervention. These findings add to the evidence base for iCCM as a public health strategy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the community members, opinion leaders, CHOs, the health workers, research assistants, field supervisors, and workers in the districts of Sapone in Burkina Faso, Kassena Nankana in Ghana, and Iganga in Uganda; this study would not have been possible without their co-operation.
