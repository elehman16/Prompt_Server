Limited talocrural dorsiflexion range of motion (DF ROM) is a common consequence of ankle sprain. Limited talocrural DF ROM may contribute to persistent symptoms, disability, and an elevated risk for re-injury. As a result, many health care practitioners use hands-on passive procedures with the intention of improving talocrural joint DF ROM in individuals following ankle sprains. Dosage of passive hands-on procedures involves a continuum of treatment speeds. Recent evidence suggests both slow- and fast-speed treatments may be effective to address disablement following ankle sprains.

Annual incidence is estimated at 52.7 per 10,000 individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Ankle injuries are very common in younger and active individuals, second only to the knee in the annual incidence of lower extremity sports-related injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Among high school athletes in the United States, sprains account for 50% of all lower extremity injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] with the ankle joint most commonly affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In one sample of individuals with non-athletic mechanisms of injury, sprains accounted for over 40% of reported injuries with the ankle joint also most commonly affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Certain sports and work activities may result in an even higher incidence and risk for injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Ankle sprains are clinically significant because they result in a substantial number of missed work days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and participation in sports activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as potential early arthritic changes in the talocrural joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Lateral ankle and midfoot injuries account for 80-85% of all sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The most common mechanism of injury for ankle sprains involves plantarflexion and inversion of the ankle and foot, which places excessive load on the anterior talofibular ligament. With failure of this ligament, secondary restrain to inversion occurs by way of the calcaneofibular and posterior talofibular ligaments, placing them at similar risk for injury. The anteromedial joint capsule and anterior fibers of the deltoid ligament may be secondarily injured due to excessive eversion of the ankle and foot that may occur during recoil from maximal inversion. Ankle sprains are assigned grades I to III, ordered from least severe to most severe ligament damage.</p><p>Although the prognosis for functional recovery following ankle sprain typically includes a rapid reduction in disablement within the first 2 weeks after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], recent studies indicate a subgroup of individuals appears predisposed to continued pain, functional deficits, and prolonged risk for additional re-injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For example, Gerber and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported 95% of their sample of injured military cadets returned to normal activities within 6 weeks, although 55% reported residual functional deficits. At 6-month follow-up, 40% of the sample continued to note functional deficits compared to their pre-injury status. Other studies have corroborated reports of prolonged functional deficits and risk for re-injury as long as 18 months to 3 years following the initial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The incidence and prolonged disability associated with ankle sprains requires identification of optimal approaches to clinical management.</p><p>One reason for continued pain and elevated risk for re-injury may be limited ankle joint mobility. Several studies have identified limited talocrural joint dorsiflexion range of motion (DF ROM) as an important predisposing factor to ankle sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Significant short-term loss of ankle range of motion also has been documented as a response to injury in persons who sustained a recent ankle sprain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Along these lines, Denegar and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] established a significant loss of posterior talar glide in individuals with unilateral ankle sprains, although a significant difference in talocrural DF ROM between involved and uninvolved sides was not noted. One important implication of studies that have identified talocrural DF ROM deficits in individuals following ankle sprains is that perhaps intervention to improve talocrural DF ROM should correspondingly reduce ankle pain, disability, and risk for re-injury following ankle sprains.</p><p>Many clinicians use hands-on passive stretching techniques to improve limited joint mobility, such as ankle DF ROM. Hands-on passive stretching techniques, including mobilization and manipulation, vary on a dosage continuum involving the speed of iatrogenic force application. Mobilization typically involves a slow and sustained application of iatrogenic force, while manipulation is characterized by a rapid application of iatrogenic force. Despite the intuitive appeal of applying mobilization and manipulation to promote parallel improvements in talocrural DF ROM and functioning in individuals following ankle sprains, this idea has been the focus of relatively few prospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Pellow and Brantingham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] were among the first to report reduced pain and improved function in individuals with ankle sprains receiving an ankle mortise distraction technique. Whitman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] reported rapid functional improvement after talocrural manipulation in a single case study of a competitive volleyball player with a mild unilateral ankle sprain. More recently, Whitman and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] documented favourable clinical outcomes in approximately 75% of their sample with post-acute ankle sprains following 2 sessions of mobilization and manipulation directed at joints distal to the knee.</p><p>Although initial results are promising, various methodological issues in existing studies challenge our collective understanding of the effectiveness of mobilization and manipulation on clinical outcomes in individuals with ankle sprains. The effect attributable to placebo manual stimulation and speed of iatrogenic force application during hands-on treatment remains unclear. Also, prior studies have not conducted longitudinal assessments over sufficient durations to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of mobilization/manipulation to reduce the risk for re-injury. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of mobilization, manipulation, and hands-on placebo treatment of the talocrural joint on short-, intermediate-, and long-term clinical outcomes in individual with post-acute ankle sprains.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients with post-acute ankle sprains will be recruited to participate in this study from multiple clinical centers across the United States.

This inventory demonstrates satisfactory internal consistency, validity, and score stability. Test-retest validity is satisfactory for use in research designs involving repeated measures (ICC<sub>2,1 </sub>= .87-.89). Minimum clinically important change scores have been identified for the ADL subscale (8 points) and Sports subscale (9 points) with respect to patient global rating of change.</p></sec><sec><title>Anterior drawer test</title><p>The anterior drawer test is a manual assessment of the integrity of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is performed with the patient in supine hook-lying position to relax the plantaflexor muscle group, and the ankle of interest plantarflexed 10-15 degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The evaluating therapist stabilizes the tibia and fibula while translating the calcaneus and talus anteriorly. A positive test involves the perception of excessive movement by the investigator or the appearance skin dimpling on the anterolateral ankle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This test demonstrates diagnostic specificity to detect rupture of the ATFL, and as little as 2 mm of excessive excursion may be detected manually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Inversion stress maneuver</title><p>The inversion stress test is intended to elicit symptoms or excessive mobility due to calcaneofibular ligament rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

In this test, the subject will first place their uninvolved foot in a 32.5 &#x000d7; 12.5 &#x000d7; 22.5 cm clear acrylic box containing a known volume of water. As the subject's foot enters the box, water will flow from a spout in a box into a graduated cylinder. Measurement of displaced water will be completed and then the displaced water will be discarded. The graduated cylinder will be dried thoroughly and replaced beneath the box spout. The subject will then place their involved foot into the box, and the volume of displaced water will be measured. This volume represents the difference in volumes between involved and uninvolved sides. The residual volume of water displaced by the involved side will then be divided by the volume of water displaced by the uninvolved side. Water displacement volumetry demonstrates strong intra-tester reliability (ICC<sub>2,1</sub>=.99) and inter-tester reliability (ICC<sub>2,1</sub>=.93-.97) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

After a learning trial consisting of 6 repetitions in each of the 8 test directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], subjects will complete 3 repetitions of single limb squat reach. Two trials will be completed: 1 trial each with the subject standing on the affected and unaffected limbs. Test directions include anterior, lateral, anterolateral, posterolateral, posterior, medial, anteromedial, and posteromedial.

Numbers indicating group assignments will be concealed in a privacy envelope. A second licensed physical therapist blinded to the baseline examination (treating therapist) will open the proper randomization envelope that corresponds to the patient's unique identification number. The treating therapist will record the subject's group assignment on a standardized form. It will be impossible to blind the subject and treating therapist to treatment assignment. However, the evaluating therapist will remain blind to the subject's treatment assignment. Patients will be instructed to conceal their group assignment from the evaluating therapist.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental groups</title><p>Subjects will be randomized into 3 groups after pre-participation screening is completed, informed consent is obtained, and baseline measures are recorded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The first group (n = 63) will receive talocrural traction manipulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). With the subject in a seated position on a treatment table and the lower extremity of interest stabilized to the table with a belt, the standardized treating therapist will grasp the foot of interest with the thenar eminences on the foot's plantar surface. A thrust will be delivered parallel to the long axis of the subject's lower leg after the treating therapist induces passive ankle dorsiflexion to end range. The second group (n = 63) will receive talocrural traction mobilization. Traction will be delivered to the talocrural joint at the treating therapist's second perception of tissue resistance in 3 bouts of 30-second holds, separated by 10 seconds of rest. The third group (n = 63) will receive the manual therapy control intervention. This will consist of the same patient and clinician preparation for the mobilization/manipulation techniques. However, the treating therapist will maintain passive DF ROM for the duration of 1 deep inhalation and exhalation by the subject. Following the procedure, all subjects will receive range of motion exercises involving 10 clockwise ankle and foot circles within a symptom-free range of motion. Subjects will be requested to complete this exercise 4 times daily for 10 repetitions each session.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart for subject screening, pre-intervention measurement, intervention, and post-intervention measurements</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6882-10-59-2"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Ankle high-velocity low-amplitude, slow velocity, and control interventions under study</bold>.

Hands-on treatments that improve ankle DF ROM are hypothesized to cause related improvement in disability and mitigation of re-injury risks. We believe the study designed in this paper addresses methodological deficiencies in the manual therapy literature to date that interfere with our optimal understanding of best practices related to mobilization/manipulation in individuals with post-acute ankle sprains. Specifically, inclusion of a hands-on placebo control should allow for differentiation of generalized clinical benefit from manual stimulation and clinician attention versus iatrogenic force application. In addition, the length of follow-up measurements should allow for adequate estimation of the potential longitudinal effects of mobilization/manipulation during the post-acute injury period on re-injury rate. The methodological characteristics of this study should help generate high quality data that will further our collective understanding of best practices in manual therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADL: activities of daily living; ATFL: anterior talofibular ligament; DF: dorsiflexion; FAAM: Foot and Ankle Ability Measure; FABQ: Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire; GROC: Global rating of change; ICC<sub>2,1</sub>: Intraclass correlation coefficient - formula 2,1; LExSES: Lower Extremity Self Efficacy Scale; MMT: manual muscle test; NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; PANAS: Positive and Negative Affect Scale; RCT: randomized clinical trial; RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation; ROM: range of motion</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TED, KK, and BEF contributed to the design of this study protocol.
