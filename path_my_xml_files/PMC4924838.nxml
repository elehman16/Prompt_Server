Mobile apps targeting health behavior change hold great promise with respect to offering customized information, continuity of information and support over time, and a potentially wide reach across virtually the entire population. This includes the increasingly prevalent midlife and older segments of the population (ages 45 years and above) that are at increasing risk for the range of chronic diseases that are positively impacted by regular physical activity, but represent the most inactive age group in the U.S. and elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This age group stands to benefit greatly from the rapid growth of smartphone usage and accompanying health apps. In 2015, about half of adults ages 45&#x02013;64 years owned a smartphone, along with a 42% increase in smartphone ownership between 2014 and 2015 in adults ages 65 and over (to 27% in 2015) [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, 52% of U.S. adults with a high school education or less and 50% of adults in the lowest third of household income now own smartphones.</p><p>While thousands of health promoting smartphone apps are currently available, relatively few have applied behavioral theory in a systematic or explicit way [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and most have not been evaluated for even short-term efficacy or scientific accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, few apps and other eHealth or mHealth programs have been aimed at bridging the &#x0201c;digital divide&#x0201d; through incorporating elements that would enable use by typically underserved populations with generally lower levels of technology literacy as well as physical activity, e.g., aging adults [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Direct, head-to-head comparisons of mobile apps for health behavior change have been rare, and relatively few studies in this field have evaluated more than one health behavior target at a time [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], or included less studied behaviors, such as sedentary time (i.e., seated/reclining with low energy expenditure) [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Evaluation of mobile apps that provide integrated adaptive information throughout the day on two complementary health behaviors (i.e., physical activity and sedentary behavior) has rarely occurred.</p><p>The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate systematically, using a controlled experimental design, the initial efficacy of three customized smartphone applications, relative to a commercially available dietary control app, on initial adoption of a more physically active and less sedentary pattern of behavior throughout the day in a sample of insufficiently active midlife and older adults who were not regular smartphone users. These &#x0201c;move more, sit less&#x0201d; apps each focused on a distinct behaviorally based motivational &#x0201c;frame&#x0201d; to better understand their relative efficacy in a sample of midlife and older adults with little mobile technology experience. This older inactive population, while carrying greater chronic disease burden than their younger counterparts, has rarely been targeted specifically in the mobile app health promotion arena [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The primary questions of interest were:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Would each of the three custom apps produce significant improvements in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and/or sedentary behavior relative to the control app during the eight-week study period? And</p></list-item><list-item><p>Would any of the three custom apps produce significant eight-week improvements in MVPA and/or sedentary behavior relative to either of the other custom apps?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The Stanford University School of Medicine Human Subjects Institutional Review Board approved this study in September 2009. All participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Trial Design and Participants</title><p>The study was a parallel, randomized trial with 1:1 allocation of participants to use one of three custom physical activity apps or a diet-tracking control app for an 8-week period (described below). Random assignment occurred through use of a computerized version of the Efron procedure [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] by the study statistical analyst, who was blinded to participant allocation assignment. The Efron procedure, while not guaranteeing identical final participant allocation numbers across study arms, allows for reasonably balanced subject allocation throughout the entire recruitment and randomization period, which is particularly advantageous for studies with smaller sample sizes and multiple study arms [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Enrollment and intervention study assignment procedures were carried out by trained, PhD-level study staff.</p><p>The target population consisted of community-dwelling adults who met the following eligibility criteria: ages 45 years and older; insufficiently physically active (i.e., engaged in less than 60 minutes of moderate or more vigorous physical activity per week that increased heart rate, breathing, or perspiration); reported typically sitting for 10 or more hours per day; were able to participate safely in a physical activity program based on responses to the physical activity readiness questionnaire [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; and were currently using a mobile phone though not a smartphone. The rationale for recruiting individuals who were not current smartphone users was twofold: 1) it facilitated the development of apps that were sufficiently simple and straightforward that they could be used regardless of smartphone proficiency; and 2) it simplified uniform testing of the Android apps in this first-generation study through using a standard smartphone model and platform, which also eliminated the need for participants to carry more than one phone with them or temporarily use a smartphone different from the one that they already had. The primary recruitment methods used were email invitations sent to local electronic mailing lists; in-person recruitment activities occurring at local community and senior centers as well as congregate housing settings; flyers and posters on community notice-boards; and ads on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Craigslist.com">Craigslist.com</ext-link>. After suitable iterative design development and formative testing of the apps, Wave 1 of the study (n = 36) was conducted between April and December of 2011 to confirm the acceptability and feasibility of the study procedures and protocols for the smartphone-na&#x000ef;ve, older population being targeted. With the acceptability of the study procedures thus confirmed, the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT01516411) on 19 January, 2012 and the second wave of participants (n = 59) was enrolled between February and November, 2012. The use of the two waves also helped to ensure adequate subject enrollment across all four seasons, given the relationship between seasonality and physical activity participation [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Study follow-up ended as planned June 2013. A copy of the study trial protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156370.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>) is included as a supporting information file, along with the CONSORT Checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156370.s001">S1 CONSORT</xref> Checklist).

Briefly, a behavioral science-informed user experience iterative design process (BSUED) was applied in the initial development and formative testing of three different smartphone apps [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], each of which emphasized a distinct type of motivational frame [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Android smartphone platform was used given its ability to provide &#x0201c;live wallpaper&#x0201d;-based glance-able displays, ease of programming, and its ability to run the built-in accelerometer in the background while other smartphone functions were operating [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The objective of each app was to shape the user towards a daily goal of approximately 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and eight or fewer hours of daily sedentary time [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], measured using the smartphone&#x02019;s built-in accelerometer. To standardize the smartphones being used in this first-generation study and to mitigate potential problems that can occur when current smartphone users are asked to use an additional phone, individuals were recruited who were mobile phone users but not regular smartphone users. All participants were provided with the same model of Android smartphone.</p><p>Among the aims of the iterative design and formative user testing process were to develop custom apps that would be generally appealing and engaging for the aging population being targeted. All three apps shared basic behavioral and design elements that have been found to elicit interest and initial participation, including both &#x0201c;push&#x0201d; (notifications) and &#x0201c;pull&#x0201d; (information available via selecting an icon) components; a glance-able display; real-time customized feedback that was driven by the personal data being captured via the built-in accelerometer; behavioral self-monitoring; and a help tab [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The above components provided each participant with his/her own customized &#x0201c;just-in-time&#x0201d; feedback and information based on the data being automatically collected by each participant&#x02019;s smartphone throughout the day.</p><p>The specific format and content of each app are described previously [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, the &#x0201c;analytic&#x0201d; app, based on Social Cognitive theory and self-regulatory principles of behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], emphasized personalized and quantitative goal-setting, behavioral feedback, informational tips promoting behavior change, and problem-solving strategies aimed at behavior change barriers. Two colorful meters, viewable on the phone&#x02019;s glance-able display throughout the day, showed progress towards goals for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behavior.</p><p>The &#x0201c;social&#x0201d; app, based largely on social influence perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], emphasized social support for behavior change, &#x0201c;just-in-time&#x0201d; social normative feedback [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], modeling of behaviors by similar others using avatars on the display, and group-based collaboration and competition. Small avatars reflecting the current physical activity/sedentary behavior levels of the participant and other members of the &#x0201c;virtual team&#x0201d; to which he/she had been automatically assigned, as well as another &#x0201c;virtual team&#x0201d;, were viewable on the phone&#x02019;s glance-able display throughout the day.

The bird avatar, which was viewable on the phone&#x02019;s glance-able display throughout the day, changed position, posture, and movement depending on how active or inactive the user was up to that time point. Users received &#x0201c;rewards&#x0201d; (e.g., the bird avatar would unexpectedly appear in far-away cities) as a function of increased physical activity levels.</p><p>Following the iterative design development and formative testing process (of both the user experience and app functionality), we conducted the first-generation randomized controlled experiment of the three apps evaluating their capabilities for impacting initial (2-month) physical activity and sedentary activity levels, measured via smartphone-based accelerometry, which was validated against Actigraph accelerometry [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], relative to a commercially available, non-physical activity control app (Calorific), which tracks dietary behaviors throughout the day. As noted earlier, individuals meeting the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to use one of the three custom apps or the diet-tracking control app for an 8-week period. The first week of the 8-week period was used as a baseline period during which time only the activity-monitoring app (without a behavior change app) was installed on the study smartphones provided to participants. Participants were requested to continue their normal physical activity and sedentary behaviors during the baseline week. Because the participants in this study had not previously used a smartphone, an initial one-on-one 1-hour training session was used to provide participants with instruction on the general use of the smartphone, including wearing it attached to their waist to optimize accurate data capture via the phone&#x02019;s built-in accelerometer. At the end of this initial week, participants returned to the research facility to receive their randomly assigned behavior change app and basic instruction on its use. In addition to having access to the &#x02018;&#x02018;help&#x0201d; tab as part of each app, participants could call project staff with any technical problems or difficulties with the apps during the 8-week project period. In addition, written instructions for the smartphone were provided in the form of the manufacturer&#x02019;s user manual along with simplified user instructions designed by the research team to highlight key features of both the smartphone and the apps.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Measures</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Accelerometry-derived daily activity and sedentary time</title><p>The primary outcome measure for this study was estimated minutes in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) based on smartphone-derived accelerometry. Secondary outcome measures were estimated minutes of sedentary time based on smartphone-derived accelerometry and self-reported ecological momentary assessment of daily brisk walking and sitting time collected via the smartphone. We utilized the cut-points generated from our prior research to determine MVPA and sedentary time (see below). These data were collected via the smartphones themselves and sent wirelessly to a secured Stanford University server for storage and analysis. The built-in smartphone accelerometer was used because of this older, technology-na&#x000ef;ve population&#x02019;s general reluctance, revealed during the piloting phase of the study, to wear or carry more than one electronic device.</p><p>Smartphone accelerometry data collection and cleaning procedures were consistent with large-scale cross-sectional accelerometer studies [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such that: (a) valid hours of data consisted of no more than 60 consecutive &#x02018;zero&#x02019; values (interpreted as non-wear time); and (b) a valid day was defined as at least 10 valid hours/day. Because data were collected continuously and trajectory-based analyses were conducted, no minimum valid days/week criterion was necessary. As noted above, minutes of moderate-vigorous (&#x0003e;301 counts/min) and sedentary (&#x02264;56 counts/min) activities using the phone&#x02019;s built-in accelerometer were calculated based on our prior validation work using this type of smartphone accelerometer [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of target health behaviors</title><p>In addition to collecting movement data throughout the day via the smartphone&#x02019;s built-in accelerometer, ecological momentary assessment-based (EMA) reporting of brisk walking and sitting time was also collected on a daily basis via the smartphone throughout the 8-week study period. EMA, a method whereby individuals are queried on behaviors, affect, and similar events close in time to the experience of such events, can facilitate more sensitive and accurate recording and/or prediction of such events or behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Daily reporting occurred each evening, at a time most convenient to each participant. In the event that a participant failed to respond at the set time, automated reminder notifications were sent to the smartphone. The brisk walking item consisted of the following question: &#x0201c;How many total minutes of brisk walking have you engaged in today? Choose one response&#x0201d;. Categories of total minutes were as follows: 1&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;14, 15&#x02013;19, 20&#x02013;24, 25&#x02013;29, 30&#x02013;34, 35&#x02013;39, 40&#x02013;49, 50&#x02013;59, 60&#x02013;74, 75&#x02013;89, 90&#x02013;119, and more than 120 minutes.

In that study, between-arm differences were achieved with approximately 18 participants per arm completing the study. The sample size was increased by approximately 22 percent per arm in the current trial to allow for multiple testing, in conjunction with adding objective measurement of the two major outcome variables (physical activity and sedentary behavior) and use of mixed models analysis to enhance statistical power.</p><p>Mixed models analyses were utilized because of the intensive repeated measures design [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The advantages of this technique are that it is capable of handling nested observations (e.g., multiple observations for each individual), unbalanced (i.e., unequal) numbers of observations, and missing values [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Physical activity (i.e., accelerometer-derived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, EMA-derived brisk walking) and sedentary behavior (i.e., accelerometer-derived sedentary time, EMA-derived sitting time) outcomes were entered as dependent variables in separate models. Wave of study recruitment and linear, quadratic, and cubic time parameterizations were adjusted for in all models. Main effects for time, and time x study arm interactions were tested. Full-information maximum likelihood estimation was used as part of SAS Enterprise Guide v5.1 software to accommodate missing data in the models. To provide more easily interpretable data, we centered our time variable to the last baseline date (i.e., intervention day 1 = 1), thus allowing easier interpretation of the results. Because of a non-normal distribution of MVPA estimates, MVPA values were log-transformed. Scheff&#x000e9; adjustment for multiple comparisons&#x02014;customarily used with unequal cell sizes&#x02014;was applied in interpreting differences between pairs of study arms.

There were no significant differences found for such satisfaction ratings between apps.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the current study indicate that, among a sample of midlife and older adults who were insufficiently active and reported sitting for prolonged periods throughout the day, a customized smartphone app that specifically targeted social elements and contexts showed significantly greater short-term improvements in both accelerometer-based MVPA and sedentary behavior relative to a non-physical activity control app as well as the other two intervention apps that specifically targeted different motivational frames (affect/nurturance framing and analytic framing). This was the case even though all three apps were developed using extensive formative evaluation of target group interests and preferences, along with user-experience testing and iteration. The potency of the types of social influences incorporated into this app (i.e., social norm comparisons, implicit cues for within-team collaboration and between-team competition, social interaction opportunities between team members) have been noted in other evaluations of mHealth interventions for physical activity as well as other types of health behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Future studies would do well to explore the isolated effects of these different aspects of social influence and support, along with aspects of app functionality and usability, on physical activity and sedentary behavior outcomes. Of note, the overall effect size estimates for the differences found were reasonably large, suggesting potentially meaningful differences that merit further study.</p><p>While the Social app showed the largest average changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior across the 8-week study period relative to the other apps, the mean overall changes across this time period were reasonably modest and variable from week to week (as reflected in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156370.g002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156370.g004">4</xref>). These results and those from other behavioral health interventions suggest that there are likely participant subgroups for each intervention app comprising the overall group means that deserve further systematic evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Unfortunately, the reasonably small sample size in the current investigation prevented the types of subgroup analyses that could have shed further light on what has been called the &#x0201c;whiches conundrum&#x0201d; (i.e., which interventions for which individuals under which circumstances) [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Given the diversity of human preferences and experiences, such subgroup analyses are an important means of better customizing behavioral mHealth programs to optimize success (i.e., via a &#x0201c;behavioral&#x0201d; precision health paradigm).</p><p>Self-reported sitting time has been found to be associated with all-cause mortality in a growing number of (though not all [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) observational studies as well as in a range of countries [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Daily self-reports of health behaviors collected via the smartphone supported the decreases in sitting represented via the accelerometry-derived information in the Social app arm, and also indicated decreases in reported sitting time among users of the Affect app. As shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156370.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156370.g004">4</xref>, the overall shapes of the curves for these two different forms of sedentary behavior measurement were reasonably similar for the Affect app. It is possible that the increased variability derived via the accelerometry-based measurement reduced power to detect significant differences in that arm, given that the accelerometry-based measurement captures overall sedentary behavior, while the behavioral goal reflected in the apps was sitting time. It would be worthwhile exploring these issues further with larger sample sizes and across longer time periods.</p><p>Among the strengths of the current investigation were its focus on smartphone applications&#x02014;an increasingly accessible and scalable delivery system for behavioral health interventions, yet one in which many programs have received surprisingly little systematic evaluation to determine initial efficacy; use of a formal iterative design process to optimize the applicability of the three customized apps for the target population; targeting of two health behaviors that, while complementary, have been found to have independent effects on important health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; measurement of both health behaviors through objective accelerometry, which also allowed the apps to provide accurate &#x0201c;just-in-time&#x0201d; feedback to users [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; and an experimental design in which three different motivationally framed apps were compared &#x0201c;head-to-head&#x0201d; to move the field forward in an arguably more efficient way. The targeting of sedentary behavior, in particular, through this mobile communication mode has received relatively little attention to date. Additionally, while population aging and the increasing physical inactivity accompanying it are occurring globally [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], few studies in this area have specifically targeted aging adults in mobile application development and testing [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the above strengths, this &#x0201c;first-generation&#x0201d; intervention study contained a number of limitations that require attention in future work. These include the small sample size and the short intervention time frame which, while useful in evaluating initial app use and induction of changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior, do not systematically address the longer-term use and sustainability issues that remain a major challenge in the eHealth and mHealth fields [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156370.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Whether the currently tested apps would have been able to maintain user interest and improve the target health behaviors across longer time periods deserves further systematic investigation. To begin to gather information about the potential possibilities for sustained use of each of the apps, we conducted formative work in which 12 participants enrolled in the latter stage of the study (four from each custom app arm who were approached in consecutive order just prior to their study end date) were allowed to continue using their assigned app, if they chose, until all smartphones were collected on day 233 post-study [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These participants continued to use their apps for a mean of 191 [SD = 33] days post-study (range = 120&#x02013;233, with sample sizes too small to explore differences between apps) [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data do provide an initial positive &#x0201c;signal&#x0201d; concerning longer-term use that would be worth investigating in a systematic way.</p><p>An additional limitation concerns the use of the smartphones&#x02019; built-in accelerometer that, while shown in prior research to be a valid and reliable means of capturing physical activity and sedentary behavior, required participants to wear the phone daily. Expanding the capabilities of such apps to reliably interface with the growing number of wearable accelerometers in the marketplace are increasingly important. This point notwithstanding, it should be noted that the smartphones&#x02019; built-in accelerometer was successfully validated against what is currently considered to be the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; in research-grade ambulatory sensing devices, i.e., the Actigraph [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, a recent investigation involving a systematic head-to-head comparison of nine wearable devices currently on the market showed that none of them exceled in accurately capturing both daily physical activity and sedentary behavior [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A major challenge facing the wearable device industry is to develop suitable monitors that can accurately capture all three major behaviors&#x02014;activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep&#x02014;occurring across the 24-hour day [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, the built-in accelerometer, similar to Actigraph, Fitbit, and similar devices, is not as sensitive to measuring bouts of sedentary behavior as other devices (e.g., ActivPAL, LUMOback) [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This circumstance limited our ability to accurately ascertain differences in numbers of breaks in daily sedentary behavior. The relatively few studies that have systematically measured the effects of breaks in daily sitting time on relevant proximal health outcomes have produced mixed results [<xref rid="pone.0156370.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and this area deserves further systematic attention.</p><p>In summary, the results from this first-generation experiment support the overall effectiveness of a socially framed app, customized to the preferences and needs of midlife and older adults with minimal smartphone experience, in the early improvement of physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns. In addition, some partial support was obtained for the further exploration of an affectively framed app, particularly for reducing sitting behavior in this population. In light of the small sample size and short study period, further larger-scale evaluation of potential subgroup effects as well as impacts over time for such differently framed apps are warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156370.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156370.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156370.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156370.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the help and assistance of Dr. Susana Barradas in relation to portions of the study, including the qualitative analysis of the message board interactions for the Social app. We also gratefully acknowledge the assistance by Dr. Benjamin Chrisinger, and the efforts of study participants in contributing to this research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0156370.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Maibach</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Steg</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anable</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Promoting physical activity and reducing climate change: opportunities to replace short car trips with active transportation</article-title>. <source>Prev Med</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>49</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>326</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>7</lpage>.
