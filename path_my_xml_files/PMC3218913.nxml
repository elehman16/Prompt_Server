This disease leads to functional disability and a reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The abnormal biomechanics are believed to be among the major risk factors of disease progression and joint tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Subchondral bone turnover is a well-defined component of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The interactive process between articular cartilage and subchondral bone is complex and not yet fully understood. Yet, as these tissues are intimately related components of the joint, treatment to limit excessive bone remodelling is believed to have a possible positive effect on the global evolution of OA structural changes. Indeed, bone anti-resorptive agents have been shown to limit the development of OA structural changes in a number of experimental models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For instance, inhibition of bone remodelling by licofelone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and calcitonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] in the experimentally transected canine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model of OA was shown to reduce cartilage lesions. Similar evidence also emerged from the work done on oestrogen replacement therapy in ovariectomized monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a well-known class of molecules that contain two phosphonate groups attached to a single carbon atom, forming a "P-C-P" structure. The antiresorptive effects of these biochemical analogs of inorganic pyrophosphate have been demonstrated in skeletal diseases where excessive bone resorption is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The anion of tiludronic acid (tiludronate, TLN) is a non-nitrogen-containing BP that acts on bone through mechanisms that involve induction of osteoclast apoptosis and prevention of extracellular degradation and of pro-inflammatory cytotrafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], leading to decreased mineralized matrix resorption. This drug is recommended for skeletal disorders characterized by an increased and abnormal bone remodelling, such as Paget's disease, and is currently the only BP approved in veterinary medicine to alleviate clinical signs of an OA condition in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is yet insufficient data to claim a potentially beneficial effect of TLN on the pathological changes encountered in OA.</p><p>A recent study demonstrated that pre-emptive chronic zoledronate (a nitrogenous BP) treatment increases bone mineral density, and is chondroprotective and analgesic in both chemical (mono-iodo-acetate, MIA) and surgical experimental models of painful joint degeneration in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The authors showed that osteoclast-mediated resorption of cartilage at the subchondral bone/cartilage interface is an early initiating event in the pathobiology of the MIA model as opposed to chondrocyte death and subsequent mechanical erosion of the articular surface. Pre-emptive zoledronate fully inhibited the subchondral bone/cartilage molecular cross-talk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and/or the BP could have had a direct analgesic effect. This provided further rationale to test the potency of TLN at improving functional disability and structural changes in the canine ACL model of OA.</p><p>While BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and other antiresorptive agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have shown promise, mostly structural effects (inhibition of cartilage degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], prevention of osteophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and reduction in bone marker turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) in animal models of OA with pre-emptive treatment, clinical results in knee OA patients have been disappointing, for example, with risedronate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In OA, sclerosis of the subchondral bone is preceded by its resorption in the early phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This bone remodelling has also been characterized as bone marrow lesions (BML) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and could also be perceived as an adaptation to changes in the biomechanics (maintaining intramedullary homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) or in an attempt to repair microdamages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, bone remodelling has been associated with redistribution of mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the hypothesis has been advanced that to counteract it could prevent the repair of naturally occurring bone microdamage, thus increasing the susceptibility to crack initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, in the ACL transection canine OA model, an experimental BP was demonstrated to be effective at reducing the turnover of cancellous subchondral bone, but ineffective at preventing osteophyte formation or pathologic changes of OA in the overlying cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Rather, a decrease in proteoglycan synthesis was observed, suggestive of impairment in the hypertrophic repair process. In contrast, chondroprotection was denoted in cruciate-deficient rats under BP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in parallel to a decrease in the expression of degradative enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as well as of biochemical markers of cartilage degradation in human beings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also, in these studies stating a limited efficacy for BP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], it has to be noted that one main limitation to inference was the relatively mild degree of OA in the control animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as the absence of OA radiographic signs progression in placebo subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>ACL transection in dogs generates abnormal biomechanical forces and metabolic pathways that initiate structural changes on morphometry and histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as on imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], mimicking those seen in naturally occurring OA. This model is additionally acknowledged to induce significant chronic gait disability and functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The canine ACL model of OA is valuable for assessing the evolution of functional outcomes in response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the present study, we hypothesized that the bone anti-resorptive action of TLN might curb the development of structural and functional joint lesions associated with ACL transection. We used a set of complementary tools to relate pain and functional outcomes in parallel to joint structural, biochemical and molecular changes. This allowed the evaluation of the effect of TLN on limb loading, pain/stress sensation, activity level and behaviours related to canine experimental OA conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a parallel design (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), dogs were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of eight dogs each, stratified by body weight and gender.

Under pre-emptive (transdermal fentanyl 50 or 75 &#x003bc;g/h, Duragesic<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Janssen Ortho, Markham, ON, Canada) and multimodal (intra-articular block combined with opioid administration) analgesia, the tibial edge was located with the thumb and index finger, followed by a medial sagittal skin incision (30 mm). The subcutaneous tissues were dissected, and a medial arthrotomy was performed, distal to the patella and parallel to the patellar ligament. A retractor was inserted to view the ACL to be sectioned, the completeness of which was verified by obtaining a large drawer motion in both flexion and extension. The capsule and the retinaculum were sutured in a simple continuous pattern. Bupivacaine (Marca&#x000ef;ne<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>0.5%; Hospira, St-Laurent, QC, Canada) was injected (5 to 8 mL) in the capsule as an intra-articular block. Finally, the subcutaneous tissues were sutured, followed by intra-dermal and skin sutures.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>One group was treated with 2 mg/kg of disodium TLN dissolved in a mannitol solution (CEVA Sant&#x000e9; Animale, Libourne, France). The OA control group received only the vehicle solution (CEVA Sant&#x000e9; Animale). Both treatments (0.2 mL/kg) were injected subcutaneously (SC), starting on the day of ACL transection, and repeated every two weeks up to the end of the follow-up (total of four administrations). The dose level of TLN was selected by the Sponsor based on preliminary studies in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and using an allometric scale-up to the weight of dogs.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain and functional evaluations</title><sec><title>Gait analysis</title><p>In dogs, the use of a pressure-sensing walkway device acquires limb loading and is defined as a quantitative measurement of gait function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Gait analysis was performed at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 using the podobarometric recording device (Walkway<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>System; Tekscan Inc, Boston, MA, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For the right (ACL-deficient) hind limb, the peak vertical force (PVF) was acquired at a trotting gait velocity ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 meters/second. Velocity and acceleration (&#x000b1; 0.5 meter per second<sup>2</sup>) was ensured using a set of three photoelectric cells specially designed for this podobarometric device (LACIME; &#x000c9;cole de Technologie Sup&#x000e9;rieure, Montr&#x000e9;al, QC, Canada). The gait acquisition window was three seconds with a sampling rate set at 44 hertz, producing a total of 132 frames. Raw PVF (Kg) data from the first five valid trials were obtained for each dog and later used for statistical purposes using body weight as a covariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Data were expressed as percentage of body weight (%BW).</p></sec><sec><title>Pain scoring systems</title><p>The lameness and pain of treated and control OA dogs were evaluated using previously developed scoring systems, and included a visual analog scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and a composite numerical rating scale (NRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The pain scores were obtained at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 by the same technician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] with a 100 mm VAS scale, coding from 0 ("no pain") to 100 ("pain intensity could not be worse"). The composite NRS, which was scored by the same veterinarian throughout the study, includes the following seven criteria: Global assessment (score 0 to 4); Evaluation of lameness while the dog is standing up (score 0 to 4), walking (score 0 to 4) and trotting (score 0 to 4); Willingness to hold up contralateral limb (score 0 to 4); Evaluation of response to palpation (score 0 to 4); Evaluation of response to flexion and extension (score 0 to 4). Inter- and intra-observer reliability of both VAS and NRS were tested and found to be highly satisfying (Spearman correlation, rho &#x0003e;0.72, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrodermal activity (EDA)</title><p>Changes in skin conductance response (EDA) resulting from sympathetic neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] has recently been validated in the canine ACL model of OA as a measurement of stress or pain that is strongly associated with functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The EDA was recorded at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 using a Pain Gauge<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(PHIS, Inc., Dublin, OH, USA) system, which grades the signal intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the most painful.

The capture of behavioural changes in terms of body positions and motor activities allows a non-invasive monitoring of pain-related functional disability and discomfort. Recording was performed in the outdoor runs where the dogs exercised for two consecutive hours, at baseline and at Week 8. The resulting ethogram included the following eight classes of behaviour: location in the run, body position, facial expression, vocalization, tail position, self-care, motor activity and dog interaction. The analysis of behaviour occurrence was done following the manufacturer's recommendations.</p></sec><sec><title>Telemetered locomotor actimetry</title><p>Acceleration-based monitoring of frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activities is a valid objective tool to monitor pain-related functional disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. At baseline, Week 4 and Week 8, locomotor actimetry was monitored continuously for 24 hours with an electronic chip (Actical<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Bio-Lynx Scientific Equipment, Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada) that was placed inside a protective neck collar. During this time, all dogs followed the same daily routine to ensure consistency. The cumulative locomotor activity was recorded over two minutes, thus providing 720 measurements over 24 hours. The height of peaks for each recording was scaled in arbitrary units from 0 to &#x0221e; to quantify the intensity of locomotor actimetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Comparison of actimetry with simultaneous video-automated recordings allowed the threshold to be set between active and inactive motions at 30 units. Data were then expressed as daily averaged total intensity (considering all counts, DATI), and daily averaged active intensity (considering only counts higher than 30 in intensity as active counts, DAAI).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Macroscopic grading</title><p>At the end of the study, the dogs were euthanized under sedation with barbiturate overdose.

The model was proven to be most useful at the preclinical stage of drug development for testing the abilities of new therapeutic modalities to limit or halt the disease development/progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the present study, TLN was demonstrated to have a positive effect both on some of the structural changes and on pain/function. More particularly, TLN was found to decrease the production of catabolic enzymes, bone resorption, and synovial inflammation. These were associated with improved locomotion, reduced lameness and gait disability, and improved joint pain perception. These findings are in line with the report on a rat model of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showing that the analgesic effect of the nitrogenous BP zoledronate is mediated by its anti-resorptive action. In the current study, TLN promoted better function despite the presence of cartilage lesions, which were of similar extent in OA and control dogs. This finding suggests that cartilage integrity in a weight-bearing joint is not compulsory for functional improvement. Furthermore, even when the knee joint was exposed to additional mechanical constrains related to an increase in limb support (that is, pain-relief), cartilage did not undergo excessive alteration and remained similar to control dogs.</p><p>This study demonstrated that TLN improves the functional disability following ACL transection, more specifically the limb impairment, allowing dogs to load their afflicted limb to a greater extent as demonstrated by the results of the PVF analysis. Dogs were also more active without showing evidence of severe lameness. The stress/pain sensation was also reduced by TLN treatment, as highlighted by the results of the EDA measurements, pain scoring and behaviours denoting changes in pain-related condition. Lameness improvement was found to be maximal at Week 8 (PVF, NRS and video-automated analysis of body position and motor activities), after dogs had received full TLN treatment. However, at the intermediate time-point (Week 4), the difference between TLN and placebo groups was greater than at Week 8 for both EDA and telemetered actimetry. The beneficial effect of TLN therapy on pain/function was likely related to a combination of effects including its anti-inflammatory effect shown by a reduction in synovial effusion size, synovitis score, and level of inflammatory mediators, as well as its effect on the initiation of bone remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Transduction of noxious signals occurs through high-threshold receptors responding to a variety of thermal, chemical and mechanical stimuli, and defined as polymodal nociceptors. At the level of damage-sensing neurons, release of protons and high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) act, respectively, on transient receptor potential (TRP) and acid-sensing (ASIC) ion channels, and on ionotropic ligand-gated purinergic (P2X) receptors to activate nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. During the early stages of inflammation, mediators such as PGs and bradykinin change the sensitivity of receptors and reduce the activation threshold for these conducting ion channels, which is the basis for peripheral sensitization. This study provides interesting new findings on the ability of TLN to reduce the inflammatory changes in the OA synovium. Hence, TLN demonstrated a clear anti-inflammatory local effect while decreasing the joint effusion and synovitis (synovial lining cells). The analyses of synovial fluid confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects reflected by a decrease in the levels of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and NOx, two well-known inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Inflammatory markers such as PGE<sub>2 </sub>are known to be correlated with pain and functional disability in human OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] as well as in the canine ACL model of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The high level of synovial fluid NOx found in this study is in line with our previous findings in this OA model, in which the inducible NOS was found to be increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is likely that NO contributed to the disability and perception of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, the decrease in NOx levels by TLN treatment may have contributed to the structural protective effect of the drug as previously demonstrated in this OA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Tiludronate, by inhibiting the ATP-dependent proton pumps located in the plasma membranes of the osteoclasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], can reduce the acidification of the bone matrix, which is the first step in the bone resorption process. In addition, TLN can disrupt adhesion of the osteoclast to the bone surface before bone resorption is initiated by modifying the phosphorylation of proteins of the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As well as decreasing pro-inflammatory cytotrafficking (cytokines and NO synthesis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], acidification and phosphorylation and, in consequence, activation of proteolytic enzymes, TLN can also inhibit activity of MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In the present study, TLN was found to decrease the expression of MMP-13 and ADAMTS5 in the cartilage and cathepsin K in the subchondral bone, which is in line with the findings of our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and supports this hypothesis. The anti-inflammatory effects of TLN are interesting, as they add to the most important recognized biological effect of BPs, that is, the reduction in bone remodelling through the inhibition of osteoclastic activity. The pain and functional improvements observed under TLN therapy were present at Week 4 and maintained at Week 8. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the actions of TLN on bone matrix and synovial inflammation would lead to a decrease in TRPV1, ASIC3, and P2X receptors activation, translating into diminished peripheral sensitization and subsequent benefits on pain sensation and mobility. Although BPs were developed for the treatment of pathologies associated with excessive bone resorption, several reports revealed that they were able to reduce the pain associated with different painful diseases. Direct analgesic effects of BPs have been largely acknowledged using reflex algesimetric tests in mice after acute administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Clodronate and pamidronate presented anti-nociceptive dose-responses, comparing favourably to aspirin and morphine, and the central and peripheral analgesia did not appear to be mediated through opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Prolonged anti-nociceptive effects have also been demonstrated for clodronate, a non-nitrogenous BP, without inducing any behavioural side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Such action has been proposed to explain the efficacy of zoledronate in experimental rat OA models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Increased osteoclastic activity, as found in OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], could contribute to neuronal excitation and pain, and, therefore, inhibition of bone resorption and of nociceptor activation through anti-acid, anti-inflammatory actions would be analgesic. This hypothesis maintains an interaction of TLN with the molecular subchondral bone/cartilage cross-talk.</p><p>Subchondral bone mineral density decreases as early as one month following ACL transection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this OA model, extensive remodelling leading to a reduction in subchondral bone plate thickness, bone surface, and trabecular thickness, increased trabecular separation and loss of bone density and anisotropic properties were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this study, we found that following TLN treatment a number of those changes were reduced and closer to the values found in normal dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More specifically, the architecture of subchondral bone and calcified cartilage was better preserved. The anti-resorptive action of TLN may explain these findings.</p><p>The advance movement and duplication of the tidemark contributes to overall thinning of the articular cartilage, thickening of the calcified cartilage while altering the biomechanic of the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In ACL-deficient dogs, the calcified cartilage undergoes thinning and an advancement of the tidemark later in the OA process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, duplication of the tidemark was previously reported following 12 weeks of BP treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Whether or not TLN affects the endochondral ossification remains to be determined as change in the calcification front was not assessed in the present study.</p><p>The decrease in cathepsin K activity observed under TLN treatment is well in line with the known mode of action of the drug at reducing osteoclastic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Given that mechanical loading governs bone architecture and mass, the greater alteration in bone structure found in placebo-treated dogs may also be explained by the lower forces transmitted to the joint as a consequence of pain-related limb disuse. Whereas previous studies using BPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or other antiresorptive agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] focused on the beneficial structural effects in experimental OA models, the present study highlights that the anti-resorptive effect of TLN was associated with an apparent absence of effect on cartilage lesions, but translated to beneficial analgesic and functional consequences. One must, however, take into account that the present study lasted only eight weeks, which is an obvious limiting factor regarding the exploration of the chondroprotective effect of TLN.</p><p>A recent analysis using MRI confirmed the common belief that it is likely that changes in the subchondral bone (BML) predominate in relation to OA knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Bone marrow lesions are also associated with cartilage lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. These results support the dynamics of bone/cartilage cross-talk, and the fact that TLN affected the molecular, nociceptive, and biomechanical bone/cartilage interface in the canine ACL model. In the dog ACL model, we have observed similar relationships between MRI structural and functional changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Such findings further support the translational nature of results obtained in the ACL dog model to human OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of the dog ACL model in association with the complete set of functional methods used in the present study represents a most useful tool for the monitoring of pain and joint function in OA. The present study brings into perspective a possible link between joint structural changes and functional outcomes. The level of joint inflammation is an important co-factor in generating pain-related functional disability. The preservation of bone integrity also likely plays a key role in functional outcome, being required to reduce the disability occurring in ACL-deficient dogs. This is supported by the fact that TLN treatment demonstrated a positive effect on gait disability and joint symptoms, while being associated with a better preservation of calcified cartilage and subchondral bone histomorphometry, as well as reducing the synthesis of catabolic and inflammatory mediators.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACL: anterior/cranial cruciate ligament; ADAMTS: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin motifs; ASIC: acid-sensing ion channel; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; BML: bone marrow lesions; BP: bisphosphonate; DAAI: daily averaged active intensity; DATI: daily averaged active intensity; EDA: electrodermal activity; MIA: mono-iodo-acetate; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NOx: nitrites and nitrates; NRS: numerical rating scale; OA: osteoarthritis; P2X: purinergic receptors; PGE<sub>2</sub>: prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>; PVF: peak vertical force; %BW: percentage of body weight; SC: subcutaneous; SD: standard deviation; TLN: Tiludronate; TRPV1: transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; VAS: visual analog scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The majority of authors declare that they have no competing interests, but Drs T Bertaim and D Thibaud are regular employees of CEVA, who supervised the study for this sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MM contributed to the study design, carried out the analysis and interpretation of data from the gait analysis, contributed to tissue sampling, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
