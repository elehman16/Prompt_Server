Imagiological examinations for the <italic>in vivo</italic> group were performed to inspect the position of the implant and spinal cord status. Specimens were harvested six months after the operation. Biomechanical testing was conducted to obtain the ROM in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation at upper adjacent level (C<sub>2&#x02013;3</sub>), operative levels (C<sub>3&#x02013;4</sub> and C<sub>4&#x02013;5</sub>) and at C<sub>2&#x02013;5</sub>.

Although this procedure has been reported to have positive outcomes, operative level motor function is inevitably lost when three or more cervical vertebras are fused during the procedure [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Patients who undergo ACCF often complain of neck pain or numbness of upper limbs even after long-term follow-up [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some patients experience degeneration of the adjacent upper or lower segments, a condition known as adjacent segment disease (ASD) [<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Possible reasons for ASD may be ROM redistribute into the adjacent spinal segment that increases pressure inside the adjacent discs and facet joints, further accelerating degeneration [<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>As non-fusion technology develops, motion preservation devices, such as the artificial cervical disc, have demonstrated their ability to prevent ASD [<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, artificial cervical disc is limited by its inability to reconstruct the height of vertebra, and hence cannot be used when cervical corpectomy must be performed in the treatment of diseases, such as ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) [<xref rid="b9-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, the investigation of intervention strategies for ASD after ACCF is lacking and further <italic>in vivo</italic> assessments are limited by the absence of an ideal cervical corpectomy non-fusion animal model. To date, there has been a paucity of motion preservation devices used for the investigation of this problem. An ideal model would restore the motion of the intervertebral space not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address this issue, we have designed a non-fusion implant model in goats. Our study used an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cervical corpectomy non-fusion goat model and tested the model&#x02019;s range of motion (ROM) for operative levels (C<sub>3&#x02013;4</sub> and C<sub>4&#x02013;5</sub>) and the upper adjacent level (C<sub>2</sub>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>A Non-fusion implant</title><p>The implant, produced by three-dimensional (3D) metal printing technology (Bright Laser Rapid Prototyping Technology Co.

Twelve adult-male goat cervical spine specimens (C<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>7</sub>) and six adult-male goats (38.5&#x000b1;2.1 kg) were included in this study (provided by animal surgery center, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University).</p><p>The 12 cervical spine specimens were randomly divided into an intact group and an <italic>in vitro</italic> group with six specimens in each group. Muscle and peripheral soft tissue were removed with caution, keeping the ligament and capsule of the facet joint intact. Specimens of the <italic>in vitro</italic> group had a cervical corpectomy performed at C<sub>4</sub> level. A 15 mm width incision for decompression was made by a bone rongeur. The C<sub>3&#x02013;4</sub> and C<sub>4&#x02013;5</sub> discs were removed by a pituitary rongeur. The implant was assembled and then implanted at the C<sub>4</sub> level followed by screw fixation at C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>, respectively. The specimens were preserved under minus 20&#x000b0;C condition before biomechanical testing.</p><p>The operation for the <italic>in vivo</italic> group was performed under aseptic conditions. The six male-adult goats had a 24-hours fast to empty their digestive tract. Before anesthesia, a venous channel was established via ear vein and a subcutaneous injection of atropine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered to reduce tracheal secretions. Equipment, such as negative pressure aspirator and sputum suction apparatus, were prepared for use as needed by nursing staff during the operation. Pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) was injected via the venous channel for anesthesia.

C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> as well as C<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>7</sub> were fixed together by several nails for the enhancement of embedding. The ends of specimens were embedded vertically into two molds containing a mixture of N (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1, 3-propylenediamine and bisphenol A-(epichlorhydrin) (1:1). Materials testing machine (MTS) (model MTS 858 Bionix, MTS Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and an optoelectronic 3D motion capture system with three cameras (Optotrack Certus, Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Canada) were used in the tests. The Optotrack Certus had a 3D precision of 0.1 mm, a measuring distinguishability of 0.01 mm and a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The vertebras (C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>5</sub>) were attached with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-medscimonit-22-1131">Figure 3</xref>). The specimens had circulatory movement in flexion-extension, left-right bending, or left-right rotation axially when a 1.5 Nm was applied to its top by MTS. In total, five loading cycles were completed. The torque and the angle were recorded by MTS. The instantaneous spatial locations of the LEDs were recorded by Optotrack Certus.

Experimentally, the implantation of a novel implant preserved the ROM of the operative levels and reduced the ROM of the upper adjacent level of the specimen; these conditions may be related to the lower risk of developing ASD. In summary, this study reports on a successful method of ACC non-fusion modelling, which provides a new way for future study of non-fusion treatment strategies of cervical spinal disease. The authors believe the model reported in this study is a reliably reproducible non-fusion model after cervical corpectomy. Our study results suggests this new approach may be an alternative to anterior fusion method.</p><p>ACCF is an effective strategy for cervical spinal disease [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

ACCF usually includes a corpectomy and implants of an end-construct plate fixation spanning the strut graft. Notably, the biomechanical environment is greatly changed after rigid fusion of three or more vertebras, which generates a large moment arm at the ends of the construct [<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The most visible alteration of the cervical spine is the motor function. A number of biomechanical studies have evaluated the cervical spine ROM after ACCF [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Galler et al. reported that corpectomy and grafting allowed the ROM of the fusion level to be dispersed fairly equivalently into the non-operative levels in flexion, lateral bending, and axial rotation [<xref rid="b13-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Motion loss is a common feature caused by anterior fusion. Currently, non-fusion procedures, such as cervical disc arthroplasty, have been developed for preserving the ROM of the operative levels and have yielded favorable clinical outcomes [<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, insertion of an artificial cervical disc cannot reestablish the height of the vertebra, which makes this procedure impracticable for ROM preservation after a corpectomy. Currently, there is no anterior corpectomy non-fusion model due to the lacking of proper implants. The implant in our study has the function of reconstructing the vertebra height using the implantation of an artificial vertebra and preserving the ROM produced by the relative movement of the disc part and vertebra part. This non-fusion model provides an alternative procedure for the treatment of cervical spinal disease. The first goal of this unique procedure is to provide the cervical spine with a stable biomechanical environment by reconstruction the height of vertebra after corpectomy, which cannot be achieved by implanting artificial cervical disc or artificial nucleus [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The second goal is to restore the dynamic function of the intervertebral space by means of the motional structure of the novel implant. Theoretically, the non-fusion procedure could decrease the ROM of the adjacent levels due to the preservation of the ROM at the corpectomy level. Previous studies reported that the increased ROM of the adjacent level was related to a high risk of developing adjacent segment disease (ASD) [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The corpectomy non-fusion model has the potential to ameliorate ASD.</p><p>In this study, we reported the six-degrees-of-freedom ROM of the goat cervical spine under four experimental conditions. The biomechanical testing of <italic>in vitro</italic> models are very important; if the <italic>in vitro</italic> prosthesis has no ROM or shows catastrophic results such as dislocation, it cannot be used <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, an <italic>in vivo</italic> model must be established based on the results of an <italic>in vitro</italic> model. This study used both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models. We also wanted to know whether the two models had different ROM when, after several months, the soft tissue of the <italic>in vivo</italic> model may affect the ROM. According to Watson et al., the ROM in flexion of the three groups was not equal to the extension because goats have larger ROM in flexion than extension [<xref rid="b20-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; similar result was observed in our study. In general, the ROM of the left movement should be equal to the right movement. However, a symmetrical motion curve was not observed. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows. First, the embedding of the specimens into the mold requires a stable fixation and a high accuracy of a neutral position of the specimens, which are difficult to achieve. Second, although the goats for specimen harvesting were the same age and similar body weight, the anatomical structure of the goat cervical spines were not completely the same. Third, the implantation of the implant affects the symmetry of the specimens if the position of the implant is not in the centerline of the cervical spine.</p><p>Despite the motion preservation, another important function for a successful non-fusion model is to provide stability for the cervical spine. The model will be considered unstable if the ROM of the non-fusion segments is too large, which is particularly dangerous for the cervical spinal cord &#x02013; the ROM should be neither too large nor too small. In this study, the hemispheric articular fossae in the center of the two ends of artificial vertebra body were designed to prevent the dislocation of the disc and vertebra parts. This special design of the angle between the anterior plate and the endplate allowed the artificial disc part to firmly attach to the adjacent vertebra. Two lateral long grooves and two holes were designed for long-term bony fusion. Meanwhile, dentate grooves on the surface of the endplate might be more prone to bone ingrowth into the endplates, which reduces the risk of displacement. However, the specimens in the <italic>in vivo</italic> and the <italic>in vitro</italic> groups had significantly increased ROM compared with those in the intact group indicating that improvement of the model may be needed. Similarly, facet dislocation might happen if the axial ROM is too large [<xref rid="b21-medscimonit-22-1131" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>This study had the following limitations. First, although the ROM of the operative levels could be preserved by implanting a novel implant, the different anatomical structures may require different sizes of implants. Second, the goat model established in this study might not have the same biomechanical properties of human models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The presented implant model provides a better understanding of the potential motion loss after anterior fusion, and the potential to develop a new non-fusion device for the treatment of cervical spinal disease.

The endplate with special structures, several dentate grooves on the surface, and a column with a height of 1 mm followed by a hemispheric articular head with a diameter of 12 mm. (<bold>C, D</bold>) The vertebra was a quadrangular column (33 mm-38 mm in length, 14 mm in width and 14 mm in depth), with a hemispheric articular fossa (12 mm in diameter) in the center of the two ends. (<bold>E</bold>) The angle between the anterior plate and the endplate was 84&#x000ba; in the upper disc and 100&#x000ba; in the lower disc. (<bold>F</bold>) To match the angle between the anterior plate and endplate, a 6&#x000ba; angle between the top surface and horizontal plane and a 10&#x000ba; angle between the bottom surface and horizontal plane were designed. Two long grooves and two holes laterally interpenetrate the artificial vertebra for the formation of a bony bridge. The self-tapping screws for fixation were 16 mm-18 mm in length, 3.0 mm-3.4 mm in diameter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medscimonit-22-1131-g001"/></fig><fig id="f2-medscimonit-22-1131" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Process for establishing the <italic>in vivo</italic> model.
