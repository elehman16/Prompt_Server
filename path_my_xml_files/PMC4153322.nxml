the absence of ingested fat. It is possible that following consumption of low doses of fat
the basal level of chylomicron secretion and subsequent metabolism are sufficient to
metabolise this fat without an increase in postprandial chylomicron concentrations. To
test this hypothesis, healthy male subjects were randomised to receive, on three separate
occasions, meals containing a range of doses of fat (average 8&#x000b7;1&#x02013;19&#x000a0;g) and effects on
postprandial lipaemia and chylomicron concentration were determined. Furthermore, to

levels were also determined in a density &#x0003c;1&#x000b7;006&#x000a0;g/ml fraction. Following
consumption of the very low dose of fat the postprandial concentration of chylomicrons was
unaltered, whereas following the medium dose postprandial chylomicron concentrations were
significantly increased. Interestingly, this increase was only detected in the lipid-rich
chylomicron fraction, with postprandial levels of chylomicron remnants remaining
unchanged. In conclusion, it appears that consumption of what would be considered low to
medium doses of fat are not associated with transient postprandial increases in
chylomicron remnants in healthy male subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type=""><title>Key words</title><kwd>Chylomicrons</kwd><kwd>apo B48</kwd><kwd>Postprandial lipid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abreviations</title><kwd>LBM, lean body mass</kwd><kwd>iAUC, incremental area under the curve.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Impaired postprandial lipid metabolism as a risk factor for CVD is an area that has
attracted great interest since the hypothesis was highlighted by Zilversmit in
1979<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that we spend the majority of our life in a postprandial state an
understanding of the regulation of postprandial lipid metabolism is important. A number of
studies have focused on the regulation of postprandial TAG and the results have helped
establish elevated postprandial TAG concentrations as an independent risk factor for
CVD<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elevations in postprandial TAG concentrations result from a combination
of increased concentration of TAG-rich chylomicron and VLDL particles, and their remnants.
Such elevations appear to result from increased competition for lipolysis and particle
clearance pathways due to the increased secretion of TAG-rich chylomicrons by enterocytes.
However, postprandial remnant lipoproteins have also been established as a risk factor for
atherosclerosis and CVD and it is therefore important to examine factors affecting their
concentration. Following hydrolysis by endothelial lipases, TAG-depleted chylomicrons,
secreted by the intestine in response to dietary fat and, thereafter, hepatically derived
VLDL remnants attain a sufficiently small diameter to become entrapped within the
sub-endothelial space<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chylomicron and VLDL remnants contain twenty&#x02013;forty times more
cholesterol per particle compared with LDL and initiate a powerful cytokine response when
retained within the arterial intima. Moreover, these remnant lipoproteins are avidly
degraded by macrophages, initiating a respiratory burst and exacerbating endothelial
oxidative stress<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the factors that could be expected to be important in determining the extent and
duration of postprandial lipaemia is the dose of lipid consumed in a test meal. Indeed, it
has been reported that a stepwise increase in the postprandial serum TAG response results
with increasing amount of fat consumed<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. A threshold ingestion of about 15&#x000a0;g is ordinarily required to induce
transient lipaemia in otherwise healthy lean individuals. Consumption of other
macronutrients, in particular carbohydrates, as well as the type of fatty acids may also
confer some regulation of postprandial lipaemia, the former via insulin-regulated
pathways<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, due to differences in regulation of the lipolysis and
clearance pathways it is possible that elevated postprandial lipaemia may not always track
directly with levels of remnant lipoproteins. It is important therefore to determine the
effect of dietary lipid load on arterial exposure to the post-hydrolysed pro-atherogenic
remnant lipoproteins. Remnant lipoproteins, being smaller in size than their TAG-rich
progenitors, are able to penetrate arterial tissue<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, and induce macrophage lipid loading<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. The determination of remnant lipoproteins in the postprandial state is
therefore of importance in evaluating the atherogenic risk of postprandial lipaemia. It is
likely that accumulation of remnants of both hepatic and intestinal origin plays an
important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and vascular
inflammation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Determination of the concentration of chylomicron particles can be done
by measurement of apoB48 concentration in the circulation. More importantly, elevated apoB48
concentrations both in fasting and postprandial states have been reported in obese
subjects<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> and in type 1 and type 2 diabetics<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chylomicron particles appear to be constitutively synthesised and secreted by
enterocytes<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> even in the absence of ingested fat. Results from animal and clinical
studies suggest that, unlike hepatically derived TAG-rich VLDL, basal rates of chylomicron
biosynthesis are chronically modulated and not significantly influenced by singular meals
containing fat. In rats, following lipid infusion there was only a 1&#x000b7;5-fold increase in the
rate of chylomicron particles secreted; whereas the size of secreted lymph chylomicrons was
up to 13&#x000b7;8-fold greater<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, in free-living subjects we have previously observed that
the basal circulating concentration of chylomicrons represent approximately 70% of the peak
levels attained throughout the day<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. It appears therefore that the basal synthesis of chylomicrons can
accommodate most of the lipid absorbed from meals by the formation and secretion of larger,
lipid-rich chylomicrons. However, it remains unclear whether the extent of nascent
chylomicron lipidation within the enterocyte subsequently influences plasma metabolism of
chylomicrons, or thereafter interaction and kinetics within the arterial intima. Indeed, the
atherogenic risk associated with postprandial lipaemia may primarily be indicative of
chronic disturbances in chylomicron remnant homoeostasis, rather than reflecting single and
transient meal effects. To explore this hypothesis further, healthy male subjects were
randomised to receive, on three separate occasions, meals containing a range of very low to
medium doses of fat (average 8&#x000b7;1&#x02013;19&#x000a0;g) and effects on postprandial lipaemia and chylomicron
concentration were determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of ten healthy normolipidaemic (TAG&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;7&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc>) generally lean male

doses of fat on postprandial chylomicron metabolism. Following consumption of the medium
dose of fat significant increases in the circulating concentration of chylomicron particles
(apoB48) were observed, whereas the very low dose did not result in any postprandial change
in apoB48 concentration. It appears therefore that the basal rate of chylomicron synthesis,
lipolysis and clearance is sufficient to metabolise the very low doses of fat ingested
without an elevation in postprandial chylomicron concentration resulting in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed chylomicron particles appear to be
constitutively synthesised even in the absence of ingested fat, with basal (fasting) levels
being approximately 70&#x000a0;% of the peak levels attained throughout the day in free-living
subjects<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Once secreted into the circulation chylomicrons are rapidly acted on by
lipoprotein lipases prior to being cleared from the circulation with a half-life of plasma
residency time between 5 and 15&#x000a0;min<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. We also observed that consumption of the very low dose of fat did not
result in a change in postprandial TAG concentrations, a finding previously reported by
Dubois <italic>et al.</italic><sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. This lack of effect on postprandial TAG concentrations again suggests
that the rate of lipolysis and/or clearance capacity is sufficiently high to process these
low levels of ingested fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, it
remains possible that the basal rate of chylomicron synthesis may accommodate low doses of
ingested fat by an increase in chylomicron particle size without the need for increased
chylomicron particle synthesis. However, following the consumption of the medium dose of fat
it appears that an increase in chylomicron synthesis is required to accommodate the ingested
fat and/or limitations in the capacity of the lipolytic, and particle clearance pathways
result in a net accumulation of postprandial TAG and chylomicron particles. Interestingly,
although the consumption of the low and medium doses of fat resulted in a significant
increase in the postprandial TAG concentration, it appears that this effect was not
localised in either the lipid-rich or lipid-poor fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>In the circulation chylomicron particles exhibit a fairly large heterogeneity with respect
to size, resulting from variations in the amount of lipid incorporation during their
enterocytic formation, and the extent of lipolysis that has occurred in
circulation<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in terms of atherogenic potential, it is only the
lipid-depleted remnant forms that are of a size sufficiently small enough to penetrate
arterial tissue<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>, and induce macrophage lipid loading<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. But the quantification of chylomicron remnants remains a difficult
proposal due to the heterogeneity of size. However, by determining the extent of circulating
chylomicrons that are of a density &#x0003c;1&#x000b7;006&#x000a0;g/ml (lipid-rich chylomicrons), we can
split the chylomicrons into those that are lipid-rich and lipid-poor, the latter of which
can be used as a surrogate measure of the remnant particles which may be small enough to
permit transcytotic delivery to the sub-endothelial space<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, the effect of increasing fat load on chylomicron
concentration appeared to be mostly due to an increase in lipid-rich chylomicrons, with a
stepwise increase in postprandial apoB48 observed in the VLDL fraction with increasing fat
load, whereas the concentration of lipid-poor chylomicrons was essentially unchanged
following all doses of fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Hence, although
consumption of greater doses of fat results in sequentially greater circulating chylomicron
concentrations, the increase is due primarily to an increase in lipid-rich chylomicron
particles. It is possible that these lipid-rich chylomicrons accumulate due to a limiting
rate of lipolysis and/or an increased chylomicron secretion; however, once lipolysed the
remnant forms (lipid-poor chylomicrons) appear to be rapidly cleared from circulation and do
not accumulate. However, although no difference was detected in the concentration of apoB48
in the lipid-poor fraction, it is possible that greater doses of fat consumption or
monitoring the postprandial response beyond 4&#x000a0;h may reveal an accumulation of lipid-poor
chylomicron remnants. Interestingly, the concentration of apoB and cholesterol in the
lipid-rich fraction did not change following any of the fat loads, suggesting that the VLDL
particle number was unaltered. As VLDL and chylomicron particles compete for the same
lipolytic pathway<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> one may speculate that an increased secretion of lipid-rich chylomicrons
may have been the primary reason for their postprandial accumulation.</p><p>The oral fat loads used in the present study consisted predominantly of lipid with only
minor levels of protein and carbohydrate (maximum: 2&#x000b7;9&#x000a0;g carbohydrate and 1&#x000b7;0&#x000a0;g protein),
mostly coming from the cream. The amount of added sugar (in the form of chocolate
flavouring) was kept constant across the different fat loads. Consequently, protein and
carbohydrate content increased slightly with increasing dose of fat load. It is likely that
this is responsible for the increase in postprandial insulin concentration observed
following the medium fat load. An increased postprandial insulinaemia has been reported in
some<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> but not all<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup> studies examining postprandial effects of increased fat load. The slight
changes in insulin concentration observed in the present study in the early postprandial
phase appear to have been sufficient to result in a suppression of postprandial glucose
concentrations, which, however, were not sufficient to significantly reduce postprandial
NEFA concentrations. Rather, NEFA concentration increased towards the end of the
postprandial period, a finding that did not appear to be affected by the dose of fat load
given (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Others have reported either a
similar postprandial NEFA response or no effect of the dose of fat on the postprandial NEFA
response<sup>(</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings in the present study show for the first time that consumption
of low doses of fat results in no effect on the postprandial concentration of chylomicron
particles. Rather, it appears that either the fat load is accommodated by the basal level of
chylomicron secretion, or the rate of lipolytic, or clearance pathways are sufficient to
rapidly process slight fluctuations in chylomicron concentration. Following consumption of
moderate doses of fat the ensuing postprandial chylomicronaemia appears to be primarily due
to an accumulation of lipid-rich chylomicron particles. Hence, in otherwise healthy male
subjects the transient postprandial lipaemia observed following consumption of moderate
doses of fat is not reflected by increased arterial exposure to pro-atherogenic (lipid-poor)
chylomicron remnants. However, in subjects with remnant clearance disturbances, it is
possible that acute lipid meals may result in elevations in chylomicron remnant levels.
Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether consumption of doses of fat greater than
those used in the present study would result in an accumulation of more lipid-poor remnant
chylomicron particles. The findings from the present study raise the possibility that there
is merit in limiting the amount of fat consumed during mealtimes in order to reduce the
circulating concentration of pro-atherogenic (lipid-poor) chylomicron remnants.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>A. P. J. conceived the idea of the study, developed the study design, conducted the study,
