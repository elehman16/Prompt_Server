Introduction</title><p>As an irreversible and progressive loss of kidney function, chronic renal failure eventually causes the patient to need dialysis or transplantation (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Longo, Fauci, &#x00026; Kasper, 2011</xref>). The global growing trend of this disease is indicative of increasing number of patients undergoing alternative treatments such as kidney transplant, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Glover, Banks, Carson, &#x00026; Martin, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira, &#x00026; Silva Filho, 2011</xref>). According to statistics by Iran&#x02019;s Center for Special Diseases and Kidney Foundation of Iran, the number of patients with chronic renal failure reached 24,000 by the end of 2008, of whom, 48.3% underwent hemodialysis, and this statistics increased by about 15% every year. Hemodialysis leads to increased life expectancy in patients, but has no effect on underlying renal disease (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Kargar Jahromi, Javadpour, Taheri, &#x00026; Poorgholami, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Monfared, Safaei, Panahandeh, &#x00026; Nemati, 2009</xref>).</p><p>End-stage renal disease is incurable and patients will require kidney transplantation for survival. Considering limitations of kidney transplant, many patients have to opt for dialysis. Although dialysis saves lives and increases longevity, it entails a wide range physical, mental, and socioeconomic problem for patients, which collectively affect their quality of life (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Ebad, Sodani, Faghihi, &#x00026; Hosseinpoor, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Poorgholami Javadpour, Saadatmand, &#x00026; Kargar Jahromi, 2016</xref>). Evidence suggests that hemodialysis is responsible for dramatic changes in quality of life of patients with chronic renal failure. In addition to several physiological changes, these patients are faced with many psychological pressures, and each in turn can impair their mentality and personality, such that the majority suffers behavioral problems and unadjusted stresses such as anxiety, depression, isolation, denial, and delusion. These problems affect their quality of life and hope, such that more problems mean lower quality of life and hope (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Sabetghadam Poorgholami et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Hope is defined as process of thinking about personal goals, and motivation for achievement of goals (causal thinking), and methods of achieving goals (intrusive thinking) (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Narimani, 2008</xref>). Hope is considered a cognitive goal-oriented process. Snider and Lopez (2005) believe highly hopeful people can create greater number of ways to achieve their goals, and are sufficiently motivated for reaching their desired outcome. On the contrary, people with little hope are neither likely to find possible solutions for their goals, nor are they highly motivated to achieve them (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Folkman, 2013</xref>). There seems to be a mutual relationship between physical and psychological illness (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, Hara, Pope, Young, &#x00026; Rula, 2011</xref>). Despair in patients has been reported to cause loss of appetite, weight loss, and reduced positive coping behaviors including non-compliance with medication regimen, reduced learning, worrying and disability (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, Johnson, &#x00026; Keely, 2004</xref>). As an inner psychological source, hope is associated with future goals and expectations and can also affect individual&#x02019;s behaviors. Hope is a psychological issue associated with self-care, adaptation to disease, and positive health behaviors (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Folkman, 2013</xref>). In relation to adaptation to chronic diseases, Miller believes there is a relationship among hope, health and recovery. Miller also believes there is a direct relationship between sedentary life (which leads to inability to solve problems, organize goals or take the right action) and weakness, disability, loss of self-esteem, and despair, all of which ultimately lead to non-recovery, frustration and disappointment (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 2007</xref>). Since renal failure is a chronic and incurable disease, these patients may feel disappointed due to reduced physical capabilities, and functional and social changes (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Pasha &#x00026; Amini, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Patient training is considered an important nursing role in all areas (including public awareness of hospital roles, cause and symptoms of diseases, treatment and self-care, etc.) (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Noohi &#x00026; Pouraboli, 2009</xref>). This role has been emphasized by the American Nursing Association (ANA) Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice (Safavi &#x00026; Brazzy, 2006). Patient training has many benefits, including reduced healthcare costs, increased quality of care, and helping patients to achieve greater independence and self-sufficiency (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Mobarak &#x00026; Karami, 2006; Najafi Mehri, Vahedparast, Hafezi, Saghafi, Farsi, &#x00026; Vahabi, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Since nurses spend longer time with hemodialysis patients compared to other medical team members (<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Pudner, 2005</xref>). They are the best to generate hope in patients, and can easily use non-medication therapy to enhance hope in patients (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Forchuk &#x00026; Reynolds, 2001</xref>). Providing non-medication measures by nurses (often with lower risk for patients) can increase hope, and can lead to cessation or reduction of drug use (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Phipps, Monahan, Sands, Marek, &#x00026; Neighbors, 2003</xref>). Using nursing interventions to increase hope is not in conflict with medical standards. One of such methods is teaching patients how to manage stress (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hossein Rezaei &#x00026; Abbaszadeh, 2002</xref>). Stress management is referred to as a set of techniques used to reduce stress, or to increase the ability to cope with life stresses. This method is effective in psychosomatic illnesses, and even in diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis (MS) (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hasanvandi, Valizade, Mehrabizade Honarmand, &#x00026; Mohammadesmaeel, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite all this and planning educational programs, in practice, patient training is less applied (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Coates, 1999</xref>). In Iran, patient training program is also poor, and evidence suggests that patient training is either not implemented, or is implemented incompletely and irregularly (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Mardanian Dehkordi, Salahshorian, Mohammad Alayha, &#x00026; Hosseini, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Increased knowledge of stress management in hemodialysis patients can increase their performance, and increased stress management ability promises increased hope in these patients. Overcrowded hemodialysis department is highly stressful for patients, and inadequate nurse/patient ratio does not lend itself to receiving necessary training. Given all the above, and cultural, social, and economic differences in Iran (compared to other countries), this study aims to assess the effect of stress management training on hope in hemodialysis patients, so that a small step may be taken to abate patient suffering and reduce costs incurred to these patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Study population consisted of patients with advanced chronic renal failure attending hemodialysis department of Motahari Hospital in Jahrom in 2013-2014. Study participants were selected purposively and were then randomly divided into two groups using Random Allocation software. Sampling was conducted after obtaining necessary permissions and coordination with hemodialysis department authorities. Study inclusion criteria were the following: age between 18 and 65 years old, end stage renal disease, constantly receiving hemodialysis treatment for at least 6 months for once to three times per week lasting 3 to 4 hours each time, with no intention to leave Jahrom or to have kidney transplant in the course of intervention, receiving no formal hemodialysis training, no cognitive or psychological disorders, Farsi speaking with minimum literacy, and having a mobile phone.

Patients in this group were also able to phone the researchers 24 hours a day in case of questions or problems. The control group received routine training provided in hemodialysis department, and did not participate in training sessions or receive educational booklet.

Discussion</title><p>The present study aimed to assess the effect of stress management training on the level of hope in hemodialysis patients. Descriptive data showed that trial and control groups matched in terms of age, gender, training, and duration of disease. According to the results, intervention was able to increase mean hope score in stress management training group compared to the control. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of pretest and posttest mean scores (P&#x0003c;0.001). In other words, the difference between the two groups in hope scores was significant. Studies conducted on progressive renal failure in Iran so far have rather focused on patients&#x02019; quality of life, stress and coping mechanisms using quantitative or statistical methods, but stress management training and its effect on hope in hemodialysis patients in Iran had not been studied. Stress management training can reduce anxiety and depression, and increase the number of ways to cope with stress. Furthermore, it is a strategy for better control of the disease, reduction and prevention of physical and psychosocial complications. Stress management has been considered effective in many psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression, psychosomatic diseases, and even diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Studies by <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">McGregor (2004)</xref> and <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Antoni (2006</xref> and <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">2009)</xref> show that stress management training led to reduced anxiety, stress, and depression in women with breast cancer (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">McGregor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Antoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Antoni, 2009</xref>). Some researchers consider stress management group training effective in reducing negative emotions and increasing a sense of self-efficacy and hope in chronic patients (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Cobden, Niessen, Barr, Rutten, &#x00026; Redekop, 2010</xref>). According to the results obtained, 5 sessions of stress management training led to improvement in mean hope score in the intervention group compared to the control. The present study results concur with those found by Hassanvandi et al. (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hasanvandi, Valizade, Mehrabizade Honarmand, &#x00026; Mohammadesmaeel, 2013</xref>). And Hamid et al. regarding positive effect of stress management training program (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hamid, 2011</xref>). Results of a study by Shojaee et al. showed a significant improvement in mean hope score in the intervention group after intervention (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Shojaee, Nehrir, Naderi, &#x00026; Zareiyan, 2012</xref>), which agrees with the present study results. Researchers in nursing have long been investigating hope, and Fryback considers hope as one of the three main subjects in mental, emotional, and health of patients with end stage diseases. Some researchers in nursing even propose hope as a part of patient care process. Thus, nurses can inspire hope in patients by applying interventions with the above objectives. Quoting Lavaven, Tsay asserts that there is a direct relationship between taking responsibility for self-care and emotional-psychological states in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Tsay &#x00026; Healstead, 2002</xref>). Eresk et al. reported the following factors as the most important nursing strategies for generating hope in patients: symptom management, making patients happy with occasional jesting, encouraging patients&#x02019; creative activities, minimizing social limitations, easy communication, reviewing past successes, organizing and correcting objectives, spending time with patient&#x02019;s family, and emphasizing patient&#x02019;s religious beliefs (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Shojaee, Nehrir, Naderi, &#x00026; Zareiyan, 2012</xref>). In the present study, patients that received stress management training had higher mean hope scores. Therefore, hope and stress can be considered as factors affecting outcomes of chronic diseases. All above studies concur with the present study regarding stress management training, and the results showed that stress management training led to better mean hope scores in the intervention group compared to the control (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Narimani, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Ebad Sodani, Faghihi, &#x00026; Hosseinpoor, 2009</xref>). To improve hope in patients with chronic diseases, the majority of studies emphasize patient training and increased patient information, improvement in patient self-care performance, reinforcement of beliefs, and ultimately, all-out patient support. Other studies consider the following as interventions to increase hope in patients: patient information, improving self-care, social support programs, educational sessions, programs designed for patient discharge, programs that improve sense of being in control in patients, increased patient contact with medical team, and secure environment for expressing anxieties and problems (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Barnason, Zimmerman, &#x00026; Young, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Moattari Ebrahimi, Sharifi, &#x00026; Rouzbeh, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Due to the high prevalence of patients requiring hemodialysis, to prevent increased medical costs, and to enhance the process of recovery, it is necessary to use psychological therapies. Stress management and life skills training are considered effective in reducing stress, anxiety and depression in general population (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hasanvandi, Valizade, Mehrabizade Honarmand, &#x00026; Mohammadesmaeel, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Hamid, 2011</xref>). Therefore, providing such trainings can also be beneficial to hemodialysis patients. Also, to better provide hemodialysis patients with psychological health, stress management group training (or individual training if required) is beneficial, and will help reduce problems of these patients. Given adverse social, economic, and psychiatric effects of hemodialysis on family and community, it is recommended to use stress management strategies in hemodialysis patients.</p><p>Considering chronic nature of the disease in patients undergoing hemodialysis, despair is inevitable in these patients. On the other hand, the role of this internal factor cannot be overlooked in self-care in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The present study results showed that stress management training leads to increased hope in the case group. Finally, this strategy can also be recommended for inspiring hope in patients suffering other chronic diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The researcher wishes to thank all participants, and all those that supported this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Asadi Lari</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Standardization of Three Hope Scales, as Possible Measures at the End of Life, in Iranian Population</article-title><source>Iranian Journal of Cancer Prevention</source><year>2011</year><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>71</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antoni</surname><given-names>M.
