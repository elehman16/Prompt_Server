In Australia, national costs of excessive alcohol consumption is estimated at 15 billion dollars annually, attributed to decreased workplace productivity, strain on the healthcare system, road or vehicular accidents, crime and associated costs, illness, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Excessive alcohol consumption is especially apparent in university populations, with a third of students drinking to hazardous levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and appearing to outdrink their non-student peers on drinking occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Research shows that excessive alcohol consumption significantly impairs students&#x02019; health and academic performance, and increases risk-taking behaviors such as unplanned sexual activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Recent research has focussed on <italic>pre-drinking</italic>, the practice of consuming alcohol prior to attending a subsequent event, where alcohol consumption often continues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Pre-drinking is also referred to as <italic>prepartying</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], <italic>pregaming</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and <italic>pre-loading</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Pre-drinking has been found to constitute more than 40&#x000a0;% of alcohol consumption on drinking occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and an Australian multi-site study conducted in night entertainment areas found 65&#x000a0;% of people reported pre-drinking prior to &#x02018;going out&#x02019; for that evening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Pre-drinking has been shown to be largely socially-motivated, with pre-drinkers citing &#x0201c;catching up&#x0201d; with friends and meeting new people as precipitating factors contributing to the popularity of these sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. LaBrie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found that <italic>interpersonal enhancement</italic> (i.e., pre-drinking for socialisation or enjoyment) was the strongest predictor of pre-drinking frequency and alcohol consumption, and demonstrated that pre-drinking motives differ from general alcohol consumption motives. Alcohol price has also been shown to be related to pre-drinking. Not only have students cited cost as influencing their pre-drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but Miller and Droste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have shown that students change their hypothetical drinking decisions based on increases in the cost per drink. A recent study shows a relationship between strongly endorsing a cost motive for pre-drinking, and higher reported typical pre-drinking consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In a series of recent studies, pre-drinking has been implicated as specifically contributing to alcohol-related harm. An event-level analysis by Barry et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] found pre-drinking status significantly predicted blood-alcohol concentration, as measured by a breathalyser device. Merrill et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] used event-level associations to reveal that pre-drinking on any given day was a significant predictor of alcohol related harm in university students, beyond both the total alcohol consumed on that day, and typical drinks consumed per day. In a sample of undergraduates, Caudwell and Hagger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found higher scores on pre-drinking cost motive items predicted higher incidence of alcohol-related harm in the previous twelve months. Pre-drinking appears to present an elevated risk to young adults, who demonstrate a lack of awareness of safe alcohol consumption limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and, in laboratory settings, are unable to accurately pour a standard drink<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To date, no interventions specifically aimed at reducing pre-drinking alcohol consumption have been developed. This protocol outlines a theory-based intervention that will attempt to reduce alcohol consumption during pre-drinking sessions, and the experience of alcohol-related harm.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theory-based interventions for excessive alcohol consumption</title><p id="Par9">One approach to reducing excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm among undergraduates is to develop behavioral interventions based on social psychological and motivational theories of health behavior. The use of such theories in informing interventions is important in targeting the influential determinants of health behavior, facilitating an understanding of &#x0201c;what works, and for whom&#x0201d;, and allows for testing of the component theories in accounting for behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A range of health behavioral interventions targeting excessive alcohol consumption have been developed in university student populations, incorporating brief screening and feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], motivational [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], peer or normative feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and volitional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Though the efficacy of online interventions appears to bring about small changes in alcohol consumption behaviour [d&#x02009;+&#x02009;= 0.14; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]], many interventions are not theory-based, and there is evidence that theory-based interventions that closely develop intervention content to target specific psychological variables (commonly identified as correlates or predictors of alcohol consumption) are efficacious, with medium-sized effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence supports the use of online delivery of alcohol interventions in student populations as they appear preferable to face-to-face methods (e.g., contact with a health professional) and may be especially useful for at-risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the development of a theory-based online intervention to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption may be a useful endeavour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The theory of planned behavior</title><p id="Par10">The <italic>theory of planned behaviour</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] has been extensively applied to predict a range of health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The theory considers behavioural <italic>intention</italic> the focal point of behavioural engagement, where <italic>intention</italic> is formed by belief-based constructs of <italic>attitude</italic>, <italic>subjective norm</italic>, and <italic>perceived behavioral control</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. <italic>Attitude</italic> comprises belief-based evaluations of the behavior of interest; <italic>subjective norm</italic> consists of perceived social influence regarding behavioural engagement, and; <italic>perceived behavioral control</italic> constitutes the individual&#x02019;s ability to perform the behavior. The theory has been widely used across a range of health behavioural contexts, with a recent meta-analysis supporting the tenets of the theory-based model in predicting intention and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. More recently, a meta-analysis of the theory applied to alcohol consumption behaviour has found attitudes strongly related to alcohol consumption intentions (r<sub>+</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.62), and intentions moderately related to behaviour (r<sub>+</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.54) with authors concluding that both attitudes and intentions towards alcohol consumption are worthwhile targets for alcohol consumption behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Generally, changes in behavioral intention appear to produce small-to-moderate changes in behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], with theory-based health behavioral interventions informed by the theory of planned behavior demonstrating particular efficacy [d&#x02009;+&#x02009;= 0.36; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]], supporting our advocacy of adopting a theoretical approach.</p><p id="Par11">A prominent criticism of the theory is the <italic>intention-behavior gap</italic>: the relative weakness in the link between intention and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This is an important issue for interventions where intention may be the focus, yet it is a weak or modest predictor of behavioural engagement. For example, McEachan, Conner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] shows the intention-behaviour relationship is weaker for health risk behaviours, such as abstaining from alcohol consumption, compared to health enhancing behaviors such as diet and exercise. A recent meta-analysis investigating the relationships between the theory of planned behaviour constructs applied to alcohol consumption concluded that interventions targeting attitudes and subjective norm may be worthwhile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, there is little utility in attempting to change intention through its antecedent constructs, where a substantial intention-behaviour gap is unlikely to facilitate meaningful behaviour change. This point and the utility of the theory of planned behaviour in health behavioural research is one of current debate (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]), with Schwarzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] suggesting that post-intentional (i.e., volitional) constructs that are known to influence behaviour are of importance in interventions based on the theory of planned behaviour. <italic>Implementation intentions</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] present an approach to &#x0201c;closing&#x0201d; the intention-behavior gap by linking important contextual cues to enacting the intended behaviour in the volitional stage, increasing the likelihood that the behavior is carried out in accordance with one&#x02019;s intentions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Implementation intentions and volition</title><p id="Par12">According to Gollwitzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], individuals who intend to reach an intended goal often fail to do so due to limitations in their ability to self-regulate behaviour. These limitations may constitute reasons such as failing to get started (e.g., forgetting or failing to act at the opportunity to do so) and getting derailed (e.g., due to attentional or competing factors; Gollwitzer &#x00026; Sheeran, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]). For example, a pre-drinking goal intention may be &#x0201c;I intend to reduce my alcohol consumption drinking during pre-drinking sessions&#x0201d;. However, an individual with this intention may not recognise the chance to enact that intention or fail to do so at the critical moment (e.g., where an environment is conducive to excessive alcohol consumption). <italic>Implementation intentions</italic> increase the likelihood that people will attain their intended goals by specifying contextual details of how these goals will be implemented, as well as when, and where [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. An implementation intention for pre-drinking may therefore be &#x0201c;when I have finished an alcoholic drink at a pre-drinking session, I will then drink a glass of water or soft drink to help reduce my alcohol consumption&#x0201d;. This allows individuals to switch from making conscious, effortful deliberations about enacting behaviour, to responding automatically to critical cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], mitigating the effects of self-regulatory limitations on carrying out intended behaviours. A meta-analysis by Gollwitzer and Sheeran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] shows that there is a considerable effect (<italic>d</italic>
<sub><italic>+</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.65) of implementation intentions in facilitating goal attainment over that of simply forming goal intentions. Importantly, implementation intention approaches have been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in young people including university students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Key features of an implementation intention approach include detailing <italic>how</italic> the intended behaviour will be enacted. In previous studies using this approach, participants either formed their own implementation intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] or chose from a menu of responses to refusing a drink with the option of developing their own plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These studies and a recent review by Hagger and Luszczynska [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] suggest that implementation intentions may be more successful if they include additional planning components that address certain contingencies in an <italic>if-then</italic> format, such as &#x0201c;<italic>if</italic> I am offered an alcoholic drink, <italic>then</italic> I will politely refuse by saying, &#x02018;No thanks, I have to drive&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the context of pre-drinking, there are likely many contextual scenarios where individuals may be at risk of consuming excessive amount of alcohol (e.g., drinking games, coercion or pressure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Therefore, the formation of multiple implementation intentions to address these scenarios may be especially effective in reducing pre-drinking alcohol consumption. However, compelling individuals to intend to perform certain behaviours and assisting them in doing so may not be as effective if individuals lack the necessary motivational resources to facilitate the formation of these intentions and subsequent behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Self-determination theory</title><p id="Par14">Another theoretical framework that has seen wide application in many health-related fields is <italic>self-determination theory</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Self-determination theory places the <italic>quality</italic> of an individuals&#x02019; motivation as influential in behavioural engagement and persistence. Individuals who exhibit <italic>controlled motivation</italic> to engage in a behaviour tend to do so because of certain external contingencies - monetary incentive or reward, or for self-esteem rationales such as avoiding guilt or blame, or embarrassment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Individuals who exhibit <italic>autonomous motivation</italic> to engage in a behaviour tend to do so because it serves personally-relevant goals or the act is itself intrinsically rewarding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The more autonomously motivated an individual is towards engaging in behaviour, the more likely they will be to perform and persist in performing that behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates attitudes and intentions towards engaging in health behaviour are more strongly linked to autonomous motivation rather than controlled motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Health behavioural interventions based on self-determination focus on the facilitation of autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This is often achieved by providing <italic>autonomy support &#x02013;</italic> a supportive context and rationale for the individuals&#x02019; internalising of behavioural regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The provision of autonomy support and facilitation of autonomous motivation have demonstrated validity in engendering positive behavioural change in a wide context of health behavioural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Within the context of alcohol consumption, studies involving self-determination theory have found relationships between autonomous forms of motivation and reductions in self-reported alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], as well as intentions to keep alcohol consumption within limits, and reductions in alcohol units consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Pavey and Sparks found that autonomy in relation to perceptions of health risk information and autonomous motivation to engage in health protective behaviours were related to participation in those behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Conversely, studies on peer influences in college drinkers have shown individuals who exhibit controlled motivation to drink excessively do so because they tend to appraise situations from a controlled orientation, related to their sense of self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, an intervention that provides an autonomy-supportive context for reduced alcohol consumption may prove effective for pre-drinkers who consume alcohol excessively or in contexts where motivation to reduce excessive alcohol consumption may be lacking. Given research demonstrating the importance of autonomy in enhancing receptiveness to health risk information, and indicating intrinsic goals are more likely to be pursued than those where individuals feel compelled to pursue goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], individuals may be more autonomously motivated to reduce their pre-drinking alcohol consumption if they generate their own autonomous reasons for pursuing such a goal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Evidence for combining approaches</title><p id="Par17">A meta-analysis of internet-based health behavioral interventions has found those incorporating more behavior change techniques tended to have larger effects, potentially due to these techniques targeting different components of the behaviour change process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. According to the model of action phases proposed by Heckhausen and Gollwitzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], a &#x0201c;Rubicon&#x0201d; exists between a deliberative, or <italic>predecisional</italic> phase, and a volitional, or <italic>preactional</italic> phase. The predecisional phase incorporates the feasibility and desirability of a behavioral outcome; the motivational tendency towards enacting that behavior which leads to the formation of a <italic>goal intention</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The preactional phase therefore incorporates how best to meet the behavioral goal &#x02013; the stage at which individuals may fall short of meeting that goal due to limitations in their ability to self-regulate behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. It follows, therefore, that interventions targeting both motivation and volitional phases of action may be more effective in evoking behaviour change.</p><p id="Par18">Studies have also shown that intentions are more likely to be carried out if they are formed consistent with autonomous reasons for engaging in the target behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and when the behavior is consistent with their psychological needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Evidence shows support for a synergistic relationship between autonomous motivation and the formation of implementation intentions in facilitating goal-directed behaviour. For example, a study on goal <italic>self-concordance</italic> (i.e., the extent to which a goal-directed behaviour is self-determined), found self-concordance significantly predicted progress on a range of participant goals, and that the relationship between goal self-concordance and progress was dependent on whether or not participants formed implementation intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Koestner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] demonstrated that participants who formed autonomy-supportive implementation intentions achieved greater goal progress than those in a neutral condition (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.67). The authors attribute this to the internalisation of goals in a self-concordant manner that reflects heightened personal interest and meaning. In terms of interventions based on this premise, targeting the motivational and volitional phases in tandem show increased efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], promoting exercise behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], reducing saturated fat intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], and improving fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] over either approach in isolation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The present study</title><p id="Par19">The purpose of the present study is to test an online, theory-based intervention to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption among undergraduate students who pre-drink. The intervention will test the effects of two theory-based techniques targeting the predecisional and implemental phases of the model of action phases through: (1) facilitating autonomous motivation to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption, and (2) prompting the individual to form context-specific implementation intentions to help bridge the goal intention-behavior gap. Combining these techniques should see greater reductions in pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm than either approach in isolation. The current research makes an original contribution to knowledge by adopting a factorial design, which permits us to examine the independent and interactive effects of two intervention components related to different processes in the model of action phases. The research builds on previous approaches to promoting autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] and based on current &#x02018;best practice&#x02019; recommendations for using implementation intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

No theory-based interventions to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption have yet to be developed. The present protocol has outlined a theory-based intervention that will attempt to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm, by targeting the volitional and motivational phases of action, according to the action-phase model outlined by Heckhausen and Gollwitzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. There is evidence that the provision of autonomy support is associated with greater autonomous motivation to engage in behaviour, and that autonomous motivations for reducing alcohol consumption are associated with reductions in alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Although, exhibiting motivation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for behavioural enactment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Forming implementation intentions has been shown to strengthen the link between intention and behaviour, by providing a link between a contextual cue and an intended response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Combining these approaches is based on the premise that promoting goal self-concordance is important in successful goal attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and is integral to the efficacy of implementation intention approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Therefore, an approach that combines the volitional and motivational action phases, providing individuals with autonomy supportive context for behaviour change and the regulatory skills with which to translate this motivational impetus into behaviour, may be more effective in eliciting successful behaviour change. We therefore expect that while participants in the autonomy support and implementation intention conditions will report lower pre-drinking alcohol consumption at follow-up, the combination of these approaches will see the greatest reduction in pre-drinking alcohol consumption. This is because individuals may be autonomously motivated and intend to reduce their pre-drinking alcohol consumption, let may lack the regulatory capacity required to translate this intention into action (i.e., inclined abstainers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Similarly, the formation of if-then plans to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption may not lead to action if the underlying rationale for these plans is not autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Providing autonomy support to facilitate autonomous motivation will form a sound basis for the development of if-then plans, leading to the translation of that motivational basis into successful action and greater reductions pre-drinking alcohol consumption.</p><p id="Par39">There are some limitations in the design of the intervention that should be noted. As the intervention will be delivered online, there may be potential problems with attrition between baseline and follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This has the potential to reduce the statistical power of the intervention to detect an effect, and limit testing intervention effects on the relevant theoretical constructs. To mitigate this, recruitment will attempt to account for the attrition rate observed in recent online interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. It is important to note that the primary focus of the intervention is to ascertain the overall efficacy of the intervention conditions in terms of reductions in the primary outcome variables, pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm, rather than the mediating effects of theoretical constructs which are important issues but secondary to overall effects. Secondly, reviews of alcohol interventions often cite the lack of continued follow-up as detrimental to establishing the efficacy of these interventions over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. However, the efficacy of this intervention can be considered a basis for further research that ascertains the extent of intervention efficacy over time. Finally, there are many issues with the validity and accuracy of self-reported alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. However, by using pictorial aids detailing standard drink equivalents for commonly-consumed alcoholic beverage containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], we attempt to mitigate errors in measurement. Further, by measuring goal attainment, the effect of the intervention on fulfilling participant goals to reduce pre-drinking alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm can also be assessed.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec31"><title>Intervention components</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>Control condition</title><p id="Par40">Participants are presented with two guidelines from the NHMRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to inform them of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of alcohol-related harm over a lifetime, and reducing the risk of injury on a single occasion of drinking.</p><p id="Par41">GUIDELINE 1</p><p id="Par42">Reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm over a lifetime.</p><p id="Par43">The lifetime risk of harm from drinking alcohol increases with the amount consumed.</p><p id="Par44">For healthy men and women, drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day reduces the lifetime risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury.</p><p id="Par45">GUIDELINE 2</p><p id="Par46">Reducing the risk of injury on a single occasion of drinking.</p><p id="Par47">On a single occasion of drinking, the risk of alcohol-related injury increases with the amount consumed.</p><p id="Par48">For healthy men and women, drinking no more than four standard drinks on a single occasion reduces the risk of alcohol-related injury arising from that occasion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Autonomy support condition</title><p id="Par49">Participants are presented with a script comprising a series of statements using autonomy-supportive language, and given prompts to write about reasons pursuing the goal of reducing their pre-drinking alcohol consumption may be worthwhile:</p><p id="Par50">&#x0201c;Over the next few weeks, we&#x02019;d like you to consider reducing your pre-drinking alcohol consumption.
