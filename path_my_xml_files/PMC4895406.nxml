Systemic hypertension in cats is most commonly associated with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Other conditions associated with the development of secondary hypertension in cats include hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus (DM), primary hyperaldosteronism, and pheochromocytoma.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Chronically sustained increases in BP cause injury to various tissues, mainly to kidneys, eyes, brain, and heart. This is commonly referred to as target organ damage (TOD).</p><p>According to the guidelines of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) Hypertension Consensus Panel,<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> hypertension is categorized according to its risk of TOD: minimal risk (&#x0003c;150/95&#x000a0;mmHg), mild risk (150&#x02013;159/95&#x02013;99&#x000a0;mmHg), moderate risk (160&#x02013;179/100&#x02013;119&#x000a0;mmHg), and severe risk (&#x0003e;180/120&#x000a0;mmHg).</p><p>The goal of antihypertensive treatment is to maximally decrease the risk of TOD, which is achieved with persistent BP reduction to values &#x0003c;150/95&#x000a0;mmHg. Currently, no drugs are approved for treatment of hypertension in cats, but calcium channel blockers (CCB) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the most widely used antihypertensive agents in practice.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>
</p><p>Amlodipine has been considered the treatment of choice for hypertension in cats for more than a decade. Amlodipine at a dose of 0.125&#x02013;0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg once daily has been shown to significantly decrease BP in spontaneously hypertensive cats in several clinical trials.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> According to the ACVIM consensus statement on hypertension,<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> standard veterinary textbooks, and other publications, CCBs are the first choice for antihypertensive treatment in cats.</p><p>There is, however, no amlodipine product approved for veterinary use for treatment of hypertension in cats; therefore amlodipine approved for human use has been used off&#x02010;label in veterinary medicine. The product approved for human use has certain disadvantages such as difficult dosing because of high amlodipine concentration and challenging administration because of lack of palatable formulation. Thus, veterinary profession lacks an approved medication effective in majority of cases for feline hypertension.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of chewable amlodipine tablets in cats diagnosed with systemic arterial hypertension. The formulation used in this study has been shown to have similar in vitro dissolution profile (immediate release tablet) to that of the human formulation.</p><sec id="jvim12589-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim12589-sec-0009"><title>Study Design</title><p>The randomized, multicenter, double&#x02010;blinded, placebo&#x02010;controlled, parallel group study was conducted at 20 private veterinary clinics in 3 European countries (Finland, France, and Germany). This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Informed consent was obtained from each animal owner prior to enrollment. The welfare, treatment, and care of study animals at study sites were ensured by veterinary supervision. Permission to conduct the study was received from each National Regulatory Agency prior to commencement.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12589-sec-0010"><title>Study Animals</title><p>Cats included in the study were identified by the participating veterinarians in the course of their routine clinical practice. Veterinary practices were encouraged to screen cats at risk (old cats, including those with CKD or other diseases related to hypertension). To be eligible for the study, cats had to weigh between 2.5 and 10.0&#x000a0;kg, and have a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x02265;165&#x000a0;mmHg on 2 separate visits within 2&#x000a0;weeks, to rule out white coat hypertension. If the cat had a primary disease associated with hypertension (e.g. CKD, hyperthyroidism, primary hyperaldosteronism, DM, or pheochromocytoma), the primary disease had to be stable with no need for immediate initiation of other medication or dose adjustment of current medication.</p><p>Cats were excluded from study if they met any of the following criteria: use of systemic treatment with CCBs, vasodilators, alpha&#x02010;1 adrenergic antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta&#x02010;blockers, aldosterone antagonists within 30&#x000a0;days of screening; use of long&#x02010;acting glucocorticoids or continuous use of short&#x02010;acting glucocorticoids within 3&#x000a0;months of screening, initiation or change in dosing of methimazole, carbimazole, phenylpropalamine, nonsteroidal anti&#x02010;inflammatory drugs, diuretics, short&#x02010;acting systemic glucocorticoids, or any other medication for primary disease within 14&#x000a0;days of screening; starting on ACE inhibitors or insulin treatment for DM or a change in dosing of existing ACE inhibitors or insulin or renal diet within 30&#x000a0;days of screening and; presence of ocular or neurological signs, which were deemed to be caused by hypertension and requiring immediate medical treatment. Cats were also excluded if SBP &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mmHg was recorded, unless the investigator estimated that the cat could be enrolled in the study. Other reasons for exclusion were presence of clinically relevant liver failure or impaired hepatic function and unstable CKD that was expected to worsen markedly during the study.</p><p>The dose of amlodipine was determined from data found in literature. In previous studies, most cats received an initial single dose of 0.625&#x000a0;mg amlodipine daily. This dosage regimen was chosen mainly for practical reasons as this corresponds to 1/8 of the 5&#x000a0;mg tablet registered for human use.</p><p>The amlodipine product used in this study was a chewable chicken flavored tablet designed for cats. Placebo tablets were equal in size and shape, contained the same excipients but no active ingredient.</p><p>The overall study design and plan is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="jvim12589-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

It confirms findings of the first placebo&#x02010;controlled study which involved just 9 cats<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and other uncontrolled studies.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> It increases our confidence because of the fact that changes induced by amlodipine were compared to placebo in a large cohort of cats seen in primary care practices and improves understanding of the dose required to produce a clinically relevant reduction in arterial BP. Precision in dosing amlodipine in the present study was facilitated by a cat&#x02010;specific formulation of amlodipine and a tablet size that facilitated dosing between 0.125 and 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight.</p><p>The design of the present study demonstrates that when BP of 34 cats is measured repeatedly, the administration of a placebo tablet led to an apparent reduction of about 10&#x000a0;mmHg (5% reduction from baseline) after 14&#x000a0;days. No further reduction was seen after further 14&#x000a0;days in the placebo group suggesting this decrease in BP might be accounted by a training effect although other explanations are possible. This contrasted with change in SBP seen in group of 40 cats receiving amlodipine which decreased by more than twice the reduction seen in the placebo group. Doubling the amlodipine dose resulted in further significant reduction in SBP over next 14&#x000a0;days increasing the difference between the 2 groups after 28&#x000a0;days of treatment. The effect of amlodipine was further demonstrated in placebo group after they were switched to receive amlodipine. Their SBP reduced to very similar levels to those seen in amlodipine treated cats by Day 42 of the study.</p><p>In addition to having the gold standard design of a randomized, controlled, double&#x02010;blinded clinical trial, the present study had a number of other strengths which set it apart from previous published studies. Firstly, primary efficacy measure was defined a priori as a reduction in SBP to below 150&#x000a0;mmHg or a decrease from baseline pressure of more than 15%. Furthermore, number of cats recruited was determined by a power calculation which assumed that 70% of amlodipine treated and 30% of placebo treated cats would attain this primary efficacy endpoint. The power calculation showed that 72 cats would need to be recruited if these assumptions were correct, in order to determine whether amlodipine was superior to placebo in achieving this endpoint. In the 2 placebo&#x02010;controlled studies in the published literature,<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> one was very much a pilot study involving just 9 client&#x02010;owned cats<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and other was an experimental model study where hypertension was induced by subtotal nephrectomy.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Neither of these studies had determined a target BP reduction a priori and no power calculations are mentioned in these papers.</p><p>Another factor that distinguishes the present study is its multicentric design. It shows that the results are applicable across a range of different clinics in 3 European countries. The fact that the study was well&#x02010;designed with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria was essential for it to work as a multicenter study. Furthermore, it was essential to standardize the method of BP measurement and ensure all personnel measuring BP were well&#x02010;trained in the selected method. None of the commonly used indirect BP measurement techniques used in clinical practice performs sufficiently well that they would be approved by the Association of Medical Instruments as being valid. High definition oscillometry was selected for the present study and recent data<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> suggests that this method compares favorably with direct telemetry measurements made in young healthy cats. It has the advantage of providing a digital output that can be stored and examined after the measurement session by an expert to quality control the values taken in clinic. Thus, the method of BP measurement selected for this trial minimized intraoperator variability by standardization through training and additional quality control measures.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint used in the present study was based on expert opinion of the risk of TOD resulting from persistently elevated BP. A reduction of SBP below 150&#x000a0;mmHg would decrease the risk of TOD from moderate to negligible according to the ACVIM consensus statement on hypertension.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Cats entering the study with a baseline SBP between 165 and 176&#x000a0;mmHg, would respond if their SBP was reduced below 150&#x000a0;mmHg (15% of the baseline SBP). Responders with starting SBP between 177 and 187&#x000a0;mmHg would notice a reduction in SBP below 160&#x000a0;mmHg (going from moderate or severe risk to mild risk) and those between 188 and 211&#x000a0;mmHg baseline SBP, would be taken from severe risk to moderate risk (160&#x02013;180&#x000a0;mmHg) of TOD. Thus, achievement of primary efficacy endpoint, by consensus, should lead to protection of hypertensive cats against TOD.</p><p>Two&#x02010;thirds of the recruited cats (63%) randomized to receive amlodipine were responders whereas just 1 in 6 cats (18%) apparently responded to placebo. The reason why administration of placebo led to a reduction in BP relative to baseline is unclear. One possible explanation is that this represented a training effect in response to repeated BP measurement sessions over a period of 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;months. Classification of a cat as a responder was not influenced by factors other than amlodipine treatment (e.g. baseline SBP, concomitant ACE inhibitor treatment, underlying disease). In previously published studies, administration of amlodipine has been associated with reductions in SBP of over 40&#x000a0;mmHg.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> The most likely reasons for larger reduction in BP achieved in previous studies, is that a higher proportion of cats enrolled in these studies had baseline SBP values above 200&#x000a0;mmHg. Although practitioners could use their discretion in enrolling cats with such high SBP in the present study, it seems likely that as this was a randomized placebo&#x02010;controlled trial, the veterinarians and owners were reluctant to enroll cats with such high SBP particularly where there was evidence of TOD (usually hypertensive retinopathy). Indeed, in the present study, secondary analysis showed that the absolute magnitude of reduction in SBP was influenced by baseline SBP value as well as whether the cat received amlodipine, supporting the conclusion that smaller reduction in SBP seen in the present study is explained by the relatively lower baseline SBP of the cats enrolled.</p><p>Nevertheless, the population of cats enrolled in the present study appears to be typical of those seen in clinical practice that are diagnosed with systemic arterial hypertension.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> They were typical in terms of age (median age 14&#x000a0;years), sex (equal numbers of neutered males and females), breed (majority of cats being nonpedigree) and underlying disease (CKD International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 2 and 3, hyperthyroidism and idiopathic making up the majority of the diagnoses). The major difference from previous studies was the relatively low prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy seen, again possibly explained by the reluctance of veterinarians and owners to enroll cats into a placebo&#x02010;controlled study when there is clear evidence of TOD. The block randomization procedure produced 2 groups well&#x02010;matched in terms of all of these factors as well as the baseline SBP. The post&#x02010;treatment SBP achieved with amlodipine treatment in the present study was similar to that seen in other studies (median value of 150&#x000a0;mmHg). As discussed above, reduction in SBP achieved relative to that seen in the placebo was clinically significant and highly likely to be protective in the cats responding. Only a small minority of cats (16%) were taking ACE inhibitors and this concomitant treatment did not influence whether a cat was classified as a responder or not.</p><p>Looking at SBP and responder rates by disease etiology, cats with idiopathic hypertension showed higher proportion of nonresponders compared to cats with other underlying diseases like CKD or hyperthyroidism. Present medical history, AEs during the study or age of cats gave no obvious explanation for these cats not responding to treatment. However, the conclusion that cats with idiopathic hypertension react less to amlodipine than cats with other diseases cannot be made because of small number of cases.</p><p>The factors that meant the minority (just over a third) of cats being nonresponders to amlodipine remain to be determined; possible factors including poor compliance, individual (including genetic) variation in pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of amlodipine or resistance of the underlying pathophysiology of the hypertension to arterial vasodilators. In human medicine, large studies of factors influencing response of hypertensive patients to amlodipine have not identified genetic factors, either through a candidate gene approach<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> or genome wide association studies.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> In a human clinical trial,<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> low calcium, low cholesterol, and low urinary sodium excretion were all associated with more effective response of patients to the BP lowering effect of amlodipine. In humans, amlodipine is a CYP3A enzyme substrate and some studies have identified certain genotypes (e.g. CYP3A5*3/*3) to be associated with greater response to amlodipine but this is highly dependent on the population studied and complicated by the role of the CYP3A enzyme involved in cortisol and corticosterone metabolism; and the explanation of differences seen between different genotypes of CYP3A may not necessarily relate to pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.<xref rid="jvim12589-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> It is clear that future research should explore factors explaining the variation in response of client&#x02010;owned hypertensive cats to amlodipine.</p><p>Nevertheless, the present study confirms amlodipine as a highly efficacious antihypertensive agent. The AEs seen in the present study were what might be expected in elderly cats with multiple medical problems. They were very similar in frequency and nature between amlodipine and placebo groups over the first 28&#x000a0;days of study indicating that they were unlikely to be directly related to amlodipine treatment itself.</p><p>The present study has confirmed the efficacy and safety of amlodipine as a monotherapy for majority of cats with hypertension. Cats given a placebo showed a small reduction in BP with a small minority being classified as responders demonstrating the importance of including a placebo when assessing antihypertensive drug treatments in hypertensive cats.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12589-sec-0020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study shows that amlodipine is superior to placebo in treatment of client&#x02010;owned cats with hypertension. The chewable amlodipine formulation effectively reduced SBP, had good palatability and was well&#x02010;tolerated. It can be used concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and in cats with CKD.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim12589-sec-0021"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank all the veterinarians, owners of cats, and study team members who participated in the study.</p><p>
