With respect to the NNCS, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor &#x003b1;7 (&#x003b1;7nAChR) mRNA was significantly lower in lesional AD skin at baseline. After TSST, PGP 9.5+ NF numbers dropped in lesional AD as did their contacts with mast cells. NGF+ NF now correlated with SCORAD and mast cell-NF contacts with itch in non-lesional skin.

An exemplary chronic inflammatory skin disease, atopic dermatitis (AD), greatly contributed to our understanding of the underlying neuroendocrine-immune interactions <xref rid="pone.0113552-BuskeKirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113552-Segerstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Most studies investigating the link between heightened stress and worsened inflammation in humans demonstrated a contribution of the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and the sympathetic axis (SA) to its characteristic immune profile: prominent production of pro-allergic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, which drive humoral and eosinophilic inflammation and dominate the initial lesion. Later on, cytokines driving cellular adaptive immunity rise in addition, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) and interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;).</p><p>In addition, a substantial number of studies - mainly done in animal experimental models that utilize inbred mice - have demonstrated the contribution of neurotrophin- and neuropeptide-dependent neurogenic inflammation to stress-induced aggravation of allergic flares <xref rid="pone.0113552-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113552-Theoharides1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This innate immune response, accounts for about 50% stress-induced worsening of skin inflammation in mice with an experimentally induced allergic dermatitis <xref rid="pone.0113552-Pavlovic2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These basic research findings support the concept that maladaptive neuroendocrine-immune interaction is a potent source of stress-induced worsening of AD. However, in humans this remains to be proven <xref rid="pone.0113552-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Spradley1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In addition and supporting the development of new pathogenic concepts, the cholinergic system in non-neuronal cells (NNCS) has been identified as a potential player in the skin's response to stress. Stress leads to the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and activation of its associated receptors (AChR) may play an important role in stress-related cytokine imbalance and exacerbation. Accordingly, several authors have shown dysregulation of the cholinergic system in AD and other inflammatory skin diseases, both in the brain and in tissues bordering the environment such as the skin <xref rid="pone.0113552-Grando1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113552-Sinkus1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Endogenous modulators of AChR known as secreted mammal Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-related protein-1 (SLURP-1) and -2 (SLURP-2) now emerge as important ligands of these receptors. Among other targeted nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), SLURP-1 was shown to act as an allosteric agonist with high affinity at the &#x003b1;7nAChR enhancing its ACh binding, while SLURP-2 was shown to strongly compete with ACh at the &#x003b1;3nAChR <xref rid="pone.0113552-Chernyavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These proteins regulate immune responses of lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages <xref rid="pone.0113552-Kawashima1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and suggest themselves as intriguing key players that await analysis in the context of stress.</p><p>We here wanted to know if inflammation induced changes in neuro-immune interaction as well as the NNCS occurs in humans and whether they play a role in the skin's response to stress. To follow up on this hypothesis we here employed acute laboratory stress in AD patients as an instructive model to study neuro-immune plasticity and expression of NNCS markers under conditions of acute perceived stress and chronic inflammation. We subjected AD patients and well selected age and sex matched healthy controls to the standardized and validated highly acute Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and determined neuronal plasticity and mast cell phenotype as well as SLURP and nAChR expression in biopsies at baseline and after stress-exposure. With this approach we found that neuro-immune communication and NNCS mediators do play a role in the complex interdependency between acute stress and chronic inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study-design and ethics votum</title><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany. Participants were recruited using flyers and advertisements. After obtaining written informed consent, participants were enrolled in the study. The participants were informed to take their usual breakfast and avoid coffee, tea and physical exercise on the morning of the stress study. Experiments took place on two consecutive days. During the first day, experiments started at 10.00 h. Upon arrival, participants rested for 30 min then full thickness punch biopsies were taken as described below, followed by another 30 min rest. Participants then received instructions about the TSST and had 15 min for preparation (see description below). After TSST, participants had a final rest of 30 min. During the procedure, 7 times saliva samples and psychometric data were obtained. On the following day (24 h after TSST) a second biopsy per skin area was taken on the contralateral side. This protocol thus required multiple biopsies plus stress exposure. We were therefore highly motivated and instructed by the ethics committee to keep the number of participants required as low as possible and employed rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria (described below) to reduce variance not related to experimental conditions as much as possible.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selection of participants and inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants older than 18 and younger than 50 years of age were included. AD patients had confirmed diagnosis of AD according to international criteria of Hanifin <xref rid="pone.0113552-Hanifin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> with duration not less than 1 year and SCORAD score above 30. Exclusion criteria were as follows: Secondary infection or Herpes simplex in the area of biopsy; manifested bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis; severe mental disorder; severe somatic disorder including obesity; oral intake of drugs and medications with influence on stress and immune response (alcohol, nicotine, drugs, contraceptives, glucocorticoids, &#x000df;-adrenergic, antihistaminic or psychotropic medications, cyclosporine A and others); UV-therapy conducted less than one week before experiment; local application of glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive medications in the area of biopsy less than 48 h before experiment. Of the 58 AD patients who applied, 23 could be invited for clinical examination out of which 11 (eight male, three female) matched the criteria. Due to technical issues not all samples could be analyzed in each assay, respective numbers are indicated in the figure legends. Control subjects were matched to patients in age and gender as well as biopsy location for each assay. In addition, they were matched with respect to education, social class and environmental conditions. The resulting study population consisted of educated healthy Caucasians who were either without skin disease or had extrinsic AD with a personal history longer than 1 year.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Biopsy acquisition</title><p>4 mm diameter punch-biopsies were taken under local anesthesia with 1% Scandicain (Mepivacain, AstraZeneca, Wedel, Germany) in localizations typical for AD (mostly elbow flexural side, occasionally knee flexural side, not from head or neck region) 1 h prior to TSST and 24 h later. Matching locations were chosen to obtain biopsies from non-lesional and control skin. After biopsy was taken, the wound was closed with one stitch, which was removed after 7&#x02013;10 days. Skin samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Acute stress exposure: the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)</title><p>The TSST <xref rid="pone.0113552-Kirschbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> is a standardized and well validated stress paradigm frequently used in psychoneuroimmunology to reliably induce moderate acute psychosocial stress in a laboratory setting. Participants were invited to the laboratory in the morning and after the biopsy and a rest as described above, they were given the instructions to the TSST. They were allowed to prepare a free speech on a novel topic for 15 min in a separate room adjacent to the experimental room. The subjects were then told to enter a brightly lit room without their notes and give the speech (5 min) publicly in front of a microphone, a camera and an expert committee that was to evaluate their performance. The committee consisted of three harsh faced white lab coated interviewers, trained to give no social feedback. After the free speech they were told to do mental arithmetic by giving them a serial subtraction task (5 min). When they paused, subjects were told to continue and to restart when making an error. To control effectiveness of TSST, salivary cortisol levels were measured. Time points for sample acquisition were as follows: 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; after rest before biopsy, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; immediately after biopsy, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 min after rest following biopsy, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; after instruction and preparation for TSST, 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; after TSST, 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10 min after TSST, and 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 min after TSST.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Immunofluorescence-histomorphometry</title><p>Cryostat sections (10 &#x000b5;m), fixed in acetone (at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, 10 min), were incubated overnight at room temperature with the primary antisera to PGP 9.5 (1&#x02236;100, Biotrend, Cologne, Germany), Gap43 (1&#x02236;400, EURO-DIAGNOSTICA, Heidelberg, Germany), Nerve growth factor (NGF) (1&#x02236;75, SantaCruz, Heidelberg, Germany) or tryptase (1&#x02236;200, R&#x00026;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) as described previously <xref rid="pone.0113552-Hendrix1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Negative controls were incubated with the secondary antibody alone or with a mixture of the primary antibody and the control peptide for the specific anti-serum. Labeling of NF (PGP 9.5, Gap43, NGF) and mast cells (tryptase, FITC-avidin) in full thickness scalp skin biopsies served as internal positive controls. Mast cells were also detected by Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) staining to assess degranulation as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Stained sections were examined at 400x magnification under a Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope with a daylight as well as fluorescence device (Zeiss, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany). Each staining pattern was analyzed in the compartments epidermis (epidermal thickness) and upper dermis (NF and mast cells). Histomorphometry was performed by counting NF profiles and mast cells per microscopic field as described before <xref rid="pone.0113552-Hendrix1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Each staining-pattern was evaluated in at least five different microscopic fields per analyzed sample and compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR</title><p>For RT-PCR, skin samples were transferred into lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and minced by using an Ultra-Turrax (IKA-Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany).

Multiple biomarkers and data sets were required to allow assessment of these different aspects of neuro-immune interaction as well as NNCS modulation in stress aggravated inflammatory disease. Our first data set demonstrates altered neuro-anatomy in lesional AD skin compared to control in humans which is suggestive for increased neurogenic inflammation. The second data set suggests decreased presence of the investigated potentially anti-inflammatory NNCS markers in AD skin. The third data set demonstrates that after psychosocial stress (TSST) neuro-anatomy in uninflamed skin is significantly changed in a way that facilitates neurogenic inflammation. And finally, the fourth data set demonstrates that NNCS markers are decreased in healthy skin after TSST but increased in inflamed AD skin suggesting a role in the fine tuning of proliferative and inflammatory responses in the skin's response to stress.</p><p>Discussing neuro-immune interaction at baseline in detail, an increase in NGF expression and in NF density can be observed in chronically inflamed skin and allergy <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Dou1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Joachim1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We here confirm these results in humans under laboratory stress. In our hands however, increased innervation in chronically inflamed AD skin did not seem to be associated with active growth of NF since we observed lower numbers of Gap43+ nerve fibers in AD skin under steady state conditions. Instead, increasing numbers of NGF+ NF in inflamed AD skin correlated with epidermal thickness, which is a sign of chronic inflammation and a major source of peripheral NGF. Since NGF is taken up by NF and retrogradely transported to the cell body, where it promotes their survival <xref rid="pone.0113552-Howe1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we conclude that enhanced innervation is due to enhanced neurotrophin support and maintenance of existing NF rather than NF growth.</p><p>Discussing the role of the NNCS in AD, ACh synthesis and transport was shown to be decreased in allergically inflamed lungs <xref rid="pone.0113552-Lips1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and nicotine has an anti-inflammatory effect in a model of allergic asthma <xref rid="pone.0113552-Mishra1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

SLURP-1 was also shown to downregulate TNF&#x003b1; and upregulate NF-kappa B e.g. in asthmatic lung epithelia <xref rid="pone.0113552-Chernyavsky2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113552-Narumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, inflammatory processes that are characterized by strong innate and cellular immune responses such as eosinophilia and neutrophilia or viral infection are characterized by a lack of SLURP-1 <xref rid="pone.0113552-Matoso1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Swamynathan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These processes can also be observed in AD and SLURP-1 therefore appears to control a wide spectrum of AD-relevant immune responses. Taking these known functions of nAChR and SLURPs into account, the absence of NNCS markers in non-lesional AD skin observed here and specifically the lack of &#x003b1;7nAChR in lesional AD skin may relate to the thickened epidermis characterized by dysfunctional cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0113552-Misery1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and to a shortage of anti-inflammatory effects normally provided by the NNCS.</p><p>With respect to the effect of psychosocial stress on non-inflamed versus inflamed skin our results are suggestive for an enhanced neuro-immune communication as early as 24 h after TSST in healthy and in non-lesional AD skin, which can promote neurogenic inflammation in heretofore uninflamed skin. By contrast we observed reduced innervation in lesional AD skin. To understand this observation, it is interesting to note that under highly acute and combined stress conditions, nerve terminals and mast cells are forced to release stress- and inflammatory mediators so rapidly, that even degeneration of peptidergic nerve endings and mast cell apoptosis were described <xref rid="pone.0113552-Pavlovic2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Hendrix2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The decreased number of NF in lesional AD skin after stress observed here may thus be the result of their deleterious activation and degranulation. However, electron microscopy would be required to confirm this idea.</p><p>The most interesting finding to us however was the observation that highly acute stress leads to decreased SLURP-1 and -2 mRNA levels in healthy skin while SLURP-2 transcript is increased in inflamed AD skin. Highly acute stress was repeatedly reported to promote a cytokine profile also described as the T-helper cell type 1 (TH1) profile consisting of TNF&#x003b1; and other cytokines that promote adaptive cellular immunity under conditions not involving additional stressors or pre-existing pathologies <xref rid="pone.0113552-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Rohleder1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A drop in SLURPs in the skin of healthy individuals under acute psychosocial stress could be involved in this reported shift. On the contrary, in skin already subjected to chronic allergic inflammation, a shift of the immune balance towards increased TH2, dominated by pro-allergic cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5 is reported in response to additional stressors <xref rid="pone.0113552-Dhabhar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113552-Rohleder1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The SLURP-2 rise in lesional AD skin after acute stress exposure may contribute to this profile.</p><p>Finally, to employ few but well matched participants with regard to ethic efforts allowed us to analyze skin biopsies and comprehend the local effects of stress in peripheral tissues while most comparable human studies were restricted to neuroendocrine-immune analysis in blood. Naturally, the results presented here have to be confirmed in larger and more diverse populations. Follow up studies should also recapitulate cellular and molecular mechanisms involved utilizing <italic>ex vivo</italic> models such as skin organ culture. However, this pilot study is instructive and effectively confirms in humans the involvement of neuroendocrine-immune interaction in stress-induced aggravation of allergic inflammation reported in mice. It also demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge the participation of the NNCS and SLURPs in the skin stress response.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, neuro-immune interaction participates in the pathogenesis and stress-sensitivity of AD in humans.
