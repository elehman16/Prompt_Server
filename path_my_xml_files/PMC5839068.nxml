As of the year 2010, 265,000 people have sustained a SCI in the USA with nearly 61% having incomplete spinal lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As a result of SCI, individuals may experience a loss of independence in mobility impacting their community participation and integration and leading to a decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In order to restore the capability for locomotion in a short period of inpatient stay and outpatient therapy, gait rehabilitation usually focuses solely on providing compensatory strategies such as walking with assistive device and braces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, compensatory strategies limit the potential regeneration and reintegration of the neuromuscular system that leads to functional recovery. Thus, the current trend of SCI rehabilitation has emphasized more on task-dependent or activity-dependent neuromusculoskeletal plasticity and recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Neuroplasticity, a condition and ability of modification of neural pathways and synapses in the nervous system, plays a critical role in motor and functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A substantial number of research studies have demonstrated that neural plasticity and cortical reorganization could occur through systematic execution of task-specific training which leads to recovery of walking after sustaining neurological injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One of the most commonly seen examples of task-specific training for gait is body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT). BWSTT produces a large number of stepping repetitions that could induce neuroplastic changes at both the spinal and the cortical levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and lead to gait improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; however, the results are inconclusive. Several studies involving BWSTT have suggested to be beneficial, but the improvements were not significantly different when compared to conventional overground walking gait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A study by Duncan et al. showed no superiority of BWSTT over home-based physical therapy in improving the functional level of walking and reducing the incidence of falls in individuals with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These findings could be explained, partly by the difference in gait kinematics and subject involvement between treadmill and overground walking. Some gait kinematics when walking on a treadmill are not an exact replica to overground gait kinematics as the body does not move forward in space over the lower limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is also difficult to judge the patient&#x02019;s active involvement which is a key factor in administering effective rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To have more effective gait training that follows task-specific training principles, overground gait training with body weight support features from exoskeleton robotic devices should be considered.</p><p id="Par18">Lower limb robotic assistive devices known as exoskeletons have been developed to assist individuals with lower limb paralysis and weakness to walk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and can be used as a gait training device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Exoskeleton robotic devices utilize the user&#x02019;s movements to control externally powered gait. Therefore, the users of the exoskeleton must be both physically and cognitively engaged to advance the limb. The device is equipped with computer-controlled motors at the hip, knee, and even ankle joints to provide assistance in sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit, upright standing, and walking tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The developments have been inspired by the recent advances in technology, with a variety of them being utilized in rehabilitation centers to assist individuals with disability. In recent studies, the safety of walking with wearable exoskeleton devices has been clinically evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and it is safe for individuals with thoracic SCI, when utilized in a controlled environment with assistance by a trained personnel. Compared to BWSTT, exoskeleton-assisted training could provide potential advantages such as the ability to provide overground walking by using a biomechanical reciprocating pattern that allows achievement of hip extension and full loading of the lower limbs that is similar to a natural gait pattern and engages active involvement. Moreover, the reciprocal gait feature that provides the capability of producing repeated patterns of walking could facilitate neural plasticity. However, the effectiveness of exoskeleton-assisted gait training for individuals with SCI remains unclear.</p><p id="Par19">The primary purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of exoskeleton-assisted gait training (EGT) in individuals with chronic incomplete SCI (iSCI). The primary feasibility objectives were assessing patient eligibility, pre-assessment, randomization process, treatment reliability, and post-assessment. The secondary objective of the study was to investigate the potential efficacy of EGT on motor and gait performance compared to conventional physical therapy (CPT) gait training. We hypothesized that subjects who received EGT would show greater improvement in motor and gait performance compared to those who received CPT designed for gait training. Studies that have included complete SCI populations have examined the clinical effectiveness, feasibility, and safety during exoskeleton-assisted walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As the focus of this study was to examine the potential efficacy of training with exoskeleton on gait and potential underlying mechanisms that lead to improvement, therefore, we only considered incomplete SCI individuals who were also ambulatory. Moreover, chronic individuals particularly &#x0003e;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months post-injury reach a stable level of recovery, and any observed improvement from any intervention could be attributed to the intervention itself, unlike acute and sub-acute stage where the observed improvements could also be a result of spontaneous recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Further, acute and sub-acute SCI may still have other medical complications that exclude them from utilizing wearable exoskeletons. The results of this study will allow us to ascertain if the complete procedure, i.e., assessing patient eligibility, baseline assessment, randomization process, treatment reliability, and post-assessments, could be conducted in a well-defined manner prior to a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design, setting, and subjects</title><p id="Par20">We conducted a parallel-group randomized controlled pilot trial (Houston, TX, USA 2014-2016).

As individuals with SCI can walk safely with exoskeleton as an assistive device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and there is a potential to receive various health benefits such as improved bowel and bladder function and reduced spasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], wearable exoskeletons could also be utilized as a gait training device to facilitate motor and gait function recovery and health promotion in this population. By increasing the duration of the training and inducing large number of the repetitions, the use of exoskeleton provides intense repetitive locomotor training to facilitate gait function recovery as compared to conventional physical therapy gait training. As we observed improvement in both EGT and CPT groups, the effectiveness of EGT requires further investigation. Our experience also indicated that the use of wearable exoskeleton may relieve clinicians (i.e., physical therapists) from improper body mechanics and musculoskeletal burden in manual body weight support and guidance during locomotion training. Although the sample was small and the results are not statistically significant to support a strong conclusion, the results have provided insightful and critical information such as assessing patient eligibility, baseline assessment, randomization process, treatment reliability, and post-assessments could be conducted in a well-defined manner prior to a definitive RCT.</p><p id="Par46">The current protocol was feasible as all subjects were able to complete the training and assessments. The training frequency (five sessions/week) was feasible; however, this may not be ideal for persons who are employed full time or need transportation assistance from family members or friends. The subject inclusion and exclusion criteria was feasible and designed appropriately. The exoskeleton technology is new, and only a few clinical trials were or are being conducted; the inclusion and exclusion criteria was designed and determined for subject safety. The only adverse event (ankle soreness) occurred during the EGT, showing that EGT is safe and the training protocol was tolerable. The assessment sessions were 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h long and were performed in one time slot. The patient was able to complete all tasks in one session that shows the reliability of the assessment protocol. The exoskeleton-assisted walking involves a human-machine contact, particularly the thighs and shanks are wrapped with straps attached to the exoskeleton for an upright posture. These areas could potentially develop redness if pressure is applied for a long time. Therefore, it is important to monitor the skin for any potential adverse effects before and after each training session. In addition, the assessment protocol was designed to look at the different parameters such as muscle strength, endurance, gait speed, etc. Static and dynamic balance assessments could be added in future trials to further evaluate the effectiveness of EGT.</p><p id="Par47">An effective gait requires a multi-factor and system control including the neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, sensory, and cognitive systems. We observed improvement in gait characteristics and gait speed and distance in EGT with significant improvement in the stride length, right step length, and 6MWT. The results are similar with the results in the study by Sale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Three subjects with SCI participated in 20 sessions of mobility training using wearable exoskeleton (Ekso), and improvement was found in walking speed, cadence, step length, and walking distance in 6&#x000a0;min after training. The significant improvement in gait speed and distance could be attributed to the improvement in LEMS. The increases in muscle strength could be associated, at least partially, with the effects on neuroplasticity after EGT. Literature has shown that short-term strength and endurance training, especially at higher gait speeds, improves gait parameters and facilitates neuromuscular output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, EGT may have led to strengthening of intact neural pathways in the subjects and the improvements in gait characteristics. Moreover, the improvement could also be attributed to the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal stress induced during exoskeleton-assisted walking. It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory and metabolic demands of exoskeleton-assisted walking are consistent with activities performed at a moderate intensity in individuals with SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the perceived exertion when using a powered exoskeleton for assisted walking could range from mild to somewhat hard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Long-term application of exoskeleton-assisted walking, therefore, could be treated as a cardiopulmonary and endurance training with appropriate assistance setting in the device. In addition, EGT could also provide essential afferent inputs such as proprioceptors responding to hip extension for initiating swing (hip position) and extensor load during stance-to-swing transition (external loading) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It also provides an opportunity for hip extension and external load during overground walking, by predetermined walking speed, and inter-limb and intra-limb coordination and kinematics that could enhance the neural output and modulate neuroplasticity for walking in spinal and/or supra-spinal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">It is important to note that the recovery of gait after SCI depends on the type and level of the injury, post-injury medical care, and rehabilitation intervention. EGT could be treated as a standalone gait training program or as a part of the rehabilitation program depending on the treatment goals, recovery phases, or disability severity of the patients; thus, further investigation is required. The design and control of wearable exoskeleton utilized in this study require the user to use and control assistive device such as walker or canes to maintain standing balance and perform lateral and forward trunk sways for movement (stepping) initiation of the exoskeleton. Therefore, the strategy of exoskeleton-assisted training is different between training with paraplegia and quadriplegia. One of the significant differences is the ability to maintain balance and trigger stepping movement when using wearable exoskeleton; however, this could be compensated by body weight supported harness and assistance from the trainer (i.e., assist the user to perform trunk sway). Depending on the impairment and patient goals, potential therapeutic effects, if any, of exoskeleton-assisted gait training could focus on gait and balance for paraplegia and bowel and bladder function or cardiopulmonary strengthening for quadriplegia.</p><p id="Par49">Some important insights regarding the duration and intensity of the study and the randomization process are provided to facilitate the conduction of future RCTs. Our EGT protocol may not provide sufficient intensity. EGT program was held five times per week for 3&#x000a0;weeks with a total of 15 sessions. Short-term (6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;weeks) strength and endurance training at higher gait speeds improves gait parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In Aach et al.&#x02019;s study, subjects showed improvement in 10MWT, TUG, and 6MWT after 90&#x000a0;days (five times per week) of body weight support of exoskeleton-assisted treadmill training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the study by Hornby et al., 6MWT started to improve after 4&#x000a0;weeks of training and continued to increase up to 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In future studies, longer training duration should be considered when conducting EGT. Moreover, subjects were randomly assigned to either group by drawing lots, not by injury and functioning level. Subjects in the CPT group had better baseline function in 10MWT, 6MWT, and TUG as compared to EGT group but still not close to the normal values in healthy able-bodied. Persons with low functioning may have difficult time at the beginning of the EGT in learning how to maintain balance and coordinate upper and lower limb movement during walking with exoskeleton, and therefore, less time was spent in walking early during training. Statistical comparison of the CPT and EGT groups was not performed due to the modest sample size and the fact that the baseline scores of the two groups were different (CPT higher functioning than EGT). The subjects were allocated to either intervention after randomization, yet the CPT group has a higher functioning level than EGT. This explains that even if the injury level of the individuals is same, their functional level could be different; therefore, the intergroup differences could be impacted because of baseline functional differences. To reduce the likelihood of biased group assignment, different randomization methods could be used when allocating patients to different interventions. We suggest using stratified randomization for balanced and unbiased allocation of individuals. For future definitive RCT, a stratified scheme would be used. Individuals would be assigned to groups based on the functional level, i.e., low functioning, mid-functioning, and high functioning. Then, within each group, randomization scheme can be separately performed reducing the risk of biased group assignment. Finally, one of the practical challenges observed in this study was the small number of patients (30%) who qualified for the study. This was partly (10% screen failures) due to the size range of the exoskeleton (i.e., body height, weight, hip width, and lower limb segment length) which limits the number of subjects who could be fitted in the exoskeleton and qualify for the trial. Future wearable exoskeletons which may have better capability to fit a wider range of body size and a larger scale of trials to investigate effectiveness will be feasible. Conducting a multi-center trial is another potential solution as greater outreach is possible. Apart from the size range of exoskeleton, other factors such as time, location, and intervention assignment also play a major part in subject recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">Exoskeleton-assisted gait training for individuals with iSCI could improve gait, but studies with a larger cohort of individuals with iSCI are required to signify improvement. The results suggest that powered exoskeletons not only provide iSCI patients the ability to walk overground but may also be utilized for therapeutic intervention to improve gait function. The plausible mechanisms leading to the observed improvement need further investigation; therefore, further studies are needed to measure plasticity and physiological changes in response to training. Moreover, further investigation in the form of large randomized trials is also required to investigate the cost-effectiveness and dose-response relationship of exoskeleton-assisted gait training as standalone training or combined with other gait training in SCI.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>10MWT</term><def><p id="Par6">10-Meter Walk Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>6MWT</term><def><p id="Par7">6-Minute Walk Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AIS</term><def><p id="Par8">Association Impairment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASIA</term><def><p id="Par9">American Spinal Injury Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p id="Par10">Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPT</term><def><p id="Par11">Conventional physical therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGT</term><def><p id="Par12">Exoskeleton-assisted gait training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iSCI</term><def><p id="Par13">Incomplete spinal cord injury</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LEMS</term><def><p id="Par14">Lower Extremity Motor Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p id="Par15">Timed Up and Go</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants for their time and efforts.
