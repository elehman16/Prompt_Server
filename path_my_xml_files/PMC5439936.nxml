Intra-articular prolotherapy agents can initiate proliferation and regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Dextrose has been useful in prolotherapy of knee joints and adjacent compartments.

All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee. Information about the study was given comprehensively both orally and in written form to all patients or their accompanying adult. They gave informed consent in writing prior to inclusion in the study. The clinical trial number for this study is IRCT2015102713364N3.</p><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>In a randomized clinical trial, 104 patients with chronic knee OA were enrolled as subjects in the study. The subjects were divided into two groups based on random numbers assigned by a computer to each patient. Intra-articular dextrose prolotherapy was performed in one group and periarticular dextrose prolotherapy in the other group. The physicians who injected the drug solutions and the ones who evaluated patients in follow-up visits were different and were blind to the subject groupings. All demographic variables including age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were measured and recorded in specified data sheets.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were patients with chronic OA over 50 years of age, grade 2 or higher of OA documented by radiology studies, morning stiffness of &#x0003c;30 minutes, and 3 months of no response to conservative therapy. Exclusion criteria were severe underlying disease, coagulopathy, history of rheumatologic disorders, diabetes or history of corticosteroid therapy, prolotherapy or intra-articular injection in the past year, and indication for surgical arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Periarticular injection</title><p>All analgesics were discontinued 48 hours before the procedure and for up to 2 weeks after the procedure. In intra-articular group, 8 mL of 10% dextrose and 2 mL of 2% lidocaine were injected through an infra-patellar approach by a 23G needle. Injection was repeated at 1 and 2 weeks after first injection. In the periarticular group, 5 mL of 1% lidocaine and 5 mL of 20% dextrose were mixed in a syringe and 2.5 cc of the solution was injected subcutaneously at 4 points around the knee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-1179">Figure 1A</xref>) where the periarticular nerves exit the joint capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-1179">Figure 1A</xref>). Two points were located at upper lateral and medial parts of knee joint, one point at a line medial to knee and one point located at the head of fibula. The injection was performed fan-wise by 2.5 mL of drug solution (5 mL of 1% lidocaine and 5 mL of 20% dextrose) at each point with a 23G needle. Injections were repeated at 1 and 2 weeks after the first injection. All injections were performed by the same physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain and disability measurement</title><p>After the injections, patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 months. At each visit, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain was measured using a range of 0&#x02013;100. The disability index was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score at each visit, range of motion, and patient satisfaction. In the WOMAC score, the scale of dif-ficulty for different movements is classified based on the following scale: 0= none, 1= slight, 2= moderate, 3= very and 4= extremely difficult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical calculations were conducted using SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).

Both peri- and intra-articular prolotherapy patients showed reduced pain and disability of knee OA after 5 months of follow-up. Interestingly, periarticular prolotherapy had better effects on pain scores (VAS) and disability scores (WOMAC) in some respects.</p><p>Periarticular prolotherapy showed superior effects on healing of knee disability and WOMAC score compared with intra-articular injections. Pain score was significantly lower at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-month visits in the periarticular group compared with the intra-articular group. Periarticular injections have been suggested in some recent reports for analgesic effect after TKA.<xref rid="b11-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Periarticular injections can significantly reduce the requirements for patient-controlled analgesia and can improve patient satisfaction following TKA.<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Other than these reports in TKA, in another recent study, periarticular injection showed adjuvant effects to intra-articular prolotherapy. Periarticular injection of lidocaine-corticosteroid improved the clinical efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronic acid alone in patients with knee OA and can be considered a useful adjunctive treatment modality.<xref rid="b13-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> On the other hand, intra-articular injections have not been reported in previous studies. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid have only small effects when compared with intra-articular placebo injection. A systematic review has suggested that the intra-articular effects may have been overestimated.<xref rid="b14-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Return of knee function is also an important part of any treatment modality for knee OA. Periarticular prolotherapy in our study showed healing effects in many aspects of knee function that were more marked than with intra-articular prolotherapy. This healing effect was observed particularly in active movements, including walking on flat surfaces, and ascending and descending stairs. The precise molecular targets responsible for the effect of periarticular prolotherapy remain to be elucidated. Periarticular injections around the knee joint ignite the inflammatory reaction in the vicinity of joint capsule. The infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokines to the periarticular area may enhance blood perfusion in the capsular joint, increase nourishment to the cartilaginous tissue, and enhance regeneration. Hypertonic dextrose has been hypothesized to stimulate healing of chronically injured peri- and intra-articular tissue by increasing inflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="b15-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Other potential mechanisms that have been suggested include stimulating the release of growth factors favoring soft tissue healing and positive neural effects.<xref rid="b16-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Volume expansion of local tissue may also produce tissue-level effects.<xref rid="b18-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Another suggested mechanism for periarticular prolotherapy is neural prolotherapy (NPT), which is based on treatment of neurogenic inflammation and neuronal damage related to the hypothesis of Pybus et al,<xref rid="b19-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> who described fiber C transmission of deep pain signals from knee joint, ligaments, and tendons, as is often seen in OA. Antegrade nerve transmission cause pain perception in the brain, while the reverse nerve impulses travel to the blood vessels where substance <italic>P</italic> and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are released, causing swelling and pain. Two decades later, Lyftogt<xref rid="b20-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> used the same concept and treated joint pain and swelling in OA by inhibiting neurogenic inflammation with dextrose prolotherapy.<xref rid="b20-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> NPT is given just under the skin close to subcutaneous nerves at weekly intervals.<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>The sites of injection points were selected based on Hilton&#x02019;s law and chronic constitutional injury (CCI) injection points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-1179">Figure 1A</xref>) introduced previously.<xref rid="b22-jpr-10-1179" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> According to acupuncture sites depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-1179">Figures 1B and C</xref> for knee osteoarthritis, the trigger points are selected for injection of dextrose. These trigger points are accepted in acupuncture as the main points of pain control in knee OA. The notion that these acupuncture sites involve the healing effect in capsular cartilage is hypothetical and this is one of the first studies reporting on use of this method.</p><p>Intra-articular injections and puncturing of the joint capsule have been the subject of ongoing debate regarding the management of knee OA because of concerns about side effects and risk of infection. Hemarthrosis and post-injection pain are other possible side effects. The periarticular method avoids capsular injection and its side effects, which gives an additional modality for pain management in knee OA. Limitations of this study included the need to obtain patient consent and also the need for an extended time for follow-up and patients&#x02019; adherence to follow-up visits. Both VAS and WOMAC scores are subjective scales and dependent on individual perceptions and therefore are not an objective measurement, which could be a limitation to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Periarticular prolotherapy significantly improves some aspects of pain and disability of knee OA comparable with intra-artic-ular injections. In addition, periarticular injections avoid risks intrinsic to intra-articular injections. Future studies could deter-mine whether there are synergistic effects of prolotherapy after both intra- and periarticular injections at various time points.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-jpr-10-1179"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hootman</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Obesity and other modifiable factors for physical inactivity measured by accelerometer in adults with knee osteoarthritis</article-title><source>Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)</source><year>2013</year><volume>65</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>53</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22674911</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jpr-10-1179"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Felson</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmick</surname><given-names>CG</given-names></name><etal/><collab>National Arthritis Data Workgroup</collab></person-group><article-title>Estimates of the prevalence of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions in the United States.
