Consequently, extrusion of infected material apically and destruction of the apical binding point for the root filling can affect the outcome of root canal treatment negatively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Traditionally, conventional radiographs are used to determine the WL. However, radiographs are subject to distortion, magnification, interpretation variability, and lack of a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Radiograph is a technique that provides information about the canal anatomy and surrounding tissues, but superimposition and anatomy interferences can be problematic and affect correct interpretation of the images.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The results of a microscopic study showed that the major foramen may be located up to 3.5 mm from the radiographic apex.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In such teeth, if the canal terminates in the plane of the film, the radiographic appearance will be &#x0201c;short,&#x0201d; and any adjustment will result in the WL being overextended. Other shortcoming of radiography is the danger of ionizing radiation.</p><p>Recently, the use of electronic devices became popular and numerous devices have been introduced to the market. The advantages of electronic apex locators (EALs) include reduction in radiation dosage and procedure time, both of which aid in maintaining patient cooperation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The EALs are used to locate the minor constriction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Microscopic studies have shown the apical constriction to be located 0.5-1.0 mm from the major foramen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Root ZX mini (J. Morita Corp., Kyoto, Japan) is a modified version EAL based on the same technology of the Root ZX.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The Root ZX mini has a compact size and conveniently portable design. Besides the Root ZX mini offers 3 programmable memory settings, shock resistance and automatic calibration. However, there is a lack of information in the literature about the <italic>in vivo</italic> accuracy of Root ZX mini in determining the correct WL. VDW Gold is an endodontic motor integrated apex locator device. The continuous monitoring of WL is important during canal preparation as the WL may vary during the procedure, especially in curved canals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The combinations of EAL and low-speed endodontic hand-pieces have been introduced to achieve the accuracy of conventional EALs during canal shaping.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this randomized clinical study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of traditional radiographic method, EAL and apex locating endodontic motor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 120 patients with 283 root canals that referred for endodontic treatment were selected. Informed written consent in full accordance with ethical principles was obtained from each patient before the treatment was initiated. Patients that used heart pacemakers were excluded. The teeth with no apical patency or with the radiographic signs of resorption were excluded. The selected patients were aged 20-65 years old. The patients were informed about routine endodontic procedures. The teeth were randomly allocated to each group. All clinicians involved in this study had at least 5 year of experience with apex locators. In case of the disability of determination of proper WL with the selected method, such teeth were excluded from the study.</p><p>Under local anesthesia (Ultracain D-S, Sanofi Aventis, Turkey) and isolation with rubber dam, caries, and existing restorations were removed. Standard access cavity was carried out using high-speed diamond round bur (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) under water coolant for each tooth and a straight-line access to the root canals was achieved. The entrances of the root canals were irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and excess sodium hypochlorite was removed from the pulp chamber by using cotton pellets, no attempt was made to clean debris or pulp tissue remnants prior to introducing a size 15 k-file (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) into the canals.</p><p>Following the preparation of adequate access cavity, the steps followed for each group were as follows:</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group 1 (Conventional radiographic length determination)</title><p>

</p><p>For the roots obturated shorter than 2 mm or overfilled, the WLs were reestablished and root canal obturations were carried out according to the corrected WL in all groups.

However, neither <italic>in vitro</italic> nor <italic>in vivo</italic> results can be a true representative of clinical situations in which the whole treatment is done in the mouth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] On the other hand, randomized clinical studies may provide high-level of evidence for clinical practice since they reflect a truly clinical condition.</p><p>The apical constriction is the ideal and recommended end-point for instrumentation and canal filling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] It is located about 0.5-1 mm from the major foramen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The foramen does not coincide with the anatomical apex; it might be located laterally and in a distance of up to 3 mm from the anatomical apex.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Root canal filling 0-2 mm short of the radiographic apex was reported as the most favorable outcome for the prognosis of root canal treatment,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] so this reasonable criteria was chosen for our study for evaluating the length adequacy on radiographs.</p><p>In our study, the length adequacy of master cone radiography was considered as the final outcome of root canal treatment. Following the preparation of root canal with a tapered rotary ni-ti file, the use of a matched tapered single gutta percha cone for obturation became popular. Tapered cones provide three-dimensional obturation of the root canal over its whole length without the requirements for accessory cones and the use of tapered single cone technique produces faster root canal obturation than the lateral compaction technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Previous studies reported the tapered single cone technique as an efficient alternative to the lateral compaction technique because of similar sealing ability, shorter application time and ease in the application.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Operator is the most significant factor affecting the prevalence of root filling extrusion when cold lateral compaction was used.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Therefore, in order to minimize operator's procedural errors, the utilization of compatible single cone was preferred.</p><p>Radiography is the only universally accepted, available, and meaningful method of length adequacy assessment in the clinic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] However, there is repeated expose to unwanted radiation before, during and immediately after the endodontic treatment. The adverse effect of radiation was investigated on areas in the path of ionizing radiation including, the oral tissues, periodontal tissues, human embryos, and fetuses in pregnant women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Therefore, reducing the number of radiographs is crucial to prevent the patients from the repeated expose of ionizing radiation. Neena <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] reported that EALs were comparable to conventional radiographs in determining the WL without radiation. Similarly, Ravanshad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] reported that the results of endodontic treatment using EAL are quite comparable to radiographic length measurement and the average number radiographs taken was recorded significantly lower when EALs were used during WL determination. Our results are in accordance with the previous clinical trial, in which the accuracy of EAL on WL determination was reported as quite comparable to radiographic length measurement. The result of present study demonstrated that there was no statistical significant difference between the success of both tested EALs and conventional radiographic method in terms of WL determination.</p><p>Many studies have addressed the advantages and clinical performance of electronic devices for root canal length determination and the use of EALs became widespread in daily practice. Recently, various brands of EALs are available in the markets. Venturi and Breschi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] reported that the accuracy of EAL were superior to radiographs. Past <italic>in vivo</italic> studies reported that measuring the location of the apical constriction using Root ZX apex locator was more accurate than radiographs and would reduce the risk of instrumentation and filling beyond the apical foramen.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The accuracy of different locators working on the same principle was found to be similar.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Since Root ZX mini was built on the industry standard Root ZX technology and works on the same principle, Root ZX mini can measure in both wet or dry canal conditions. Besides, the miniaturized size of Root ZX mini can be accepted as an advantage in clinical practice. Although, this study is not in agreement with previous reports which reported that EAL are more accurate than radiographs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] if not superior, the results of WL determination of Root ZX mini was similar to conventional radiographs. Previous studies reported that 75.0-83% of the determined WLs were accurate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] and such rates were reported to be clinically acceptable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] In this study, the acceptable root canal filling rates ranged from 81.9% to 87.0%. Thus, all methods used to determine WL demonstrated clinically acceptable results.</p><p>A laboratory study showed that the combination of EAL and endodontic motor was accurate in terms of length control during root canal preparation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] To our knowledge, the clinical accuracy of an endodontic motor in combination with a EAL has not yet been described in literature. Therefore, one of the objectives of the present study was to test this combination under clinical conditions with respect to its function and accuracy. The results revealed that the accuracy of multi-functional endodontic motor with integrated apex locator was acceptable and quite comparable to EAL and conventional radiographs. Besides, the continuous monitoring of the WL may help clinicians to prevent the procedural errors like loss of reference point and over instrumentation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>According to the results of this study success of both apex locators were similar to the radiographic WL determination technique. In conclusion, Root ZX mini and VDW Gold are clinically acceptable apex locators for determination of WL.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
