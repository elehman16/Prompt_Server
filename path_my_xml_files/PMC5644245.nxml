In the past two decades, the burden of stroke has increased significantly in terms of the absolute number of people with incident stroke, number of deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost especially in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. According to a nationwide population-based survey in China, there are approximately 2.4 million new strokes and 1.1 million stroke-related deaths annually, with 11.1 million stroke survivors, which consequently results in a huge financial burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Despite recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and emerging evidence for endovascular treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], only a few highly selected patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) receive thrombolytic therapy due to strict selection criteria. From the Chinese National Stroke Registry, 21.5% of patients with acute stroke presented to the emergency department (ED) within 3&#x000a0;hours, 12.6% were eligible for thrombolytic treatment, and only 1.6% received intravenously administered rt-PA therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The lack of effective and widely applicable therapeutic approaches for AIS has resulted in a growing interest in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).</p><p id="Par40">
<italic>Xingnaojing</italic> injection (XNJ) was extracted by modern biotechnology from a well-known Chinese patent medicine named <italic>An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan</italic> which was first documented in <italic>Wen Bing Tiao Bian</italic>, a classical work of TCM published in 1798. XNJ has been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and is widely used for the treatment of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. XNJ consists of four Chinese herbs: <italic>Moschus</italic>, <italic>Radix curcumae</italic>, <italic>borneol</italic>, and <italic>Fructus gardeniae</italic>. Previous studies have demonstrated that XNJ may has multiple neuroprotective mechanisms in terms of inhibiting glutamate-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], anti-autophagy via the p53-DRAM signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], decreasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], improving neurobehavioral disturbances, as well as reducing infarct size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of XNJ for stroke demonstrated that XNJ may reduce brain injury and improve functional recovery after stroke. Due to methodological limitations of the included trials, however, the efficacy of XNJ for ischemic stroke is still not established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Thus, in the present study, we aim to determine whether the addition of XNJ to standard care, intravenously administered within 24&#x000a0;h of symptom onset, improves the 3-month functional outcome in participants with AIS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par42">The <italic>Xingnaojing</italic> for Moderate-to-severe Acute ischemic Stroke (XMAS) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled, open-label trial with blinded endpoints assessment (PROBE design).

Additional analysis will performed using the generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test statistic to compare the distribution of mRS scores between groups.</p><p id="Par90">Secondary analyses include the reduction of NIHSS, the total score and score in four dimensions of PRO, incidence of cardiovascular events, mortality, the proportion of BI scores&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90, END, and sICH. Secondary outcome analyses will be carried out according to standard statistical principles for comparison of parametric or non-parametric distributions as appropriate. Multivariable regression analysis will be used to adjust for chance imbalances in the main prognostic variables between groups, such as age, stroke severity (NIHSS score), time since onset, ischemic stroke subtype, whether atrial fibrillation, and whether diabetes mellitus.</p><p id="Par91">Pre-defined subgroup analyses will be performed of the effect of treatment at 3&#x000a0;months, subdivided by the following baseline features: time since onset, age, gender, clinical stroke syndrome using the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, stroke severity according to the NIHSS, blood pressure at randomization, and TCM syndrome (Zheng, a key concept in TCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Missing data</title><p id="Par92">Missing data may cause seriously compromised inferences to scientific credibility of causal conclusions from clinical trials. Missing data are mainly caused by discontinued treatment due to adverse events, lack of tolerability, lack of efficacy, or simple inconvenience. To limit the extent of missing data, several approaches are taken according to previous experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When the assigned treatment is discontinued, efforts will be made to obtain the participant&#x02019;s consent for the collection of data on treatments and outcomes. Patients with no data available after randomization will have worst-case values assigned for the 3-month data point (e.g., mRS&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, BI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par93">In the XMAS study with a multicenter PROBE design, placebo is not used as the control group. A double-blind, placebo-controlled designed trial might be optimal; however, this design would lead to considerably higher costs as compared with the PROBE design. A potential advantage of the PROBE design is that the effect of XNJ in our trial will resemble the effect in clinical practice. The PROBE design has been widely discussed and demonstrated to yield the same result as a placebo-controlled design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Moreover, the PROBE design has been performed in several previous studies of stroke intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">Our study has several limitations. First, since this study is undertaken in China, it is uncertain whether the effects of XNJ would be similar in other ethnic groups. Moreover, due to the relatively short follow-up period of 3&#x000a0;months, it will remain unknown whether XNJ can reduce vascular events and mortality over longer periods.</p><p id="Par95">In summary, the aim of the XMAS study is to determine whether the addition of XNJ to guideline-based standard care increases the proportion of patients independent at 3&#x000a0;months after AIS. If positive, this study will provide critical evidence for XNJ, a traditional Chinese patent medicine, as a complementary approach that can be initiated after reperfusion therapy or when the AIS is not eligible for thrombolytic treatment.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par96">Recruitment to the study started in June 2016.
