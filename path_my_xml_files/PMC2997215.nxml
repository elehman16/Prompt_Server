Use of anti-emetic prophylaxis has become the standard approach to minimize the nausea and vomiting postoperatively.</p><p>Glucocorticosteroids are well known for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immune- modulatory and anti-emetic effects. Several clinical trials have been conducted to determine the effects of glucocorticoids on surgical outcome.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the present study, was to investigate whether preoperative Dexamethasone can reduce PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic Surgery. We also compared the anti -emetic effects of Dexamethasone with an established anti emetic drug, Ondansetron.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a prospective randomized study on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) between October 2004 to January 2005. We obtained the approval from the hospital ethical committee and got the informed consent from the patients for the following study. Patients with ASA Grade III/IV, Mentally ill health, GERD patients, Pregnancy or having h/o motion sickness, were excluded from the study.</p><p>We divided the patients into 2 groups depending on their hospital inpatients number (INP). Patients with even number INP were categorized in group one and those in odd number INP were group two. Group one patients received IV Dexamethasone (5 mg) and group two received IV Ondansetron (4 mg), 90 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia. This was administered by a house-staff, who himself administered the drugs to blind the anaesthetist and the surgeon.</p><p>The patients received single dose of injections (Amoxicillin+Clavulanic acid) at the time of induction of anaesthesia. All patients received Inj Diclofenac 50mg i/m thrice daily for day 1 and then as and when required. If patients developed nausea or vomiting, they were given injection Ondansetron 4 mg intravenously, irrespective the group.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgery and anaesthesia</title><p>All the patients received similar type of standardized anaesthetic regimen - induction with Propofol, maintenance with Isoflurane, relaxation with Atracuronium and reversal with Neostigmine. Nasogastric tube was placed in every patient to empty the stomach of air and gastric contents, which was taken out as a routine, at the end of the procedure.</p><p>Reverse Trendelenberg with right side up position was made and pneumoperitoneum was created at the supraumbilical port site, with the closed needle technique. During laparoscopy, intrabdominal pressure (IAP) was maintained at 12 mm Hg and at the end of surgery, Co<sub>2</sub> was removed by suction and manual compression of abdomen. LC was preformed using standard 4 ports technique with two 10 mm and two 5 mm ports. Gall bladder was extracted through the epigastric port and the 10 mm port fascial defect was closed with 3/0 vicryl.</p><p>After surgery, patients were observed for any episode of nausea or vomiting, or whether the patient required any anti-emetic drug in the postoperative period. Patients were evaluated for nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hrs. Nausea was rated on the VRS grade (Gr 0-no nausea, Gr I - mild, Gr II - moderate, Gr III - severe nausea) and the number of vomiting episodes was noted. Vomiting was graded as Gr 0-no vomiting, Gr I- less than 4 vomiting, Gr II - more than 4 vomiting. Vomiting was treated with the intravenous Ondansetron.</p><p>Patients were followed up in hospital from the day of surgery, to the day of discharge. Day of operation was defined as D0, first day was defined as D1 and so on. All the patients were discharged on D2.</p><p>The data was analyzed using Pearson's Chi square test with <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 taken as significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We included 200 patients in the study; 100 patients were enrolled for both the groups.

However, a high incidence of PONV (53&#x02013;70%) has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Several agents like Metoclopromide, Prochlorperazine, Droperidol, Ondansetron etc have been used to prevent nausea / vomiting.</p><p>Dexamethasone was reported as an effective anti-emetic in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy in 1981.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting has been significantly decreased by preoperative single dose steroid administration in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Glucocorticoids have been recognized as an important modifier of the postoperative physiology, inflammatory, humoral and immunologic response, by regulation of trauma induced humoral mediators.</p><p>As an immune modulation strategy, Dexamethasone appears to shift the balance of inflammation, in favor of anti-inflammatory mediators. The incidence and severity of PONV have been significantly decreased as shown in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] This prophylaxis also seemed to reduce postoperative pain and early convalescence. BisGaard <italic>et al</italic> concluded that, preoperative Dexamethasone reduced pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and duration of convalescence in patients undergoing LC, as compared to placebo and they recommend the routine use of Dexamethasone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>]</p><p>The exact mechanism by which glucocorticoids decrease the incidence of nausea / vomiting is not fully understood, but probably can be explained by centrally mediated anti-emetic action via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, or inhibition of release of endogenous opoids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>]</p><p>Recently, metanalysis of 17 randomized controlled trials have shown that Dexamethasone combined with 5HT3 receptor antagonist significantly reduces the postoperative nausea or vomiting as compared to placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] The role of the concomitant 5HT3 receptor has to be clarified.</p><p>Many studies have used preoperative Dexamethasone administration just before induction of anaesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] Glucocorticoids act on the intracellular receptor and the effects are mediated through altered prostaglandin synthesis, via gene transcription. Onset of biologic action of glucocorticoids is 1&#x02013;2 hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>]</p><p>Since action of early mediators of metabolic response to surgery occurs immediately after surgical incision, it seems appropriate to administer Dexamethasone 1&#x02013;2 hours preoperatively, to achieve full postoperative benefits of the treatment. In the present study, we administered the IV Dexamethasone, 90 min before skin incision was made. We all know that metabolic response to surgery starts immediately as soon as the skin incision is made.</p><p>The timing of steroid administration seems to be the key (1&#x02013;2 hr preoperatively), if excess inflammatory and related postoperative morbidity is to be attenuated.</p><p>The major concern regarding the use of Dexamethasone is infection, delayed wound healing and other side effects. But various studies in the literature have shown that single-dose Dexamethasone does not increase complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] A recent metanalysis concluded that, perioperative administration of high dose of Methylprednisolone (30&#x02013;35 mg/kg), a dose approximately 50 times that of the dose used in the study, was not associated with significant side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] We did not have any postoperative complication which could be attributed to Dexamethasone prophylaxis.</p><p>In our study, we found that incidence of PONV was 24 and 30% in patients receiving IV Dexamethasone and Ondansetron, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We have an opportunity to enhance further, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.</p><p>Long-term corticosteroids may have significant morbidity. A single dose of Dexamethasone is safe and is comparable to Ondansetron.
