Many pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), C-reactive protein (CRP), and adhesion molecules including intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) are expressed in atherosclerotic lesions. The plants of genus <italic>Vaccinium</italic> are rich in anthocyanins with anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of <italic>Vaccinium arctostaphylos</italic> fruit extract on the serum level of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in adult patients with mild hyperlipidemia to detect its possible inhibitory effects on progression of atherosclerosis. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, eligible hyperlipidemic patients were randomly and equally divided in to two groups of study drug or placebo control to receive either the <italic>Vaccinium</italic> extract or placebo capsules, respectively, twice daily for four consecutive weeks. Each drug capsule contained 0.8 mg of anthocyanins. Serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 were measured before and after the interventions and finally were compared.A total of 8 men and 12 women in drug group as well as 11 men and 9 women in placebo group completed the study (<italic>P</italic> = 0.527). The use of <italic>Vaccinium</italic> extract significantly reduced only the IL-6 level (<italic>P</italic> = 0.037); however, this reduction was not significant compared to placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.062). Consumption of <italic>Vaccinium arctostaphylos</italic> fruit extract with the dose of 500 mg twice daily did not show any significant effect on serum levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in adult hyperlipidemic patients. However, considering slight decrease in the level of IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1, the use of higher doses with longer duration might have significant effects on these factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Hyperlipidemia</kwd><kwd>Inflammatory</kwd><kwd>factors</kwd><kwd><italic>Vaccinium arctostaphylos</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of athero-sclerosis (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The cytokines such as interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x02013;&#x003b1;) released by stimulated T lymphocytes, affect the macrophages/monocytes to elaborate mediators of innate immunity such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 in response, as well as transforming growth factor-&#x003b1; (TGF-&#x003b1;). These cytokines in turn mediate paracrine signaling to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). On the other hand, products of oxidized lipoproteins and critical factors in the atherogenesis, could provoke vascular wall cells to produce cytokines (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, an early stimulus for the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lesion might arise from the production of cytokines by local vascular wall cells that elicit expression of adhesion molecules including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as well as chemoattractants (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>The adhesion molecules, expressed by cytokine&#x02013;stimulated endothelial cells, bind to monocytes and T lymphocytes; subsequently, these inflammatory cells accumulate in the early atherosclerotic plaque (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the arterial intima, monocytes mature into macrophages. In the plaque, these mono-nuclear phagocytes trap modified lipoproteins contributing to formation of foam cells (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and fatty streaks, the anatomical hallmark of early atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Due to contribution of inflammation to the development of atherosclerotic plaques, anti-inflammatory drugs that are aimed at reducing the progression of atherosclerosis and risk of cardiovascular events are now in development.

The study was registered in Iran Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) with the record number of IRCT201507309662N10. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly and equally assigned to either the study drug (<italic>V. arctostaphylos</italic> extract) or placebo groups. The demographic characteristics were recorded for all patients. Prior to any intervention, 5 mL of blood sample was obtained from each subject, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the separated serum was frozen at -70&#x000b0;C. At appropriate time, the serum levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 were determined using specific ELISA Kits (Boster Biological, Fremont, CA, USA). Also, for detection of any possible renal and hepatic adverse effect of the extract, the serum levels of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine were measured using related assay kits (Pars Azmoon, Iran). The patients of drug and placebo groups were instructed to use drug or placebo capsule (500 mg), respectively, twice daily with food for four weeks. All patients were advised to maintain their habitual diet and physical activity and report any adverse effect during the study. The patients&#x02019; compliance was evaluated by counting their capsules at the end of use and their results were applied for data analysis if they used more than 80% of their capsules. At the end of four weeks, all mentioned parameters were again determined and compared with baseline values as well as between groups. For randomization and blindness, each capsule container was given a code according to the type of its content (drug or placebo). When giving a container to each patient, its code was recorded on his / her own consent form. At the end of the intervention and after determination of the patient's own results, the recorded code was identified in terms of the type of intervention. All participants, the physician, and the laboratory personnel were blind to the intervention type.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for statistical analysis of obtained data.

For comparison of pre- and post-intervention values within each group, paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon singned-rank test were performed for normally and non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for comparing parameters between drug and placebo groups with statistical control of baseline values.

At the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study on this plant evaluating such an effect. However, several experimental and clinical studies have evaluated anti-inflammatory effects of other species of the genus <italic>Vaccinium</italic> in various groups of subjects. In a placebo-controlled study conducted by Kolehmainen <italic>et al</italic>., daily consumption of 400 g of fresh bilberries of <italic>V. myrtillus</italic> by patients with metabolic syndrome reduced their serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and IL-12 (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the clinical study of Karlsen <italic>et al</italic>., the effects of bilberry juice at 330 mL/day on plasma levels of inflammatory markers in subjects at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were assessed (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Based on the results, bilberry significantly reduced the plasma levels of CRP, IL-6, and IL-15, while the TNF-&#x003b1; level increased. Therefore, these results are similar to ours regarding the effects on IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels. In another clinical trial performed by Ruel <italic>et al</italic>. on healthy sedentary men, the consumption of increasing daily doses of cranberry juice cocktail (125, 250, and 500 mL/day) over three successive periods of 4 weeks resulted in reduction of serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and OxLDL (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). According to the authors, these effects were attributed to polyphenolic compounds of the cranberry. On the other hand, in the study of Basu <italic>et al</italic>., daily use of 50 g freeze-dried blueberries by metabolic syndrome patients for 8 weeks showed no significant effects on serum CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IL-6 (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The various amounts of consumed doses as well as different applied preparations, study population, and intervention durations might have contributed to different results of these studies. Considering slight insignificant reduction of IL-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 by <italic>V. arctostaphylos</italic> extract in our study, it seems that the use of higher doses for longer durations might have more significant effects on these biomarkers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, consumption of <italic>V. arctostaphylos</italic> fruit extract with daily dose of 1000 mg did not show any significant effect on serum levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 in adult hyperlipidemic patients. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a protective supplement against atherosclerosis progression. However, more studies for evaluation of higher doses of the extract for longer durations are recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was financially supported by the Vice-Chancellery for Research and Technology at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
