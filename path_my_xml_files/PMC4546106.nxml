The diagnosis is often based on symptoms and urine dip-stick, which has limited validity, causing the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescription. Additionally, with increasing antibiotic resistance, the risk of choosing an antibiotic to which an infecting pathogen is resistant is rising. Combined point-of-care-tests (POCT) for urine culture and susceptibility testing have been developed and validated for primary care, and performing such a test in all patients with suspected UTI in primary care seems rational in order to reduce the use of inappropriate antibiotics. However, the clinical effect of the culture and susceptibility test has not yet been investigated. This study aims to investigate whether POCT urine culture and susceptibility testing decreases the inappropriate use of antibiotics and leads to faster patient recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Randomized controlled open label trial of two diagnostic approaches. 750 patients with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, consecutively contacting their general practitioner (GP), randomized to either POCT urine culture and susceptibility testing and targeted treatment or POCT urine culture without susceptibility testing and empirical treatment. Treatment is started when the POCT is read. The two groups are compared with regard to appropriate choice of antibiotics, clinical remission, and microbiological cure rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study may provide important evidence to recommend POCT culture and susceptibility testing in all patients with suspected uncomplicated UTI. This could become an additional strategy to fight antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02323087?term=NCT02323087&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02323087</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Antibiotic resistance is rapidly spreading, making it one of the most serious threats to human health. The World Health Organization has stated that a post-antibiotic era is a very real possibility and that urgent actions are needed in order to maintain the effect of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Primary health care in Denmark is responsible for about 90&#x000a0;% of all redeemed prescriptions of antibiotics, and it is known that a high out-patient consumption of antibiotics leads to high levels of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, a cornerstone in the efforts to reduce antibiotic resistance is to reduce and improve prescription of antibiotics in primary health care.</p><p>In 2008, 1.8&#x000a0;% of all patients consulting their GP in Denmark were diagnosed with a UTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Resistant strains of <italic>E. Coli</italic>, which is the causative organism in 70&#x02013;80&#x000a0;% of all UTIs, are spreading world-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In Denmark, 33&#x02013;40&#x000a0;% of <italic>E. Coli</italic> isolated from urine samples from primary care are resistant to sulfamethizole and 6&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% to pivmecillinam, which account for about 80&#x000a0;% of all antibiotic treatments of adults with UTI in primary care in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is, therefore, critical that a UTI is treated only when clinically indicated and using an appropriate antibiotic, i.e., one to which the infecting pathogen is susceptible, taking into account the use of first-line agents over second-line agents.</p><p>Urine culture is necessary to accurately determine if a patient has a UTI since other tests have limited predictive values in primary care and treating based on symptoms can cause up to 50&#x000a0;% being inappropriately treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Susceptibility testing adds the advantage to predict whether a first-line antibiotic can be expected to eliminate the infecting pathogen. However, delaying treatment for several days while waiting for the results of the susceptibility test cannot be justified as symptoms are painful and affect quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Point of care test (POCT) culture and susceptibility testing provides the result within 24&#x000a0;h, and can, therefore, be used to target individual therapy without compromising patient welfare. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can be partly avoided by performing a POCT culture since this will assumedly eliminate treatment of patients without bacteriuria. However taking into account the above-mentioned resistance rates in <italic>E. Coli</italic> and for example enterococci being inherently resistant to both antibiotics, this could result in about 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for UTI. Adding susceptibility testing to the POCT should raise the appropriate antibiotic prescriptions above 90&#x000a0;%.</p><p>This study aims to answer the questions: 1) Does POCT urine culture and susceptibility testing decrease the use of inappropriate antibiotics, and 2) Does targeted therapy improve clinical outcomes in patients with suspected uncomplicated UTI in general practice when compared to POCT urine culture without susceptibility testing? We hypothesize that the use of POCT susceptibility testing improves the following outcomes: Appropriate choice of antibiotic, clinical remission, and microbiological cure rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Randomized controlled open label trial of two diagnostic approaches in a primary care setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recruitment process</title><p>General practitioners (GPs) 200 general practices in the Copenhagen area will be contacted by letter with the aim of recruiting 50 GPs.

If a sufficient sample is obtained, sub-group analysis will be performed for patients with diabetes, elderly patients and patients with recurrent UTI since these groups are expected to benefit the most from the intervention. In an additional analysis of the primary outcome, the group inappropriately treated will be divided into under-treated and over-treated and analyzed in multinomial logistic regression models. Comparison of cure-rates will be done with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. A P-value of 0.05 will be considered significant. Analyses will be performed with SAS v9.4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In Denmark, POCT combined culture and susceptibility testing has been in use for decades, and the use has increased since introduction of the FLEXICULT&#x02122; SSI-Urinary Kit. Despite this popularity no clinical trials have yet validated its impact in clinical practice. This study will investigate the effect of POCT susceptibility testing on appropriate choice of antibiotics and on clinical and microbiological cure in patients with uncomplicated UTI in primary care in Denmark.</p><p>The clinical effect and cost-effectiveness of POCT culture and susceptibility testing in UTI is currently being investigated by another research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although both studies aim at investigating the effect of the Flexicult on the appropriateness of antibiotic use and the impact on patient outcomes, there are at least three important differences. Firstly, in the study by Bates et al., the effect of combined culture and susceptibility testing is compared to various forms of standard care in a four-country multicenter setting. The focus of the present study is narrower, specifically aiming at determining the value of the susceptibility component compared to culture alone in a single region in Denmark. Secondly, all GPs in this study are experienced users of POCT susceptibility testing, and their skills are validated before enrollment of patients as described under the recruitment process, thus inter-practice variation is minimized. Thirdly, in this study, both groups will have treatment delayed until a positive culture is obtained, thereby minimizing the number of culture-negative patients receiving inappropriate antibiotic treatment.</p><p>We have chosen to include patients with diabetes, recurrent UTI and elderly patients when they are otherwise healthy and can be safely included. In the analysis, they are investigated for effect modification and, if the sample allows it, they are analyzed separately, since they could be expected to benefit more from the intervention than other groups.</p><p>A challenge of this study is the similarity between the intervention and control groups. The potential difference between the groups in this study will mainly be driven by those patients in the control group receiving an antibiotic to which, the infecting pathogen is resistant. Since <italic>in vitro</italic> resistance rates in Denmark against the most commonly used antibiotics for UTI are 15&#x02013;40&#x000a0;%, the effect could turn out minor at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If the study detects no additional benefit of susceptibility testing over culture alone, this will provide important information for the Danish national health care system. However, the results may not be directly applicable to countries outside Scandinavia. On the other hand, if susceptibility testing proves superior to culture alone, the impact of such a finding will likely be much higher in countries where resistance rates are higher. In conclusion, the present study will test the hypothesis that POCT susceptibility testing for uncomplicated UTI and individually targeted therapy will decrease the use of inappropriate antibiotics and positively influence clinical cure rates. If this proves true, the results of the study may provide important evidence to recommend POCT susceptibility testing for patients with suspected UTI. This could become one of many strategies to fight antibiotic resistance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AH is the primary investigator, responsible for the design and conduction of the trial.
