This results in blurred or distorted vision (metamorphopsia). A blurred or gray spot in the central visual field is common when the retina is detached. Reduced visual acuity may persist after the fluid has disappeared.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The disease is considered idiopathic, but mostly affects white males in the age group 20&#x02013;50, but occasionally other groups. The condition is believed to be exacerbated by stress or corticosteroid use. SC has long been considered a condition that will resolve spontaneously and thus the mainstay of management is usually observation alone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There is, however, some evidence to support the benefit of early treatment of acute CSC. A potential benefit of early resolution of sub retinal fluid might be mediated by a lower rate of RPE degeneration in the treated eye, which might be warranted due to the uncertain relationship between the onset of detachment and the onset of symptoms and special occupational demands for binocular vision function. This has led clinicians to search for a more effective treatment alternative, one less likely than PDT or focal laser photocoagulation to cause side effects. Although focal laser photocoagulation and PDT have proven effective for the treatment of CSC, these treatments can cause permanent damage to the RPE or choriocapillaris, retinal thermal injury, and subretinal choroidal neovascularization, often many years following the primary incident.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] VEGF has dramatic effects on vascular permeability. The direct role of VEGF in CSC, however, remains unknown. Indocyanine green in patients with CSC has provided evidence of choroidal lobular ischemia, choroidal venous congestion, and multiple areas of choroidal vascular hyperpermeability.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Choroidal ischemia in CSC may induce an increase in the concentration of VEGF.</p><p>In Lim <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that aqueous VEGF levels are increased in a portion of patients with chronic CSC, but not in acute CSC. Several reports, however, indicate that intravitreal bevacizumab injection improves vision and reduces the incidence of neurosensory detachment in patients with acute CSC.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Ranibizumab is a humanized anti-VEGF antibody that inhibits all forms of biologically active VEGF.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Our results showed that no significant difference exists between the intervention and control groups in the BSCVA. However, in the study of Aydin showed that intravitreal bevacizumab injection for acute Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) can lead to remarkable improvements of visual acuity within 3 months follow-up compared with controls. These results demonstrated that intravitreal bevacizumab injection may be a promising option for selected patients in the treatment of acute CSCR. Moreover, also in a study, Mehany <italic>et al</italic>. showed intravitreal Avastin injection with improved vision and decreased sensory nerve detachment and had no side effects in patients with CSC. The results were promising, but the authors recommend that, randomized controlled studies would be more useful to understand the treatment for patients with CSC. Moreover, in another study, intravitreal bevacizumab showed no positive effect in acute CSC patients compared to the observation group.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, this is not a randomized, controlled clinical study and the follow-up duration was limited to approximately 3 months. Second, our study has a relatively small sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>At last, compared with observation, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy showed no positive effect in terms of visual outcome during the 3 months&#x02019; follow-up period, although it had no side effects. In a recent study, a significant reduction in CMT was only 1 month after injection. However, there was not significant significant difference between the two groups in other times. Therefore, it is possible to increase the number of samples and there was a significant difference in this regard.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Munch</surname><given-names>IC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasler</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Pr&#x000fc;nte</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Larsen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Central serous chorioretinopathy</article-title><source>Acta Ophthalmol</source><year>2008</year><volume>86</volume><fpage>126</fpage><lpage>45</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17662099</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torres-Soriano</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a-Aguirre</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kon-Jara</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Ustariz-Gonz&#x000e1;les</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Abraham-Mar&#x000ed;n</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ober</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Apilot study of intravitreal bevacizumab for the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy (case reports)</article-title><source>Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol</source><year>2008</year><volume>246</volume><fpage>1235</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18523796</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boscia</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>When to treat and not to treat patients with central serous retinopathy</article-title><source>Retin Today</source><year>2010</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>32</fpage><lpage>34</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Transpupillary thermotherapy in the treatment of central serous chorioretinopathy</article-title><source>Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging</source><year>2005</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>412</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16238041</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Taban</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boyer</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Taban</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy: Photodynamic therapy</article-title><source>Am J Ophthalmol</source><year>2004</year><volume>137</volume><fpage>1073</fpage><lpage>80</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15183792</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Christina</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retina</article-title><source>Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</source><year>2006</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>China</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier, Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>1135</fpage><lpage>61</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maia</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A new treatment for chronic central serous retinopathy.
