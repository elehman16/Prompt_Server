Long-term retention of residual &#x003b2;-cell function is associated with a reduction of severe hypoglycemic episodes and complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Thus an intervention that achieves persistent improvement of endogenous insulin production would be expected to improve management and reduce long-term complications.</p><p>The immunopathogenesis of &#x003b2;-cell destruction is typically associated with T-lymphocyte autoimmunity. Thus several clinical trials to prevent or treat T1DM have targeted T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) or their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). B-lymphocyte&#x02013;directed therapies have been shown to prevent and even reverse T1DM in the nonobese diabetic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In human beings, B-lymphocytes can be selectively depleted using the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). We previously reported that such selective depletion of B-lymphocytes resulted in significant preservation of insulin secretion for 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We now report the safety and efficacy of this treatment with further follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design and Procedures</title><p>This phase 2 clinical trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00279305). The complete study design and results of the 1-year end points have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Briefly, at 12 sites in the U.S. and Canada, a total of 87 patients were enrolled in a double-masked parallel group design and were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with 57 subjects receiving rituximab and 30 subjects receiving placebo. The major time focus for the current report was 24 months, although longer-term data for some subjects is included. While subjects were given the overall results of the study after year 1, participants and staff remained masked to individual study assignment and data until all subjects had completed at least 2 years of follow-up and data lock had occurred. Data reported here were obtained prior to unmasking of the clinical site and study participant as to treatment assignment.</p><p>Each subject received one course of four intravenous infusions of rituximab (each infusion being 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or placebo on study days 1, 8, 15, and 22. No additional courses or treatments with rituximab or other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs were allowed or given during the follow-up period. Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine were administered as premedication before each infusion to attenuate infusion-related events.</p><p>Predefined secondary outcomes at 24 months included 2-h area under the curve (AUC) serum C-peptide during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT), changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and insulin dose at 6 month intervals, time to first stimulated peak C-peptide of less than 0.2 nmol/L, and safety. Safety outcomes focused on infections and laboratory assessments, particularly white blood cell counts and immunoglobulin levels.</p><p>The study protocol is available at the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet public website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabetestrialnet.org">www.diabetestrialnet.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Details of the statistical plan are included in our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The intention-to-treat principle was prespecified to be applied to all subjects with known end points; there were 78 analyzable subjects at 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>P</italic> values associated with the intention-to-treat comparisons of the primary and secondary end points are one-sided to be consistent with the design of the trial (although the earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) reported two-sided <italic>P</italic> values in accordance with the journal&#x02019;s rules). The prespecified analysis method for C-peptide mean AUC, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and total daily insulin dose was an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline age, sex, baseline value of the dependent variable, and treatment assignment. The significance levels associated with the treatment effect are from the Wald test (from the fitted model) and are one-sided in agreement with the statistical design. A normalizing transformation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="453inf1.jpg"/></inline-formula> was prespecified for C-peptide AUC mean, and normal plots of the residuals indicated that it was adequate. The C-peptide mean AUC equals the AUC divided by the 2-h interval (i.e., AUC/120). The AUC was computed using the trapezoidal rule from the timed measurements of C-peptide during the MMTT. The 95% CIs of the predicted group means were calculated from the linear model. The CI for percentage change was derived by using a bootstrap procedure.</p><p>The time to first stimulated peak C-peptide of less than 0.2 nmol/L was analyzed using standard survival methods (Cox model and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method). Adverse events were analyzed using contingency table methods, and the significance levels are from the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (two-sided). Mean rate of change of C-peptide AUC mean from 6 to 30 months (3-month assessment was not included to maintain a uniform contribution of scheduled assessments over time) was estimated using a mixed effects model with both random intercept and slope adjusting for age, sex, baseline C-peptide AUC mean, and treatment assignment. The initial fit included a fixed interaction effect of treatment and time but was removed because of the lack of any statistical evidence of it being other than zero. To assess the treatment effect over the entire time period, a similar mixed model was fitted to the data, except time was defined without structure and grouped by 6-month intervals (6&#x02013;30 months).</p><p>Missing values became a significant issue at the 30-month follow-up assessment, thus potentially diminishing the randomized treatment group comparison. For this reason, no significance tests at 30 months are reported, but point estimates and the corresponding 95% CIs are provided in the graphs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s5"><title>Results</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the two groups were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0626/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link> depicts the patient flow diagram, showing enrollment/randomization and retention of subjects during the study through 24 months of follow-up.

When a linear relationship was specified across time, both for subject and population means, the associated Wald test for treatment effect was significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).

In autoimmune diseases, B-lymphocytes are thought to play a pathogenic role as antigen-presenting cells and may provide help in the activation of T-lymphocytes that are the mediators of autoimmune destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Therefore, we conducted a trial with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets B-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We have previously reported that a single 4-week course of rituximab within 3 months of the time of diagnosis significantly preserves &#x003b2;-cell function and is associated with a lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lower insulin dose at 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In following these subjects up to 30 months after randomization, the rate of fall in the C-peptide AUC paralleled the fall seen in the control group, suggesting that rituximab did not fundamentally alter the underlying pathophysiology of disease. However, the early rituximab treatment did delay this fall in C-peptide, as compared with the control group, by 8.2 months, resulting in an overall greater preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function when all time points were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although C-peptide AUC, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and insulin dose per kilogram tended to be more favorable in the rituximab group than the placebo group in follow-up, there is waning of the effect of rituximab as demonstrated by the lack of statistical difference in these parameters at the 2-year time point. The parallel fall in AUC may reflect resumption of ongoing immune-mediated destruction of &#x003b2;-cells, although without a true marker of the autoimmune response, this remains conjecture. Whether repeat dosing with anti-CD20 or other agents could achieve a more prolonged response without increasing adverse events is not known. It is interesting to note that in the other recent studies that showed beneficial effect of immune intervention in T1DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), longer-term follow-up also revealed a decline in effect over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)<sub>.</sub> Although qualitatively similar, direct comparison with the results in the current study is difficult.</p><p>When the study was designed, it was assumed that future rituximab dosing might be needed for optimal effect. However, without proof that the treatment was effective and no previous data on the safety of B-lymphocyte depletion in this population, only a single course of therapy was provided. In the initial report, other than the cytokine-associated reaction mostly to the first dose of rituximab, there were no other unusual safety events and particularly no increased rates of infection. This current paper updates that safety analysis. The therapy continued to be safe during longer follow-up. As seen with previous rituximab trials, the B-lymphocyte counts returned to baseline levels after approximately 18 months. The reduction of IgM levels reported at 1 year persisted at 2 years. Reduction of IgM levels has been consistently seen across rituximab studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), but the mechanism and clinical implications are unclear. In contrast, IgG levels remained stable over the entire period. We have reported that antibody responses to neoantigens and to recall immunization, which were decreased during the time of depletion of B-lymphocytes, returned toward normal as B-lymphocyte counts recovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a single course of four infusions of rituximab over 1 month shortly after the diagnosis of T1DM appears to delay the fall in C-peptide by 8.2 months with minimal safety concerns. This trial now paves the way for other approaches targeting B-lymphocytes in the treatment of T1DM, such as extended or repeat dosing with rituximab, use of alternative anti-CD20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) or other anti-B-lymphocyte antibodies [e.g., anti-CD19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)] or therapies that block the BAFF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We continue to caution against the use of rituximab for treatment of new-onset T1DM outside carefully monitored and controlled clinical trials.</p></sec>
