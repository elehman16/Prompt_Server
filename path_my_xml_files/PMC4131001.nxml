Follow-up studies were performed in 2005 and 2009.

There are also studies indicating that this relation is present already among children and adolescents (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, there is a lack of intervention studies evaluating feasible interventions to implement among free-living individuals. There is also a lack of long-term studies, especially with observations more than 5 years post intervention (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Childhood and adolescence are seen as important stages in life for promoting FV consumption. The European Union (EU) initiated a school fruit program from the school year 2009/2010, and the European Commission is allocating approximately &#x020ac;90 million per year for the provision of FV in European schools. EU's main argument for initiating this program is reduced overweight and obesity prevalence (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The US Department of Agriculture's Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program (FFVP) also aim to combat obesity by providing fresh FV during the school day in selected schools (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, there are no studies to date demonstrating that school fruit schemes do prevent overweight.</p><p>The rationale for the risk-reducing effect of FV on overweight may in part be exerted through their possible reduction upon total energy intake due to low energy content and high satiation (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), that is, by its high content of fiber and water, leading to dilution of the energy density and delaying gastric emptying. In addition, it has been shown that an increased FV intake might substitute consumption of more obesogenic foods (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Studies assessing the weight impact of FV intervention studies are dearly lacking (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), for example, only one out of 18 studies reviewed on school-based food and nutrition policies evaluated the impact of the intervention on weight status (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Within the Fruits and Vegetables Make the Marks project (FVMM), all pupils at nine schools received free school fruit, that is, with no parental payment, for a period of almost one full school year (9 months). The effect on FV consumption has been reported to be 0.8 portions/school day (an increase of 267% from baseline) by the end of the intervention period (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, lasting effects have been reported 1 year (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), 3 years (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and possibly also 7 years (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) after the end of the intervention. The potential effect of this intervention regarding weight status has previously not been reported.</p><p>The aim of the present study is to assess if this increased consumption of FV over a 7-year period, due to the free school fruit program, might have an impact on participants&#x02019; reported weight status 7 years later.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Design and study sample</title><p>A total of 38 randomly drawn elementary schools from two different counties participated in the FVMM project, and nine schools within one of the counties were randomly selected as intervention schools and participated in the Norwegian School Fruit Program for free during the school year 2001/2002 (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the present study, the remaining 29 schools serve as control schools. The free subscription program started in October 2001, and lasted throughout the school year (i.e. until June 2002). Questionnaire surveys were conducted in September 2001 (baseline), May 2002, May 2003, May 2005, and September 2009.</p><p>Sample size and number of clusters were determined according to an expected increase in FV consumption of 45% in the intervention group. With this, the study aimed to include 40 schools with 2 classes per school, in total 1,600 pupils at baseline and 1,300 in the follow-up-study. The allocation, randomization, and enrollment of clusters were done by the project group. Small schools with fewer than 10 pupils per grade level were excluded from the sampling frame (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The FVMM cohort includes 1,950 pupils (6th and 7th graders at baseline): 984 boys and 966 girls, 585 in the free fruit group and 1,365 in the control group. Average age was 11.8 years at baseline. A total of 320 pupils (16%) participated at the follow-up survey in September 2009, and constitute the study sample for the present study, of which 282 also participated in the 2005 survey. Descriptive data of the study sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. At baseline, 296 of the study sample had a parent/guardian who completed a parent questionnaire. The average parental age was 40.5 years, and 86% of the parents were mothers/female guardians.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics from 2001 to 2002 of all particpants, those lost to follow-up, and those remaining in the trial<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF0001">a</xref>

The 2009 survey was sent by regular mail to the participant's homes. Self-reported height and weight were included in the 2005 and 2009 surveys. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on these measures of height and weight. Age and sex-specific cut off points (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) were used to categorize adolescents in the 2005 survey, while a BMI of 25 or above was used in 2009 as the criteria for being categorized as overweight (including obese). Self-reported perceived weight status were assessed by the following question at all surveys; &#x02018;Are you on a (slimming) diet&#x02019;, with the following response alternatives: &#x02018;NO, my weight is OK&#x02019;, &#x02018;NO, but I should be on a (slimming) diet&#x02019;, and &#x02018;YES&#x02019;. The two last alternatives were seen to indicate that the responders perceive themselves as too heavy/overweight. A new variable was calculated by combining these two to: (1=I am too heavy, 0=my weight is OK). The pupils reported their own sex and parents recorded their level of education at baseline (lower: no college or university education/higher: having attended college or university).

Furthermore, it indicates that it takes time from intervention implementation to effects are seen on weight status &#x02013; recognizing the importance of long-term follow-up intervention studies for obesity prevention. No significant effect was observed 3 years after the end of the intervention, but 1 year of free school fruit at age 10&#x02013;12 resulted in a 40% lower prevalence of overweight, compared to controls, 7 years later. This effect might have been due to the long-term effect seen for reported FV intake, and/or the reduced consumption of unhealthy snacks (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Few intervention studies do follow the participants for several years as done in the present study (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and few studies have reported effects in FV intake after the end of the intervention period (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To our knowledge, there are no comparable studies reporting the effects of 7 years of sustained elevated FV intake on weight status. This extended follow-up period of an intervention proven to be effective in changing eating habits, represents the main strength of the present study.</p><p>There are limitations with the present study. No baseline measure of weight and height were included, and the subsequent measures were self-reported. Baseline data on perecived weight status were included, however, and there were no baseline difference between the proportions of intervention and control group particpants perceiving themselves to be too heavy. There are no reasons to believe that there is a differentiated underreporting of weight between the intervention and the control groups, as weight was no issue in the intervention. The participation rate in the 2009 survey was low, only 16%. Loss to follow-up can lead to bias in randomized trials, especially if the characteristics of people lost to follow-up differ between the randomized groups (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the present study, the group lost to follow-up differed between the randomized groups in the same way the groups differed in the full cohort. Furthermore, there were no differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention group and the control group in the presented study sample. According to Dumville et al., the attrition is only important if the differeing characteristics is correlated with the trial's outcome measures (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the present study, the directions of the loss do not support that this would effect the results. Among those lost to follow-up, a higher proportion of parents with high education were lost in the intervention than in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>, column c), and among those lost, the intake of unhealthy snacks was lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>, column c), both findings indicating that the prevalence of overweight probably would have decreased in the free fruit (intervention) group had those lost to follow-up been included. In addition, this is no perfect randomized study, and limitations regarding the study design and generalizability have been reported earlier (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Previous results show that free school fruit seem to increase intake of fruit with all its health benefits, reduce intake of unhealthy snacks, especially in lower SES families (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and in addition prevent future excessive weight gain. The sum of this suggests that free school fruit should be considered an important public health initiative.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study indicates that free school fruit might contribute to prevention of future excessive weight gain in Norwegian children.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0007"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KIK conceived the 2001 study.
