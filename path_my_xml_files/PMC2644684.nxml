There is evidence that exercise therapy is effective for reducing pain and improving function in patients with knee OA, some evidence that exercise therapy is effective for hip OA, and early indications that manual therapy may be efficacious for hip and knee OA. There is little evidence as to which approach is more effective, if benefits endure, or if providing these therapies is cost-effective for the management of this disorder. The MOA Trial (Management of OsteoArthritis) aims to test the effectiveness of two physiotherapy interventions for improving disability and pain in adults with hip or knee OA in New Zealand. Specifically, our primary objectives are to investigate whether:</p><p>1. Exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy improves disability at 12 months;</p><p>2. Manual physiotherapy versus no manual therapy improves disability at 12 months;</p><p>3. Providing physiotherapy programmes in addition to usual care is more cost-effective than usual care alone in the management of osteoarthritis at 24 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial randomised controlled trial. We plan to recruit 224 participants with hip or knee OA. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive either: (a) a supervised multi-modal exercise therapy programme; (b) an individualised manual therapy programme; (c) both exercise therapy and manual therapy; or, (d) no trial physiotherapy. All participants will continue to receive usual medical care. The outcome assessors, orthopaedic surgeons, general medical practitioners, and statistician will be blind to group allocation until the statistical analysis is completed. The trial is funded by Health Research Council of New Zealand Project Grants (Project numbers 07/199, 07/200).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The MOA Trial will be the first to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of providing physiotherapy programmes of this kind, for the management of pain and disability in adults with hip or knee OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ref: ACTRN12608000130369.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Non-pharmacological, non-surgical interventions, such as the treatments offered by physiotherapists, are recommended as the first line of treatment for hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], however there is still insufficient evidence about many such interventions to make specific recommendations regarding management of this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Given the prevalence of OA, its economic and human burden, and accumulating evidence supporting the effectiveness of various physiotherapy interventions for patients with OA of the hip or knee, further research is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Two common forms of physiotherapy intervention are exercise therapy and manual therapy.</p><p>Although it is well established that various forms of exercise are effective in reducing pain and increasing physical function in people with knee OA, there is still little knowledge about which forms of exercise are most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Little is known about whether effectiveness endures beyond the medium term, with few studies following up to 12 months, and none beyond 15 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Few trials have investigated the relative benefits of differing exercise approaches: systematic reviews of exercise therapy for the osteoarthritic knee have included randomised controlled trials, which are clinically diverse, with variability in the interventions employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, one meta-analysis of trials on strengthening exercises concludes that, to get the maximum benefit of strengthening exercises, it is necessary to also include range-of-motion and stretching exercises in a multi-modal approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There are no trials that we know of investigating a supervised, individualised, multi-modal programme of exercise therapy for OA of the knee, although clinicians consider this to characterise the 'ideal standard of clinical practice' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Regarding OA of the hip, there have been very few randomised controlled trials of exercise therapy, however what data there are indicate the benefits may be similar to those found for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Although there are no systematic reviews available specific to exercise therapies for hip OA, reviews that have summarised either hip and/or knee OA identified no trials of strengthening exercises or of land-based supervised exercise for people with OA of hip and had not undergone hip joint replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two more recent trials in the literature indicate that a programme of multimodal exercise training and lifestyle advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and a multi-modal strengthening, stretching, gait training and range of motion exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] may be effective for reducing pain and improving function in patients with hip OA, however effect sizes were small in both trials. Again, little is known about whether effectiveness endures beyond the medium term.</p><p>New developments in manual physiotherapy have demonstrated very promising improvements in pain and physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but effectiveness has not yet been definitively established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is one clinical trial in the literature of manual physiotherapy for hip OA: compared with exercise physiotherapy, manual physiotherapy resulted in superior improvements in pain and physical function, that endured to six months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Deyle and colleagues have conducted two trials of manual physiotherapy for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the first, a multi-modal intervention of individually tailored manual therapy plus stretching, strengthening, range of motion and home exercises resulted in clinically significant superior outcomes compared with a placebo control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the second, the multi-modal intervention of individually tailored manual therapy plus stretching, strengthening, range of motion and home exercises resulted in clinically significant superior outcomes compared with home exercises alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In both studies, benefits were still evident at the 12-month follow-up.</p><p>Our project is an extension of these recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and is designed to answer questions that have not been addressed in the literature to date. None of the three previous controlled trials of manual physiotherapy has directly compared manual therapy interventions with usual care. We have identified no trials directly comparing an individually tailored, supervised multi-modal exercise therapy programme with usual care, or to individually tailored manual therapy. No trials have investigated if there is a synergistic, antagonistic or neutral effect when both exercise and manual therapy are employed. Few of the previous trials have assessed the effectiveness of their interventions beyond a short to medium term. The MOA Trial responds to the dearth of economic analysis studies in this field, and will report cost-utility over a 24-month timeframe.</p><p>The MOA Trial will investigate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both a multi-modal, individualised, supervised exercise therapy programme, and an individualised manual therapy programme, for the management of pain and disability in adults with hip or knee OA. This publication outlines the design and analysis plan for the MOA Trial.</p><sec><title>Specific aims</title><p>The specific aims of this trial are to establish if:</p><p>1. Exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy improves disability at 12 months in adults with hip or knee OA.</p><p>2.

Provision of physiotherapy programmes in addition to usual care to adults with hip or knee OA is more cost-effective than usual care alone at 24 months.</p><p>In addition, we will test for differences in the secondary outcomes at 9 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, and for an interaction between the interventions for disability at 12 months. The secondary outcomes include physical performance tests, patients' global assessment, and joint replacement surgery (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcome measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Primary Outcome measure*</th><th align="left">Data collection instrument</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">WOMAC composite score</td><td align="left">WOMAC-3.1 patient-rated questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><bold>Secondary Outcome measures</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Timed up-and-go</td><td align="left">Physical test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">30 second sit-to-stand</td><td align="left">Physical test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">40 m self-paced walk</td><td align="left">Physical test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">WOMAC subscales: A) Pain; B) Stiffness C) Physical Function;</td><td align="left">WOMAC-3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] patient-rated questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Numeric pain rating</td><td align="left">NPRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] patient-rated questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Self-efficacy and pain beliefs</td><td align="left">The Pain Belief Screening Instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Depression</td><td align="left">The two-item case-finding instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patient's global assessment</td><td align="left">GROC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] patient-rated scale</td></tr><tr><td align="left">OARSI response criteria</td><td align="left">Composite of WOMAC, NPRS, GROC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of OA</td><td align="left">Clinician-rated criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] from physical tests and symptoms</td></tr><tr><td align="left">New Zealand National Clinical Priority System score</td><td align="left">Clinician-rated criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>];</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Adverse events</td><td align="left">MOA field team audit; ODHB records; self-report questionnaire</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Overall health status<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="left">SF-12 general health survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Surgical intervention<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="left">Self-report questionnaire; health system records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Healthcare consumption and related costs<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="left">Self-report questionnaire; health system records</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*The primary end-point for data analysis is 12 months.

We have chosen a factorial design because it is an efficient way to evaluate more than one intervention in a single trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This is because all participants are included in each of the primary analyses, whereas in a trial of, say, three parallel arms evaluating two different interventions compared with a control arm, only two thirds of participants are used for each comparison. However, the sample size benefits gains of this design only occur when the assumption of no interaction between the two interventions is met. We do not anticipate any interaction effects since these are uncommon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], even in drug trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The statisticians conducting the statistical analyses will be blind to group allocation until the analyses are completed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Protocols for the physiotherapy interventions will be described in a Manual of Standard Operating Procedures (MSOP), available from the principal investigator (JHA). Guidelines for individual tailoring of activity prescription and progression will be described within these protocols. Secondarily, additional interventions will be individually tailored as needed, according to the results of a standardised physical examination that will include tests and measures to assess impairments in physical function (e.g. muscle strength, muscle length, joint range of motion). Impairments revealed will be matched explicitly to interventions, described in the MSOP, intended to directly address each impaired physical function. In this manner, the plan of care for each patient is individually tailored from a standardised menu of interventions, using a defined algorithm, in the categories of 'exercise therapy' and 'manual therapy' (described below). Individualised home exercise instructions, plus compliance logs, will also be provided. The methodology will therefore be consistent with the 'ideal standard of clinical practice' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the research designs of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Participants randomised to receive trial physiotherapy will receive nine treatment sessions: seven in the initial nine weeks of the trial and two 'booster' sessions at week 16.

We will also request that the GP contact the researchers before adding physiotherapy to the patient's plan of care during the trial. The researchers will discourage contamination of the 'usual care only' group by referral to physiotherapy within the 9-week intervention phase, however it would be unethical and unreasonable to recommend physiotherapy be withheld from the 'usual care only' group throughout the follow-up period of the trial. We will measure potential contamination with non-trial physiotherapy by participant self-report questionnaire.</p><p>All participants will continue to receive their usual care at the Dunedin Hospital Orthopaedic Clinic, by consultant orthopaedic surgeons blind to group allocation.

We will also assess change in physical performance tests: the timed up-and-go, 30-second sit-to-stand, and 40 metre self-paced walk tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and psychological function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We will assess overall health status using the SF-12 (Quality Metric, Inc., Lincoln, Rhode Island, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and will measure health care consumption costs, including surgical interventions, by records audit and patient self-report questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We will track and classify adverse events. We will continue to assess the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of OA of the hip or knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; the New Zealand National Clinical Priority System score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] (where available); and exercise compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>A summary of the follow-up schedule is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Assessments will be performed by researchers at baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and, if future funding permits, subsequent years.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary endpoint in this trial is disability at 12 months, measured using the numeric rating scale version of the WOMAC scale. We calculated the sample size to detect a difference of 28 points for each of the main effects, namely, exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy, and manual therapy versus no manual therapy. We regard this as the minimum clinically important difference between groups in patients with moderate OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Assuming a standard deviation of 50 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and a type I error rate of 5%; a sample of 45 participants per intervention group (90 per row (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)) will be sufficient to detect the differences with approximately 95% power. With a sample of this size, the predicted width of the 95% confidence interval for each intervention effect will be approximately &#x000b1; 14.6 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Allowing for 20% attrition, we plan to recruit 56 participants per group, providing a total of 224 participants.</p><p>Using the assumptions above, a sample of this size will have limited power of approximately 46% to detect an interaction between exercise therapy and manual physiotherapy. However, these calculations may be conservative since we have not incorporated the stratification variable, or correlation between baseline and follow-up measures, due to lack of prior information.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Analyses subsets</title><p>The primary analysis of the data will be undertaken using the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Our ITT analysis will include all participants, including those who are not fully compliant and those with missing outcome data. While we plan to implement procedures to minimise loss to follow-up and patient withdrawal, we expect to observe some attrition. We plan to employ multiple imputation to handle missing data in the analysis. Multiple imputation, compared to other case deletion strategies, can provide valid inferences with less restrictive assumptions surrounding the mechanism for missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>As part of the secondary analyses, we plan to undertake two per-protocol analyses for the primary outcome (WOMAC composite score) at 12 months. The first analysis will include participants who did <italic>not </italic>have hip or knee replacement surgery. The second analysis will include participants who complied with the intervention protocol; where compliance will be defined as attendance of 80% of scheduled intervention visits, 60% of prescribed home exercise sessions in the intervention groups, and low contamination (less than 4 physiotherapy visits) in the comparison group.</p></sec><sec><title>Descriptive analyses at baseline</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be presented by intervention group at baseline to investigate the comparability between groups. This will include summary statistics of demographic, stratification, baseline measures of outcomes, and other potential confounding variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics for the WOMAC scale will be presented for each intervention group at 12 months follow-up. We will evaluate the effectiveness of exercise therapy and manual therapy on disability (WOMAC composite score) at 12 months using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), a form of general linear model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We will include the baseline measure as a covariate in the model, and include adjustment for the stratification variable (condition), and pre-specified potential confounding factors: age, body mass index, baseline pain intensity, duration since first diagnosis, quadriceps muscle strength, mental health, and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. These will be included regardless of whether baseline imbalance exists. This approach has been chosen because confounder selection strategies that are based on collected data can result in models with poor statistical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This will adjust appropriately for any baseline imbalance and will provide the most powerful analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Adjusted estimates of intervention effect from this model will be reported as the primary analysis in the trial publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary analyses</title><p>Secondary analyses will be undertaken using general linear models to investigate the effectiveness of the interventions for the primary and secondary outcome variables at 9 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. We will include the same pre-specified confounding factors as in the primary analysis, the stratification variable, and for continuous outcomes collected at both baseline and follow-up, we will include the baseline measure of the outcome. In addition, estimates of the effectiveness of exercise therapy and manual therapy from models that only include the stratification variable and baseline measure of the outcome will also be presented.</p><p>We will report the event rates for joint replacement surgery and the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and the number needed to treat (NNT) statistics. Logistic regression methods and Cox's proportional hazards model will be used to compare the risk of joint replacement for each of the interventions at 12 month and 24 month follow-up. These models will include adjustment for the stratification variable.</p><p>The effect of the interventions over time will be compared using linear mixed models. These models appropriately adjust for correlation that occurs from collecting multiple observations per participant.</p><p>Finally, we will investigate (i) if there is an interaction between the two interventions for the primary outcome at 12 months, and (ii) if the effects of the two interventions differ by the condition (hip or knee osteoarthritis). For these analyses we will include appropriate interaction terms in the models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The trial is not powered to detect these interactions and is likely to have poor precision for the interaction terms. We plan to report regression coefficients for the interaction terms and their 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>No statistical adjustment will be made for multiple testing. All tests will be two-sided and carried out at the 5% level of significance. Changes to the study design or analysis plan will be documented with full justification.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will assess the incremental costs and the economic consequences of delivering the manual therapy and exercise programmes compared with usual care alone according to established methods for the analysis of patient-level data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. We will estimate all health care consumption and costs from a societal perspective using patient self-report questionnaires, and verify hospital admissions from hospital records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. We will report incremental cost-utility ratios using quality-adjusted life-years derived from SF-12 scores using appropriate preference weightings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Trial organisation</title><sec><title>Trial co-ordination and trial progress</title><p>The MOA Trial Team membership is listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.
