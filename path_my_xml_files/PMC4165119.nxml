Mental health issues are one the most important thing in students which influence in their education advancements,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Self-esteem is a mental issue for the students and one the most important factor in progress and education advancements.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The studies have shown that the students who have higher self-esteem are succeeding in their study and educations. They communicate better with others, have more participation in academic and non-academic communities and utilize more social and emotional adjustment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The people who have low self-esteem damage themselves by inferiority complex and their constant and negative self-criticism are one of the usual ways for them. These people may encounter with emotions like sadness, anxiety, feeling shame and guilt, humility, disappointment and anger and may experience chronic courage less and disappointed in their life. Finally, low self-esteem may result in depression and suicide.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] One of the theoretical patterns which justify the reasons for relinquish from study is a failure pattern of self-esteem and It is assumed that the failure in a university can decrease the student's self-esteem and vice versa.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] There are several ways to increase the people's self-esteem, including Psychotherapy, referring to the counseling center and bibliotherapy.</p><p>Self-esteem is a preliminary human need. The successful life requires high self-esteem. Individual Decision-making power depend upon his/her self-esteem level; so it is very important and vital in humans life. People regardless of age, gender, cultural background and their profession, they need self-esteem because it affects all levels of life.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Self-esteem is a state which the person assumes himself as a competent person and face with life challenges such a successful way and he feels that life has worth to live more happily. According to Cooper Smith, self-esteem is self-evaluation and/or self-judgment about his/her values. There is an interaction between the person's self-esteem and ability to understand his abilities, in such a way that decreasing self-esteem causes weakness and inability, while increasing self-esteem can revive the feeling of power and valuable in the person.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Self-esteem is a source for struggling with stress effects and motivate for suicide.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The studies have shown that the girls have low self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] One of the most important reasons in girl's low self-esteem results from the society and family attitude toward female (against males). In a traditional family, the girls never have equal opportunity for studying, profession and learning experience in compared with the boys and there have been more control upon them. In the past, the parents sent their sons to the masters for learning science at their childhood or if they had profession or experience, they learned know-how of it. At that time, the girls were limited to the house work and after entering those girls to the society, they couldn&#x02019;t encounter with issues maturely and competently like boys. Although these customs fades as the time goes by, it has not eradicated. Entering the university is an important milestone in the each person's life. Today, however, girls more than boys enter the Iranian universities,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] but still there are parents who are disagree with educate their daughters in other cities. Owing to the fact that the most girl students are resided in dormitories, they suddenly encounter with a new environment and have not their family support anymore. Staying away from family, independent living experience and related issues cause them to endure stress and heavy pressures and these factors may decrease their self-esteem. As mentioned before, there are many treatment methods to increase self-esteem which bibliotherapy is one of those ways.</p><p>Bibliotherapy is a method which is used for treatment by information specialists and with cooperation of psychologists and physicians. In this method, selected readings are used for clients and proposed to them in order to help them during treatment. These resources are offered to individuals and help them to resolve issues related to their health needs to gain new insights. By this, Bibliotherapy will effect on people's attitudes and change their behaviors. This method depends on librarians, because they are more able than others to recommend the most readable topics based of their experiences and profession. Meanwhile, Bibliotherapy should not only be regarded as an independent approach, but also a help and supplement method.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Biblotherapy's total aim is the individual and group guidance which includes personality development, emotional maturity and changing philosophy of life, and based on his awareness of internal dynamic process.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Bibliotherapy, as a therapy supplement is applied in medicine and clinical psychology to help people with emotional and mental problems and personal problems through targeted study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There have been conducted many studies about the effect of Bibliotherapy on illnesses and the result have showed that Bibliotherapy has positive influence on illnesses like depression, anxiety and the children aggressive. Below some of these studies are mentioned. According to Balouch Zera&#x02019;atkar, Biblitherapy has effect on female students living in a dormitory. In other words, using this method reduces sadness, the feeling of failure, dissatisfaction, guilt feeling, self-dissatisfaction, self-blame, energy level and pessimism. This study has also showed that not only Bibliotherapy can improve the reading habits, but also with promotion of the society mental health, facilitates the achieving of mental health goal.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] According to Jokar, Baghban and Ahmadi showed that cognitive consultation and Bibliotherapy individually has effect on depression symptoms reduction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Also, Mazaheri, Baghban and Fatehizadeh made a conclusion that behavior methods and cognitive behavioral with group approach increase the student's self-esteem which living in dormitory and cognitive-behavioral training had more effective influence than behavioral training.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Saheb-alzamani and his colleagues showed that there are meaningful statistical differences between self-esteem mean scores and the firmness of female high school student's researchable units before and after training. Paired T Test shows that the Self-esteem and the firmness rate increased in both before and after training.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Karacan and Yerin Guneri conducted the research &#x0201c;The effect of self-esteem enrichment bibliocounseling program on the self-esteem of sixth grade students&#x0201d;. The findings showed that there has been important increase in the case group self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] According to Muto, Hayes and Jefcoat, the students who receive acceptance and commitment therapy (ACP) and the self-help book in Japanese translation, utilize more mental health than others. These patterns repeated right after waiting list group received the mentioned books. The findings totally showed that ACP Bibliotherapy has improved the international Japanese student's flexibility and mental health.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The studies conducted in Iran which were about the measurement of Bibliotherapy on illnesses, were based upon cases like depression, anxiety and children's aggression and there have not been conducted any study about the influence of Bibliotherapy on self-esteem yet and it is clear that the mentioned study is necessary to do. Hence, the aim of this study is to survey the effect of Group Bibliotherapy on the self-esteem of female students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences living in dormitory in 2012. It is clear that the results can effect on the female students self-esteem and improve their mental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study is an interventional semi-experimental study with pre test and post test and control group. Study population includes the female students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences who were keen to participate in the study. The requisite condition for quitting the study was obtaining 4 out of 8 by a lie detector. According to the formula n = (Z<sub>1</sub> + Z<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> (2S<sup>2</sup>) / d<sup>2</sup>, at least 32 female students living in dormitory of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2011-2012 were determined in both Case group and Control group. Firstly, a call was made for participating in the study and attending Bibliotherapy course in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences dormitories, then 200 enrolled students were selected by simple random sampling. The students were arranged based on the obtained test scores from low to high Sort by Cooper Smith and 64 people who obtained the lowest scores were placed in Case and Control groups. To unify the two groups, the arranged people were sorted into odd and even numbers.</p><p>Data was collected by Cooper Smith Self-esteem Inventory.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This inventory includes 58 questions which 8 of them are about Control questions. In total, the 50 provisions have divided into 4 subscales of General self-esteem, Social self-esteem (peers), Family self-esteem (parents) and Education self-esteem (job). The grading system was based on one-zero method. The minimum obtained scores may be zero and the maximum is 50. Seifi Gandomany quoted Zolfaghari that the inventory's validity equals 84% and the reliability of the inventory in which is based on the female students, are reported 85% through Cronbach's alpha method.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>To performing the study, firstly the inventory was completed by Case and Control groups. Next, a justification meeting was held for both groups and a book donated to them. Control group book was (Stop: Be serious about passing time wrote by Raheleh Samoei: the book is about Time Management) and Case group book was (Seven Day self-esteem wrote by Jenny Alexander: the book is about self-esteem). Then, 8 sessions of 2 hours about Bibliotherapy were held within 2 months for Case group according the programas. The way of boosting self-esteem was trained thorough group reading, question and answer and brainstorming to the Case group in the 8 sessions. After 2 training months and 1 month latency (totally 3 months from starting Bibliotherapy session) to study the Bibliotherapy effecting process, the inventory was completed and measured again by both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, the 32 female students who living in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences dormitories Kermani 1, Kermani 2, Milad and Seyyedol shohada, were placed in Case group and the other 32 students in Control group. 4 peoples from Case group refused to continue the study. 50% of Case group and 37.5% of Control group in Bachelor's degree, 50% of Case group and 46.9% of control group in Master's degree and 15.6% of Control group in Professional Doctorate were studying.
